00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:07,410
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, I'm going to introduce you to Estima five Canvas.

2
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:16,100
All right, so now we have already talked about the team of five, Kanavis, before, maybe like a couple

3
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,690
of times, and especially when we created that drawing gap.

4
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:21,030
Right.

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:27,850
But the purpose of this chapter is to reintroduce you to Estima five canvas.

6
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:36,590
What are the methods, how you can draw basic rectangles or squares, how you can draw arcs, how you

7
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:40,820
can draw lines, and ultimately how you can draw circles.

8
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:41,660
Right.

9
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,740
And that is basically the entire premise of this chapter.

10
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:54,920
And there are going to be like there aren't going to be a lot of lectures because we need to do something

11
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,640
practical.

12
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:55,990
Right.

13
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,640
I don't want to dive into theory too much.

14
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:06,260
That's why we after we are done with this chapter, we are immediately going to start working with our

15
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:16,040
projects, which are related to game development with each team of canvas in JavaScript right now before

16
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:24,410
actually recreating actual games, we are going to have a set of basics basic to intermediate projects

17
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:25,960
that are going to be several of them.

18
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:32,540
I'm not sure how many because I'm still in the process of creating those projects, but as many as they

19
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:39,440
are, they will be preliminary skills for you to master how game development works.

20
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:47,510
And they are categorized in projects as well because they are projects and but they are lower level

21
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:50,540
projects than like actual games that we have.

22
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,570
They will allow you to acquire the necessary skills to create awesome games.

23
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:57,280
Right.

24
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:01,580
So starting with this lecture, what we are going to do in this lecture is I'm just going to go over

25
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,240
how we can initiate a canvas.

26
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:05,930
Right.

27
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:10,520
And how we can select it in JavaScript, how we can give it a height.

28
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:16,100
And with and how basically we can draw a rectangle, rectangle or square.

29
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:16,790
Doesn't matter.

30
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:22,350
Both of them are like the formula or the method for both of them is the same.

31
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,710
That's why I'm just saying, like, it doesn't matter.

32
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:25,250
Right.

33
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:31,160
So here we have a basic boilerplate, for example, and our JavaScript file is empty.

34
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,220
We will be working mainly with two files.

35
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,320
One is e-mail, the other one is G.S..

36
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,100
Right.

37
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:44,330
And in here, first stuff, I'm just going to provide a comment here that is going to say JS file.

38
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:45,230
Right.

39
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:49,070
And I'm going to script with the source of one G.S..

40
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,120
Right.

41
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:58,280
And above the title, I'm going to create a style element and this style element is internal access.

42
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:03,750
So whatever I write inside here is going to be these tiles for this entire Web page.

43
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:08,480
Now, the elements that we are we will be having here is simple.

44
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:16,730
We we are just going to have an HTML, just have a canvas element that said so in the EMR body, we

45
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:21,820
just have our canvas element and then we have linked our JavaScript inside the style.

46
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,530
So let's save it.

47
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,620
Let's open it up.

48
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:32,550
And here we go, so you can see that there is nothing here, right and right, what is this should be

49
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,210
Fabrica.

50
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,490
Not to Reynolds.

51
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:42,000
Yeah, it is Phalcon, so if you reloaded, you're not going to see it, that you're going to see it

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,260
at first, but then it's going to go away.

53
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:48,750
So this is going to be our canvas right now.

54
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,940
This is not the canvas.

55
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:50,910
This is the viewport.

56
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,920
Where is our canvas now before diving into actually drawing our canvas?

57
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:56,610
Right.

58
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,480
What I'm going to do is I'm going to go over some basic styling.

59
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:06,120
So by default, the Web pages they have and the elements to have some padding, some margin.

60
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,540
And I just want the box sizing to be box.

61
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,720
Now I want to grab the body and I want to say that the mean height of the body should be 100.

62
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,690
And it means that it is going to be 100 viewport height.

63
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:24,330
It's going to grab all the height available to it.

64
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,260
And we are going to say display flex.

65
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:34,980
The reason that I'm using using this flex is I want to work and I want our canvas to be self center,

66
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,740
vertical and horizontal.

67
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:42,950
So for a vertical alignment, we just sell line items for horizontal alignment.

68
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,600
We say justify content and let's set it to center.

69
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,770
Now let's grab our canvas by the elements.

70
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,400
I'm not going to give it to either class or an ID.

71
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,150
We are just going to use the arm and solitaries because we usually have only one canvas.

72
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,850
So I'm going to give it a background color.

73
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:14,550
It's going to be 40 for one, two, six, six, and I'm going to give it a border as well, so it's

74
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:23,970
going to be two pixels solid and najiba off 193 oh and 252.

75
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:30,450
That's why I used to provide all the styling for all the projects, because, like riding all these

76
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:33,090
styles, it's very time consuming.

77
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:38,380
And it it takes away from the major point that we are we want to do here.

78
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:44,040
So basically, this is our canvas and you can see that these dimensions, they have been applied by

79
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,540
default.

80
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,060
So if I come here.

81
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,390
So this is our canvas element.

82
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:49,320
Right.

83
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,280
And this canvas element sprung this over here.

84
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,380
These are the styles that we have applied.

85
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,190
But what are the default styles?

86
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,740
If I come to W, we should see something.

87
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,270
Right.

88
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,720
So whereas with.

89
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:13,720
OK, zoom with so you can see that the with by default is three or four and if I inspect it here, it

90
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,800
doesn't show it to me.

91
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,040
All right.

92
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:21,760
So you can see that the width is three or four and the height is 154.

93
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:22,020
Right.

94
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,950
So if I go to H.

95
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:33,550
Height 154, for now, all the styling that you can see here, which are not highlighted, the ones

96
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:37,740
that are highlighted, they are applied by the browser, but there are some of those stars.

97
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:43,240
So if I bring this up, these are all the browsers, as some of them have been applied by us, like

98
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,560
this border top, like this background, background style.

99
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,290
But these are these have been applied by us.

100
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,940
These all of these borders have been applied by us, this box sizing.

101
00:06:54,190 --> 00:07:00,550
But you can see that this display and this height, they are a bit like you could say, they are not

102
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,780
highlighted like this.

103
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:02,890
They're a bit faded out.

104
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,360
So they are the browser styles, if you want to see all of them.

105
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:10,210
These are all the browsers stars except for the ones which are highlighted.

106
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:10,690
Right.

107
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:19,410
So let's bring it down and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to jump into JavaScript and first things

108
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:24,210
first in order to interact with any external element you need to select.

109
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,540
And I'm going to call this variable canvas element.

110
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,920
Now, this canvas element is actually this canvas element that we have it right here.

111
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,030
So I'm going to say document to query selector.

112
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:43,280
I'm going to select it using its element selector name.

113
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:44,670
Right.

114
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,490
We do not need that.

115
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:51,870
Now, whenever you create the canvas, you need to get a context.

116
00:07:52,230 --> 00:08:00,090
The context allows us to use all the methods to draw shapes on the canvas, to animate shapes on the

117
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:00,630
canvas.

118
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,200
Right.

119
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:06,750
So whenever you say and the context, I'm just going to call it canvas context.

120
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:11,640
You might see this as this canvas context.

121
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:19,080
Some people you see or I don't know like the context word itself, but I'm going to use canvas contexts

122
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,980
so it's clear.

123
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:24,810
And then we are going to grab our canvas element and we are going to say get context.

124
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,760
So here it is.

125
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:31,590
And you can see that there is all the information about the get context in here.

126
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:39,720
OK, a context object includes information about colors, line widths, fonts and other graphic parameters

127
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:42,080
that can be drawn on a canvas.

128
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:48,120
So this is the the base method that we are going to get now, a 2D canvas.

129
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,000
So before doing that, so open this.

130
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:59,010
Now you can see that the identifier idea of the type of canvas to create and now let's fast forward.

131
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,120
Right.

132
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:06,930
So it just says that I think is the IEEE doesn't support it.

133
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:07,530
Right.

134
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:08,550
There is nothing here.

135
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:14,580
So I'm just going to use a 2D context because we are not working with 3D.

136
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,780
We are just working with two dimensions height and with we are going to say 2D.

137
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,620
Now, what are we going to do here is I'm going to give the canvas a height.

138
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,870
So I'm just going to say canvas height.

139
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:34,110
Canvas has a property of height and I can set it to 600 and I'm going to grab the canvas element and

140
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:39,180
I'm going to say that with and I'm going to set it to 800.

141
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:46,800
And when I save it and if I come here now, you can see that the canvas has a height of 600 and a width

142
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,860
of 800.

143
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:53,970
Now, how can you draw on the canvas now in order to draw anything on the canvas, you need to call

144
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:58,800
the canvas context because the canvas context is the variable.

145
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,000
There are all these properties and methods are available for.

146
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,460
So if you want to draw a rectangle.

147
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,740
So if I want to draw a rectangle, we are just going to say fill erect.

148
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:11,740
Right.

149
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,840
So this one, if I want to change the color, the background color of that rectangle, I'm going to

150
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,220
say fill style.

151
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,060
All right.

152
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,370
If you want to draw a circle.

153
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,230
So where is ARC?

154
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:34,380
This that first one that we have now, this arc, it creates half a circle, which is ARC or also it

155
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,380
creates a perfect circle as well.

156
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:36,950
Right.

157
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:44,460
So all these methods that we need to animate or to we need to create games is all of them are available

158
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,820
on the canvas context.

159
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,430
So first things first.

160
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:51,800
I'm just going to grab our first tile and I'm going to set it to white.

161
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:57,150
So the background color of our rectangles, be them rectangles, are squares we are going to get to.

162
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,620
That is going to be white.

163
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:58,950
Right.

164
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,500
And I'm going to say canvas context.

165
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,560
Dot fell RACT.

166
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:08,710
And now here there are going to be four numbers you can see.

167
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,030
So the first one is going to be the horizontal position.

168
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:18,640
This is going to be the vertical position, the skin to be the width, and this is going to be the height.

169
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:25,590
So aside from the horizontal and vertical positions, if the width and the height are the same, then

170
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,120
we end up with the square, right.

171
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:30,930
If the width and the height are different, then we end up with a rectangle.

172
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:40,650
So I want it to be, for example, 100 pixels from the air in the extraction, 200 pixels in the Y direction.

173
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,990
The width should be 50.

174
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,230
The height should also be 50.

175
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:50,190
And if I save it and if I come here now, you can see we have one one square.

176
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,830
This is square because the height and with are the same.

177
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,900
Now it is 100 percent from the left and 200 pixels from the top.

178
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:01,500
In this matter we can create as many as we want.

179
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:09,810
So if you want to create another rectangle and change the color, you first of get the context and NFL

180
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:10,530
style.

181
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,710
And now let's let's try and RGV value and I'm going to say a najiba, actually.

182
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:26,350
So I'm going to say two one four two hundred one sixty seven and point five.

183
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:30,060
Now I'm just going to grab that and I'm going to put it down here.

184
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,460
And now we should have two.

185
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,940
Fill a rectangle.

186
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:40,960
OK, they are on top of each other, so I'm just going to provide it 100 here.

187
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,440
So now we can see.

188
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:43,950
So this is our second square.

189
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,760
In this manner, you can't create as many squares as you want.

190
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:53,150
For example, what I'm going to do is I'm going to start creating squares in different locations.

191
00:12:53,400 --> 00:13:02,550
So the first one is going to be 50 X, 50 Y, then we are going to have 100 X hundred Y, then 150.

192
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:10,860
Hundred and fifty x, I'm going to give it hundred and fifty four Y, then I'm going to I'm going to

193
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,410
change both them accordingly.

194
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:16,050
So 200 I should do control D, right.

195
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,060
200.

196
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,780
So 250.

197
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,560
Oops.

198
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,570
300.

199
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,140
350.

200
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:28,950
400.

201
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:31,820
For 50.

202
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:44,560
500 and finally, I'm just going to do 550 and I'm going to make our canvas 600 by 600.

203
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:47,180
And when I save it, you can see that we get this.

204
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:53,310
So now you can see that the first one is 50 and 50 X and Y.

205
00:13:53,520 --> 00:14:02,160
The second one is 100 X and 100 Y, 150, 150, 200, 200 and so on and so forth.

206
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,890
So this is how you saw in this lecture?

207
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,480
We created a canvas.

208
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,230
We created squares or rectangles.

209
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,820
It doesn't matter if you just change one of the dimensions to be different than the other one, then

210
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,950
you're going to end up with this.

211
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:20,480
So you can see that this one the second one is not a square, it's a rectangle.

212
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,830
So you know how this is created.

213
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,510
And that's it for this lecture.

214
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:30,690
It turned out to be longer than I expected it to be, but we started canvas.

215
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:37,590
I want it to be geared towards beginners that who have never who have never touched canvas before because

216
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:43,110
we are I'm going to take you from here and I'm going to create amazing games with you.

217
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:48,450
OK, I'm going to show you how you can create astounding games, OK, with with these these basic,

218
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:53,290
simple things, because these are the building blocks of game development in JavaScript.

219
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,870
That's it for this lecture.

220
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,360
See you guys in the next one.
