00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:02.330
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
2

2

00:00:02.330  -->  00:00:05.970
Ok, so we have two big concepts under our belts.
3

3

00:00:05.970  -->  00:00:10.900
Frameworks and integrated development environments or IDEs.
4

4

00:00:10.900  -->  00:00:15.210
Now, there is one more concept that is both 
changing the landscape of modern programming
5

5

00:00:15.210  -->  00:00:20.120
and almost always confused for one of 
the other two things we just talked about.
6

6

00:00:20.120  -->  00:00:22.820
This concept is what's called a library.
7

7

00:00:22.820  -->  00:00:28.060
This is by far one of the most confusing 
things for the non-technical to understand.
8

8

00:00:28.060  -->  00:00:33.960
What is a library and how is that different than a framework or an IDE?
9

9

00:00:33.960  -->  00:00:36.000
Well, we're going to attempt to answer that.
10

10

00:00:36.000  -->  00:00:40.000
Libraries, frameworks, and IDEs can often share similar functions
11

11

00:00:40.000  -->  00:00:44.510
and often libraries are installed at the same time as the others,
12

12

00:00:44.510  -->  00:00:48.050
but it's actually not exactly the same thing.
13

13

00:00:48.050  -->  00:00:50.220
Have you ever heard anyone say things like
14

14

00:00:50.220  -->  00:00:55.790
"That must be built in ReactJS" or "Have you tried JQuery"?
15

15

00:00:55.790  -->  00:01:00.360
Chances are you have, and chances are 
they're just shamelessly trying to convince you
16

16

00:01:00.360  -->  00:01:04.400
that it's the greatest thing ever, and you have to learn it now.
17

17

00:01:04.400  -->  00:01:08.800
Those two garbled gook terms I just used are examples of libraries.
18

18

00:01:08.800  -->  00:01:12.440
Not frameworks, not IDEs, those are actually libraries.
19

19

00:01:12.440  -->  00:01:17.350
Ok, to explain libraries we have to take a 
similar path as when we learned about frameworks.
20

20

00:01:17.350  -->  00:01:22.580
Writing applications takes a really long time, and there's a lot of stuff that is redundant,
21

21

00:01:22.580  -->  00:01:29.120
and if you wrote everything from scratch it 
would take way longer than if you had some help.
22

22

00:01:29.120  -->  00:01:30.890
I think you've heard this already.
23

23

00:01:30.890  -->  00:01:31.950
That was the point where people said,
24

24

00:01:31.950  -->  00:01:35.950
"Ok, let's make frameworks that are essentially pre-made architecture
25

25

00:01:35.950  -->  00:01:39.300
for your app plus a whole bunch of goodies kind of sprinkled in."
26

26

00:01:39.300  -->  00:01:42.600
Remember, this is the template to your resume.
27

27

00:01:42.600  -->  00:01:46.700
At the same time, there was a smaller movement to solve this problem,
28

28

00:01:46.700  -->  00:01:51.740
and the solution was instead to just take lots of chunks of pre-made commands,
29

29

00:01:51.740  -->  00:01:54.210
and package them together for easy access.
30

30

00:01:54.210  -->  00:01:57.220
The idea here is that if you're making, let's say, a social network,
31

31

00:01:57.220  -->  00:02:02.620
you might want to program the same kinds 
of functions that other social networks have.
32

32

00:02:02.620  -->  00:02:09.990
Add, say, a "like" button, add the 50th sepia tone filter, etc.
33

33

00:02:09.990  -->  00:02:12.030
Well, instead of doing all of that by scratch,
34

34

00:02:12.030  -->  00:02:16.900
I could go and find a library of assorted pre-made bits to save me time.
35

35

00:02:16.900  -->  00:02:20.600
JQuery is one of the most popular and famous libraries
36

36

00:02:20.600  -->  00:02:24.510
and the use for it is actually pretty simple to understand.
37

37

00:02:24.510  -->  00:02:29.010
Websites, if you haven't noticed this, are adding more and more animation,
38

38

00:02:29.010  -->  00:02:34.080
and varying degrees of motion and interactivity to their front-end.
39

39

00:02:34.080  -->  00:02:37.260
People are getting really creative with what moves on the screen.
40

40

00:02:37.260  -->  00:02:42.530
But writing that stuff, the actual interaction commands, from scratch
41

41

00:02:42.530  -->  00:02:46.470
can take an enormous amount of time, hence the library that can
42

42

00:02:46.470  -->  00:02:50.340
supercharge your ability to make your site do ridiculous things
43

43

00:02:50.340  -->  00:02:54.040
that are most likely just distracting and make me want to browse away.
44

44

00:02:54.040  -->  00:02:59.650
And it's worth bringing up JQuery because it's 
only one of many popular libraries for JavaScript.
45

45

00:02:59.650  -->  00:03:02.680
There are an insane amount of different libraries
46

46

00:03:02.680  -->  00:03:05.960
for doing anything and everything in JavaScript.
47

47

00:03:05.960  -->  00:03:11.560
There are even search engines just dedicated to finding JavaScript libraries.
48

48

00:03:11.560  -->  00:03:18.670
My two favorites JavaScript libraries, if I do 
say so myself, is one that's used to template websites,
49

49

00:03:18.670  -->  00:03:21.740
the first one is called Handlebars, and the second one is called Mustache.
50

50

00:03:21.740  -->  00:03:25.140
To go along with the hipster thing, I think there's one called like Unicycle,
51

51

00:03:25.140  -->  00:03:27.340
or Fixie Bike, or something like that.
52

52

00:03:27.340  -->  00:03:30.040
And of course, back-end languages have libraries as well.
53

53

00:03:30.040  -->  00:03:34.550
Making a script that runs to your server, let's say, to grab a piece of information
54

54

00:03:34.550  -->  00:03:39.550
and bring it back, it's a pain to make that 
yourself, so you can get a library to do it for you.
55

55

00:03:39.550  -->  00:03:42.660
If you wanted a library for, let's say, making something in Ruby,
56

56

00:03:42.660  -->  00:03:46.030
you could download what is called a "gem."
57

57

00:03:46.030  -->  00:03:50.170
And this is a word I've been told repeatedly that I can't actually pronounce.
58

58

00:03:50.170  -->  00:03:52.480
It's gem, or... gem.
59

59

00:03:52.480  -->  00:03:54.300
I don't know, I just... whatever.
60

60

00:03:54.300  -->  00:03:57.060
Jim went to the gym to get his gem.
61

61

00:03:57.060  -->  00:03:58.750
Yeah, I'm from the Midwest.
62

62

00:03:58.750  -->  00:04:00.800
The general theme of libraries is that they're just
63

63

00:04:00.800  -->  00:04:03.410
chunks of code centered around something.
64

64

00:04:03.410  -->  00:04:04.750
Want to scrape websites?
65

65

00:04:04.750  -->  00:04:07.150
Well, there's a library called Scrapy.
66

66

00:04:07.150  -->  00:04:14.020
Sick of making basic forms that are ugly and don't have a lot of fancy functions?
67

67

00:04:14.020  -->  00:04:16.120
Well, there's a library called Formtastic.
68

68

00:04:16.120  -->  00:04:19.790
There are literally too many libraries to actually discuss.
69

69

00:04:19.790  -->  00:04:24.230
The only other thing worth knowing, I think, is that frameworks and IDEs
70

70

00:04:24.230  -->  00:04:30.100
are usually pretty adept at using libraries, 
and they are usually designed to support them.
71

71

00:04:30.100  -->  00:04:33.740
So again, to use the creative writing metaphor 
that we've essentially beaten to death,
72

72

00:04:33.740  -->  00:04:38.210
what if you were, let's say, researching the topic of U.S. Presidents,
73

73

00:04:38.210  -->  00:04:42.080
and you got really tired of putting their quotes in your book,
74

74

00:04:42.080  -->  00:04:46.200
and making sure those quotes were formatted and just right.
75

75

00:04:46.200  -->  00:04:50.290
A programming library equivalent here might be a document
76

76

00:04:50.290  -->  00:04:55.750
that's just full of Presidential quotes organized by time and which president,
77

77

00:04:55.750  -->  00:04:58.600
and if what they said was hilariously inaccurate.
78

78

00:04:58.600  -->  00:05:02.100
Ok, now you are three concepts smarter.
79

79

00:05:02.100  -->  00:05:04.040
Just imagine how good you'll feel when someone asks you
80

80

00:05:04.040  -->  00:05:07.680
what you think of the AngularJS library, and you say,
81

81

00:05:07.680  -->  00:05:12.410
"Excuse me, that's actually a framework. You're thinking of React or Ember."
82

82

00:05:12.410  -->  00:05:15.020
Yeah, I know, that'll never happen, but we can dream.
83

83

00:05:15.020  -->  00:05:16.960
All right guys, in the next lecture, we're going to talk about
84

84

00:05:16.960  -->  00:05:20.180
yet another concept that is essential to know.
85

85

00:05:20.180  -->  00:05:21.320
It's called the API.
