00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,470
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
2

2

00:00:02,470  -->  00:00:07,500
This lecture, we're going to do a brief drive-by of how you can get out there
3

3

00:00:07,500  -->  00:00:10,200
and learn some form of back-end development.
4

4

00:00:10,200  -->  00:00:12,350
The idea here is that if you wanted to learn back-end development,
5

5

00:00:12,350  -->  00:00:17,390
you either are someone who wants to do front-end design or front-end development
6

6

00:00:17,390  -->  00:00:21,860
and be familiar with back-end, or you're trying to become a full stack,
7

7

00:00:21,860  -->  00:00:24,160
or you're just trying to become a software engineer.
8

8

00:00:24,160  -->  00:00:28,300
Now, you're in luck, because there are a lot of options
9

9

00:00:28,300  -->  00:00:30,670
for learning back-end development,
10

10

00:00:30,670  -->  00:00:34,410
it's really the stuff that has the most documentation,
11

11

00:00:34,410  -->  00:00:38,800
it has a very long history, because it developed way before
12

12

00:00:38,800  -->  00:00:42,890
front-end technologies kind of exploded in the last five years.
13

13

00:00:42,890  -->  00:00:46,930
So really you just have options and options for days.
14

14

00:00:46,930  -->  00:00:53,860
Really, my suggestion is to pick which back-end language you specifically want to learn,
15

15

00:00:53,860  -->  00:00:58,400
and then follow a separate process for just that language.
16

16

00:00:58,400  -->  00:01:02,100
There are different programs and different tools for each individual one,
17

17

00:01:02,100  -->  00:01:03,770
and some are better than the other.
18

18

00:01:03,770  -->  00:01:10,540
So how do I decide, let's say, between Python, Ruby, PHP, and let's say, Java?
19

19

00:01:10,540  -->  00:01:14,350
Well, the first thing I would suggest doing is, if there's a specific company
20

20

00:01:14,350  -->  00:01:18,750
you want to work for, or a specific industry that you want to work at,
21

21

00:01:18,750  -->  00:01:20,550
go and look at the companies in the space.
22

22

00:01:20,550  -->  00:01:25,620
Use that tool that we talked about earlier, called Built With, and see what they use.
23

23

00:01:25,620  -->  00:01:29,800
If you want to work at AirBNB, they use Ruby, ok,
24

24

00:01:29,800  -->  00:01:32,460
so you're going to have to know Ruby on Rails.
25

25

00:01:32,460  -->  00:01:36,130
If you want to work at Google, you're going to need to know Python,
26

26

00:01:36,130  -->  00:01:41,420
and if you want to work in enterprise software for like, Oracle, or Microsoft,
27

27

00:01:41,420  -->  00:01:43,780
it's probably more helpful to know something like Java.
28

28

00:01:43,780  -->  00:01:45,700
Past that, the way I look at it is,
29

29

00:01:45,700  -->  00:01:50,220
Ruby is best for web development, so if you know you want to be
30

30

00:01:50,220  -->  00:01:54,820
in web development, and you know you want to work with startups,
31

31

00:01:54,820  -->  00:01:57,680
then I'd suggest maybe going that path.
32

32

00:01:57,680  -->  00:02:02,230
The reason why I say startups is because Ruby is like brand new comparatively,
33

33

00:02:02,230  -->  00:02:05,450
and so the people that have picked it up are usually going to be startups.
34

34

00:02:05,450  -->  00:02:09,240
Big enterprise companies haven't picked up Ruby, it doesn't really make sense for them
35

35

00:02:09,240  -->  00:02:13,500
to rework their entire systems and code base for something that's so new,
36

36

00:02:13,500  -->  00:02:15,210
and they don't really know what the future is going to be.
37

37

00:02:15,210  -->  00:02:17,800
So if you know you're going to be working on the web
38

38

00:02:17,800  -->  00:02:21,840
or building web services for mobile apps, I think Ruby
39

39

00:02:21,840  -->  00:02:25,350
is a decent opportunity, it's also great for getting a job.
40

40

00:02:25,350  -->  00:02:29,600
Now, the way I think about Python is, well, it just kind of depends.
41

41

00:02:29,600  -->  00:02:32,260
If you want to work for Google, obviously yes,
42

42

00:02:32,260  -->  00:02:37,330
but if you want the flexibility of being able to program on the desktop, and the web,
43

43

00:02:37,330  -->  00:02:43,100
and in large data sets, then I think Python is a pretty interesting way to go.
44

44

00:02:43,100  -->  00:02:46,830
If you're not really sure if you want to be data science or a programmer,
45

45

00:02:46,830  -->  00:02:50,090
you're going to have to go Python regardless, because either or,
46

46

00:02:50,090  -->  00:02:51,780
you're going to have to work with one of those.
47

47

00:02:51,780  -->  00:02:53,900
Unfortunately, if you learn like PHP or Ruby
48

48

00:02:53,900  -->  00:02:56,480
then go to data science, you just wasted a lot of time.
49

49

00:02:56,480  -->  00:02:58,680
Now, why would you learn PHP?
50

50

00:02:58,680  -->  00:03:02,920
Well, PHP is probably best, the way I think of it is,
51

51

00:03:02,920  -->  00:03:06,220
if you want to start your own thing, maybe you want to get into freelancing,
52

52

00:03:06,220  -->  00:03:08,900
maybe you want to build something relatively quickly
53

53

00:03:08,900  -->  00:03:10,900
and you have a limited budget, PHP is great.
54

54

00:03:10,900  -->  00:03:15,310
PHP 7 is out now, and those of you who are watching this in the future,
55

55

00:03:15,310  -->  00:03:19,110
I mean PHP 8, and 9, and 10, and 12, but it's really,
56

56

00:03:19,110  -->  00:03:23,710
really improved on a lot of the complaints people have about it.
57

57

00:03:23,710  -->  00:03:29,550
The reason why I say that is because PHP is open source, lots of people know it,
58

58

00:03:29,550  -->  00:03:32,880
it's cheap and easy to learn, there's a lot of people out there
59

59

00:03:32,880  -->  00:03:37,390
that will help you or tutor you for cheap, again, because it's so international,
60

60

00:03:37,390  -->  00:03:39,790
and then, when you have to use frameworks and tools,
61

61

00:03:39,790  -->  00:03:42,490
and things out there, for the most part, they're all free.
62

62

00:03:42,490  -->  00:03:45,180
So that's why I suggest it for personal projects,
63

63

00:03:45,180  -->  00:03:47,600
or people who are kind of like web freelancers.
64

64

00:03:47,600  -->  00:03:50,700
And then the last one was Java, and Java is just largely good
65

65

00:03:50,700  -->  00:03:53,040
if you want to work at a large company,
66

66

00:03:53,040  -->  00:03:57,680
or if you want to work specifically on the Android platform.
67

67

00:03:57,680  -->  00:04:00,180
Ok, so your paths for learning this are pretty wide spread.
68

68

00:04:00,180  -->  00:04:03,400
You have books, you have online courses, you have bootcamps,
69

69

00:04:03,400  -->  00:04:06,520
and you also have traditional college courses.
70

70

00:04:06,520  -->  00:04:11,200
In the next lecture, we'll cover what you should do in terms of a path
71

71

00:04:11,200  -->  00:04:13,820
if you chose one of those languages over the others.
72

72

00:04:13,820  -->  00:04:14,960
All right, see you then!
