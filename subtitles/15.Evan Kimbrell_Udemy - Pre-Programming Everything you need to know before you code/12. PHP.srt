00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,640
All right guys, welcome back to the course.
2

2

00:00:02,640  -->  00:00:07,150
Let's tackle the next language on our list 
and get the run down on what it is,
3

3

00:00:07,150  -->  00:00:10,140
what's different, and what do we need to know about it.
4

4

00:00:10,140  -->  00:00:12,210
This one is called PHP.
5

5

00:00:12,210  -->  00:00:15,280
PHP is one of the oldies but still one of the goodies.
6

6

00:00:15,280  -->  00:00:23,150
PHP stands for, and stay with me on this one, 
it's PHP Hypertext Preprocessor.
7

7

00:00:23,150  -->  00:00:27,830
Yes, the acronym PHP includes its own acronym in its acronym.
8

8

00:00:27,830  -->  00:00:31,160
This is, and I'm not even making this up, an inside joke
9

9

00:00:31,160  -->  00:00:34,160
amongst the original people that developed the language.
10

10

00:00:34,160  -->  00:00:38,210
I can imagine that after the 15th Red Bull and the 14th hour
11

11

00:00:38,210  -->  00:00:41,470
of staring at a screen of code, that was a pretty funny joke.
12

12

00:00:41,470  -->  00:00:46,150
Also, pro tip, if you want to impress 
your developer, use the word "recursive,"
13

13

00:00:46,150  -->  00:00:50,550
which actually describes the way something is self-referential,
14

14

00:00:50,550  -->  00:00:54,620
like a name encapsulating its own name within itself.
15

15

00:00:54,620  -->  00:00:55,660
You're welcome for that one.
16

16

00:00:55,660  -->  00:00:58,860
PHP is one of the most well-known back-end languages for the web
17

17

00:00:58,860  -->  00:01:05,830
and it has had a sizeable community for 
significantly longer than other languages.
18

18

00:01:05,830  -->  00:01:10,280
PHP, for the most part, is considered easy 
to learn, but because of its age,
19

19

00:01:10,280  -->  00:01:15,410
it's inherited a handful of inefficiencies 
that can make it rather tedious.
20

20

00:01:15,410  -->  00:01:17,580
Remember, in the last lecture, when I showed you the example of
21

21

00:01:17,580  -->  00:01:21,520
Python code versus a mysterious other code?
22

22

00:01:21,520  -->  00:01:23,740
Well, it wasn't really mysterious, because I told you what it was.
23

23

00:01:23,740  -->  00:01:28,090
Remember, that was PHP. It's got curly 
brackets, and tons of goofy rules.
24

24

00:01:28,090  -->  00:01:30,120
So, what do we need to know about this language?
25

25

00:01:30,120  -->  00:01:35,060
Well, there are, I'd say, something like three things 
you'd have to know about this language
26

26

00:01:35,060  -->  00:01:39,430
if you had a meeting with your CTO in the 
next 15 minutes on building a new product.
27

27

00:01:39,430  -->  00:01:43,900
Number one is that PHP is for the most part open source.
28

28

00:01:43,900  -->  00:01:47,300
Remember, open source means free and available for anyone.
29

29

00:01:47,300  -->  00:01:50,010
That means that this is not a commercialized language,
30

30

00:01:50,010  -->  00:01:54,980
rather it's supported and developed by a group 
of enthusiasts that prefer to not monetize it.
31

31

00:01:54,980  -->  00:01:58,490
Anyone can use it and anyone can get set up with it very quickly.
32

32

00:01:58,490  -->  00:02:01,990
That means that, generally speaking, using this language is cheaper,
33

33

00:02:01,990  -->  00:02:05,760
because it's rare that you'll find a tool for it that costs money.
34

34

00:02:05,760  -->  00:02:08,520
It's hard to make a tool and charge for it in PHP,
35

35

00:02:08,520  -->  00:02:10,960
because it kind of goes against the open source ethos.
36

36

00:02:10,960  -->  00:02:14,110
As a result of being open, and free, and all that good stuff,
37

37

00:02:14,110  -->  00:02:17,530
it also means that the community using it is enormous.
38

38

00:02:17,530  -->  00:02:20,310
This then leads me to point number two that you should know.
39

39

00:02:20,310  -->  00:02:23,570
Number two, it has the largest community, and is therefore
40

40

00:02:23,570  -->  00:02:26,450
the easiest to find and recruit developers for.
41

41

00:02:26,450  -->  00:02:31,350
More supply, lower price. 
Good for companies, bad for developers.
42

42

00:02:31,350  -->  00:02:33,860
The last thing I'd say that's worth understanding, number three,
43

43

00:02:33,860  -->  00:02:38,590
is that because it's free, and the community that uses it is enormous,
44

44

00:02:38,590  -->  00:02:41,860
there's a strong vibe against the developer community
45

45

00:02:41,860  -->  00:02:45,760
that PHP is some form of an inferior language.
46

46

00:02:45,760  -->  00:02:51,040
It's pretty similar to hipsters who love something 
until too many other people love it,
47

47

00:02:51,040  -->  00:02:53,840
then they disown it and pretend like they never liked it.
48

48

00:02:53,840  -->  00:02:58,160
PHP does have some drawbacks, but for the most part it is flexible,
49

49

00:02:58,160  -->  00:03:00,380
it's well supported, and it's easy to use.
50

50

00:03:00,380  -->  00:03:03,190
The next time someone makes a disparaging comment about PHP,
51

51

00:03:03,190  -->  00:03:06,670
you can just say one thing that will 
shut them up, and that's "Facebook".
52

52

00:03:06,670  -->  00:03:12,060
Yes, Facebook, that massive ground-breaking 
platform is built entirely in PHP.
53

53

00:03:12,060  -->  00:03:17,300
Remember The Social Network, where Mark 
Zuckerberg, played by Jesse Eisenberg,
54

54

00:03:17,300  -->  00:03:22,180
is throwing those coding parties, and trying 
to make their website as fast as possible?
55

55

00:03:22,180  -->  00:03:23,360
* What's going on? *
56

56

00:03:23,360  -->  00:03:25,740
* They have ten minutes to get root access to a Python web server, *
57

57

00:03:25,740  -->  00:03:29,230
* expose its SSL encryption, and then intercept 
all traffic over its secure port. *
58

58

00:03:29,230  -->  00:03:33,080
In that very accurate documentary, that was PHP they were using.
59

59

00:03:33,080  -->  00:03:36,280
Facebook and all of its glory is built on the back of PHP.
60

60

00:03:36,280  -->  00:03:39,750
And if saying Facebook doesn't work 
for you, you can also say "WordPress,"
61

61

00:03:39,750  -->  00:03:43,520
which they may or may not get, but we'll cover that later
62

62

00:03:43,520  -->  00:03:45,560
when we get to the content management systems.
63

63

00:03:45,560  -->  00:03:51,880
I'll tell you a secret though, WordPress is 
responsible for 22% of the entire internet.
64

64

00:03:51,880  -->  00:03:54,900
And guess what? WordPress is 100% PHP.
65

65

00:03:54,900  -->  00:03:56,810
All right guys, see you in the next lecture!
