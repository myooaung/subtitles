00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:02.240
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
2

2

00:00:02.240  -->  00:00:05.610
So in this lecture, we're going to jump into WordPress, like I promised.
3

3

00:00:05.610  -->  00:00:09.130
We're going to look at how it works and what it looks like.
4

4

00:00:09.130  -->  00:00:12.580
The idea here is just to get some basic familiarity with it,
5

5

00:00:12.580  -->  00:00:15.790
should, God forbid, you ever have to install this monstrosity.
6

6

00:00:15.790  -->  00:00:20.430
So this is what it looks like when you search 
for WordPress and you go to WordPress.com.
7

7

00:00:20.430  -->  00:00:27.060
Looks kind of like a business, and the key 
kind of giveaway here is it says "see plans."
8

8

00:00:27.060  -->  00:00:29.470
Now, remember, I said that WordPress is free.
9

9

00:00:29.470  -->  00:00:35.240
Well, that is actually still true, and I'm 
going to explain that here in just a second.
10

10

00:00:35.240  -->  00:00:39.140
So on WordPress.com, you get kind of all the basics about it,
11

11

00:00:39.140  -->  00:00:40.980
it's great for websites, it's great for blogs,
12

12

00:00:40.980  -->  00:00:43.920
it pitches you on some reasons why you should use it,
13

13

00:00:43.920  -->  00:00:46.450
you're probably weirded out by this premium plans part.
14

14

00:00:46.450  -->  00:00:53.950
And this was a correction, it powers 26% of the internet, I think I said 22%.
15

15

00:00:53.950  -->  00:00:54.660
Good Lord.
16

16

00:00:54.660  -->  00:00:57.060
This is what confuses people a lot of times,
17

17

00:00:57.060  -->  00:01:00.370
there's actually WordPress.com, and there's WordPress.org.
18

18

00:01:00.370  -->  00:01:06.140
So WordPress.org, on the other hand, is where you could actually go,
19

19

00:01:06.140  -->  00:01:12.000
and I've seen this happen way too often, and install this just for free.
20

20

00:01:12.000  -->  00:01:17.080
So I see people all the time going to .com and paying for the same exact thing.
21

21

00:01:17.080  -->  00:01:22.950
I think the basic idea is that WordPress.com, they sell the same packages,
22

22

00:01:22.950  -->  00:01:27.360
just with more updates, and more features, and things plugged into it.
23

23

00:01:27.360  -->  00:01:32.730
That's kind of a trick though, is that WordPress.org, 
the normal, free, open source version of it
24

24

00:01:32.730  -->  00:01:36.940
has access to all these plugins anyway, it's just a little more effort to put together,
25

25

00:01:36.940  -->  00:01:40.210
so it's not really worth going to .com and paying the extra.
26

26

00:01:40.210  -->  00:01:45.470
If you're curious, the company that makes a lot of these plugins,
27

27

00:01:45.470  -->  00:01:49.880
and a lot of these themes and extensions for WordPress is called Automattic,
28

28

00:01:49.880  -->  00:01:53.850
and that's what the fonder of WordPress does 
now, he runs this company called Automattic,
29

29

00:01:53.850  -->  00:01:59.260
so if you're on .com, it will push you towards a lot of the ones made by Automattic.
30

30

00:01:59.260  -->  00:02:03.430
Ok, so if you go to WordPress.org, you just download the newest one.
31

31

00:02:03.430  -->  00:02:06.660
The newest one, as we're speaking right now, is 4.6.1,
32

32

00:02:06.660  -->  00:02:11.040
I'm sure in the future when you guys are watching this, it's going to be 7.8.2,
33

33

00:02:11.040  -->  00:02:17.440
but whatever. It hasn't changed a ton in the last five years, really.
34

34

00:02:17.440  -->  00:02:21.040
The biggest change we've seen over the last couple of years with WordPress is that
35

35

00:02:21.040  -->  00:02:25.850
they are now focused more on mobile, kind of like everyone,
36

36

00:02:25.850  -->  00:02:30.890
they've reset up their entire system to compete with
37

37

00:02:30.890  -->  00:02:36.360
a lot of the CMS systems out there that focus on mobile websites first,
38

38

00:02:36.360  -->  00:02:42.580
so now they have a lot of different options, more plugins, and more extensions,
39

39

00:02:42.580  -->  00:02:46.500
and it just naturally is easier to use for mobile sites.
40

40

00:02:46.500  -->  00:02:51.740
They even have a setup now where you can make mobile apps through WordPress,
41

41

00:02:51.740  -->  00:02:57.820
which, I don't know, it's entirely too new to really cover right now.
42

42

00:02:57.820  -->  00:03:01.020
Ok, so typically what you would do is you'd want to download it,
43

43

00:03:01.020  -->  00:03:03.450
and you want to go to your web host,
44

44

00:03:03.450  -->  00:03:05.990
in this example I'm using 1and1,
45

45

00:03:05.990  -->  00:03:13.370
and ideally what you want to do is you just 
then take that and upload it to your server.
46

46

00:03:13.370  -->  00:03:18.030
Remember, we used FTP before, it's relatively easy.
47

47

00:03:18.030  -->  00:03:19.900
When you download WordPress, it comes as a zip file,
48

48

00:03:19.900  -->  00:03:24.580
you just unzip it, and it comes out as this folder, WordPress,
49

49

00:03:24.580  -->  00:03:26.610
then you upload it to your server.
50

50

00:03:26.610  -->  00:03:31.250
It creates a little bit of a weird setup, but for the most part,
51

51

00:03:31.250  -->  00:03:35.750
you can then look at this and say, "Oh, that is how I access it."
52

52

00:03:35.750  -->  00:03:38.400
Now, how does one set up WordPress?
53

53

00:03:38.400  -->  00:03:40.190
Well, that's similar to the other ones.
54

54

00:03:40.190  -->  00:03:46.240
WordPress really, really likes to harp on this 
a lot, you'll see it all over their copywriting,
55

55

00:03:46.240  -->  00:03:53.840
is that they became popular, or at least 
they hit an inflexion point with their adoption
56

56

00:03:53.840  -->  00:03:58.880
when they figured out a way to make their system install in five minutes or less.
57

57

00:03:58.880  -->  00:04:01.590
So it used to be the case that when you installed something, it just took a while,
58

58

00:04:01.590  -->  00:04:04.620
there was a lot of individual pieces you had to plug in for CMS systems.
59

59

00:04:04.620  -->  00:04:08.860
They just made it one simple system, all in a wrapper,
60

60

00:04:08.860  -->  00:04:11.550
and it should take you five minutes.
61

61

00:04:11.550  -->  00:04:16.490
So let's go to that actual address we've seen,
62

62

00:04:16.490  -->  00:04:18.760
and let's see if it actually does take five minutes.
63

63

00:04:18.760  -->  00:04:23.470
So when you go here, it just asks you language, I speak English,
64

64

00:04:23.470  -->  00:04:26.870
it asks you for some information about your database.
65

65

00:04:26.870  -->  00:04:30.640
In order to get that, you typically have to go back to your web server
66

66

00:04:30.640  -->  00:04:35.010
and look up the names for your SQL, probably SQL database.
67

67

00:04:35.010  -->  00:04:40.250
In my case, I had to go back to 1and1, and I had to create a SQL database setup,
68

68

00:04:40.250  -->  00:04:43.890
when you do that, it's usually pretty accessible 
depending on the web server you're using,
69

69

00:04:43.890  -->  00:04:47.850
mine is over here, I just go to MySQL database, and I just set one up.
70

70

00:04:47.850  -->  00:04:53.900
So here's my information, and I will copy that over, and move on to the next step.
71

71

00:05:01.000  -->  00:05:04.310
All right, so that worked out, and now we get to run the install,
72

72

00:05:04.310  -->  00:05:07.550
it's just going to ask you a whole bunch of questions about
73

73

00:05:07.550  -->  00:05:12.340
how you want to login, what you want your site to be called.
74

74

00:05:12.340  -->  00:05:16.000
Wordpressy site is what we'll call it,
75

75

00:05:16.000  -->  00:05:22.190
username, udemystudents, please don't actually login to this and hack my account,
76

76

00:05:22.190  -->  00:05:28.100
and we'll put my email address, and we'll use a masked email.
77

77

00:05:28.100  -->  00:05:30.140
All right, then I just hit "install,"
78

78

00:05:34.000  -->  00:05:34.970
and it says success.
79

79

00:05:34.970  -->  00:05:37.840
Ok, great. So now I can login and it's going to show me
80

80

00:05:37.840  -->  00:05:43.210
that gigantic administration panel that WordPress is so known for.
81

81

00:05:43.210  -->  00:05:46.030
Ok, so this is basically what WordPress is.
82

82

00:05:46.030  -->  00:05:47.720
So now I have installed it on my server.
83

83

00:05:47.720  -->  00:05:54.490
All I do really is just login by going to 
wp-admin, and this is where I build the website.
84

84

00:05:54.490  -->  00:05:59.850
If you were to go to my website, just WordPress, without this wp-admin,
85

85

00:05:59.850  -->  00:06:02.730
it would pull up whatever site I'm actually creating,
86

86

00:06:02.730  -->  00:06:05.240
it's usually pretty useful to have it in a separate window,
87

87

00:06:05.240  -->  00:06:09.340
or you edit it here and then look at it in a separate section.
88

88

00:06:09.340  -->  00:06:13.950
So here it has a lot of walkthroughs, where you can customize your site,
89

89

00:06:13.950  -->  00:06:18.420
or write your first blog post, bla bla bla, manage widgets and menus.
90

90

00:06:18.420  -->  00:06:20.740
Really it's up to you.
91

91

00:06:20.740  -->  00:06:23.960
They're trying to make it more user-friendly just in general.
92

92

00:06:23.960  -->  00:06:26.560
So the lingo you need to know - themes.
93

93

00:06:26.560  -->  00:06:32.430
A theme is a template that you can put onto your website,
94

94

00:06:32.430  -->  00:06:35.740
and it'll determine a lot of different things, what does it look like,
95

95

00:06:35.740  -->  00:06:38.940
what forms you have, what is the main function of your site,
96

96

00:06:38.940  -->  00:06:42.710
and then it's usually easier to modify that closer to what you want.
97

97

00:06:42.710  -->  00:06:47.580
Plugin. A plugin is like a miniature application that plugs into WordPress,
98

98

00:06:47.580  -->  00:06:51.980
in that case it might be something like a popup,
99

99

00:06:51.980  -->  00:06:54.630
you know, you're going to have a popup 
that tries to collect their email address,
100

100

00:06:54.630  -->  00:06:59.860
like a sumome.com, you'd use a plugin, and then an extension is generally
101

101

00:06:59.860  -->  00:07:05.750
a large piece of another code base you're attaching to WordPress.
102

102

00:07:05.750  -->  00:07:10.980
So let's say I wanted to make a forum on WordPress, well,
103

103

00:07:10.980  -->  00:07:15.000
I'd go and download an extension that gives me a lot of the functionality
104

104

00:07:15.000  -->  00:07:18.170
that a forum would have, and so I'd attach that to it.
105

105

00:07:18.170  -->  00:07:22.340
Now, if I wanted to add some themes, there's a million places to go.
106

106

00:07:22.340  -->  00:07:25.420
I'm not even joking, there's so many places you can go to get themes for this.
107

107

00:07:25.420  -->  00:07:29.290
I'd probably just go to WordPress.org/themes.
108

108

00:07:29.290  -->  00:07:33.480
Here, we can see a lot of free ones, and 
that's kind of their thing on WordPress.org,
109

109

00:07:33.480  -->  00:07:34.690
they're not trying to charge you money.
110

110

00:07:34.690  -->  00:07:38.560
On WordPress.com, try to look for a theme there,
111

111

00:07:38.560  -->  00:07:40.330
yes, they would gladly charge you money.
112

112

00:07:40.330  -->  00:07:45.400
So here, you can see a lot of different themes, up to you to download it.
113

113

00:07:45.400  -->  00:07:50.740
The way that these generally work is you download it as a package, and then
114

114

00:07:50.740  -->  00:07:54.310
when you're in the admin panel, it's going to ask you to set your theme,
115

115

00:07:54.310  -->  00:07:58.650
and you just navigate on your computer to that theme, and it should integrate it.
116

116

00:07:58.650  -->  00:08:02.700
So, back in the panel, what I could do is
117

117

00:08:02.700  -->  00:08:06.370
I could go to "change your theme completely,"
118

118

00:08:06.370  -->  00:08:13.000
and here are actually the embedded ones that they give you for free,
119

119

00:08:13.000  -->  00:08:15.880
there's a lot of free ones everywhere, but 
these are the ones that just come installed on it.
120

120

00:08:15.880  -->  00:08:24.210
So let's say I wanted Twenty Fourteen, which looks 
kind of like a photo blog, or something like that.
121

121

00:08:24.210  -->  00:08:28.700
This is the live preview that doesn't usually seem to work.
122

122

00:08:28.700  -->  00:08:34.500
So I could save and activate it, and then if I navigated towards the site,
123

123

00:08:34.500  -->  00:08:39.150
it would generally speaking work. Let's see.
124

124

00:08:39.150  -->  00:08:40.620
And see, right there, ok?
125

125

00:08:40.620  -->  00:08:46.170
So this is the site that I just put up, and now that I had that theme installed,
126

126

00:08:46.170  -->  00:08:50.040
as soon as I add content onto it, or photos, it'll start organizing it
127

127

00:08:50.040  -->  00:08:54.300
a bit more like that preview we saw here.
128

128

00:08:54.300  -->  00:08:57.010
Now, if I wanted to add a new one, I go to "add new"
129

129

00:08:57.010  -->  00:08:59.800
and just pull it out of that package that we had before.
130

130

00:08:59.800  -->  00:09:04.950
So I go to "upload," and then I would just pick the one we had before.
131

131

00:09:04.950  -->  00:09:10.220
So, in this case, what I would do is actually go to the zip diversion,
132

132

00:09:10.220  -->  00:09:14.300
apparently that's how it likes to take it, and "install now."
133

133

00:09:14.300  -->  00:09:16.090
Ok, there we go. And so, now it's installed.
134

134

00:09:16.090  -->  00:09:18.100
I can live preview it, I can activate it.
135

135

00:09:18.100  -->  00:09:22.600
Let's just activate it, and then we should see something
136

136

00:09:22.600  -->  00:09:26.250
close to that one that we downloaded and installed.
137

137

00:09:26.250  -->  00:09:32.350
So, now I can go there, just refresh it, might 
have to clear the cache, but there you go.
138

138

00:09:32.350  -->  00:09:36.400
So that was, as you can see it has some of the similarities.
139

139

00:09:36.400  -->  00:09:39.850
Again, once you start adding content to it, photos, blog posts, all that stuff,
140

140

00:09:39.850  -->  00:09:41.890
it will start actually looking like it.
141

141

00:09:41.890  -->  00:09:46.250
Ok guys, so this is WordPress, this is pretty much how they set up themes,
142

142

00:09:46.250  -->  00:09:50.500
plugins, extensions, there are millions and millions of themes out there,
143

143

00:09:50.500  -->  00:09:53.610
some are paid, a lot of them are free.
144

144

00:09:53.610  -->  00:09:58.140
You pick what you want and then essentially you activate the one you want,
145

145

00:09:58.140  -->  00:10:03.250
and then over here you have the options 
of adding posts, and media, and bla bla bla.
146

146

00:10:03.250  -->  00:10:07.800
You can add widgets, and menus, and headers, a lot you can do here.
147

147

00:10:07.800  -->  00:10:11.150
Even down here, in users, you can control the people that have signed up,
148

148

00:10:11.150  -->  00:10:15.580
if you have a membership profile, something like that, that's where you do this.
149

149

00:10:15.580  -->  00:10:18.260
Now, if you had installed an extension, it would show up over here,
150

150

00:10:18.260  -->  00:10:22.970
so then you'd be able to focus on the features that extension brings to you.
151

151

00:10:22.970  -->  00:10:25.700
All right guys, so that's pretty much what that looks like.
152

152

00:10:25.700  -->  00:10:27.730
You don't need to go too far into that one.
153

153

00:10:27.730  -->  00:10:30.230
I would suggest that if you ever have free time and you're bored,
154

154

00:10:30.230  -->  00:10:32.540
install this one, and just dink around.
155

155

00:10:32.540  -->  00:10:37.680
Why? Because 26% of the internet is on 
WordPress, so it's worth getting used to it.
156

156

00:10:37.680  -->  00:10:39.780
All right guys, see you in the next lecture!
