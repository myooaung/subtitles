Hey guys welcome back to the course so this lecture I'm going to answer one of the more common questions

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:12,180
I get which is should I specialize in new technology such as the mean stack the stack that includes

3
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,180
Mongo B-B.

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:14,780
No.

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,880
Yes.

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,820
And one of the other one it's angular jazz.

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,900
Now I know it's tempting to think while cutting edge is what I should be learning.

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,350
Right now everybody is just blowing up about react.

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,010
It's change in the name of the game etc. etc..

10
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:31,900
I should learn that.

11
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:39,150
Here's what I'll tell you is that the technology is constantly changing and a lot of times people get

12
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,100
hyped up about something that doesn't pan out.

13
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,790
Does anybody remember cold fusion.

14
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,630
No of course you don't because it flopped.

15
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:54,840
Now that's not to say that react Imber and angular and all these non-relational data bases aren't a

16
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,200
big deal and they're not going to be around.

17
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:04,320
I'm just saying make sure you have kind of a historical view of it and I generally suggest stick with

18
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,170
the stuff that has persisted over time.

19
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:13,710
If you're someone who knows that they're going to go into freelancing or it's going to star web or a

20
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:20,840
mobile development studio I actually second that advice I said before the reason why.

21
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,160
Well there's a lot of cool technology out there.

22
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,660
You can learn it and it can.

23
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,750
For instance making more efficient at what you do.

24
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:30,130
Build things faster and you think that's obviously a benefit.

25
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,180
But guess what it actually the only thing that matters is what you can explain to the client.

26
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,580
The client doesn't know what re-act is or what it does.

27
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:44,250
They don't really care so it doesn't give you a competitive advantage to win that game you're just going

28
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:50,520
to focus on the basic skills like selling yourself explaining what you do and communicating well you

29
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,100
can make a studio out of some crazy new language but just don't expect people to be beating down a path

30
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:02,940
to your door because most clients just don't know what it is the time to suggest learning some of these

31
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:08,580
newer types of technologies is just if it comes down to personal preference through that type of person

32
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:15,480
that hates javascript but loves what's called Asynchronous JavaScript like node.

33
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:23,670
J Yes if that's the case then maybe you go with more modern things and the things that are cutting edge

34
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:30,210
just make sure that you're keeping up to date with what's going on because the stuff can turn on a dime.

35
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:35,790
The last thing I'll say is make sure if you're trying to get a job just keep your eyes open for changes

36
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,190
in the industry.

37
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:43,110
If you're someone who for some reason wants to be a database administrator it's worth paying attention

38
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:49,840
or at least learning how new databases work because we do see large shifts in that technology.

39
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,360
For instance Hadoop is a system that people use for big data.

40
00:02:54,510 --> 00:03:00,180
While a lot of companies are moving towards using big data and so might use Hadoop so it's probably

41
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,050
something you should learn to at least stay with the trends.
