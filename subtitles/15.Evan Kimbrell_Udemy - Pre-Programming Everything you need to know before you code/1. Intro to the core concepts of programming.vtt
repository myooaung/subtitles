00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:01.960
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
2

2

00:00:01.960  -->  00:00:07.310
Ok, so in this section we're just ever so slightly going to dip our toes
3

3

00:00:07.310  -->  00:00:12.650
in the waters of programming, so that we can see that it's really not that bad.
4

4

00:00:12.650  -->  00:00:17.050
Now, a lot of people have this, I would almost 
say like an irrational fear of programing
5

5

00:00:17.050  -->  00:00:20.350
because they assume it's way too complicated for them to learn,
6

6

00:00:20.350  -->  00:00:24.560
and when they do actually see code, they don't understand any of it,
7

7

00:00:24.560  -->  00:00:28.200
thus feeding into that first fear even more.
8

8

00:00:28.200  -->  00:00:30.830
Looks complicated, must be complicated.
9

9

00:00:30.830  -->  00:00:34.600
Programming is just like any human language in that regard.
10

10

00:00:34.600  -->  00:00:38.480
Does it take time to learn? Yes, absolutely, of course.
11

11

00:00:38.480  -->  00:00:43.810
Is it really, really hard? Well, it depends 
obviously on what you are trying to learn.
12

12

00:00:43.810  -->  00:00:48.150
If I saw code for the first time, could I actually understand it?
13

13

00:00:48.150  -->  00:00:52.920
Well, you know, to make the reference back to human languages,
14

14

00:00:52.920  -->  00:00:59.900
if you saw two people speaking Bahasa Indonesia, 
which is what they speak in Indonesia,
15

15

00:00:59.900  -->  00:01:02.900
would you be able to understand those two people speaking that language?
16

16

00:01:02.900  -->  00:01:04.730
Well, no, of course not.
17

17

00:01:04.730  -->  00:01:08.140
But does that mean that it's so complicated you'll never get it?
18

18

00:01:08.140  -->  00:01:14.040
No, actually not at all. In human language, Bahasa is apparently consistently
19

19

00:01:14.040  -->  00:01:16.950
ranked the easiest language in the world to learn.
20

20

00:01:16.950  -->  00:01:19.420
Programming has its equivalents.
21

21

00:01:19.420  -->  00:01:23.480
Everything is confusing until you take the first step towards learning something.
22

22

00:01:23.480  -->  00:01:29.790
Once you unravel the details of it, you'll find out 
it's really not much of a mystery after all.
23

23

00:01:29.790  -->  00:01:35.230
You might be frustrated by how tedious, or, at times, arbitrary it feels,
24

24

00:01:35.230  -->  00:01:40.260
but at the end of the day, it's still logical, 
and it's just not nearly as complicated
25

25

00:01:40.260  -->  00:01:44.310
once you actually break down the individual sections of how programming works.
26

26

00:01:44.310  -->  00:01:47.640
In fact, programming is relatively easy to understand,
27

27

00:01:47.640  -->  00:01:50.650
and there's only a handful of concepts that you need to understand
28

28

00:01:50.650  -->  00:01:54.020
to understand virtually any language.
29

29

00:01:54.020  -->  00:01:57.390
You see, when programming languages were initially being developed,
30

30

00:01:57.390  -->  00:02:02.930
they were inevitably going to be based off of the languages that preceded them,
31

31

00:02:02.930  -->  00:02:07.300
and as a result, most languages inherited 
the same techniques from their predecessors,
32

32

00:02:07.300  -->  00:02:11.460
and then any language that was being built in parallel to each language
33

33

00:02:11.460  -->  00:02:13.940
would often borrow the same techniques.
34

34

00:02:13.940  -->  00:02:18.440
The result is that they all operate essentially the same way.
35

35

00:02:18.440  -->  00:02:22.800
Now, in human speech, everyone has the concept of, let's say, a verb, right?
36

36

00:02:22.800  -->  00:02:26.280
A verb is just a word that connotates an action.
37

37

00:02:26.280  -->  00:02:30.650
In programming, every language has the concept of a variable,
38

38

00:02:30.650  -->  00:02:34.920
which is essentially like a short form way of storing information
39

39

00:02:34.920  -->  00:02:38.450
and then using it later somewhere in your instructional code.
40

40

00:02:38.450  -->  00:02:41.560
Ok, we're going to breeze through the concepts and hopefully at the end of this
41

41

00:02:41.560  -->  00:02:44.340
you'll be like, "Hey, this isn't that bad."
42

42

00:02:44.340  -->  00:02:47.260
And if you don't say that, well, I guess it's not my fault.
43

43

00:02:47.260  -->  00:02:49.000
The concepts that we're going to learn are:
44

44

00:02:49.000  -->  00:02:56.810
one - syntax; two - printing; three - commenting; 
four - variables (which you should've already gotten a taste of);
45

45

00:02:56.810  -->  00:03:04.850
five - arrays; six - loops; seven - strings; eight - functions, 
and last, nine, what are called conditionals.
46

46

00:03:04.850  -->  00:03:08.800
Seriously, wipe that grin off your face, it's really not that complicated.
47

47

00:03:08.800  -->  00:03:10.190
Again, it sounds complicated.
48

48

00:03:10.190  -->  00:03:12.620
Trust me, you'll get through this without skinning your knees.
49

49

00:03:12.620  -->  00:03:14.000
All right, see you in the next lecture!
