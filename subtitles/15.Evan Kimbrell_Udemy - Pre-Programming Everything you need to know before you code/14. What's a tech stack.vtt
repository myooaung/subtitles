00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:01.960
Hey guys, we are back.
2

2

00:00:01.960  -->  00:00:05.700
Let's talk about the concept of a technology stack.
3

3

00:00:05.700  -->  00:00:09.710
You've heard it, I'm sure, so let's take some time to clear up
4

4

00:00:09.710  -->  00:00:14.720
the knots in your head, so you can finally 
see clearly and get what I'm saying.
5

5

00:00:14.720  -->  00:00:18.480
When we talk about technology, you've 
probably noticed that I frequently
6

6

00:00:18.480  -->  00:00:24.860
will say that a software or a program runs 
ON something instead of IN something.
7

7

00:00:24.860  -->  00:00:33.550
If I said "Mozilla Firefox runs on OS X, Macintosh OS X," 
what do you think that I meant by that?
8

8

00:00:33.550  -->  00:00:35.730
What I mean by that is that your operating system
9

9

00:00:35.730  -->  00:00:39.770
acts as a gigantic interpreter for your computer,
10

10

00:00:39.770  -->  00:00:44.080
and, as a result, any software or program can do its own thing
11

11

00:00:44.080  -->  00:00:47.410
within the space that your operating system has created for it.
12

12

00:00:47.410  -->  00:00:51.550
Now, the way that we frequently think 
of this to save us mental energy
13

13

00:00:51.550  -->  00:00:57.000
is to think of it like a physical stack. And that's 
where you hear ON as opposed to IN.
14

14

00:00:57.000  -->  00:00:58.320
Let's imagine an office building.
15

15

00:00:58.320  -->  00:01:02.430
Can you build floor two without building floor one?
16

16

00:01:02.430  -->  00:01:05.630
Well, no. If floor one is, let's say, your operating system,
17

17

00:01:05.630  -->  00:01:09.210
say it's Microsoft Windows, what is floor two?
18

18

00:01:09.210  -->  00:01:13.570
Well, it could be one of many things, 
but let's say it's your browser.
19

19

00:01:13.570  -->  00:01:16.600
It could also be your email client, it could be your favorite tool,
20

20

00:01:16.600  -->  00:01:19.240
it could be a word processor, whatever.
21

21

00:01:19.240  -->  00:01:23.010
Now, what could you build on top of what I just said?
22

22

00:01:23.010  -->  00:01:26.650
Well, you could build websites on top of your browser,
23

23

00:01:26.650  -->  00:01:28.920
with a browser now we can run programs that run
24

24

00:01:28.920  -->  00:01:31.990
within a program within an operating system.
25

25

00:01:31.990  -->  00:01:33.930
It's like one of those crazy Russian doll things.
26

26

00:01:33.930  -->  00:01:38.490
So the stack paradigm is the one way to think about technology
27

27

00:01:38.490  -->  00:01:41.860
and I suggest you try your best to start looking at it this way.
28

28

00:01:41.860  -->  00:01:45.140
Now any set of technology or programming 
languages that works together
29

29

00:01:45.140  -->  00:01:49.540
and enables each other will and can be referred to as a stack.
30

30

00:01:49.540  -->  00:01:52.610
Much like the floors are stacked on top of each other,
31

31

00:01:52.610  -->  00:01:57.280
programming languages and technology 
can be stacked on top of each other as well.
32

32

00:01:57.280  -->  00:01:59.380
Now, if you forgot everything I just said, and if there was
33

33

00:01:59.380  -->  00:02:02.550
only one thing you needed to understand, it's this.
34

34

00:02:02.550  -->  00:02:05.890
To build a website, or mobile app, or mobile site,
35

35

00:02:05.890  -->  00:02:10.630
we have to use a series of programming languages 
and technologies to get the job done.
36

36

00:02:10.630  -->  00:02:15.710
When I say web stack, I'm referring 
to exactly that series of technology,
37

37

00:02:15.710  -->  00:02:20.020
what is the combination of technologies that this website uses.
38

38

00:02:20.020  -->  00:02:23.980
And 90% of the time we hear the phrase "tech stack,"
39

39

00:02:23.980  -->  00:02:27.610
we're going to be talking about web and mobile apps.
40

40

00:02:27.610  -->  00:02:32.210
You very rarely hear "tech stack" being 
referred to a simple website,
41

41

00:02:32.210  -->  00:02:36.360
because it doesn't really matter, or we can easily guess what it uses.
42

42

00:02:36.360  -->  00:02:39.170
Now, any given common tech stack is going to be broken down
43

43

00:02:39.170  -->  00:02:42.930
into four different categories, with interchangeable parts.
44

44

00:02:42.930  -->  00:02:48.430
Let's take an example, the most common 
example you can possibly find, which is LAMP.
45

45

00:02:48.430  -->  00:02:53.000
A website or web app could be built using the LAMP stack.
46

46

00:02:53.000  -->  00:02:56.180
Now, every single letter in this acronym stands for something.
47

47

00:02:56.180  -->  00:02:59.580
L is the first spot and it stands for Linux.
48

48

00:02:59.580  -->  00:03:02.950
Linux is going to be the operating system that is most commonly
49

49

00:03:02.950  -->  00:03:06.620
used on servers, therefore the L is reserved for that spot.
50

50

00:03:06.620  -->  00:03:11.450
A is Apache, which is also the most 
common technology installed on servers
51

51

00:03:11.450  -->  00:03:17.060
to provide the ability to store, sort, 
and transmit files between servers.
52

52

00:03:17.060  -->  00:03:21.900
I wouldn't worry too much about Apache, just 
understand that servers have their own software
53

53

00:03:21.900  -->  00:03:27.440
that is designed to host websites and transmit files effectively.
54

54

00:03:27.440  -->  00:03:33.680
Now, the M in LAMP refers to the technology 
MySQL, spelled M-Y-S-Q-L,
55

55

00:03:33.680  -->  00:03:38.450
it's Sequel, but you could also say 
MySQL, which we'll actually cover later,
56

56

00:03:38.450  -->  00:03:42.680
but what that is is it refers to the database 
that's used to store information
57

57

00:03:42.680  -->  00:03:47.490
like images, form data, user profile information, on and on.
58

58

00:03:47.490  -->  00:03:53.000
The last one in the acronym for LAMP is the P, which stands for PHP,
59

59

00:03:53.000  -->  00:03:57.800
and that's the language that's used to run 
all the back-end functions of the website.
60

60

00:03:57.800  -->  00:04:01.670
So to go backwards, you would use a PHP programming language
61

61

00:04:01.670  -->  00:04:07.650
to talk to the MySQL database, and ask 
for some records by communicating
62

62

00:04:07.650  -->  00:04:12.380
with the Apache software that runs on 
that server, which would then have to
63

63

00:04:12.380  -->  00:04:17.760
relay that information down to Linux, 
which is the operating system on that server.
64

64

00:04:19.120  -->  00:04:21.090
Don't worry too much about these details.
65

65

00:04:21.090  -->  00:04:24.700
So that's it, a very common technology stack for websites.
66

66

00:04:24.700  -->  00:04:26.760
Guess who uses LAMP?
67

67

00:04:26.760  -->  00:04:28.230
If you can take a wild guess.
68

68

00:04:28.230  -->  00:04:31.100
Facebook. Facebook is built on LAMP.
69

69

00:04:31.100  -->  00:04:33.140
Also, probably a million other websites.
70

70

00:04:33.140  -->  00:04:37.470
If I were to change one of the pieces, 
let's say we wanted to change
71

71

00:04:37.470  -->  00:04:41.050
the server operating system to Windows instead of Linux,
72

72

00:04:41.050  -->  00:04:44.920
that would change LAMP to LAMP's evil sister, WAMP.
73

73

00:04:44.920  -->  00:04:49.460
And not to be forgotten, of course, the other sibling, MAMP,
74

74

00:04:49.460  -->  00:04:51.920
which you can guess what that is, hopefully.
75

75

00:04:51.920  -->  00:04:54.330
Macintosh OS makes MAMP.
76

76

00:04:54.330  -->  00:04:56.630
Think of it like a sandwich.
77

77

00:04:56.630  -->  00:05:01.100
The bread and the buns are the PHP and the Linux,
78

78

00:05:01.100  -->  00:05:03.250
and in the middle you have the meat and veggies,
79

79

00:05:03.250  -->  00:05:08.740
which is the Apache and MySQL, all comes 
together for the lamest sandwich ever.
80

80

00:05:08.740  -->  00:05:10.810
In the next couple of lectures, we're going to talk about
81

81

00:05:10.810  -->  00:05:12.840
common stacks that you should be familiar with.
82

82

00:05:12.840  -->  00:05:16.110
How do stacks, for instance, work with mobile apps?
83

83

00:05:16.110  -->  00:05:18.480
What does my company use?
84

84

00:05:18.480  -->  00:05:22.390
Spoiler: I don't know, but we can probably figure it out.
85

85

00:05:22.390  -->  00:05:24.370
All right guys, I'll see you the next lecture!
