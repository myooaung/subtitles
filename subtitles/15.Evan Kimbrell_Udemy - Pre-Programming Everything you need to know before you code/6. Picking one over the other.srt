00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,370
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
2

2

00:00:02,370  -->  00:00:04,980
All right, so in this lecture, we're going to address the obvious question.
3

3

00:00:04,980  -->  00:00:09,180
This is a lot of different information and different systems,
4

4

00:00:09,180  -->  00:00:11,980
how do I choose one or the other?
5

5

00:00:11,980  -->  00:00:15,650
And it's an important question, obviously, 
especially if you're going to build an app,
6

6

00:00:15,650  -->  00:00:20,800
launch a blog, create a forum, or pretty much 
anything else you could possibly do on the interwebs.
7

7

00:00:20,800  -->  00:00:22,960
Well, the first distinction is easy.
8

8

00:00:22,960  -->  00:00:26,130
Are you going to sell things online?
9

9

00:00:26,130  -->  00:00:29,800
If you're primarily going to be working on an e-commerce store,
10

10

00:00:29,800  -->  00:00:33,700
then spend your time working with a Magento, or Shopify,
11

11

00:00:33,700  -->  00:00:38,010
or any of the other like a hundred e-commerce focused CMS systems.
12

12

00:00:38,010  -->  00:00:42,380
These are made for you, and made for 
all the problems you will run into selling things.
13

13

00:00:42,380  -->  00:00:45,650
And yes, there are a lot of problems you haven't thought of
14

14

00:00:45,650  -->  00:00:49,980
that other non e-commerce systems don't really bother to address,
15

15

00:00:49,980  -->  00:00:53,560
such as "What happens when I accept a payment in a different currency?",
16

16

00:00:53,560  -->  00:00:58,100
"How can I detect user fraud or pick up on a bad credit card?",
17

17

00:00:58,100  -->  00:01:03,940
or even "How can I routinely offer sales on certain items to boost sales?"
18

18

00:01:03,940  -->  00:01:07,210
Someone creating a blog could not care less about these questions.
19

19

00:01:07,210  -->  00:01:10,040
Now, one thing you need to ask yourself upfront is
20

20

00:01:10,040  -->  00:01:13,540
"Is the purpose of this site primarily to sell things?"
21

21

00:01:13,540  -->  00:01:17,750
or "Is selling things just one of the many things my site does?"
22

22

00:01:17,750  -->  00:01:21,050
Keep in mind, online shops also have blogs.
23

23

00:01:21,050  -->  00:01:25,250
Amazon has a blog, although I'm not sure anyone has actually ever read it.
24

24

00:01:25,250  -->  00:01:29,660
Going with an e-commerce focused system can still facilitate this.
25

25

00:01:29,660  -->  00:01:33,920
Shopify is going to be harder to attach a blog to because
26

26

00:01:33,920  -->  00:01:37,200
they control too much and they're all about the money.
27

27

00:01:37,200  -->  00:01:41,210
Magento, on the other hand, can make this a little bit easier for you.
28

28

00:01:41,210  -->  00:01:45,470
What most people do, believe it or not, is they either choose a platform
29

29

00:01:45,470  -->  00:01:50,720
that focuses on e-commerce and handles blogging sufficiently
30

30

00:01:50,720  -->  00:01:54,320
or they use two separate CMS systems.
31

31

00:01:54,320  -->  00:01:59,360
I know - mind blown - one for selling and one for blogging.
32

32

00:01:59,360  -->  00:02:02,460
Now, does this create unique challenges? Yes.
33

33

00:02:02,460  -->  00:02:05,100
Is it hard to do? No, not really.
34

34

00:02:05,100  -->  00:02:07,730
Now, if you're more focused on creating other types of content
35

35

00:02:07,730  -->  00:02:13,400
and selling things is but one of the things you do, then typically you're going to pick
36

36

00:02:13,400  -->  00:02:17,080
one of the onesie CMS systems we talked about before.
37

37

00:02:17,080  -->  00:02:24,150
Why? Well, because they handle all types of content 
really well and they can handle e-commerce fine.
38

38

00:02:24,150  -->  00:02:28,430
Since you're not going to be running intense cohort and regression analysis
39

39

00:02:28,430  -->  00:02:34,030
on your year to year sales totals, using an e-commerce platform might be overkill.
40

40

00:02:34,030  -->  00:02:38,800
All you have to do with WordPress, for example, is just install plugins for what you need,
41

41

00:02:38,800  -->  00:02:43,330
plugins for listing products, plugins for accepting payment.
42

42

00:02:43,330  -->  00:02:45,230
Is that easy to do?
43

43

00:02:45,230  -->  00:02:48,440
Well, it's not the hardest thing in the world, let's just say that.
44

44

00:02:48,440  -->  00:02:50,500
Ok, so that's your first fork in the road.
45

45

00:02:50,500  -->  00:02:53,450
To money or not to money? That is the question.
46

46

00:02:53,450  -->  00:02:57,520
The second question is "How particular are you about details?"
47

47

00:02:57,520  -->  00:03:03,520
Do you need to make this site 100% unique and tailor every part to what you want?
48

48

00:03:03,520  -->  00:03:08,500
If that's the case, then you need one of the older, more traditional CMS systems,
49

49

00:03:08,500  -->  00:03:11,960
because with those, really the sky is the limit.
50

50

00:03:11,960  -->  00:03:17,170
Keep in mind, obviously, that you're inviting way 
more work onto yourself by going this route.
51

51

00:03:17,170  -->  00:03:21,540
If you're not as particular about the details, and don't care about having
52

52

00:03:21,540  -->  00:03:26,580
an exclusive design, then try using a Weebly, or a SquareSpace, or a Wix.
53

53

00:03:26,580  -->  00:03:30,690
They, after all, do look pretty slick, because that's what they focus on.
54

54

00:03:30,690  -->  00:03:35,220
Now, what if you can't tell if you care or not about these details?
55

55

00:03:35,220  -->  00:03:37,780
Although, I mean, this is a bit weird, try this.
56

56

00:03:37,780  -->  00:03:41,460
Go to SquareSpace.com and look at one of their templates.
57

57

00:03:41,460  -->  00:03:45,130
Now, when you're looking at it, how many things can you point out
58

58

00:03:45,130  -->  00:03:47,770
that you think are wrong with the website?
59

59

00:03:47,770  -->  00:03:52,070
If you're response is along the lines of "Ooo, pretty"
60

60

00:03:52,070  -->  00:03:57,740
then, trust me, you're probably fine with non-customizable newer CMS systems.
61

61

00:03:57,740  -->  00:04:01,010
Another question worth asking, "What are you planning to make?"
62

62

00:04:01,010  -->  00:04:06,680
If your answer is a blog, a forum, a store, a news outlet, a membership site,
63

63

00:04:06,680  -->  00:04:12,020
or a site that just has information on it, then, well, you're well within the bounds
64

64

00:04:12,020  -->  00:04:15,860
of using a more restrictive but easier to use CMS.
65

65

00:04:15,860  -->  00:04:21,070
If your answer is along the lines of "It's a site that needs to do this and that,
66

66

00:04:21,070  -->  00:04:25,940
but not this, and look like this but not that," well then, you need more customization.
67

67

00:04:25,940  -->  00:04:30,080
What if I want to build an online service or tool that is 100% unique?
68

68

00:04:30,080  -->  00:04:34,280
Well, I'm sorry to say this, but you're not going to be using a CMS.
69

69

00:04:34,280  -->  00:04:39,680
You might use one to run smaller parts of your website that are non-unique,
70

70

00:04:39,680  -->  00:04:44,980
like your blog, or like large portions of the site that frequently have updated text,
71

71

00:04:44,980  -->  00:04:49,240
but the rest of it, well, that's probably going to have to be made from scratch.
72

72

00:04:49,240  -->  00:04:55,680
Well, unless you're using a PaaS system, which right now,
73

73

00:04:55,680  -->  00:04:58,970
I know, means absolutely nothing to you, but we'll talk about it very soon.
74

74

00:04:58,970  -->  00:05:01,130
Ok, here's what you want to ask yourself.
75

75

00:05:01,130  -->  00:05:02,540
Store or no store?
76

76

00:05:02,540  -->  00:05:06,080
If your main focus is selling, use a Magento or Shopify.
77

77

00:05:06,080  -->  00:05:07,900
If you're not, then don't use those.
78

78

00:05:07,900  -->  00:05:10,680
If you care a lot about details, uniqueness, and creative control,
79

79

00:05:10,680  -->  00:05:15,650
then you're going to want to lean on the spectrum towards customization
80

80

00:05:15,650  -->  00:05:18,920
and more work for you - WordPress and the like.
81

81

00:05:18,920  -->  00:05:21,780
If you're not picky about details and what you're making
82

82

00:05:21,780  -->  00:05:25,360
does not have a large unique technical aspect to it,
83

83

00:05:25,360  -->  00:05:28,770
then using a SquareSpace or a Weebly is probably going to be your ticket.
84

84

00:05:28,770  -->  00:05:32,140
And lastly, if you're creating a custom application, then, well,
85

85

00:05:32,140  -->  00:05:35,270
you're not going to use a CMS, I'm sorry.
86

86

00:05:35,270  -->  00:05:37,200
All right guys, see you in the next section!
