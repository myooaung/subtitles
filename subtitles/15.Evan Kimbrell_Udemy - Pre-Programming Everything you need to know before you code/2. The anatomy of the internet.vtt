1

00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:01.760
All right, and we are back.
2

2

00:00:01.760  -->  00:00:04.700
So now we know where the internet 
came from, why it's called "the internet"
3

3

00:00:04.700  -->  00:00:11.370
and what the F we are doing when we type in 
HTTP and WWW into our browsers
4

4

00:00:11.370  -->  00:00:13.510
to get to our Pinterest boards.
5

5

00:00:13.510  -->  00:00:18.440
Trust me, soon we will be out of the woods 
and into way more complicated stuff.
6

6

00:00:18.440  -->  00:00:22.630
So right now just enjoy the relative simplicity while it lasts.
7

7

00:00:22.630  -->  00:00:26.400
So what does the rest of the browser 
mean and where am I getting
8

8

00:00:26.400  -->  00:00:30.030
my information from when I upload a photo of my cat to iCloud?
9

9

00:00:30.030  -->  00:00:34.100
To explain this, let's go over some softballs 
and learn some easy concepts.
10

10

00:00:34.100  -->  00:00:38.530
First off, you need to know the difference between 
three terms as they relate to computers.
11

11

00:00:38.530  -->  00:00:41.740
These, I guarantee you, you will use and hear.
12

12

00:00:41.740  -->  00:00:45.340
They are three things: client, node, and server.
13

13

00:00:45.340  -->  00:00:49.350
Ok, so let's say I'm using a computer 
to download a Kindle book from Amazon.
14

14

00:00:49.350  -->  00:00:55.820
In this scenario, my computer is what we call a client, 
as it's the device in a transaction
15

15

00:00:55.820  -->  00:01:01.260
receiving the information, and whatever 
machine in Seattle that stores the book
16

16

00:01:01.260  -->  00:01:04.460
and is now sending it to me is then called the server.
17

17

00:01:04.460  -->  00:01:11.700
Any machine that book crosses through to get 
to me from its origin point is called a node.
18

18

00:01:11.700  -->  00:01:14.840
Now, earlier when I said two LAN networks connected together
19

19

00:01:14.840  -->  00:01:18.240
through an intermediary forms what is essentially the internet,
20

20

00:01:18.240  -->  00:01:22.110
that intermediary I just referenced would be considered a node.
21

21

00:01:22.110  -->  00:01:23.950
Keep in mind, these terms are just relative.
22

22

00:01:23.950  -->  00:01:30.570
You might think "But I thought a machine called a server, 
and it said server on the box when I bought it,"
23

23

00:01:30.570  -->  00:01:32.290
you might think that that's a server.
24

24

00:01:32.290  -->  00:01:35.660
Well, yeah, it is most likely, and they most likely call it that
25

25

00:01:35.660  -->  00:01:38.460
because it's designed to store and send information.
26

26

00:01:38.460  -->  00:01:45.030
But if I decided to upload information, let's say, 
from my computer to that server,
27

27

00:01:45.030  -->  00:01:49.570
guess which one technically now, in this new 
arrangement, is called the server?
28

28

00:01:49.570  -->  00:01:53.140
If you said the server in the box, no, 
you're wrong, it's the computer.
29

29

00:01:53.140  -->  00:01:56.450
The server in this instance then 
flips roles and it's called the client.
30

30

00:01:56.450  -->  00:01:59.450
If I transferred information from my phone to my computer,
31

31

00:01:59.450  -->  00:02:01.850
guess what my phone would be called?
32

32

00:02:01.850  -->  00:02:05.590
It would be called a server. It serves the information.
33

33

00:02:05.590  -->  00:02:09.730
It's kind of confusing, and I suggest 
you don't think about it too much.
34

34

00:02:09.730  -->  00:02:14.200
It's just an important set of terms you'll 
need to know and it will help you eventually.
35

35

00:02:14.200  -->  00:02:17.200
What you do need to know is that the internet is made solely
36

36

00:02:17.200  -->  00:02:22.040
of those three pieces we just went over: 
clients, servers, and nodes.
37

37

00:02:22.040  -->  00:02:26.880
In the vast majority of cases, 
information stored on a large machine
38

38

00:02:26.880  -->  00:02:33.110
is on request transferring information to 
your laptop - server transferring to a client.
39

39

00:02:33.110  -->  00:02:35.720
In most cases that is just purely simple enough.
40

40

00:02:35.720  -->  00:02:39.950
Want to watch a movie on Netflix, well, 
Netflix has a big server you connect to
41

41

00:02:39.950  -->  00:02:44.230
and it transfers that data from their 
big old server to your computer.
42

42

00:02:44.230  -->  00:02:48.500
But what exactly happens in the middle of that transfer?
43

43

00:02:48.500  -->  00:02:50.800
Well, a bunch of nodes happen.
44

44

00:02:50.800  -->  00:02:55.640
For the sake of your sanity, you only really need 
to understand three nodes in this process.
45

45

00:02:55.640  -->  00:03:00.140
The first one is what's called an Internet Service Provider,
46

46

00:03:00.140  -->  00:03:03.520
also called an ISP in cool tech lingo.
47

47

00:03:03.520  -->  00:03:05.680
The second one you need to understand is what's called a modem,
48

48

00:03:05.680  -->  00:03:08.120
and the third one you need to understand is what's called a router.
49

49

00:03:08.120  -->  00:03:10.690
For all intents and purposes, just think about it this way.
50

50

00:03:10.690  -->  00:03:13.470
Information, every time you request it and you receive it,
51

51

00:03:13.470  -->  00:03:16.990
it must pass through these three things to get to your computer.
52

52

00:03:16.990  -->  00:03:18.060
So let's start with the first one.
53

53

00:03:18.060  -->  00:03:22.970
What is an Internet Service Provider 
in this weird web of relationships?
54

54

00:03:22.970  -->  00:03:29.040
Well, I guarantee you interact with one and you probably 
have at least a mild dislike for the one you use.
55

55

00:03:29.040  -->  00:03:34.780
Internet Service Providers, like Comcast, or Time 
Warner, or actually even, back in the day, AOL,
56

56

00:03:34.780  -->  00:03:40.820
are essentially mega hubs for distributing and 
connecting computers across the country.
57

57

00:03:40.820  -->  00:03:43.990
But what exactly, as an entity, do they do?
58

58

00:03:43.990  -->  00:03:48.000
Well, let me explain it by explaining 
how the internet used to work,
59

59

00:03:48.000  -->  00:03:49.360
and then it will make more sense.
60

60

00:03:49.360  -->  00:03:54.030
Let's say, back in the day, you wanted to 
get the news from your local CBS news station.
61

61

00:03:54.030  -->  00:03:58.270
Well, in order to do that, you would 
need to connect a physical line
62

62

00:03:58.270  -->  00:04:02.200
to that CBS news station, from your computer.
63

63

00:04:02.200  -->  00:04:04.650
What if you wanted to transfer a music file to your friend
64

64

00:04:04.650  -->  00:04:06.980
down the street without Metallica suing you?
65

65

00:04:06.980  -->  00:04:11.010
Well, you would need a physical cable running to their house.
66

66

00:04:11.010  -->  00:04:13.760
At some point in the internet's 
development, several large companies
67

67

00:04:13.760  -->  00:04:17.820
all kind of came to the same conclusion 
that it's materially impossible
68

68

00:04:17.820  -->  00:04:21.360
to connect every single house to every single house,
69

69

00:04:21.360  -->  00:04:25.920
so it actually made more sense if 
we created one big hub that's local
70

70

00:04:25.920  -->  00:04:30.300
that everyone connected to instead, and 
then to connect the hubs to each other,
71

71

00:04:30.300  -->  00:04:32.400
you don't have to have as many wires.
72

72

00:04:32.400  -->  00:04:37.140
That process cost money, and after all, 
it's millions of dollars in new lines
73

73

00:04:37.140  -->  00:04:41.820
that have to be put in the ground, and 
that's what the inexplicable charge
74

74

00:04:41.820  -->  00:04:44.110
on your monthly credit card statement is from.
75

75

00:04:44.110  -->  00:04:48.380
True story, back in the day, some neighborhoods 
would actually pitch in together
76

76

00:04:48.380  -->  00:04:53.130
to buy cable lines and to make their 
own little happy neighborhood hub.
77

77

00:04:53.130  -->  00:04:56.500
Anyway, ok, so that is the first node 
that you need to understand.
78

78

00:04:56.500  -->  00:04:59.500
ISPs, or that company you probably hate.
79

79

00:04:59.500  -->  00:05:05.030
The second node is that thing that keeps blinking 
in your house and you have no idea what it's doing.
80

80

00:05:05.030  -->  00:05:07.100
That thing is called your modem.
81

81

00:05:07.100  -->  00:05:12.140
With pretty much everything in this course, 
there are a million things I could tell you,
82

82

00:05:12.140  -->  00:05:15.010
but there are not a million things you need to know.
83

83

00:05:15.010  -->  00:05:18.110
A modem is a very complicated piece of equipment,
84

84

00:05:18.110  -->  00:05:21.860
but you don't need to know how it works basically.
85

85

00:05:21.860  -->  00:05:26.560
A modem is just a device that is permanently connected to your ISP,
86

86

00:05:26.560  -->  00:05:31.670
and is used to send and receive information through your ISP hub.
87

87

00:05:31.670  -->  00:05:36.150
When your internet goes out, it's often just 
the modem, since it's the intermediary,
88

88

00:05:36.150  -->  00:05:39.540
just acting up, it is not that the internet has dried up,
89

89

00:05:39.540  -->  00:05:43.570
* Oh I'm going to sit down with that 
internet and just start emailing *
90

90

00:05:43.570  -->  00:05:45.750
contrary to what some people believe.
91

91

00:05:45.750  -->  00:05:48.720
All right, you made it so far? 
That is the second node,
92

92

00:05:48.720  -->  00:05:51.450
and there's only one more we have to tackle.
93

93

00:05:51.450  -->  00:05:55.660
This last piece is the compliment to 
your modem, and it's called the router.
94

94

00:05:55.660  -->  00:05:58.030
I bet you didn't even know the difference between the two.
95

95

00:05:58.030  -->  00:06:01.760
Oh, you did? Yeah, no, you didn't, 
you don't work for Comcast.
96

96

00:06:01.760  -->  00:06:07.430
The router is merely the hub that allows all 
devices and systems in one area or room
97

97

00:06:07.430  -->  00:06:11.130
to connect to the same connection through the modem.
98

98

00:06:11.130  -->  00:06:15.400
You don't need a modem for every single 
computer you own, you just need one router.
99

99

00:06:15.400  -->  00:06:18.650
The router in most cases today is 
what takes that internet transfer
100

100

00:06:18.650  -->  00:06:23.150
and then transfers it through that 
magical wavelength called WiFi.
101

101

00:06:23.150  -->  00:06:27.190
But, remember, you can always still connect 
directly to the router with a cord in a pinch.
102

102

00:06:27.190  -->  00:06:30.850
Routers do exactly what they sound like, they route traffic
103

103

00:06:30.850  -->  00:06:35.590
so that multiple devices can use one permanent 
connection with an Internet Service Provider.
104

104

00:06:35.590  -->  00:06:40.100
So a modem just acts as a bus that 
transfers information from your ISP,
105

105

00:06:40.100  -->  00:06:45.470
and then converts it from your coaxial - you know 
that circular cord you use to actually
106

106

00:06:45.470  -->  00:06:51.680
plug into your TV, that's what they use - to something 
that's actually usable by your computer.
107

107

00:06:51.680  -->  00:06:56.380
It's also effectively the bouncer to both 
your computer and your Internet Service Provider.
108

108

00:06:56.380  -->  00:07:00.850
It regulates what connects through it and who gets access to what.
109

109

00:07:00.850  -->  00:07:05.320
Modems are pretty effective at least, hence why most hackers
110

110

00:07:05.320  -->  00:07:08.030
try to compromise the router piece instead.
111

111

00:07:08.030  -->  00:07:11.660
Ok, I know that's a ton of information, but let's recap it.
112

112

00:07:11.660  -->  00:07:14.430
When you want to download a web page what exactly happens?
113

113

00:07:14.430  -->  00:07:18.550
Well, the information you request is stored somewhere on a server,
114

114

00:07:18.550  -->  00:07:21.270
most likely owned by the company you're trying to access,
115

115

00:07:21.270  -->  00:07:26.250
or by a web host that owns tons of servers 
and then leases it out to companies,
116

116

00:07:26.250  -->  00:07:29.920
that information is then transferred 
to an Internet Service Provider,
117

117

00:07:29.920  -->  00:07:33.260
which is a company you most likely pay a monthly fee to
118

118

00:07:33.260  -->  00:07:39.360
that is in charge of acting as a hub between 
all of the devices and cables in your local area.
119

119

00:07:39.360  -->  00:07:43.130
From there, it transfers it to your home, 
first through the modem,
120

120

00:07:43.130  -->  00:07:45.830
and then through the router to get to the right device.
121

121

00:07:45.830  -->  00:07:49.970
And it does all of that, what I just 
described, in well under a second.
122

122

00:07:49.970  -->  00:07:53.200
I'm really sorry if that was boring or tedious, but guess what?
123

123

00:07:53.200  -->  00:07:55.950
You never have to learn that again, because now you know.
124

124

00:07:55.950  -->  00:07:58.350
Next lecture, we're going to add more 
layers to our understanding
125

125

00:07:58.350  -->  00:08:03.580
and start getting into how servers and computers 
know where to send and request their information.
126

126

00:08:03.580  -->  00:08:06.650
If you're not excited by that, well, you're ...normal.
127

127

00:08:06.650  -->  00:08:07.850
All right, see you then!
