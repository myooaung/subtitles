00:00:00,080  -->  00:00:04,540
Hey guys, welcome to the obligatory 
course overview lecture.
2

2

00:00:04,540  -->  00:00:08,640
Let's talk real briefly about what 
we're going to cover in this course.
3

3

00:00:08,640  -->  00:00:12,110
All right, in section one, we're going to 
go way back in time to finally
4

4

00:00:12,110  -->  00:00:16,290
understand the thing you've been trying 
so hard to ignore - your computer.
5

5

00:00:16,290  -->  00:00:19,450
We'll learn about machine code, 
why The Matrix predicted
6

6

00:00:19,450  -->  00:00:22,930
everything we experience today, 
why your mom can't figure out
7

7

00:00:22,930  -->  00:00:26,590
how to use Windows, let alone that 
penguin thing, Red Hat Linux,
8

8

00:00:26,590  -->  00:00:30,250
and how two thieves with oversized glasses 
changed computers forever.
9

9

00:00:30,250  -->  00:00:32,460
In section two, we're going to cover 
how the internet works,
10

10

00:00:32,460  -->  00:00:38,290
why Al Gore invented it, and how is it that 
browsers and websites actually work.
11

11

00:00:38,290  -->  00:00:41,930
Section three, we're off to understand how 
tech stacks resemble sandwiches,
12

12

00:00:41,930  -->  00:00:46,570
what front-end and back-end programming 
entails, and lastly,
13

13

00:00:46,570  -->  00:00:50,700
what are the most common languages 
people learn, besides French.
14

14

00:00:50,700  -->  00:00:54,820
Section four, I'm going to ever so gently 
hold your hand and
15

15

00:00:54,820  -->  00:00:58,800
start to dip our toes into the 
basic concepts of programming.
16

16

00:00:58,800  -->  00:01:03,000
Section five, we're going to explain 
the ever-increasingly important
17

17

00:01:03,000  -->  00:01:08,000
concept of the API, and then we're going to 
tackle the great trio of confusion:
18

18

00:01:08,000  -->  00:01:11,300
frameworks, libraries, and integrated 
development environments.
19

19

00:01:11,300  -->  00:01:14,300
Section six, we're going to tackle 
content management systems,
20

20

00:01:14,300  -->  00:01:18,000
how WordPress is the lord of the internet, 
and the reason why
21

21

00:01:18,000  -->  00:01:22,000
Shopify, SquareSpace, and Weebly 
are why we can't have nice things.
22

22

00:01:22,000  -->  00:01:25,150
Section seven, we're going to cover 
advanced concepts worth knowing,
23

23

00:01:25,150  -->  00:01:30,000
like object oriented programming, 
model view controller paradigms,
24

24

00:01:30,000  -->  00:01:33,400
continuous integration, GIT commits, 
and a whole bunch of other
25

25

00:01:33,400  -->  00:01:36,400
things that will make you feel really smart
26

26

00:01:36,400  -->  00:01:37,600
...or really stupid.
27

27

00:01:37,600  -->  00:01:39,700
Section eight, we're going to talk 
about all the tech trends
28

28

00:01:39,700  -->  00:01:43,950
and what's happening nowadays with 
the cool kids: responsive design,
29

29

00:01:43,950  -->  00:01:48,150
platform as a service technology like 
PARS, full stack JavaScript,
30

30

00:01:48,150  -->  00:01:50,800
hybrid apps, SWIFT, and drugs.
31

31

00:01:50,800  -->  00:01:54,100
Section nine, we're going to wrap up 
by going to talk about,
32

32

00:01:54,100  -->  00:01:58,000
for those of you who want to learn how to program,
33

33

00:01:58,000  -->  00:02:01,000
how do you pick what to learn, 
where do you go to start.
34

34

00:02:01,000  -->  00:02:03,000
And for those of you who do not 
want to learn how to program
35

35

00:02:03,000  -->  00:02:07,600
and instead want to hire programmers, 
we'll also cover where you can
36

36

00:02:07,600  -->  00:02:11,000
go to spam the people we were just 
previously talking about.
37

37

00:02:11,000  -->  00:02:14,500
All right, guys, I hope that gets you excited, 
and if it doesn't, well...
38

38

00:02:14,500  -->  00:02:17,700
this is awkward, because we're moving 
on to the next lecture.
39

39

00:02:17,700  -->  00:02:18,200
See you then!
