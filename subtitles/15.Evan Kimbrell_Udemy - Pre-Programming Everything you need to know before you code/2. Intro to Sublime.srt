00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,030
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
2

2

00:00:02,030  -->  00:00:05,670
Hey, so I want to take a quick bit to explain to you very quickly
3

3

00:00:05,670  -->  00:00:08,540
how it is that in the next lectures we're going to preview
4

4

00:00:08,540  -->  00:00:10,500
the code that we're going to talk about.
5

5

00:00:10,500  -->  00:00:14,640
So when you program, you are going to use, and this is a concept
6

6

00:00:14,640  -->  00:00:17,820
that we'll learn later in the course, but it's going to be
7

7

00:00:17,820  -->  00:00:23,690
something called a text editor, or let's call it an 
IDE - integrated development environment.
8

8

00:00:23,690  -->  00:00:27,310
So, in this case, we're going to stick with text editor, because
9

9

00:00:27,310  -->  00:00:30,730
that's usually what people write their programs in.
10

10

00:00:30,730  -->  00:00:36,220
Some people out there are hardcore and don't 
use text editors, they just use text documents.
11

11

00:00:36,220  -->  00:00:38,000
Those people are crazy, we're not going to do that.
12

12

00:00:38,000  -->  00:00:41,080
So, the easiest way of getting to a point where you can kind of
13

13

00:00:41,080  -->  00:00:45,820
follow along and play with it is just go to sublimetext.com.
14

14

00:00:45,820  -->  00:00:51,980
Very popular text editor, it's free as we currently speak,
15

15

00:00:51,980  -->  00:00:54,430
I don't know in the future if they're going to start charging.
16

16

00:00:54,430  -->  00:00:57,790
I know for a fact that the version you can download right now,
17

17

00:00:57,790  -->  00:01:01,690
they will constantly bug you about paying, but you don't actually have to pay,
18

18

00:01:01,690  -->  00:01:03,470
you can just keep clicking out of the thing.
19

19

00:01:03,470  -->  00:01:05,700
So you go to sublimetext.com, this is what it looks like.
20

20

00:01:05,700  -->  00:01:11,400
It's just a big black window, and it allows you to type in, and what it'll do is
21

21

00:01:11,400  -->  00:01:17,630
it'll color code, it'll help you organize your programming thoughts, basically,
22

22

00:01:17,630  -->  00:01:21,880
it'll allow you to preview what you're making, it'll even allow you to
23

23

00:01:21,880  -->  00:01:25,380
write in the same document in two separate areas at the same time.
24

24

00:01:25,380  -->  00:01:27,450
These are all things you don't have to concern yourself with, but
25

25

00:01:27,450  -->  00:01:29,360
it's helpful to understand why people use these.
26

26

00:01:29,360  -->  00:01:32,620
So just go down and say download for whatever.
27

27

00:01:32,620  -->  00:01:35,390
If you guys are on Windows, they have a version as well,
28

28

00:01:35,390  -->  00:01:39,200
so what you're seeing right now should say "Download for Windows."
29

29

00:01:39,200  -->  00:01:44,840
Once you download it, then you can just open it up, 
and it typically just looks like this,
30

30

00:01:47,230  -->  00:01:49,710
and you can pretty much play with it from there.
31

31

00:01:49,710  -->  00:01:54,350
So when I type in here, it's basically going to treat this like code.
32

32

00:01:54,350  -->  00:01:57,120
Down here, I can tell it what type of code I am writing in,
33

33

00:01:57,120  -->  00:02:01,060
so, you know, let's say I wanted to make something HTML,
34

34

00:02:01,060  -->  00:02:06,220
you would just say, so HTML is separated into three different sections,
35

35

00:02:06,220  -->  00:02:07,900
you have a head, a body, and a footer.
36

36

00:02:07,900  -->  00:02:09,560
It doesn't even matter, you don't need to know this,
37

37

00:02:09,560  -->  00:02:16,910
but I could just say, like, "Hello world," I can exit out of it,
38

38

00:02:16,910  -->  00:02:20,350
remember those tags that we learned when we talked about HTML.
39

39

00:02:20,350  -->  00:02:26,750
So right there, what it's going to say is, "I want this text, 
"Hello world," to display in header 1,"
40

40

00:02:26,750  -->  00:02:33,530
which is a really old way of saying moderately 
large text, I mean it's like size 28 or something.
41

41

00:02:33,530  -->  00:02:37,560
And then what you can do is go up here and say File - Save As.
42

42

00:02:37,560  -->  00:02:42,060
I suggest you just save it to your desktop, that's the easiest way of finding this,
43

43

00:02:42,060  -->  00:02:45,900
and then acting on it, so save it as Index.html.
44

44

00:02:45,900  -->  00:02:49,550
Remember, we learned about this, this is the first file that any time
45

45

00:02:49,550  -->  00:02:52,900
you access a website, your browser is going to initially just go to.
46

46

00:02:52,900  -->  00:02:55,210
I've already created it, so we have it right there. Great.
47

47

00:02:55,210  -->  00:02:59,550
Now that it knows its HTML, and you can 
change it over here, it actually color codes for me.
48

48

00:02:59,550  -->  00:03:04,440
So, if I wanted to say like, this was in the head section,
49

49

00:03:04,440  -->  00:03:10,030
see how it automatically will tell me, it will finish the text for me,
50

50

00:03:10,030  -->  00:03:13,000
so I don't have to type that out.
51

51

00:03:13,000  -->  00:03:18,130
So, and then, we save it, Command + S, you guys are Control + S.
52

52

00:03:18,130  -->  00:03:19,160
Oh, would you like to purchase?
53

53

00:03:19,160  -->  00:03:21,310
No, I would not. Ok, great.
54

54

00:03:21,310  -->  00:03:25,000
Now what that has done for me is it's saved it on the desktop right here,
55

55

00:03:25,000  -->  00:03:31,250
and what I want to do if I want to view it is I can just open it in Chrome.
56

56

00:03:31,250  -->  00:03:34,450
Right, there you go. Hello world, right?
57

57

00:03:34,450  -->  00:03:37,720
So that's how we create a little quick feedback loop.
58

58

00:03:37,720  -->  00:03:42,160
So I can write here, and then every single time I want to update it,
59

59

00:03:42,160  -->  00:03:48,470
I can just go back to my browser, and then... So if I save that,
60

60

00:03:48,470  -->  00:03:50,840
go back to my browser and literally just refresh the page.
61

61

00:03:50,840  -->  00:03:52,940
There you go, ok? That's how I change it.
62

62

00:03:52,940  -->  00:03:55,370
It gets a little bit more complicated than that, but don't worry.
63

63

00:03:55,370  -->  00:04:00,770
If you want to follow along, go and download 
Sublime, and we can do it together,
64

64

00:04:00,770  -->  00:04:03,420
otherwise you can just watch me, doesn't really matter.
65

65

00:04:03,420  -->  00:04:05,020
All right guys, see you in the next lecture!
