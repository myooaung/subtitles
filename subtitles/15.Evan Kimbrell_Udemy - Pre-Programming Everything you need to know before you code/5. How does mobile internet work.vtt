00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:02.170
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
2

2

00:00:02.170  -->  00:00:07.580
Ok, so we have a basic understanding of 
how the sausage of the internet is made.
3

3

00:00:07.580  -->  00:00:12.570
Great. But since we're living in a world 
dominated by mobile operating systems
4

4

00:00:12.570  -->  00:00:15.920
and mobile platforms now, I thought 
I'd take a second to just deviate
5

5

00:00:15.920  -->  00:00:19.570
and talk a little bit about the mechanics of the mobile internet.
6

6

00:00:19.570  -->  00:00:23.160
Again, this stuff is really worth knowing, 
because you inevitably will work on
7

7

00:00:23.160  -->  00:00:28.700
some type of mobile use case, and mobile 
use cases are almost always dominated
8

8

00:00:28.700  -->  00:00:32.830
by a handful of issues stemming from how exactly they work.
9

9

00:00:32.830  -->  00:00:36.800
The first thing that you need to 
understand about mobile internet is that
10

10

00:00:36.800  -->  00:00:39.940
the easiest way of thinking about it is just think about it
11

11

00:00:39.940  -->  00:00:43.640
like a computer with a really small screen that sometimes rings.
12

12

00:00:43.640  -->  00:00:46.880
Your smartphone is the exact same as the client
13

13

00:00:46.880  -->  00:00:50.920
that we were talking about before to describe your computer.
14

14

00:00:50.920  -->  00:00:54.830
But how does getting information to your phone differ from
15

15

00:00:54.830  -->  00:00:57.390
getting information directly to your computer?
16

16

00:00:57.390  -->  00:00:58.730
Well, dun dun dun...
17

17

00:00:58.730  -->  00:01:01.060
There's actually just a couple more steps.
18

18

00:01:01.060  -->  00:01:05.600
Remember how we talked about routers and 
how their sole job is to route connections
19

19

00:01:05.600  -->  00:01:08.940
to a modem and then to an Internet Service Provider?
20

20

00:01:08.940  -->  00:01:14.600
Well, it essentially works like that, but 
instead of a crappy Chinese manufactured box
21

21

00:01:14.600  -->  00:01:18.920
with blinking lights, it's a 400-foot tall cell tower directly
22

22

00:01:18.920  -->  00:01:21.550
in the way of your apartment's amazing view.
23

23

00:01:21.550  -->  00:01:26.550
Cell phones have two ways of getting 
the data they need: WiFi and cell service.
24

24

00:01:26.550  -->  00:01:30.860
WiFi only works within a certain range, 
and unfortunately the technology
25

25

00:01:30.860  -->  00:01:35.100
to have mile-wide WiFi just doesn't exist yet.
26

26

00:01:35.100  -->  00:01:37.630
Maybe one of you guys listening can invent that.
27

27

00:01:37.630  -->  00:01:41.140
Cell service, on the other hand, has 
to play an entirely different game.
28

28

00:01:41.140  -->  00:01:45.900
It has to use an entirely different package 
exchanging protocol, and something
29

29

00:01:45.900  -->  00:01:50.580
that specifically works over long 
distances, hence the cell towers.
30

30

00:01:50.580  -->  00:01:52.480
Who owns these cell towers?
31

31

00:01:52.480  -->  00:01:59.020
Well, usually it's the phone companies, who in 
this instance act as your Internet Service Provider.
32

32

00:01:59.020  -->  00:02:03.030
Verizon, for instance, offers cell service and home internet service,
33

33

00:02:03.030  -->  00:02:07.730
they actually own the infrastructure for both, 
and both systems use the same connections.
34

34

00:02:07.730  -->  00:02:10.950
The one other link in this chain we're missing is effectively
35

35

00:02:10.950  -->  00:02:14.570
what you can think of as the modem for mobile phones.
36

36

00:02:14.570  -->  00:02:19.240
The radio tower, remember, just acts 
as the router, getting you the signal
37

37

00:02:19.240  -->  00:02:23.040
and organizing your requests from the requests of other people.
38

38

00:02:23.040  -->  00:02:27.080
Now, the modem in this situation it's 
actually what's called the gateway server.
39

39

00:02:27.080  -->  00:02:31.200
Much like the modem in your home, 
which converts that coaxial data (remember?)
40

40

00:02:31.200  -->  00:02:33.650
into some form of data your computer can understand,
41

41

00:02:33.650  -->  00:02:38.250
the gateway server converts data into 
a language your phone can understand,
42

42

00:02:38.250  -->  00:02:42.800
and that language is called WAP or Wireless Application Protocol.
43

43

00:02:42.800  -->  00:02:45.070
Do you need to know the details? No, not really.
44

44

00:02:45.070  -->  00:02:51.270
Just know that WAP is a protocol optimized 
for phones and for transfer over radio waves.
45

45

00:02:51.270  -->  00:02:54.380
When you run into issues with data 
coming through in the wrong way,
46

46

00:02:54.380  -->  00:02:57.540
chances are there might be an issue with your gateway server.
47

47

00:02:57.540  -->  00:03:02.900
If you also tried to unlock an iPhone, 
and you have a CDMA service,
48

48

00:03:02.900  -->  00:03:07.100
and you're trying to use that other one, 
and it doesn't work, well, that's because
49

49

00:03:07.100  -->  00:03:13.600
CDMA is an example of a web access protocol, 
it's different than the other one.
50

50

00:03:13.600  -->  00:03:18.300
Some phones can actually only understand CDMA, 
and some can understand the other one,
51

51

00:03:18.300  -->  00:03:19.770
and some can actually understand both.
52

52

00:03:19.770  -->  00:03:22.730
So, all right. So that is the basics of how mobile internet works.
53

53

00:03:22.730  -->  00:03:25.240
Same structure, just different pieces.
54

54

00:03:25.240  -->  00:03:26.700
What else do you want to know?
55

55

00:03:26.700  -->  00:03:29.700
Well, since phones are essentially computers that access
56

56

00:03:29.700  -->  00:03:33.220
the internet in a very similar way, do they have IP addresses?
57

57

00:03:33.220  -->  00:03:35.450
"Interesting question, Evan," I ask myself.
58

58

00:03:35.450  -->  00:03:37.310
Yes, they actually do.
59

59

00:03:37.310  -->  00:03:40.720
You can connect to someone's phone directly through their IP address,
60

60

00:03:40.720  -->  00:03:42.960
assuming they're connected to the internet.
61

61

00:03:42.960  -->  00:03:44.230
Go have fun with that.
62

62

00:03:44.230  -->  00:03:46.260
All right, do we know how the mobile internet works?
63

63

00:03:46.260  -->  00:03:48.390
I think so. Check it off the list.
64

64

00:03:48.390  -->  00:03:49.370
See you in the next lecture!
