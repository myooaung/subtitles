00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,040
All right guys, welcome back to the course.
2

2

00:00:02,040  -->  00:00:06,060
Next up, we're going to look at back-end 
languages, i.e. languages that are used
3

3

00:00:06,060  -->  00:00:10,150
to run on the server and service the website 
or web app that you're using.
4

4

00:00:10,150  -->  00:00:15,000
Back-end languages are the unsung 
heroes and bear the lion's share
5

5

00:00:15,000  -->  00:00:17,660
of complexity when it comes to creating an application.
6

6

00:00:17,660  -->  00:00:21,900
Someone who primarily studies and 
masters these back-end languages
7

7

00:00:21,900  -->  00:00:25,720
with a moderate knowledge of the 
front-end languages we just covered
8

8

00:00:25,720  -->  00:00:28,730
is what we traditionally will call a software engineer.
9

9

00:00:28,730  -->  00:00:33,070
If you look at any boot camp, and it says "software engineering,"
10

10

00:00:33,070  -->  00:00:35,810
guess what you're probably going to be learning?
11

11

00:00:35,810  -->  00:00:38,840
It's probably a back-end web language, like PHP or Python,
12

12

00:00:38,840  -->  00:00:42,710
or you're going to learn multipurpose languages that could work
13

13

00:00:42,710  -->  00:00:45,750
on both websites and desktop operating systems.
14

14

00:00:45,750  -->  00:00:49,590
These guys get paid the big bucks 
and are generally the ones that focus on
15

15

00:00:49,590  -->  00:00:52,060
difficult challenges the web team faces.
16

16

00:00:52,060  -->  00:00:54,560
That's not to undermine the front-end work, which is difficult
17

17

00:00:54,560  -->  00:00:59,900
in its own way, but is generally speaking less work than the back-end.
18

18

00:00:59,900  -->  00:01:02,310
It's not uncommon that building an application takes
19

19

00:01:02,310  -->  00:01:07,170
15 hours of work on the front-end and 80 plus on the back-end.
20

20

00:01:07,170  -->  00:01:10,810
After all, front-end just dictates the paint that's on the house,
21

21

00:01:10,810  -->  00:01:14,480
back-end is everything that is in the house.
22

22

00:01:14,480  -->  00:01:18,050
All right, next lecture we're going to start 
with Python, one of my favorites.
23

23

00:01:18,050  -->  00:01:18,850
All right, see you then!
