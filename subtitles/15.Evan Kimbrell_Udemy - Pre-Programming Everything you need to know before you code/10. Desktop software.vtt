00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:01.170
Hey guys, welcome back.
2

2

00:00:01.170  -->  00:00:06.530
All right, so everything we have covered thus far, 
and it's really about 25 years or so
3

3

00:00:06.530  -->  00:00:10.710
of technological advancements, and we 
covered it in, like, 25 minutes,
4

4

00:00:10.710  -->  00:00:15.830
has led up to this point, the point where 
we finally become masters of that
5

5

00:00:15.830  -->  00:00:19.810
metallic beast that we own, and can finally start using them
6

6

00:00:19.810  -->  00:00:22.750
for ever increasing amounts of use cases.
7

7

00:00:22.750  -->  00:00:27.260
And the reason we can use that box 
for an increasing amount of use cases
8

8

00:00:27.260  -->  00:00:30.760
is due to the development of 
what we call desktop software.
9

9

00:00:30.760  -->  00:00:35.060
Now, what do I mean by this 
concept of "desktop software"?
10

10

00:00:35.060  -->  00:00:38.130
Well, we've already established 
what software is, remember?
11

11

00:00:38.130  -->  00:00:44.310
If you weren't actually paying attention, 
you have hardware, i.e. the hard actual pieces
12

12

00:00:44.310  -->  00:00:49.480
of your computer, like the motherboard, 
the processor, the RAM, the housing etc.,
13

13

00:00:49.480  -->  00:00:55.150
and then anything that's built and runs on 
or within this hardware system is called software.
14

14

00:00:55.150  -->  00:00:58.950
It's soft, well, because, I think it's because 
it doesn't exist in physical space.
15

15

00:00:58.950  -->  00:01:02.990
I mean, well, it technically does, 
but you only interact with it
16

16

00:01:02.990  -->  00:01:05.230
within the operations of the hardware setup.
17

17

00:01:05.230  -->  00:01:08.530
Desktop is actually just a term used to 
coin your computer's operating system.
18

18

00:01:08.530  -->  00:01:12.850
Technically, when you first see 
your operating system, you know,
19

19

00:01:12.850  -->  00:01:15.970
it will have that blank space where you 
have your background image - mine is,
20

20

00:01:15.970  -->  00:01:20.080
I think it's a bear taking a phone call, 
don't ask why - well, that's kind of similar, I guess,
21

21

00:01:20.080  -->  00:01:26.250
to how your desk looks, because you put things 
on your desk, and then you can access them.
22

22

00:01:26.250  -->  00:01:28.950
Specifically, you can put pieces of paper and folders.
23

23

00:01:28.950  -->  00:01:33.520
Now, remember, when they came up 
with this set of names, this was back
24

24

00:01:33.520  -->  00:01:37.590
when computers were still a novelty, and the 
rest of the world was in fact using paper.
25

25

00:01:37.590  -->  00:01:43.380
Ok, well, any application or self-contained 
script, or series of logic that runs
26

26

00:01:43.380  -->  00:01:47.970
within your operating system is going to be 
referred to as desktop software.
27

27

00:01:47.970  -->  00:01:51.200
You can usually go to your desktop and just open it.
28

28

00:01:51.200  -->  00:01:52.830
That's, you know, desktop software.
29

29

00:01:52.830  -->  00:01:55.440
Let's start from scratch so we can visualize this.
30

30

00:01:55.440  -->  00:02:00.000
When we boot up our computers, 
we have what's called an operating system,
31

31

00:02:00.000  -->  00:02:01.920
which effectively does two things.
32

32

00:02:01.920  -->  00:02:06.490
One, it simplifies the process of using 
a computer by letting you visually select
33

33

00:02:06.490  -->  00:02:10.160
and manipulate the files and things you need to use.
34

34

00:02:10.160  -->  00:02:14.400
The second thing it does is it translates 
everything you do, and save,
35

35

00:02:14.400  -->  00:02:18.580
and send back down to the lowest level of 
code that your computer can understand,
36

36

00:02:18.580  -->  00:02:23.740
called machine code, so that the angry beast 
can actually do something with its hardware.
37

37

00:02:23.740  -->  00:02:30.410
Fun fact: why is it that video games can only be 
played on just Windows or just Macintosh OS?
38

38

00:02:30.410  -->  00:02:36.250
Well, it's because computers that run 
these operating systems are actually different
39

39

00:02:36.250  -->  00:02:38.490
and have different machine code.
40

40

00:02:38.490  -->  00:02:43.490
Mac OS translates to one machine code 
language and Windows to another.
41

41

00:02:43.490  -->  00:02:49.400
So if I wanted to make a game for both, I would 
effectively have to write that application twice.
42

42

00:02:49.400  -->  00:02:52.430
Why the two computers accept 
different types of machine code?
43

43

00:02:52.430  -->  00:02:54.600
I don't know, we don't ask these questions.
44

44

00:02:54.600  -->  00:02:58.840
Now, within the operating system that 
we just kind of recapped is the ability to
45

45

00:02:58.840  -->  00:03:04.280
make little miniature operating systems or what we 
call applications that serve different functions.
46

46

00:03:04.280  -->  00:03:08.880
A browser, or your Skype application, or a mail client,
47

47

00:03:08.880  -->  00:03:11.850
these are all examples of these smaller applications.
48

48

00:03:11.850  -->  00:03:16.460
Now, you have to think about this almost 
like one of those little Russian doll things.
49

49

00:03:16.460  -->  00:03:19.190
You know those dolls that have progressively smaller
50

50

00:03:19.190  -->  00:03:21.430
versions of themselves inside of themselves.
51

51

00:03:21.430  -->  00:03:22.730
It's kind of like that.
52

52

00:03:22.730  -->  00:03:25.770
Within the hardware of your computer runs an operating system,
53

53

00:03:25.770  -->  00:03:28.540
within the operating system runs desktop software.
54

54

00:03:28.540  -->  00:03:32.570
In order for these three layers to work, 
they must be able to all communicate
55

55

00:03:32.570  -->  00:03:34.610
with the system it's enclosed in.
56

56

00:03:34.610  -->  00:03:38.450
Desktop software communicates in a specific 
high level programming language
57

57

00:03:38.450  -->  00:03:43.020
to its operating system, which then 
relays this information and translates,
58

58

00:03:43.020  -->  00:03:47.290
interprets it down to machine code 
for the hardware to take action on.
59

59

00:03:47.290  -->  00:03:51.490
Typically, then the hardware will send a signal 
back up to the operating system,
60

60

00:03:51.490  -->  00:03:55.930
saying maybe "Yes, I did that thing you asked," 
and the operating system will then
61

61

00:03:55.930  -->  00:03:59.470
translate that again back into 
high level code, and pass it back up,
62

62

00:03:59.470  -->  00:04:01.070
and then your application can respond.
63

63

00:04:01.070  -->  00:04:04.340
It's important to think about these concepts as layers.
64

64

00:04:04.340  -->  00:04:09.240
Hardware sits at the bottom, and then 
the operating systems sit at the top,
65

65

00:04:09.240  -->  00:04:12.380
then desktop software sits on top of that.
66

66

00:04:12.380  -->  00:04:16.850
And now, if you think that is confusing, that three layer pie, well,
67

67

00:04:16.850  -->  00:04:21.290
you're going to have a rough ride, because 
we're going to add at least five more layers.
68

68

00:04:21.290  -->  00:04:25.100
One other concept worth understanding 
at this point is that there was a point in time
69

69

00:04:25.100  -->  00:04:29.400
where operating systems just helped you navigate your hardware
70

70

00:04:29.400  -->  00:04:34.600
and any function or tool you could use 
or had access to was actually created
71

71

00:04:34.600  -->  00:04:37.710
by the company that made the operating system itself.
72

72

00:04:37.710  -->  00:04:41.280
If anyone remembers the old days of Mac OS, they tried to
73

73

00:04:41.280  -->  00:04:44.410
control almost all the applications they had on the system.
74

74

00:04:44.410  -->  00:04:48.350
Apple made the mail app, it made the clock app, 
it made the calendar app.
75

75

00:04:48.350  -->  00:04:52.700
Ironically, this is still the case today, 
but since, they've opened up, and at least
76

76

00:04:52.700  -->  00:04:57.320
given you the option to, say, download 
a different version of your mail app.
77

77

00:04:57.320  -->  00:05:00.160
By doing this, they became what we call a "platform."
78

78

00:05:00.160  -->  00:05:06.000
Now, literally, a platform is something you stand on, 
and in the computer world it means
79

79

00:05:06.000  -->  00:05:09.970
creating a software environment where 
anyone else can make something
80

80

00:05:09.970  -->  00:05:14.340
that runs within your operating system 
and then distribute it to other users.
81

81

00:05:14.340  -->  00:05:19.360
So, within your little Russian doll metaphor, 
anyone that wants to can make
82

82

00:05:19.360  -->  00:05:21.580
their own doll and stick it in there.
83

83

00:05:21.580  -->  00:05:24.990
I think I've kind of exhausted that metaphor, 
but you get the point.
84

84

00:05:24.990  -->  00:05:29.530
Now, the idea of platform-izing operating 
systems really wasn't actually a thing
85

85

00:05:29.530  -->  00:05:32.830
until sometime in the 90s, and before that,
86

86

00:05:32.830  -->  00:05:37.670
we really did not see the explosion 
we see today in computer usage.
87

87

00:05:37.670  -->  00:05:38.770
Think of it like this.
88

88

00:05:38.770  -->  00:05:42.840
Remember when the iPhone came out 
and everyone thought it was interesting,
89

89

00:05:42.840  -->  00:05:47.780
but they also thought that it had virtually 
no apps, and virtually no uses,
90

90

00:05:47.780  -->  00:05:50.850
so no one really went out of their way to buy it?
91

91

00:05:50.850  -->  00:05:56.080
At the advent of desktop software, that's the 
same cross section where computers were at.
92

92

00:05:56.080  -->  00:05:59.990
People kind of got the possibility 
that these computers were opening up,
93

93

00:05:59.990  -->  00:06:03.910
but as of yet, they had not realized its possibilities,
94

94

00:06:03.910  -->  00:06:06.660
because of a lack of an application ecosystem.
95

95

00:06:06.660  -->  00:06:10.230
These companies that made the operating 
systems could only make so many applications.
96

96

00:06:10.230  -->  00:06:12.400
Nowadays though, everything is a platform.
97

97

00:06:12.400  -->  00:06:17.540
Your phone is a platform, your watch is a platform, 
your TV is a platform, believe it or not.
98

98

00:06:17.540  -->  00:06:23.310
I even saw, there was a refrigerator the other day 
that lets you install third party apps
99

99

00:06:23.310  -->  00:06:25.510
...for your refrigerator.
100

100

00:06:25.510  -->  00:06:28.950
Ok, let's recap it, although this 
was a short lecture (just joking).
101

101

00:06:28.950  -->  00:06:32.320
After the operating system came along, 
there was a need to use computers
102

102

00:06:32.320  -->  00:06:36.250
in many different ways, and there 
was really no limit to human creativity
103

103

00:06:36.250  -->  00:06:38.030
when it came to different things you could do.
104

104

00:06:38.030  -->  00:06:43.240
Once operating systems became a platform, 
so to speak, we saw desktop applications
105

105

00:06:43.240  -->  00:06:46.780
- and, remember, desktop applications, when 
we say that we're referring to applications
106

106

00:06:46.780  -->  00:06:51.940
that run from your desktop - we saw 
more and more people kind of piling in
107

107

00:06:51.940  -->  00:06:55.720
on the computer technology train, 
and creating their own applications.
108

108

00:06:55.720  -->  00:06:58.950
On a technical level, desktop software 
is written in a high level code
109

109

00:06:58.950  -->  00:07:01.250
that sends this code to your operating system,
110

110

00:07:01.250  -->  00:07:04.390
which acts as a relay and an interpreter with your hardware.
111

111

00:07:04.390  -->  00:07:09.360
And so, finally you understand on a technical level 
how that game Minesweeper really works.
112

112

00:07:09.360  -->  00:07:11.430
What other questions could you possibly have?
113

113

00:07:11.430  -->  00:07:13.950
All right guys, see you in the next section!
