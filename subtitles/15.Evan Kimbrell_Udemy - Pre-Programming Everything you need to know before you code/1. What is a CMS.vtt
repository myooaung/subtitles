00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:01.970
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
2

2

00:00:01.970  -->  00:00:04.270
In this section, we're going to tackle the concept of
3

3

00:00:04.270  -->  00:00:08.870
Content Management Systems, also known as CMS.
4

4

00:00:08.870  -->  00:00:11.920
It's a term and a type of system that you simply...
5

5

00:00:11.920  -->  00:00:13.920
you're really not going to escape this.
6

6

00:00:13.920  -->  00:00:17.390
If you work pretty much anywhere on the web... ever,
7

7

00:00:17.390  -->  00:00:20.520
you're going to have to interact with one of these things.
8

8

00:00:20.520  -->  00:00:24.140
So writers, they post their writing through them,
9

9

00:00:24.140  -->  00:00:28.000
web developers, they spend all day pretty much customizing them,
10

10

00:00:28.000  -->  00:00:31.800
and software engineers, they install them and build plugins for them.
11

11

00:00:31.800  -->  00:00:32.770
So what are we talking about?
12

12

00:00:32.770  -->  00:00:36.130
A content management system is an application that helps you
13

13

00:00:36.130  -->  00:00:40.280
as a website owner or a website developer - you guessed it
14

14

00:00:40.280  -->  00:00:41.750
- well, manage your content.
15

15

00:00:41.750  -->  00:00:46.210
Fair warning, the word "content" is probably the most vague term
16

16

00:00:46.210  -->  00:00:49.750
ever devised in the history of the internet.
17

17

00:00:49.750  -->  00:00:55.170
Your uncle's vaguely racist Facebook 
post about immigrants - well, that's content.
18

18

00:00:55.170  -->  00:01:01.200
A blog post telling people the top 10 things to do in Paris, that is content,
19

19

00:01:01.200  -->  00:01:04.160
even though you can find it on 1,000 other blogs.
20

20

00:01:04.160  -->  00:01:08.340
Any infographic, let's say, explaining the top five productivity tips
21

21

00:01:08.340  -->  00:01:15.110
used by the world's richest people - almost entirely contrived and 100% content.
22

22

00:01:15.110  -->  00:01:19.320
Content just means anything you as the owner create and put online.
23

23

00:01:19.320  -->  00:01:24.790
Typically we think of blogs, posts, images, graphs, PDFs,
24

24

00:01:24.790  -->  00:01:29.260
guides, instructional videos like this to be content.
25

25

00:01:29.260  -->  00:01:35.060
Important distinction here is that we're talking 
about the site owner or the site contributor.
26

26

00:01:35.060  -->  00:01:37.780
Someone who posts angry comments on YouTube,
27

27

00:01:37.780  -->  00:01:42.410
which is what I think YouTube is exclusively used for nowadays,
28

28

00:01:42.410  -->  00:01:44.810
that's not technically creating content.
29

29

00:01:44.810  -->  00:01:49.520
The idea here is that any piece of content has some sort of value to it
30

30

00:01:49.520  -->  00:01:51.520
and can be treated as an asset.
31

31

00:01:51.520  -->  00:01:55.320
It might be an asset with barely any obvious worth,
32

32

00:01:55.320  -->  00:02:00.920
such as everything posted ever by Business Insider or Vox.com,
33

33

00:02:00.920  -->  00:02:03.360
but it is still content nonetheless.
34

34

00:02:03.360  -->  00:02:07.530
When the first websites started popping up, what were they used for?
35

35

00:02:07.530  -->  00:02:10.170
Well, sharing research information.
36

36

00:02:10.170  -->  00:02:12.940
That information was the world's first online content.
37

37

00:02:12.940  -->  00:02:17.700
Ok, well, in the meantime, millions of people have tried to post millions of things
38

38

00:02:17.700  -->  00:02:20.690
and if you're starting from absolute scratch,
39

39

00:02:20.690  -->  00:02:25.180
well, there's a lot you have to do that has absolutely nothing to do
40

40

00:02:25.180  -->  00:02:29.320
with creating the content you so want to share with the world.
41

41

00:02:29.320  -->  00:02:36.630
Let's say I wanted to make a site that posts 
my favorite cooking recipes in a pre-CMS world.
42

42

00:02:36.630  -->  00:02:40.170
I would have to make a page that listed out my recipes.
43

43

00:02:40.170  -->  00:02:43.980
It would need things like a logo, a navigation bar,
44

44

00:02:43.980  -->  00:02:48.900
a place to display my content, a way of formatting everything
45

45

00:02:48.900  -->  00:02:53.950
that fits on all sorts of different screen sizes and mobile screens even,
46

46

00:02:53.950  -->  00:02:58.780
a way to share things with readers, maybe even a way to comment
47

47

00:02:58.780  -->  00:03:03.250
and engage with the people who read what you just posted.
48

48

00:03:03.250  -->  00:03:06.220
The list really just goes on and on. You'd have to build a lot.
49

49

00:03:06.220  -->  00:03:12.220
But if in order to publish just a simple site 
of recipes I had to build all of that from scratch,
50

50

00:03:12.220  -->  00:03:16.390
then, well, number one, sites would look ridiculously basic, and
51

51

00:03:16.390  -->  00:03:19.400
number two, not very many people would create websites
52

52

00:03:19.400  -->  00:03:23.230
because the barrier to creating them would be way too high.
53

53

00:03:23.230  -->  00:03:27.650
That perfectly describes the world of the internet in the mid-1990s,
54

54

00:03:27.650  -->  00:03:32.060
back when Google didn't exist so you couldn't ever find anything
55

55

00:03:32.060  -->  00:03:35.320
and every site looked pretty much like Oregon Trail.
56

56

00:03:35.320  -->  00:03:36.300
Remember that game?
57

57

00:03:36.300  -->  00:03:37.250
So that was the setup.
58

58

00:03:37.250  -->  00:03:41.000
The stage was set and there was clearly a need for something better,
59

59

00:03:41.000  -->  00:03:47.090
and thus content management systems were born - big honking massive applications
60

60

00:03:47.090  -->  00:03:51.730
that could be installed on a web server and then let a website owner create
61

61

00:03:51.730  -->  00:03:58.110
and manage their website through intuitive 
and non-programmatic administration panels.
62

62

00:03:58.110  -->  00:04:01.770
Now, instead of coding from scratch every single blog post,
63

63

00:04:01.770  -->  00:04:05.780
you could login to your CMS and click on the "blog" tab,
64

64

00:04:05.780  -->  00:04:08.980
and then write in a rich text editor your blog piece.
65

65

00:04:08.980  -->  00:04:12.280
You could edit it right there, you could format it right there,
66

66

00:04:12.280  -->  00:04:15.430
you could add photos, and then you 
could publish, and the system would take care
67

67

00:04:15.430  -->  00:04:20.700
of making the images and text display correctly on all devices and screens.
68

68

00:04:20.700  -->  00:04:26.600
And that's not all that CMS's handle but it's the most common function.
69

69

00:04:26.600  -->  00:04:31.700
They let you easily have a template website, and they let you easily add
70

70

00:04:31.700  -->  00:04:36.510
and manage commenting, you can track analytics, you can share information,
71

71

00:04:36.510  -->  00:04:39.800
you can store user submitted content, it can even let you
72

72

00:04:39.800  -->  00:04:45.360
make changes easily to how your site works and looks, etc.
73

73

00:04:45.360  -->  00:04:48.400
They were essentially an all-in-one package for you to create a site
74

74

00:04:48.400  -->  00:04:53.560
without being a programmer and without 
having to spend tons of time and money
75

75

00:04:53.560  -->  00:04:57.700
on the things that every single basic site needs to have.
76

76

00:04:57.700  -->  00:05:00.670
So, in this section, we're going to take apart how they work,
77

77

00:05:00.670  -->  00:05:04.180
how they look, how they differ, and how would you choose
78

78

00:05:04.180  -->  00:05:07.310
one over the other depending on your project needs.
79

79

00:05:07.310  -->  00:05:09.570
See you in the next lecture!
