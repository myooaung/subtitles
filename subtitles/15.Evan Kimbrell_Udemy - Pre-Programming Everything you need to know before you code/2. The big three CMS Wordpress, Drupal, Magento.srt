00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,600
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
2

2

00:00:02,600  -->  00:00:06,640
Ok, last lecture we got into what CMS's do
3

3

00:00:06,640  -->  00:00:09,650
and why they were created to begin with.
4

4

00:00:09,650  -->  00:00:10,780
Now, recap.
5

5

00:00:10,780  -->  00:00:15,720
Every site that publishes anything to the world has a whole lot of functions
6

6

00:00:15,720  -->  00:00:21,490
it needs to get that most basic task done - the task of publishing something.
7

7

00:00:21,490  -->  00:00:27,990
Formatting, sizing, image processing, site navigation, commenting, abilities
8

8

00:00:27,990  -->  00:00:34,000
to take user submitted information, the ability to update and manage itself, etc.
9

9

00:00:34,000  -->  00:00:38,380
Doing that yourself is pretty crazy unless you're a big company
10

10

00:00:38,380  -->  00:00:41,040
that can spend the resources and the time.
11

11

00:00:41,040  -->  00:00:45,810
For the rest of us normal people, we use a content management system.
12

12

00:00:45,810  -->  00:00:49,020
Ok, so what are the popular ones?
13

13

00:00:49,020  -->  00:00:53,230
Well, let me first introduce you to the mother ship,
14

14

00:00:53,230  -->  00:00:57,540
the granddaddy of all content management systems - WordPress.
15

15

00:00:57,540  -->  00:01:04,440
Rock your subconscious mind, I guarantee 
you've heard this term somewhere before.
16

16

00:01:04,440  -->  00:01:08,210
Your friend's blog about her Southeast Asia backpacking trip
17

17

00:01:08,210  -->  00:01:12,700
was probably made on WordPress and it probably said WordPress
18

18

00:01:12,700  -->  00:01:16,680
somewhere on the site because she didn't really customize it very well.
19

19

00:01:16,680  -->  00:01:22,690
WordPress is the world's largest and the 
most popular content management system.
20

20

00:01:22,690  -->  00:01:25,160
Want to know a mind blowing fact?
21

21

00:01:25,160  -->  00:01:31,130
22% of the entire internet is built on WordPress.
22

22

00:01:31,130  -->  00:01:32,430
Whaaat?
23

23

00:01:32,430  -->  00:01:33,770
Yeah, I know.
24

24

00:01:33,770  -->  00:01:37,330
No, really, if you go to any website online there is a
25

25

00:01:37,330  -->  00:01:41,770
better than 1 in 5 chance that it's built on WordPress.
26

26

00:01:41,770  -->  00:01:45,510
"But it looks just like a normal website" you might say.
27

27

00:01:45,510  -->  00:01:47,680
Yeah, exactly.
28

28

00:01:47,680  -->  00:01:53,400
WordPress is so large and so well established that it has a veritable tomb of
29

29

00:01:53,400  -->  00:01:57,620
templates, plugins, and extensions to make it whatever you want.
30

30

00:01:57,620  -->  00:02:02,390
To go with that tomb, it has an army of people who for a living
31

31

00:02:02,390  -->  00:02:04,860
just customize WordPress installations.
32

32

00:02:04,860  -->  00:02:08,660
WordPress can handle everything we mentioned and then some.
33

33

00:02:08,660  -->  00:02:13,600
It can handle payments, it can handle 
email lists, it can handle post scheduling.
34

34

00:02:13,600  -->  00:02:17,100
The only thing it can't do is probably save your marriage,
35

35

00:02:17,100  -->  00:02:21,650
and ironically, it probably has ended a couple.
36

36

00:02:21,650  -->  00:02:23,810
It's really hard to use.
37

37

00:02:23,810  -->  00:02:26,580
So when I say a site could be built on WordPress
38

38

00:02:26,580  -->  00:02:29,320
and you wouldn't even know about it, I mean it.
39

39

00:02:29,320  -->  00:02:34,670
Let's look at some sites that are built on 
WordPress, you might recognize a couple of these.
40

40

00:02:34,670  -->  00:02:37,060
Let's look at BestBuy, built on WordPress.
41

41

00:02:37,060  -->  00:02:39,440
Time Magazine, built on WordPress.
42

42

00:02:39,440  -->  00:02:44,400
Fortune Magazine / .com (do they still have a magazine?), built on WordPress.
43

43

00:02:44,400  -->  00:02:47,700
New York Times, yes, built on WordPress.
44

44

00:02:47,700  -->  00:02:52,480
Harvard Business Review, AMC, it just goes on and on.
45

45

00:02:52,480  -->  00:02:58,080
True story: WordPress was created by one man, Matt Mullenweg,
46

46

00:02:58,080  -->  00:03:04,090
who in order to create WordPress spent two years programming almost non-stop
47

47

00:03:04,090  -->  00:03:08,190
and sleeping in what's called polyphasic sleep,
48

48

00:03:08,190  -->  00:03:13,620
and that means that you sleep for 40 minutes six times a day.
49

49

00:03:13,620  -->  00:03:19,200
So you sleep 40 minutes, then you stay awake and program for 2.5 hours,
50

50

00:03:19,200  -->  00:03:26,180
then you sleep for another 40 minutes, 
and then you repeat that pattern for two years.
51

51

00:03:26,180  -->  00:03:31,380
I'm just tired even thinking about it, if I don't sleep my 14 hours, I get cranky.
52

52

00:03:31,380  -->  00:03:35,750
Ok, so if you had to know one CMS, it would be WordPress.
53

53

00:03:35,750  -->  00:03:38,990
Impress your friend at the bar with this amazing piece of knowledge,
54

54

00:03:38,990  -->  00:03:42,590
and if any of them at the bar know virtually anything about the internet
55

55

00:03:42,590  -->  00:03:45,990
they will already know this and think you're quite lame.
56

56

00:03:45,990  -->  00:03:47,200
Whatever.
57

57

00:03:47,200  -->  00:03:50,570
What are the other popular ones and what should we know about those?
58

58

00:03:50,570  -->  00:03:53,910
Well, the next up is worth mentioning, it's called Drupal.
59

59

00:03:53,910  -->  00:03:58,210
Drupal is the veganism or atheism of CMS.
60

60

00:03:58,210  -->  00:04:03,280
If you know someone who uses it, they cannot wait to tell you about it,
61

61

00:04:03,280  -->  00:04:06,960
because, oh my God, Drupal does everything.
62

62

00:04:06,960  -->  00:04:08,290
What's there to rave about?
63

63

00:04:08,290  -->  00:04:15,580
Well, like WordPress, it has an innumerable number of modules, and plugins,
64

64

00:04:15,580  -->  00:04:20,250
and extensions you can add to it and make it fit for whatever you want to make.
65

65

00:04:20,250  -->  00:04:21,500
Forum? Sure.
66

66

00:04:21,500  -->  00:04:24,370
Membership site? Sure, there's a module for that.
67

67

00:04:24,370  -->  00:04:28,140
Online courses? Yeah, there's actually a module for that one too.
68

68

00:04:28,140  -->  00:04:31,000
What's worth knowing about Drupal is that from 10,000 feet
69

69

00:04:31,000  -->  00:04:33,780
and without actually diving into the system itself,
70

70

00:04:33,780  -->  00:04:40,220
it's actually virtually indistinguishable 
from WordPress on all aspects except a couple.
71

71

00:04:40,220  -->  00:04:45,390
Number one is Drupal is less mainstream and less popular than WordPress.
72

72

00:04:45,390  -->  00:04:49,500
They only have about 2.2% of the internet on their platform,
73

73

00:04:49,500  -->  00:04:52,500
which still is an enormous amount of websites.
74

74

00:04:52,500  -->  00:04:58,090
Number two, it has a more enthusiastic 
but smaller core of developers supporting it.
75

75

00:04:58,090  -->  00:05:01,840
These people give each other barbwire tattoos of the Drupal logo
76

76

00:05:01,840  -->  00:05:05,870
because they are hardcore, never die Drupal.
77

77

00:05:05,870  -->  00:05:07,310
And it shows.
78

78

00:05:07,310  -->  00:05:13,990
Drupal has more modules, and extensions, and 
updates per developer than any other CMS in the world.
79

79

00:05:13,990  -->  00:05:18,070
Worth noting, both Drupal and WordPress are built out of PHP
80

80

00:05:18,070  -->  00:05:21,090
and are generally considered multi-purpose, as in
81

81

00:05:21,090  -->  00:05:23,730
no matter what you are trying to make or do,
82

82

00:05:23,730  -->  00:05:26,500
one of these will probably work for you.
83

83

00:05:26,500  -->  00:05:30,900
I like to think of them as the onesies of content management systems.
84

84

00:05:30,900  -->  00:05:33,200
One size fits all.
85

85

00:05:33,200  -->  00:05:37,510
All right, now the last CMS we're going to 
talk about in this lecture is called Magento.
86

86

00:05:37,510  -->  00:05:39,040
Have you heard of Magento?
87

87

00:05:39,040  -->  00:05:40,920
Probably not.
88

88

00:05:40,920  -->  00:05:44,820
If you already know what this is, then, well, why are you taking this course?
89

89

00:05:44,820  -->  00:05:47,890
Maybe you're a mystery shopper from Udemy.
90

90

00:05:47,890  -->  00:05:50,080
I just want you to know that I see you.
91

91

00:05:50,080  -->  00:05:53,560
Magento is similar yet unique to the other ones that we've talked about.
92

92

00:05:53,560  -->  00:05:56,780
Like the other ones, it's also built in PHP, and like the others,
93

93

00:05:56,780  -->  00:06:00,500
it's enormous, and started around the same time as the others.
94

94

00:06:00,500  -->  00:06:04,300
But Magento targets an entirely different use case.
95

95

00:06:04,300  -->  00:06:08,200
If you haven't noticed, most of the examples 
I gave you before for WordPress or Drupal
96

96

00:06:08,200  -->  00:06:12,010
are heavy on the whole blog and written content angle.
97

97

00:06:12,010  -->  00:06:15,930
Newspapers, blogs, forums - these are things that just
98

98

00:06:15,930  -->  00:06:18,950
naturally fit within the WordPress and Drupal system.
99

99

00:06:18,950  -->  00:06:23,120
But one thing they can handle but are at somewhat of a disadvantage
100

100

00:06:23,120  -->  00:06:26,720
because they didn't really focus on it is e-commerce.
101

101

00:06:26,720  -->  00:06:29,460
E-commerce as in buying stuff online.
102

102

00:06:29,460  -->  00:06:31,790
People who run stores have different needs
103

103

00:06:31,790  -->  00:06:35,100
and focus on different things than people who write blogs.
104

104

00:06:35,100  -->  00:06:41,670
They care about inventory management, things called SKUs, product imagery,
105

105

00:06:41,670  -->  00:06:46,800
and in general they're less concerned with 
how many likes their social media posts get.
106

106

00:06:46,800  -->  00:06:50,150
The opening was there, and Magento was one of the first to go for it.
107

107

00:06:50,150  -->  00:06:53,480
So, like the other two, it's huge, it's popular,
108

108

00:06:53,480  -->  00:06:57,020
and you have to install it on a web server, just like the others.
109

109

00:06:57,020  -->  00:07:00,620
But unlike the others, it's made specifically for selling stuff.
110

110

00:07:00,620  -->  00:07:02,720
Whatever stuff you want.
111

111

00:07:02,720  -->  00:07:08,700
If you were going online and buy a Samsung Galaxy Note 7 from Samsung.com
112

112

00:07:08,700  -->  00:07:13,450
and it came to you without exploding, you'd use Magento to buy it.
113

113

00:07:13,450  -->  00:07:15,770
Samsung is built in Magento.
114

114

00:07:15,770  -->  00:07:22,190
I don't know if it's too soon for Samsung exploding phone jokes, but anyway.
115

115

00:07:22,190  -->  00:07:29,640
If you bought a laptop from Lenovo or a 
sweet "looks original but is actually a copycat"
116

116

00:07:29,640  -->  00:07:33,790
pair of headphones from Sony.com, you used Magento.
117

117

00:07:33,790  -->  00:07:37,230
Ok, those are the three biggies you need to know about.
118

118

00:07:37,230  -->  00:07:42,530
All three are built in PHP, all three are for the most part free and easy to set up.
119

119

00:07:42,530  -->  00:07:45,120
WordPress is the biggest and the most popular,
120

120

00:07:45,120  -->  00:07:48,510
although it is known to be frustrating at times,
121

121

00:07:48,510  -->  00:07:52,980
Drupal has similar characteristics but is best known for the cult that follows it,
122

122

00:07:52,980  -->  00:07:56,100
and Magento was going to go WordPress, but they took a turn
123

123

00:07:56,100  -->  00:07:59,750
and decided to go Magento and just focus on selling things online.,
124

124

00:07:59,750  -->  00:08:02,680
something that when WordPress and Drupal were coming out
125

125

00:08:02,680  -->  00:08:05,880
was not nearly as big of a thing as it is now.
126

126

00:08:05,880  -->  00:08:11,830
Remember, this is a time before Amazon Prime, 
a time I really don't like to think about.
127

127

00:08:11,830  -->  00:08:14,460
Next lecture, we're going to cover the new guard of CMS,
128

128

00:08:14,460  -->  00:08:18,520
how it's changed, and what the F is WYSIWYG.
