00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:02.850
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
2

2

00:00:02.850  -->  00:00:06.440
So, this lecture, we're going to talk about, if you're interested in programming,
3

3

00:00:06.440  -->  00:00:10.250
how do you choose between all of the options available to you?
4

4

00:00:10.250  -->  00:00:14.850
Operating system programming, you have data 
science, you have back-end programming,
5

5

00:00:14.850  -->  00:00:19.520
front-end programming, or the all alluring full stack developer.
6

6

00:00:19.520  -->  00:00:23.560
The way I like to think about this is to break it down into two different questions.
7

7

00:00:23.560  -->  00:00:27.120
First questions is, what are you orientated towards?
8

8

00:00:27.120  -->  00:00:32.330
Are you orientated towards design or logic and puzzles?
9

9

00:00:32.330  -->  00:00:37.640
The reason why I say that is because a front-end developer is someone who
10

10

00:00:37.640  -->  00:00:44.750
is going to work with design more often, they're going to use less logic,
11

11

00:00:44.750  -->  00:00:47.550
and they're going to work in a more fast-paced environment.
12

12

00:00:47.550  -->  00:00:53.080
I often think of front-end developers as more of like creatives than programmers,
13

13

00:00:53.080  -->  00:00:56.900
because you have a lot of editorial and creative control over
14

14

00:00:56.900  -->  00:01:01.330
how something is going to look, and interact, and how customers use it.
15

15

00:01:01.330  -->  00:01:05.570
Now, on the flipside, if you're the type of person who really likes puzzles,
16

16

00:01:05.570  -->  00:01:13.080
solving problems, and generally likes doing hard things, and likes logic,
17

17

00:01:13.080  -->  00:01:17.180
then software development and back-end development is probably the way to go.
18

18

00:01:17.180  -->  00:01:21.800
I think you should probably just ask yourself, would you be interested in learning design?
19

19

00:01:21.800  -->  00:01:25.960
Design as in colors, and shapes, and buttons, and images, and things like that.
20

20

00:01:25.960  -->  00:01:29.890
If you say "No way," I'd say back-end development,
21

21

00:01:29.890  -->  00:01:32.230
data science, operating system development, that's you.
22

22

00:01:32.230  -->  00:01:34.500
If you're someone who actually is interested
23

23

00:01:34.500  -->  00:01:37.640
in learning design, then front-end is the way to go.
24

24

00:01:37.640  -->  00:01:44.040
The reason why I say that is because with both of these types of programming languages,
25

25

00:01:44.040  -->  00:01:49.310
back-end and front-end, you have to over time get better at what you do,
26

26

00:01:49.310  -->  00:01:55.000
and so the logical extension of a front-end developer is going to be design, usually,
27

27

00:01:55.000  -->  00:01:58.710
and the logical extension of a software developer might be to move into
28

28

00:01:58.710  -->  00:02:02.060
front-end development, get a little bit better there, or just double down
29

29

00:02:02.060  -->  00:02:05.290
and work on harder things that are in the back-end.
30

30

00:02:05.290  -->  00:02:06.700
So ask yourself that.
31

31

00:02:06.700  -->  00:02:10.300
Do you like pretty things or hard things?
32

32

00:02:10.300  -->  00:02:13.810
Pretty things are more creative and more aesthetically pleasing,
33

33

00:02:13.810  -->  00:02:15.910
usually the front-end developers do that,
34

34

00:02:15.910  -->  00:02:18.910
and usually the back-ends will do the stuff that's just hard.
35

35

00:02:18.910  -->  00:02:24.220
The second question I'd like to ask is where do you see yourself using this programming?
36

36

00:02:24.220  -->  00:02:25.780
Do you want to work for a startup?
37

37

00:02:25.780  -->  00:02:27.500
Do you want to work for a big company,
38

38

00:02:27.500  -->  00:02:29.720
or do you want to do your own projects?
39

39

00:02:29.720  -->  00:02:32.220
If you're someone who wants to work for a startup,
40

40

00:02:32.220  -->  00:02:34.760
well, you have a lot of options available to you.
41

41

00:02:34.760  -->  00:02:38.330
Startups right now are craving back-end development,
42

42

00:02:38.330  -->  00:02:41.130
front-end, they need it, but it's not as in demand,
43

43

00:02:41.130  -->  00:02:44.130
they also have an increasing need for data science.
44

44

00:02:44.130  -->  00:02:48.440
The thing you rarely see them hiring though are operating system developers,
45

45

00:02:48.440  -->  00:02:51.300
that's not to say that startups don't ever make anything for operating systems,
46

46

00:02:51.300  -->  00:02:56.700
they do, but when they do it, they usually find a way to package web code,
47

47

00:02:56.700  -->  00:02:59.250
like Python or Ruby, and run that on the desktop.
48

48

00:02:59.250  -->  00:03:03.560
If you wanted to work for a big company, great job security,
49

49

00:03:03.560  -->  00:03:08.630
you want to kind of work your way up, lots of opportunities for promotion,
50

50

00:03:08.630  -->  00:03:13.530
well, then I would say your options are a little bit different.
51

51

00:03:13.530  -->  00:03:15.800
Big companies always need back-end developers.
52

52

00:03:15.800  -->  00:03:20.240
The thing you don't see big companies often asking for is front-end development.
53

53

00:03:20.240  -->  00:03:24.020
This is just because big companies, again, are more invested in old technologies,
54

54

00:03:24.020  -->  00:03:30.000
they haven't yet caught up to that trend where design is such a big part of what they do.
55

55

00:03:30.000  -->  00:03:31.880
If you want to program for operating systems,
56

56

00:03:31.880  -->  00:03:34.780
big companies are probably your way to go in general,
57

57

00:03:34.780  -->  00:03:40.690
you're probably going to go work for Adobe, or Microsoft, or something like an IBM.
58

58

00:03:40.690  -->  00:03:43.790
The last thing is whether or not you want to build your own projects.
59

59

00:03:43.790  -->  00:03:46.490
If you want to build your own projects, well, then I would say
60

60

00:03:46.490  -->  00:03:49.470
focus on the things that can get it done the fastest.
61

61

00:03:49.470  -->  00:03:53.440
Python and Ruby are great options.
62

62

00:03:53.440  -->  00:03:56.300
I wouldn't say learn front-end development,
63

63

00:03:56.300  -->  00:03:57.930
because that's only half of the equation,
64

64

00:03:57.930  -->  00:03:59.840
you can get more done as a back-end,
65

65

00:03:59.840  -->  00:04:02.310
and then it's cheaper to hire someone to do the front-end.
66

66

00:04:02.310  -->  00:04:04.670
Now, if you're trying to do your own thing, it's rarely the case
67

67

00:04:04.670  -->  00:04:09.190
that you should learn data science, because where are you getting the data?
68

68

00:04:09.190  -->  00:04:13.760
You don't have tons and tons of customers, there's just not as many opportunities.
69

69

00:04:13.760  -->  00:04:16.700
And, of course, not to forget mobile development.
70

70

00:04:16.700  -->  00:04:21.000
Mobile is kind of a curveball, and what I generally would say is
71

71

00:04:21.000  -->  00:04:24.600
if you're someone who likes mobile, then learn mobile,
72

72

00:04:24.600  -->  00:04:27.700
because pretty much every use case needs it.
73

73

00:04:27.700  -->  00:04:31.000
Startups need it, big companies definitely need it,
74

74

00:04:31.000  -->  00:04:33.950
and if you're going to make a mobile app, you should probably learn
75

75

00:04:33.950  -->  00:04:37.450
how to do iOS or Android programming.
76

76

00:04:37.450  -->  00:04:38.800
All right, so ask yourself that.
77

77

00:04:38.800  -->  00:04:41.300
Do I want to work for a startup, big company, do my own thing?
78

78

00:04:41.300  -->  00:04:48.690
And, in general, am I more orientated towards 
design, aesthetics, or logic and architecture?
79

79

00:04:48.690  -->  00:04:50.300
All right guys, see you in the next lecture!
