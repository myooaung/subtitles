00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,310
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
2

2

00:00:02,310  -->  00:00:06,500
All right, this lecture, we're going to talk about 
how computers send and receive information.
3

3

00:00:06,500  -->  00:00:09,140
It's a quick lecture, let's just cruise through it.
4

4

00:00:09,140  -->  00:00:13,410
Ok, so we know basically, on a really high level, 
how a computer works to
5

5

00:00:13,410  -->  00:00:15,650
process and store the information you give it.
6

6

00:00:15,650  -->  00:00:21,080
How does it actually get that information it plays with, 
and how does it deliver a response
7

7

00:00:21,080  -->  00:00:22,830
is the question we're going to answer right now.
8

8

00:00:22,830  -->  00:00:26,590
Don't worry, you'll get the answer relatively quick.
9

9

00:00:26,590  -->  00:00:30,830
In the world of computing there are tons of 
what we call computer "peripherals."
10

10

00:00:30,830  -->  00:00:33,000
Ok, that's a term you need to know, "peripheral."
11

11

00:00:33,000  -->  00:00:38,570
Things like monitors, keyboards, trackpads, mice, rats, etc.,
12

12

00:00:38,570  -->  00:00:40,470
those are all peripherals.
13

13

00:00:40,470  -->  00:00:45,110
All the stuff that's external to that beautiful 
Gateway computer sitting on your desk.
14

14

00:00:45,110  -->  00:00:49,400
We call them peripherals because they work 
outside of that closed circuit
15

15

00:00:49,400  -->  00:00:55,090
system that is your computer, outside of 
the CPU and the two different types of memory.
16

16

00:00:55,090  -->  00:00:59,520
I guess it's kind of like, you could think of it like this, 
like your computer is the sun,
17

17

00:00:59,520  -->  00:01:03,030
and the peripherals are the planets floating all the way around it.
18

18

00:01:03,030  -->  00:01:09,860
Trust me, not all the names and labels in computer 
and internet technology make any sense at all.
19

19

00:01:09,860  -->  00:01:13,750
Now, these devices allow you to give 
the computer information, and they allow
20

20

00:01:13,750  -->  00:01:17,140
the computer to take that information, 
run a process on it, and send it back.
21

21

00:01:17,140  -->  00:01:20,950
You could open up, let's say, Minesweeper, 
and start clicking your mouse.
22

22

00:01:20,950  -->  00:01:23,510
By clicking your mouse, you are giving the computer input.
23

23

00:01:23,510  -->  00:01:27,570
That input is essentially just information, 
and with that information,
24

24

00:01:27,570  -->  00:01:32,450
it can run a calculation, and then respond with output, 
respond onto your monitor.
25

25

00:01:32,450  -->  00:01:36,000
Great. We just saw that I clicked there and I blew up.
26

26

00:01:36,000  -->  00:01:40,330
Good work, input - output. 
Put information in, get information out.
27

27

00:01:40,330  -->  00:01:43,570
A keyboard works pretty much the same way. 
If you click A
28

28

00:01:43,570  -->  00:01:46,530
and it says to your computer, like a Canadian, "eh".
29

29

00:01:46,530  -->  00:01:47,370
* How's it going, eh? *
30

30

00:01:47,370  -->  00:01:51,240
And that's really what the computer - programmer 
relationship boils down to.
31

31

00:01:51,240  -->  00:01:58,220
It should be pretty obvious at this point how this all 
ties into your role potentially as a programmer.
32

32

00:01:58,220  -->  00:02:02,720
The code you write for whatever program 
or app can be thought of as simply
33

33

00:02:02,720  -->  00:02:05,720
input that the computer receives, and then the computer
34

34

00:02:05,720  -->  00:02:08,230
will respond by giving you a corresponding output.
35

35

00:02:08,230  -->  00:02:12,030
Whether or not that output matches 
what you intended with your input
36

36

00:02:12,030  -->  00:02:14,460
depends on your ability as a programmer.
37

37

00:02:14,460  -->  00:02:17,900
And whether or not computers will soon 
be able to just read our minds and
38

38

00:02:17,900  -->  00:02:22,340
program themselves, well, that's a horror story 
for an entirely different course.
39

39

00:02:22,340  -->  00:02:26,750
In the next lecture, we're going to get into 
how exactly computers "chat," so to speak,
40

40

00:02:26,750  -->  00:02:30,080
with themselves and with your periphery devices.
41

41

00:02:30,080  -->  00:02:32,580
We're also going to talk about how The Matrix perfectly predicted
42

42

00:02:32,580  -->  00:02:34,980
everything we experience today in life.
43

43

00:02:34,980  -->  00:02:35,780
Stay tuned!
