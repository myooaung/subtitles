00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.450
Hey guys welcome back to the chorus.

2
00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:09.630
So last section we're going to talk about what do you do after this class.

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:15.630
If you're someone out there who wants to learn how to program we're going to talk about each individual

4
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:22.860
language and track what's the best way of tackling learning that what programs are available what resources

5
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.480
online are the best and give you the best kind of are lie for your time and your money.

6
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.260
Now if you are actually interested in learning how to program and you're more about hiring people managing

7
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.950
them and communicating with them then this is still I think useful because you'll know where to look

8
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.810
for people to hire and then actually kind of gives you a jump on other people.

9
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.440
Most people just posted job ads but if you actually understand where people are learning front end development

10
00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:01.110
go to learn it and where the actual smart good talented ones go that will actually help you quite a

11
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.360
bit.

12
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:07.020
When it comes to recruitment our guys in the next section we're just gonna take a brief pause and work

13
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:14.760
on a set of four concepts that people really get confused all of the time.

14
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:22.140
Web Development Software Development full stack development and then what people call hackers.

15
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:23.120
OK.

16
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.510
None of those are really that similar.

17
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.730
You need to understand what they actually entail.

18
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.450
Otherwise you're just gonna say the wrong thing and get the wrong person.

19
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.250
All right see you then.
