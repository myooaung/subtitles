00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:01,800
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
2

2

00:00:01,800  -->  00:00:05,600
In this lecture, we're going to talk about 
two really important concepts in programming,
3

3

00:00:05,600  -->  00:00:07,970
the concept of the development environment
4

4

00:00:07,970  -->  00:00:12,080
and the concept of the integrated development environment.
5

5

00:00:12,080  -->  00:00:13,550
Tricky already, I know.
6

6

00:00:13,550  -->  00:00:18,720
Ok, so hopefully, now we have a pretty good understanding of frameworks.
7

7

00:00:18,720  -->  00:00:22,620
They do different things depending on what 
area of the application you're working on,
8

8

00:00:22,620  -->  00:00:28,060
but in general, they are essentially a template 
system that allows you to program faster.
9

9

00:00:28,060  -->  00:00:30,190
They are usually things you install onto your server
10

10

00:00:30,190  -->  00:00:32,630
where the rest of your code you write hangs out.
11

11

00:00:32,630  -->  00:00:38,600
Now, there is another concept that often gets 
conflated with the concept of a framework,
12

12

00:00:38,600  -->  00:00:44,150
and that's what we call an Integrated Development Environment, 
also known as an IDE.
13

13

00:00:44,150  -->  00:00:47,050
To tackle this concept, I want to break it down a little bit.
14

14

00:00:47,050  -->  00:00:50,450
Now, does anyone remember Adobe Dreamweaver?
15

15

00:00:50,450  -->  00:00:52,320
It had a green logo.
16

16

00:00:52,320  -->  00:00:56,890
You probably thought it was a generic website building application,
17

17

00:00:56,890  -->  00:01:01,030
but in reality, and more technically, it was an IDE.
18

18

00:01:01,030  -->  00:01:04,430
Now, integrated development environments, first of all,
19

19

00:01:04,430  -->  00:01:09,870
are programs that programmers can use to make their applications inside of.
20

20

00:01:09,870  -->  00:01:16,780
The concept here is very similar to, say, 
a word processor, like, let's say, Microsoft Word.
21

21

00:01:16,780  -->  00:01:20,700
If I was going to write a paper, I'd probably create it in Microsoft Word,
22

22

00:01:20,700  -->  00:01:23,680
because it allows me to do a whole lot with that paper,
23

23

00:01:23,680  -->  00:01:29,120
like export to different document types, spell check, it might give me a thesaurus,
24

24

00:01:29,120  -->  00:01:35,060
it might give me dictionary lookups, it'll handle inserting images, etc.
25

25

00:01:35,060  -->  00:01:37,030
Now, image how different the experience would be
26

26

00:01:37,030  -->  00:01:43,040
if you just made the paper in, let's say, a raw text application like text edit.
27

27

00:01:43,040  -->  00:01:47,840
It just takes in your text, no bells and whistles attached.
28

28

00:01:47,840  -->  00:01:50,910
So that's exactly what an IDE does.
29

29

00:01:50,910  -->  00:01:54,180
Programmers write their programs inside of one them,
30

30

00:01:54,180  -->  00:01:58,150
and they provide tools that make the job a whole lot easier.
31

31

00:01:58,150  -->  00:02:00,730
Some of the most common things you'll see in an IDE
32

32

00:02:00,730  -->  00:02:05,200
are things like the programmatic equivalent of spell check.
33

33

00:02:05,200  -->  00:02:08,690
So in this case it's making sure that the syntax is correct
34

34

00:02:08,690  -->  00:02:13,530
so that it doesn't create an issue 
when you actually run the program or the code.
35

35

00:02:13,530  -->  00:02:17,940
They often have things like auto complete features to help developers
36

36

00:02:17,940  -->  00:02:22,740
write the same lines of code over and over again, 
which is something that they do constantly.
37

37

00:02:22,740  -->  00:02:26,510
They'll usually help developers organize and structure the files
38

38

00:02:26,510  -->  00:02:29,730
before they upload them to a web server, and in better ones,
39

39

00:02:29,730  -->  00:02:35,070
it will help the developer even keep track of which document is new or outdated,
40

40

00:02:35,070  -->  00:02:37,720
so essentially it will handle something called version control.
41

41

00:02:37,720  -->  00:02:40,670
But the biggest thing, I think, that an IDE does is that
42

42

00:02:40,670  -->  00:02:44,030
it creates an automatic development environment.
43

43

00:02:44,030  -->  00:02:48,500
And this is hopefully where we can kind of 
clear the confusion between the two concepts.
44

44

00:02:48,500  -->  00:02:53,470
Essentially, what a development environment is is a setup on your computer,
45

45

00:02:53,470  -->  00:02:59,520
or on a web server space, where you can write code for your program, test it,
46

46

00:02:59,520  -->  00:03:06,220
and then automatically see how it runs for 
real as if it were uploaded to a live website.
47

47

00:03:06,220  -->  00:03:08,190
Imagine you're someone who writes books.
48

48

00:03:08,190  -->  00:03:11,650
What tools do you think you would need to put on your desk
49

49

00:03:11,650  -->  00:03:15,360
to be the most efficient way of writing your book?
50

50

00:03:15,360  -->  00:03:20,040
Examples might be: pencils, pens, papers, staplers, dictionary,
51

51

00:03:20,040  -->  00:03:24,010
and then some way of understanding how what you're doing
52

52

00:03:24,010  -->  00:03:27,840
translates to how it would be presented in a book.
53

53

00:03:27,840  -->  00:03:31,880
That's the most similar analogy I can think of, so you'd better like it.
54

54

00:03:31,880  -->  00:03:35,550
Now, if you don't have a development environment already set up,
55

55

00:03:35,550  -->  00:03:38,980
you can still write programs, because after all coding is just
56

56

00:03:38,980  -->  00:03:41,760
text inside of a text document at the end of the day,
57

57

00:03:41,760  -->  00:03:47,260
but you won't have any way of getting quick 
feedback on whether it was made correctly,
58

58

00:03:47,260  -->  00:03:51,740
whether it's coming out the way you thought it should, etc.
59

59

00:03:51,740  -->  00:03:55,470
The alternative is to set up a tool that allows you to test it in the wild
60

60

00:03:55,470  -->  00:04:01,870
and an IDE is actually a great example of that closed kind of feedback system.
61

61

00:04:01,870  -->  00:04:03,400
So try not to conflate the two of these.
62

62

00:04:03,400  -->  00:04:09,380
Frameworks are the template you use for 
your resume, but an IDE would be Microsoft Word.
63

63

00:04:09,380  -->  00:04:12,130
In some ways, these two things overlap in what they offer,
64

64

00:04:12,130  -->  00:04:15,290
and sometimes the line between the two is blurry,
65

65

00:04:15,290  -->  00:04:19,160
but from a conceptual standpoint, they're actually entirely different.
66

66

00:04:19,160  -->  00:04:21,400
If you're curious and want to check out some IDEs, here are
67

67

00:04:21,400  -->  00:04:24,800
some of the most popular ones worth taking a peek at.
68

68

00:04:24,800  -->  00:04:28,140
If you're writing in a more general purpose low level language,
69

69

00:04:28,140  -->  00:04:31,640
you might use something like Visual Studio by Microsoft.
70

70

00:04:31,640  -->  00:04:38,050
If you're making an app for iOS, you are 
definitely going to use an IDE called XCode.
71

71

00:04:38,050  -->  00:04:41,580
Dreamweaver, believe it or not, still exists and is still used today,
72

72

00:04:41,580  -->  00:04:43,650
although it's not, I don't think it's that popular.
73

73

00:04:43,650  -->  00:04:47,490
Other ones you might tinker with, if you want to learn Java
74

74

00:04:47,490  -->  00:04:50,060
or have some experience with that, look at Net Beans,
75

75

00:04:50,060  -->  00:04:55,830
PHP Storm is something that's often popular for writing in PHP,
76

76

00:04:55,830  -->  00:05:02,200
that one is actually popular because it 
helps assist in installing frameworks into the IDE.
77

77

00:05:02,200  -->  00:05:04,000
I know that can be confusing.
78

78

00:05:04,000  -->  00:05:06,850
So the upside of an integrated development environment is,
79

79

00:05:06,850  -->  00:05:11,650
well, lots of tools that can make writing 
easier, and getting feedback more seamless.
80

80

00:05:11,650  -->  00:05:14,910
Often times, entire companies will use these because
81

81

00:05:14,910  -->  00:05:18,420
it can help share files and code between team members.
82

82

00:05:18,420  -->  00:05:20,680
Now, what of the downsides of using this?
83

83

00:05:20,680  -->  00:05:22,750
Well, one, they can cost money,
84

84

00:05:22,750  -->  00:05:26,800
and they often can add a lot of extra code to your project
85

85

00:05:26,800  -->  00:05:30,760
that doesn't really do anything or might not be entirely necessary,
86

86

00:05:30,760  -->  00:05:33,370
this is a concept we refer to as "code bloat."
87

87

00:05:33,370  -->  00:05:36,700
And two, you actually have to learn how to use it,
88

88

00:05:36,700  -->  00:05:40,180
which a lot of times can take a significant amount of time,
89

89

00:05:40,180  -->  00:05:42,300
especially when you're onboarding team members,
90

90

00:05:42,300  -->  00:05:46,410
it's just another thing you need to understand 
before you can actually produce code
91

91

00:05:46,410  -->  00:05:50,380
to add value to the application or the organization that you're in.
92

92

00:05:50,380  -->  00:05:51,750
All right guys, don't worry about that one,
93

93

00:05:51,750  -->  00:05:55,290
we're not going to grill you too hard in the quizzes on that concept.
94

94

00:05:55,290  -->  00:06:00,200
In the next couple of lecture, we're going 
to cover a concept known as the API.
95

95

00:06:00,200  -->  00:06:01,430
All right, see you then!
