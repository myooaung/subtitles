00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,340
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
2

2

00:00:02,340  -->  00:00:08,080
Ok, so we know what WordPress is, we know 
what Drupal is, we know what Magento is.
3

3

00:00:08,080  -->  00:00:10,420
WordPress is the lord of the internet,
4

4

00:00:10,420  -->  00:00:14,720
Drupal is that small weird cult with respectable technology,
5

5

00:00:14,720  -->  00:00:18,500
and Magento is buy-buy-buy, sell-sell-sell all day.
6

6

00:00:18,500  -->  00:00:23,090
The way those got installed is you literally download a package off the internet,
7

7

00:00:23,090  -->  00:00:28,170
upload it to your server, and then open that package through your web browser.
8

8

00:00:28,170  -->  00:00:31,000
The system then just runs and does the rest for you.
9

9

00:00:31,000  -->  00:00:33,740
While that sounds nifty, and easy, and all that,
10

10

00:00:33,740  -->  00:00:40,480
that simple set of 4-5 extra steps I just described 
actually made a significant division
11

11

00:00:40,480  -->  00:00:44,020
between the types of users that would use it.
12

12

00:00:44,020  -->  00:00:48,920
I said "would" because anyone with the time and effort can use them,
13

13

00:00:48,920  -->  00:00:55,090
but that extra "computer-y" sounding part was 
enough to discourage large groups of people.
14

14

00:00:55,090  -->  00:00:56,750
At this point I want to point something out.
15

15

00:00:56,750  -->  00:00:58,530
Do you notice this trend?
16

16

00:00:58,530  -->  00:01:02,800
First, there were no CMS's out there, and the only people playing
17

17

00:01:02,800  -->  00:01:05,900
in the internet's sandbox were people who could teach themselves
18

18

00:01:05,900  -->  00:01:10,080
how to program and were fine taking hours to write and upload something.
19

19

00:01:10,080  -->  00:01:14,210
The general population in this scenario just watched from the side lines.
20

20

00:01:14,210  -->  00:01:18,920
With the creation of the CMS, more people found creating websites accessible
21

21

00:01:18,920  -->  00:01:25,750
and as CMS systems got simpler and more 
intuitive, more and more people started using them.
22

22

00:01:25,750  -->  00:01:28,830
So what was left to optimize? You might ask.
23

23

00:01:28,830  -->  00:01:31,030
Well, two things happened.
24

24

00:01:31,030  -->  00:01:37,240
One, we started seeing websites that acted 
as platforms to let you create your own website,
25

25

00:01:37,240  -->  00:01:41,800
much like something like WordPress, except that you made the site
26

26

00:01:41,800  -->  00:01:46,580
while using their site, and everything you made was stored on their servers
27

27

00:01:46,580  -->  00:01:50,050
and sometimes even listed directly from their domain.
28

28

00:01:50,050  -->  00:01:52,680
Now, what do I mean by "make it on their site"?
29

29

00:01:52,680  -->  00:01:56,900
Well, I mean their websites literally had you walk through steps
30

30

00:01:56,900  -->  00:02:03,940
to select you site's aesthetic, font, headers, content, etc.
31

31

00:02:03,940  -->  00:02:09,700
Now this is as opposed to just giving you a 
massive administration panel to do as you please.
32

32

00:02:09,700  -->  00:02:13,700
They were like the Apple to Microsoft.
33

33

00:02:13,700  -->  00:02:17,610
They assumed you were dumber, and so controlled more of the process,
34

34

00:02:17,610  -->  00:02:20,010
allowing you less ability to customize.
35

35

00:02:20,010  -->  00:02:22,650
WordPress junkies would say "How dare they?"
36

36

00:02:22,650  -->  00:02:26,120
"Doesn't everyone want complete control of their website?"
37

37

00:02:26,120  -->  00:02:31,080
Well, no, and this is a lesson we learn over and over.
38

38

00:02:31,080  -->  00:02:38,420
It's the exact lesson we learned from Linux and 
the way it tried to battle with Macintosh's OS X.
39

39

00:02:38,420  -->  00:02:44,200
The second thing we saw happening was the emergence of what we call WYSIWYG,
40

40

00:02:44,200  -->  00:02:47,440
which is actually an acronym for What You See Is What You Get,
41

41

00:02:47,440  -->  00:02:52,580
as in, no more were we creating our websites by selecting the size of each image
42

42

00:02:52,580  -->  00:02:56,010
through a drop down box, or editing our site in this
43

43

00:02:56,010  -->  00:02:59,580
hidden bunker-like system of an administration panel.
44

44

00:02:59,580  -->  00:03:03,960
With WYSIWYG, you would build your site visually,
45

45

00:03:03,960  -->  00:03:07,330
much like a toddler would build a building out of Legos.
46

46

00:03:07,330  -->  00:03:13,200
You look at it, you grab what you want, and then you place it where you want.
47

47

00:03:13,200  -->  00:03:19,400
Lastly, unlike the free CMS systems that only 
charged for upgrades or special modules,
48

48

00:03:19,400  -->  00:03:25,080
this new guard of CMS, well, they charged every 
month just for the pleasure of using their service.
49

49

00:03:25,080  -->  00:03:29,050
So if you thought WordPress is too technical or unnecessarily complicated,
50

50

00:03:29,050  -->  00:03:34,090
which in some respects it is, then these new systems were a God send.
51

51

00:03:34,090  -->  00:03:38,600
Now, three WYSIWYG closed system CMS systems have emerged
52

52

00:03:38,600  -->  00:03:43,750
in the last odd 5-7 years that are worth discussing:
53

53

00:03:43,750  -->  00:03:46,330
SquareSpace, Weebly, and Shopify.
54

54

00:03:46,330  -->  00:03:47,670
Let's start with SquareSpace.
55

55

00:03:47,670  -->  00:03:52,900
SquareSpace kicked off its existence much like the other new guard CMS systems,
56

56

00:03:52,900  -->  00:03:57,850
by treating this exactly like a startup and not an open source project,
57

57

00:03:57,850  -->  00:04:02,600
like the creators of WordPress and Drupal made their projects.
58

58

00:04:02,600  -->  00:04:05,180
They have also raised an obscene amount of money,
59

59

00:04:05,180  -->  00:04:08,220
and they have something like well over 600 employees.
60

60

00:04:08,220  -->  00:04:11,460
SquareSpace is worth knowing as they decided to go
61

61

00:04:11,460  -->  00:04:18,630
as far to the "closed - limited customization" 
side of the spectrum as they possibly could.
62

62

00:04:18,630  -->  00:04:23,540
On SquareSpace, you can create a website within a given set of templates,
63

63

00:04:23,540  -->  00:04:27,440
and you can only edit within those templates so many different things.
64

64

00:04:27,440  -->  00:04:30,510
Want a layout they don't offer? Tough luck.
65

65

00:04:30,510  -->  00:04:35,280
Want to host your site, say, off of SquareSpace? No way, Jose.
66

66

00:04:35,280  -->  00:04:38,580
Want to use a third party template for your design?
67

67

00:04:38,580  -->  00:04:43,550
What do you think this is, a website that lets you do things?
68

68

00:04:43,550  -->  00:04:45,820
SquareSpaces' main angle is design.
69

69

00:04:45,820  -->  00:04:51,080
They focus all their effort and all their money 
on making the prettiest looking websites they can,
70

70

00:04:51,080  -->  00:04:55,800
because, well... what else do you care about in a website besides prettiness?
71

71

00:04:55,800  -->  00:04:58,700
And this is very telling. They are, after all, going for people
72

72

00:04:58,700  -->  00:05:03,000
that are either the least tech savvy of the bunch, or simply
73

73

00:05:03,000  -->  00:05:07,680
the least willing to put large amounts of effort into customizing their site.
74

74

00:05:07,680  -->  00:05:08,850
So, did it work?
75

75

00:05:08,850  -->  00:05:10,900
Well, you'd have to try it out for yourself.
76

76

00:05:10,900  -->  00:05:14,620
I will admit, they do have some very sharp looking websites,
77

77

00:05:14,620  -->  00:05:19,500
and as long as you stay within their limited set of use cases,
78

78

00:05:19,500  -->  00:05:21,930
you can come away with something that actually looks pretty sweet.
79

79

00:05:21,930  -->  00:05:23,500
Now, on to the second one, Weebly.
80

80

00:05:23,500  -->  00:05:27,530
Kind of like wobbly, weebly, I don't really know how they came up with the name.
81

81

00:05:27,530  -->  00:05:32,850
Now, why do I introduce Weebly and, let's say, not Wix.com?
82

82

00:05:32,850  -->  00:05:34,210
I don't know if you've ever heard of Wix.
83

83

00:05:34,210  -->  00:05:38,110
Well, the reason why is because Wix.com is basically another SquareSpace.
84

84

00:05:38,110  -->  00:05:44,250
Limited control over what you can do and very closed end to end system.
85

85

00:05:44,250  -->  00:05:47,810
There's really not enough difference to point out, although I guess, though,
86

86

00:05:47,810  -->  00:05:51,020
if you have some free time, still check them out. It's worth seeing it.
87

87

00:05:51,020  -->  00:05:53,960
Now, Weebly sticks to the WYSIWYG paradigm religiously,
88

88

00:05:53,960  -->  00:05:58,400
but unlike SquareSpace, it lets you have some customization control.
89

89

00:05:58,400  -->  00:06:01,800
You can install integrations, you can install third party themes,
90

90

00:06:01,800  -->  00:06:04,340
you can move things around a little bit more.
91

91

00:06:04,340  -->  00:06:08,570
Like SquareSpace, it's designed to be as easy as possible to use,
92

92

00:06:08,570  -->  00:06:13,280
and it generally targets the same group of 
non-technical business owners and freelancers.
93

93

00:06:13,280  -->  00:06:20,260
Unlike SquareSpace, they are less popular, 
have raised less money, only 6-10 billion or trillion,
94

94

00:06:20,260  -->  00:06:24,310
and they did not start out targeting businesses, like SquareSpace is doing.
95

95

00:06:24,310  -->  00:06:30,830
They actually started off as a personal website or a personal portfolio site creator.
96

96

00:06:30,830  -->  00:06:33,400
It wasn't until later when they started adding more and more features
97

97

00:06:33,400  -->  00:06:37,900
that you could start using it for a whole lot more than just the site that says who I am.
98

98

00:06:37,900  -->  00:06:42,110
But remember, its genesis story was in personal portfolios you put online.
99

99

00:06:42,110  -->  00:06:46,580
Also unlike SquareSpace, Weebly had a bit of an ISIS problem.
100

100

00:06:46,580  -->  00:06:51,200
Apparently, extremist Jihadists found the user interface of Weebly to be
101

101

00:06:51,200  -->  00:06:55,250
just exactly what they needed. Very intuitive and with great customer support,
102

102

00:06:55,250  -->  00:06:58,780
exactly what you need for warning the world about infidels.
103

103

00:06:58,780  -->  00:06:59,720
I digress.
104

104

00:06:59,720  -->  00:07:02,760
All right, now the last one we're going to talk about is Shopify.
105

105

00:07:02,760  -->  00:07:07,170
If you haven't noticed from the last lecture, there is a pattern here.
106

106

00:07:07,170  -->  00:07:11,370
People notice a need in the market for creating websites, they rush to fill it,
107

107

00:07:11,370  -->  00:07:15,240
and in their rush they always forget about poor, poor e-commerce.
108

108

00:07:15,240  -->  00:07:17,840
That's exactly what Shopify is for.
109

109

00:07:17,840  -->  00:07:23,780
Shopify is the WYSIWYG, highly funded, 
and limited customization version of Magento.
110

110

00:07:23,780  -->  00:07:27,090
With Shopify you can set up a store really quickly,
111

111

00:07:27,090  -->  00:07:31,220
and you can add all sorts of cool advanced features and integrations,
112

112

00:07:31,220  -->  00:07:36,830
something that Magento can offer, but takes 
significantly more effort to do on their platform.
113

113

00:07:36,830  -->  00:07:40,770
Worth noting, Shopify is opening up and letting people customize more and more.
114

114

00:07:40,770  -->  00:07:45,040
But they still operate like a drag and drop builder for a store.
115

115

00:07:45,040  -->  00:07:52,890
And unlike Magento, Shopify takes a percentage 
of your store's sales, as well as a weekly subscription.
116

116

00:07:52,890  -->  00:07:54,180
So keep that in mind.
117

117

00:07:54,180  -->  00:07:58,500
Shopify, again, also worth noting, is written in Ruby on Rails, also known as
118

118

00:07:58,500  -->  00:08:03,460
that trendy language that makes you sound cool, but is actually a nightmare to hire for.
119

119

00:08:03,460  -->  00:08:04,680
All right, that's enough talk.
120

120

00:08:04,680  -->  00:08:07,700
In the next lectures, let's play around with some of these
121

121

00:08:07,700  -->  00:08:10,130
so you can see in the flesh what they do.
122

122

00:08:10,130  -->  00:08:11,120
See you then!
