00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:01,630
Hey guys, welcome back.
2

2

00:00:01,630  -->  00:00:04,640
So, in this lecture we're going to get a little bit more in depth
3

3

00:00:04,640  -->  00:00:07,770
with the concept we learned last lecture, tech stacks.
4

4

00:00:07,770  -->  00:00:11,840
Tech stacks, if you don't remember, or you 
skipped the lecture for some reason,
5

5

00:00:11,840  -->  00:00:15,420
are like houses, or sandwiches, or hamburgers.
6

6

00:00:15,420  -->  00:00:21,250
They're a combination of technology that is 
slammed together to make a delicious system.
7

7

00:00:21,250  -->  00:00:25,650
On the web, we for the most part 
need to make four different decisions.
8

8

00:00:25,650  -->  00:00:30,310
Number one, an operating system, number two, a server system,
9

9

00:00:30,310  -->  00:00:34,170
number three, a database, and number four, a back-end language.
10

10

00:00:34,170  -->  00:00:38,500
Now, some of you out there who are more astute 
than the others, might have asked yourselves
11

11

00:00:38,500  -->  00:00:41,410
"Why is it that we don't pick a front-end language
12

12

00:00:41,410  -->  00:00:44,740
in that stack to make our sandwich much larger?"
13

13

00:00:44,740  -->  00:00:49,250
Well, the reason why that is, and the simple truth is that everyone
14

14

00:00:49,250  -->  00:00:56,050
uses the same technology for the front-end, 
so there's no point in specifying what it is.
15

15

00:00:56,050  -->  00:01:03,330
Every single person or project will use HTML, CSS, 
and JavaScript, there's no escaping that.
16

16

00:01:03,330  -->  00:01:08,570
The rest of the technology process is 
indeed modular and indeed does change.
17

17

00:01:08,570  -->  00:01:14,870
So let's take a deeper peak at some of the other 
common stacks and why they might be popular.
18

18

00:01:14,870  -->  00:01:19,540
The first one we covered as an example 
is an everyday household item called LAMP.
19

19

00:01:19,540  -->  00:01:22,080
That one stood for... anyone? Anyone?
20

20

00:01:22,080  -->  00:01:27,020
Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP.
21

21

00:01:27,020  -->  00:01:29,930
This is the classic design and the go-to for people
22

22

00:01:29,930  -->  00:01:32,190
who are just building their first application.
23

23

00:01:32,190  -->  00:01:35,830
It's classic because it's used probably the most often.
24

24

00:01:35,830  -->  00:01:37,990
And that's the case for a good reason.
25

25

00:01:37,990  -->  00:01:43,270
Each piece of technology in this stack is well 
supported and has been around for quite a while.
26

26

00:01:43,270  -->  00:01:46,250
Now, the downside to that, of course, is that older means
27

27

00:01:46,250  -->  00:01:49,540
it hasn't yet picked up on some of 
the newer advances in technology
28

28

00:01:49,540  -->  00:01:53,440
and thus could be giving up some efficiency, theoretically.
29

29

00:01:53,440  -->  00:01:56,080
So that's a good baseline for us to understand this.
30

30

00:01:56,080  -->  00:01:59,580
LAMP is the vanilla ice cream of technology stacks.
31

31

00:01:59,580  -->  00:02:03,730
When in doubt, it's often the case that one opts for this classic setup.
32

32

00:02:03,730  -->  00:02:09,830
Ok, so what might happen if, say, I have 
different needs for my technology?
33

33

00:02:09,830  -->  00:02:13,230
Well, there's lots of different scenarios, so let's explore a couple.
34

34

00:02:13,230  -->  00:02:17,040
Let's say I'm at a big company, or I'm in an industry
35

35

00:02:17,040  -->  00:02:20,940
that has strong concerns for things like security and compliance.
36

36

00:02:20,940  -->  00:02:25,550
These are industries like finance, healthcare, ed tech, you know them.
37

37

00:02:25,550  -->  00:02:31,980
Well, in this specific type of scenario, one of the 
most popular stacks opted for is called WINS.
38

38

00:02:31,980  -->  00:02:36,750
WINS, like Donald Trump wins the presidential election.
39

39

00:02:36,750  -->  00:02:40,230
I'm going to pause the camera right now to go cry.
40

40

00:02:40,230  -->  00:02:46,540
Yes, WINS, like you're wincing at the screen 
because this is getting a little bit obscure.
41

41

00:02:46,540  -->  00:02:48,800
Took a beat line in the politics.
42

42

00:02:48,800  -->  00:02:51,660
Now what you can guess what WINS stands for without Googling it,
43

43

00:02:51,660  -->  00:02:55,340
I'll give you a million dollars. I don't have a 
million dollars, but I can give you some cash.
44

44

00:02:55,340  -->  00:03:05,410
WINS stands for Windows Server, IIS Server, 
.NET, and Microsoft SQL Server. D'oh.
45

45

00:03:05,410  -->  00:03:10,920
Windows Server, in this instance, works as the 
operating system, hence why it's in the first position,
46

46

00:03:10,920  -->  00:03:18,730
the IIS Server acts as the system that routes 
connections to the right information on the server.
47

47

00:03:18,730  -->  00:03:24,170
It's often called the host, like a host 
who takes you to the right table.
48

48

00:03:24,170  -->  00:03:26,900
Remember, this is the equivalent of Apache in LAMP
49

49

00:03:26,900  -->  00:03:31,850
.NET serves as a backend, which is a 
language developed by Microsoft
50

50

00:03:31,850  -->  00:03:36,120
and used almost exclusively in large companies, and then Microsoft
51

51

00:03:36,120  -->  00:03:42,150
has its own version of the SQL database, which 
they very creatively called Microsoft SQL.
52

52

00:03:42,150  -->  00:03:44,450
This stack, great for big enterprises.
53

53

00:03:44,450  -->  00:03:48,060
The focus is on security and on IP protection.
54

54

00:03:48,060  -->  00:03:52,600
Everything in this is backed by a large for-profit company.
55

55

00:03:52,600  -->  00:03:57,000
The downsides, well, it's slow as crap to use, it's expensive,
56

56

00:03:57,000  -->  00:03:59,840
and you often have to train your employees on how to use it,
57

57

00:03:59,840  -->  00:04:03,470
because there isn't a sufficient number of programmers
58

58

00:04:03,470  -->  00:04:07,320
learning exclusively systems built by Microsoft.
59

59

00:04:07,320  -->  00:04:11,290
Let's explore another scenario and what tech stack you might see.
60

60

00:04:11,290  -->  00:04:16,950
What about a small scrappy startup that 
has a product that needs to be cutting edge,
61

61

00:04:16,950  -->  00:04:21,360
it needs to load extremely fast, and it needs to focus on
62

62

00:04:21,360  -->  00:04:25,600
polish for the end user, for the best user experience.
63

63

00:04:25,600  -->  00:04:32,960
A great example of stack for this type 
of situation would be one called MEAN.
64

64

00:04:32,960  -->  00:04:35,000
Now, I don't really expect you to understand this one,
65

65

00:04:35,000  -->  00:04:39,650
so we're just going to kind of breeze through it, 
and hopefully you pick up a little bit.
66

66

00:04:39,650  -->  00:04:43,320
Later on, we actually have dedicated 
lectures for each of these technologies,
67

67

00:04:43,320  -->  00:04:47,800
so if it doesn't make sense now, hopefully 
it will make a little bit more sense later.
68

68

00:04:47,800  -->  00:04:58,270
MEAN stands for MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.Js, and Node.Js.
69

69

00:04:58,270  -->  00:05:00,270
I don't know if you've ever heard this phrase before,
70

70

00:05:00,270  -->  00:05:04,070
but it's that "JavaScript is eating the world."
71

71

00:05:04,070  -->  00:05:07,300
The reason why people will often say 
that is JavaScript is now being used
72

72

00:05:07,300  -->  00:05:11,140
as a back-end language as well as a front-end language.
73

73

00:05:11,140  -->  00:05:15,770
We're going to get more into this later, as we 
get into more and more advanced topics,
74

74

00:05:15,770  -->  00:05:21,350
because this concept and why it's making 
huge changes, it's kind of hard to understand.
75

75

00:05:21,350  -->  00:05:25,290
Ok, so those are the three examples of common tech stacks.
76

76

00:05:25,290  -->  00:05:28,420
It's helpful to know at least a couple and to know that
77

77

00:05:28,420  -->  00:05:32,200
different companies have different needs, and they're going to use
78

78

00:05:32,200  -->  00:05:35,310
different stacks depending on different circumstances.
79

79

00:05:35,310  -->  00:05:39,300
Pros and cons really to all of them, but it's important just to know
80

80

00:05:39,300  -->  00:05:42,910
that there are many different ways to "skin the cat," so to speak.
81

81

00:05:42,910  -->  00:05:46,680
All right, go yonder and pick ye technology stack.
82

82

00:05:46,680  -->  00:05:47,700
See you in the next lecture!
