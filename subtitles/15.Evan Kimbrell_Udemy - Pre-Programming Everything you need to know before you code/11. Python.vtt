00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:01.270
All right guys, welcome back.
2

2

00:00:01.270  -->  00:00:04.540
In this lecture, we're going to get our first 
introduction to back-end languages,
3

3

00:00:04.540  -->  00:00:07.870
and what better language to start with than Python?
4

4

00:00:07.870  -->  00:00:09.760
Why is it named Python? You might ask.
5

5

00:00:09.760  -->  00:00:15.090
Well, because pythons are huge snakes and 
that is cool. As simple as that, moving on.
6

6

00:00:15.090  -->  00:00:18.180
Now, remember, back-end languages are generally considered
7

7

00:00:18.180  -->  00:00:21.490
to be more complex and at the same time more capable.
8

8

00:00:21.490  -->  00:00:24.730
Back-end languages are designed for manipulating information,
9

9

00:00:24.730  -->  00:00:29.940
making complex calculations, and most 
of the "magic" of any web application.
10

10

00:00:29.940  -->  00:00:35.040
If front-end is what displays the map and 
adds buttons to your Google Maps,
11

11

00:00:35.040  -->  00:00:39.300
the back-end is what calculates your route 
given the weather, the traffic,
12

12

00:00:39.300  -->  00:00:44.340
the distance, the time of the day, and about 
50 other circumstances and variables.
13

13

00:00:44.340  -->  00:00:46.080
Python is known for a couple of things.
14

14

00:00:46.080  -->  00:00:51.050
One, it's known to be versatile, and two, it's especially
15

15

00:00:51.050  -->  00:00:54.090
easy to learn, relative to other back-end languages.
16

16

00:00:54.090  -->  00:00:57.330
Some of the languages we're going to talk about, like Ruby and PHP,
17

17

00:00:57.330  -->  00:01:01.070
can only be made to manipulate web pages and work with servers.
18

18

00:01:01.070  -->  00:01:03.870
Python, on the other hand, once you know how to use it,
19

19

00:01:03.870  -->  00:01:07.260
you can write web apps, you can write desktop applications,
20

20

00:01:07.260  -->  00:01:10.540
you can use it for things like data analysis and visualization,
21

21

00:01:10.540  -->  00:01:14.080
you can use for numerical computing, web scraping,
22

22

00:01:14.080  -->  00:01:17.410
and you can even use it in scientific computing applications.
23

23

00:01:17.410  -->  00:01:22.010
You'll often see hospitals using 
software that's manipulated by Python.
24

24

00:01:22.010  -->  00:01:25.790
And it's because of that that it's considered a 
general purpose programming language.
25

25

00:01:25.790  -->  00:01:31.100
The second thing is that it's the easiest to 
read and thus the easiest to learn.
26

26

00:01:31.100  -->  00:01:37.240
It's called an "expressive language" because it 
resembles very closely the English language.
27

27

00:01:37.240  -->  00:01:41.040
One of the bigger things people get tripped up on 
when they start learning how to program
28

28

00:01:41.040  -->  00:01:45.910
is the list of unnecessarily complicated rules and required rituals.
29

29

00:01:45.910  -->  00:01:50.510
Most languages make you include and 
memorize things like periods, and hashtags,
30

30

00:01:50.510  -->  00:01:56.120
curly braces, triple back slashes, multiple variations 
of equal signs, it just goes on and on.
31

31

00:01:56.120  -->  00:01:58.790
Take this little snippet of code, for example.
32

32

00:01:58.790  -->  00:02:03.030
Ok, so this example you're looking at is PHP, 
and what it says is that
33

33

00:02:03.030  -->  00:02:08.150
"if a does not equal five then do something."
34

34

00:02:08.150  -->  00:02:13.040
The exclamation point plus the equal sign means "does not equal,"
35

35

00:02:13.040  -->  00:02:15.440
and the a in this case is what's called a variable.
36

36

00:02:15.440  -->  00:02:16.710
We'll actually explain that later.
37

37

00:02:16.710  -->  00:02:18.550
Really, don't try to think too hard on this stuff, because
38

38

00:02:18.550  -->  00:02:20.710
we'll cover the basics actually in the next section.
39

39

00:02:20.710  -->  00:02:22.730
If we got any of the characters wrong in this snippet
40

40

00:02:22.730  -->  00:02:25.630
that we're looking at, then the command would be incorrect.
41

41

00:02:25.630  -->  00:02:27.950
Now, here is the Python version.
42

42

00:02:27.950  -->  00:02:30.780
It almost looks like someone spoke this out loud
43

43

00:02:30.780  -->  00:02:34.530
verbally into their Siri, and then Siri just wrote it down.
44

44

00:02:34.530  -->  00:02:38.500
Why memorize "exclamation point equal sign means is not"
45

45

00:02:38.500  -->  00:02:41.420
if you can just remember "is not"?
46

46

00:02:41.420  -->  00:02:43.800
So that's a big upside and appeal to this language
47

47

00:02:43.800  -->  00:02:45.870
and a large reason why it's in demand.
48

48

00:02:45.870  -->  00:02:49.070
It's widely considered the best first language to learn and it's
49

49

00:02:49.070  -->  00:02:51.880
the most commonly taught language in universities.
50

50

00:02:51.880  -->  00:02:54.560
Sounds great? Ok. Well, who uses it?
51

51

00:02:54.560  -->  00:02:57.060
Well, the most notable is Google.
52

52

00:02:57.060  -->  00:03:00.620
That Google Maps example I gave you is actually true,
53

53

00:03:00.620  -->  00:03:05.000
they use Python to pull and display the information you need.
54

54

00:03:05.000  -->  00:03:08.200
Other notables I can think of are YouTube, Dropbox,
55

55

00:03:08.200  -->  00:03:12.170
even NASA makes a big stink about how much they love Python.
56

56

00:03:12.170  -->  00:03:16.900
Now, not all that glitters is gold, and, of course, 
Python has some issues it's dealing with.
57

57

00:03:16.900  -->  00:03:20.750
First of all, because it's so simple and expressive, that means it's
58

58

00:03:20.750  -->  00:03:24.400
what we call a high level language (remember that from before?).
59

59

00:03:24.400  -->  00:03:28.110
High level languages are the farthest away from machine code.
60

60

00:03:28.110  -->  00:03:33.490
The farther away from machine code you are, 
the more efficient and easy you are to use,
61

61

00:03:33.490  -->  00:03:36.790
but the less precise you can be with it.
62

62

00:03:36.790  -->  00:03:40.590
Because Python skips over a lot of the 
tediousness from other languages,
63

63

00:03:40.590  -->  00:03:43.830
it can actually be harder to do certain things and have
64

64

00:03:43.830  -->  00:03:46.730
a greater control over what you're trying to accomplish.
65

65

00:03:46.730  -->  00:03:49.530
The downside to being a general purpose language is that,
66

66

00:03:49.530  -->  00:03:52.320
and hopefully you've picked this up by now,
67

67

00:03:52.320  -->  00:03:56.750
is that web code is designed to be understood by a browser,
68

68

00:03:56.750  -->  00:04:02.150
desktop code to be understood by a desktop 
operating system, server code by a server.
69

69

00:04:02.150  -->  00:04:05.250
That means every time you use it, you have to install
70

70

00:04:05.250  -->  00:04:08.820
other technologies to help interpret the code for you.
71

71

00:04:08.820  -->  00:04:12.320
If you want to program Python for your desktop, then you need
72

72

00:04:12.320  -->  00:04:17.260
to install a program that acts as an 
interpreter for your operating system.
73

73

00:04:17.260  -->  00:04:20.070
On a website, you also need an interpreter.
74

74

00:04:20.070  -->  00:04:22.900
Does that mean anything to you and should it?
75

75

00:04:22.900  -->  00:04:29.280
Well, sure, it's worth knowing this, because this is 
a common problem across most languages.
76

76

00:04:29.280  -->  00:04:30.670
Ok, let's recap.
77

77

00:04:30.670  -->  00:04:33.520
Python is a very popular programming language that
78

78

00:04:33.520  -->  00:04:36.350
can be used on all sorts of different applications.
79

79

00:04:36.350  -->  00:04:38.860
It's also the easiest to learn and understand,
80

80

00:04:38.860  -->  00:04:43.250
because it's the least complicated and 
the closest to actual human language.
81

81

00:04:43.250  -->  00:04:47.160
Google uses it, YouTube loves it, Dropbox loves it.
82

82

00:04:47.160  -->  00:04:50.480
As a result, it's quite popular and in demand,
83

83

00:04:50.480  -->  00:04:53.630
which means Python devs can be rather expensive.
84

84

00:04:53.630  -->  00:04:56.290
All right, that's all you need to know about Python for now.
85

85

00:04:56.290  -->  00:04:57.470
See you in the next lecture!
