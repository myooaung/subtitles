00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:04.650
Let's now make this application a little prettier by using

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.430
some CSS and also by adding a Google font.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.240
The first thing if we open up the sidebar and go into our project,

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:21.550
let's create the styles.css and then link this in the head of our index.html.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.460
I've already chosen a font from Google Fonts,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.400
but you can choose any different one which you prefer.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.840
This is the one I'm going to use,

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.415
which is on the homepage,

00:00:35.415 --> 00:00:39.290
but you can choose or search for a different value up at the top.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.060
To include this, just like the earlier project,

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.055
let's click on this and then we can select any of the font weights.

00:00:46.055 --> 00:00:48.750
I'm going to go for the 300,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.750
the 500 and a bold 700 version.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:00.240
Embed, and then let's copy this link which you can place in our index page,

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.450
just above our style sheet,

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.675
and then our font family is placed in our styles.css.

00:01:07.675 --> 00:01:11.300
We can add this in the root under the HTML element.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.870
Paste this in and we can also select a root font-size.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.015
I'm going to go for 10 pixels.

00:01:17.015 --> 00:01:19.160
You can also set a background color.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.615
This is going to be for the section behind our content.

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:25.275
If we stretch the browser on the final version,

00:01:25.275 --> 00:01:29.440
this is the color which we see outside of the body section.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.920
The volume I'm going to use is 2d3740.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.509
Let's check this is working and our style sheet has linked correctly.

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.880
Reload this and we see the background color,

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.290
we see a different font and also the font size has taken effect.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.550
The reason we see all of this background rather than it just on the outsides,

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:59.085
is because we haven't yet set a color for our body section. Let's do this now.

00:01:59.085 --> 00:02:01.560
First of all, some padding which is going to give you

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.160
some spacing around our edges of 1rem,

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.095
which is 10 pixels,

00:02:07.095 --> 00:02:09.970
then a background for the section.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.530
The volume I'm going to use is 1c262f.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.890
The font is a little hard to read with this dark background,

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.435
so we can also change the font color.

00:02:22.435 --> 00:02:24.625
We can again use a hex value,

00:02:24.625 --> 00:02:26.125
just like we've used above,

00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:28.690
or we can also use a RGB color,

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.195
just select any of our values.

00:02:31.195 --> 00:02:34.900
An RGB color is a way to combine red,

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.305
green, and blue values to make a particular color.

00:02:38.305 --> 00:02:41.425
I'm going to go for a red value of 230,

00:02:41.425 --> 00:02:46.820
225 for the green and 225 for the blue.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.405
This is going to give us this light white color,

00:02:50.405 --> 00:02:53.990
which will take effect for all of our body section.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.825
To find out more about these particular color values,

00:02:56.825 --> 00:03:00.360
we can do a search for HTML color picker.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.900
There is various color pickers which you can see online,

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.980
or this default one which comes with the search engine.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.515
We can see for any shade which we select,

00:03:09.515 --> 00:03:11.755
have a red, green, and blue value,

00:03:11.755 --> 00:03:15.110
and also the equivalent hex value which we've looked at just above,

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.230
along with some different values here too.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.230
This is just a couple of different ways you can use to select color values.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.470
Next back over in the body section,

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:32.044
the width of 90 percent just to restrict the overall width of the project,

00:03:32.044 --> 00:03:36.450
and also center this with margin zero auto.

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.370
Remember, if we didn't have this auto value,

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.220
this will be pushed over.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.710
Let's just check this.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.400
This will be pushed over on the left of the project.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.235
But now with the auto value on the left and right,

00:03:49.235 --> 00:03:52.870
this has now divided up equally on both sides.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.940
After the body, lets go for the logo section,

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.255
which is at the very top.

00:03:58.255 --> 00:04:02.935
We can sensor this with text-align center.

00:04:02.935 --> 00:04:06.425
The current fill color for our image at the top

00:04:06.425 --> 00:04:09.860
doesn't currently stand out too well on this darker background.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.780
Just like we see in the final version,

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.555
we can also change this too.

00:04:13.555 --> 00:04:16.440
We can also target this in the CSS,

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.990
or we can do this over in our index.html.

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:23.450
The way to do this inside of our SVG element,

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.165
is to take a look at the path section.

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:30.865
Each one of these sections has a fill attribute which we can change.

00:04:30.865 --> 00:04:34.370
I want to change this to be a value of gray,

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.580
refresh, and now the head section is gray,

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.360
and we can also do the same for the body section.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.660
Back over to our style sheet,

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.260
we're going to now move down to the form section,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.065
which is going to be the wrapper for our label,

00:04:51.065 --> 00:04:54.355
the form inputs and also the submit button.

00:04:54.355 --> 00:04:59.555
All we need to do for this wrapper is to set the text line into the center.

00:04:59.555 --> 00:05:04.770
We need to make the label a little larger, so let's target this.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.565
The font size, I want to go for 1.8rems,

00:05:09.565 --> 00:05:15.580
which is equivalent of 18 pixels down to the number input.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.229
First target all of the form inputs,

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:20.825
then inside the square brackets,

00:05:20.825 --> 00:05:24.150
we can select our particular type of number.

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.470
Not any type of number is not particularly important for

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.490
this project since we don't have multiple inputs,

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.185
but this way we are covered four a project was to grow at a later stage.

00:05:35.185 --> 00:05:39.830
By default, the form input won't inherit the rest of the font family.

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.750
We can see this is a completely different font than the rest of the project.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.080
Font family, we can set this to be inherit.

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:54.260
Lets now inherit the font style from the rest of the project.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.130
The background, to keep things consistent.

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.665
Let's also grab the same RGB color,

00:06:00.665 --> 00:06:03.715
which we used for the lighter text.

00:06:03.715 --> 00:06:07.095
The width of 80 percent.

00:06:07.095 --> 00:06:10.455
Some spacing on the top and bottom,

00:06:10.455 --> 00:06:15.220
1rem and then a value of zero on the left and right.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.545
To make the actual form input larger too,

00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:21.270
we can add some padding inside.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.480
0.8rems on the top and bottom,

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.670
and then zero on the left and right.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.170
Remove the default border with border none,

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:39.130
a font-size to make this a little larger when you use inputs or value.

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:46.780
Let's go for our 1.2rems and also set the text-align to be centered.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:53.065
Moving down, the next thing we have is this form submit button.

00:06:53.065 --> 00:06:55.190
To make this just like the finished version,

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:56.885
we're going to add a background color.

00:06:56.885 --> 00:07:00.845
We're going to add a 50 percent border-radius to make this fully rounded,

00:07:00.845 --> 00:07:03.950
along with setting the width and height.

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:07.255
Let's target our bottom element.

00:07:07.255 --> 00:07:11.490
Again, we also need to inherit the font family.

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:19.590
The font size a little larger and also the font weight is going to be bolder too.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.050
To make this a rounded bottom,

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.380
we're also going to set a width and also an equal height.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:34.650
I'm going to go for eight pixels and also a matching value for the height too.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:38.805
Let's see how this is looking inside the browser.

00:07:38.805 --> 00:07:41.120
This is equal width and height,

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.375
but we also need to round the corners with the border-radius,

00:07:44.375 --> 00:07:47.670
and also remove any default borders.

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:50.970
Let's start with border none,

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:54.090
and then the border-radius,

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:57.900
which has a value of 50 percent.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:01.200
To give this the blue color we see in the final version,

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.990
we need to set the background color.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:09.780
I want to go for a hex value which is equal to 0ad9ff,

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:12.915
followed by some margin values.

00:08:12.915 --> 00:08:16.485
On the very top, 0.5rems on the top,

00:08:16.485 --> 00:08:18.240
zero on the right,

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.620
1rem on the bottom,

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.210
and then zero on the left.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.850
Moving down to our last seven days values,

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:28.800
this is inside of another list.

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:34.335
Remove the default padding with the value of zero,

00:08:34.335 --> 00:08:37.625
and we also need to remove the list item bullets,

00:08:37.625 --> 00:08:43.200
and then we can set this to go across the page by setting the display type to be flex.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.840
Remove the bullets with the list-style to be

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:54.610
none leaving us with the dashes which we have for each list item.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:57.370
Taking a look at the finished version,

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:01.074
we also have some equal spacing between each one of these items,

00:09:01.074 --> 00:09:06.560
and we can do this by setting justify content to have space between.

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:14.470
On the list is a step in the right direction for styling the section.

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:19.070
The next thing we need to do is to target each one of our list items.

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:24.415
Starting with the borders, each one of these items stands out more.

00:09:24.415 --> 00:09:26.875
Let's go for a value of one pixel,

00:09:26.875 --> 00:09:34.835
a solid line, and then some padding inside of these list items to add some spacing.

00:09:34.835 --> 00:09:40.175
One rem on the top and bottom and 1.5 on the left and right.

00:09:40.175 --> 00:09:43.730
Within this section, let's target the level three heading,

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:46.760
increase the font size and also add some padding to give

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.915
it some spacing just like on the final version.

00:09:49.915 --> 00:09:52.530
To do this often in the index.html,

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:58.040
we have a section with the class of entries wrapper. Let's target this.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:03.990
Some can work with our a level three heading and also add some spacing to our sections.

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:07.955
This is a class so we need the dots.

00:10:07.955 --> 00:10:10.370
First of all, we can add some padding to give this

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:13.525
some spacing on the top and bottom of 1rem,

00:10:13.525 --> 00:10:16.295
zero on the left and right,

00:10:16.295 --> 00:10:22.540
and then also set the default font size to be 1.6rems.

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:29.480
Next up the level three heading which is for the title of last seven days.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:33.755
We can remove any default margin which the browser provides,

00:10:33.755 --> 00:10:38.530
and you can see this removes the default margin from the very top of our heading.

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:42.405
We can push this into the center, with text-align.

00:10:42.405 --> 00:10:44.270
This is also pretty bold,

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:48.030
so let's change the font weight to be lighter.

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:53.075
Below this, we have all of the rest of the information for our app.

00:10:53.075 --> 00:10:57.025
We have the total, the distances and also the weekly height.

00:10:57.025 --> 00:11:00.925
This is all wrapped in a section with the class of data.

00:11:00.925 --> 00:11:04.030
Moving down, let's target this.

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:11.490
First of all, we can set the default font size to be a little larger, so 1.4rems.

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:16.025
Each one of our sections is surrounded inside of a div two,

00:11:16.025 --> 00:11:21.780
so we can target.data and then div.

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:25.070
Let's begin with the background color for each one of our sections.

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:31.015
The value I'm going to use is going to be 141c22.

00:11:31.015 --> 00:11:34.645
The display type is going to be equal to flex.

00:11:34.645 --> 00:11:40.510
We can make use of the flexbox to center our label and also the value on the same line,

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:43.370
along with also adding some space in between.

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:47.800
We first place these onto their own line with a line item center,

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.425
and now it's at the spacing in between,

00:11:50.425 --> 00:11:53.390
we can use justify content.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.185
This now pushes all of our values over to the right.

00:12:00.185 --> 00:12:02.655
The next thing to do is to add some padding.

00:12:02.655 --> 00:12:04.510
These are not up against the left and

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:08.170
right edges and also some margin to the outside of our div,

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:11.640
so all three sections have some space in between.

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.630
First of all, the margin on the top and bottom,

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:17.150
I'm going to use 0.5rems,

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:19.720
zero on the left and right,

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:23.110
and then some padding inside of our divs.

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:26.300
We already have some spacing on the top and bottom so let's

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:29.435
just add some spacing on the left and right.

00:12:29.435 --> 00:12:33.865
Zero and then 1rem.

00:12:33.865 --> 00:12:37.925
This is now the majority of the styling for our application.

00:12:37.925 --> 00:12:40.070
We just need to target the section at

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:43.765
the bottom later on when we add the progress circle.

00:12:43.765 --> 00:12:45.500
But for now though, let's move on to

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:48.545
the next video and add some JavaScript to our project,

00:12:48.545 --> 00:12:51.510
so we can update our entries.
