00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.115
Hey, welcome to this class.

00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:13.860
If you are a web development beginner, come on,

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.590
so just jump in, and build some fun projects.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.840
You've came to the right place.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.740
The idea behind this series is to show you what you can do

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.550
with regular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.830
When it comes to using any frameworks,

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.199
any boilerplate, any libraries,

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.210
or any templates, instead,

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.980
we're going to be building everything completely from scratch,

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:42.130
step-by-step to show you how these free technologies all work together.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.575
The project for this class is a running [inaudible] application,

00:00:47.575 --> 00:00:51.250
where the user can log how many miles they have run each day.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.960
We have an input field at the very top,

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.390
where we can log the number of miles and these will be

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.465
recorded as the last seven days values.

00:00:59.465 --> 00:01:01.145
If you add a second one,

00:01:01.145 --> 00:01:03.920
this will then be added over on the right and it stores

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.860
the last seven values which we enter.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.380
All these values are then stored just below.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.795
We can see the total number of miles.

00:01:11.795 --> 00:01:15.145
This total is then divided up by the number of entries,

00:01:15.145 --> 00:01:17.165
to give us a average too,

00:01:17.165 --> 00:01:22.225
along what's on the highest entry which the user has entered for this week too.

00:01:22.225 --> 00:01:24.020
In addition to this just below,

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.570
we'll also add a progress circle too,

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.340
where we can add in a weekly target,

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.170
and then this progress circle will be updated for each value which the user adds.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.850
This will give us a nice visual feedback of how the week is going too.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.760
This project is created completely from scratch.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.570
We'll use HTML for the user interface,

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.790
we'll add custom font,

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.570
we'll add styling, we'll learn all about the JavaScript fundamentals such as functions,

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.715
creating variables and constants,

00:01:52.715 --> 00:01:55.445
we'll work with arrays, we'll create calculations,

00:01:55.445 --> 00:01:58.820
we'll work with the DOM, we'll work with events, conditional statements,

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.405
and all the fundamentals which you will need in JavaScript.

00:02:02.405 --> 00:02:05.300
Your progress circle will also be fully custom too.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.950
We'll make use of JavaScript,

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.099
and also CSS to keep this updated.

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:15.180
Well, thanks for checking out this class and I'll see you in the first lesson.
