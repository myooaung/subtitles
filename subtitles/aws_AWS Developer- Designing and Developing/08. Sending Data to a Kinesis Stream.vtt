00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.340
Now that we've created a Kinesis Stream, we need to start sending records to it.

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.200
Let's start by just taking a look at a file.

3
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:14.190
Go to the lib/simulation folder and open the resolution.js file.

4
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.520
This file is used once the simulation is complete and the

5
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.840
records need to be sent to SQS and kinesis.

6
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.270
On Lines 8 and 9, we define variables for the stream name and partition key.

7
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.380
The partition key is a value that kinesis hashes and uses to segment the

8
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.010
data record to a specific shard. Even with a single shard,

9
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.340
this is a required field when pushing data to kinesis.

10
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:47.440
Now let's open the kinesis.js file in the lib/data/lib folder.

11
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.530
This is another simple file that performs one operation.

12
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.350
Go ahead and update your region first on Line 3. The send function on

13
00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.080
Line 7 is exported so the simulation.js file can use it.

14
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.130
Let's implement this method by creating our params const object on Line 8.

15
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.880
The first property will be data,

16
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.600
which is what will be sending to the Kinesis Stream. We

17
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.460
need to stringify it so call json.stringify passing in

18
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.190
the message function argument.

19
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.380
The next property is partition key,

20
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.940
which we can give the value of our partition function argument.

21
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.340
And the final property is StreamName, which will have the value streamName.

22
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.840
It's pretty simple.

23
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.540
Just point the data at a stream and put it up there. On Line 14, the

24
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.570
kinesis.putRecord function is called to put the record into the stream

25
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:51.000
and that's pretty much all there is to it. Now, in the next clip, we're going to set up our stream consumer.
