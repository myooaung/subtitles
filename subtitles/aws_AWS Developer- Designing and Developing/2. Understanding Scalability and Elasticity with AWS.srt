00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,930
In the world of the cloud and AWS, terms such as

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,290
scalability and elasticity are thrown around like they're

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,490
the most common things in the world.

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:14,880
The terms are often used interchangeably, something which I'm guilty of as well.

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,010
I've found, however,

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:20,330
that the nuances of these terms often aren't completely understood

7
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:25,160
and can result in some confusion in how each impacts your cloud

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,590
architecture with AWS. In this clip,

9
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,340
we're going to talk about each one in detail.

10
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:34,840
Scalability in terms of AWS refers to the ability for your

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,740
resources to increase or decrease in size or quantity.

12
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,390
There's a lot of infrastructure involved to make something like this happen,

13
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,840
so it's no easy task.

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,520
Many of the services in AWS are scalable by default,

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,510
which is one of the reasons that AWS is so successful.

16
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,790
Scalability is pretty simple to define,

17
00:00:55,790 --> 00:01:01,340
which is why some of the aspects of elasticity are often attributed to it.

18
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:05,280
Elasticity is the ability for your resources to scale

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,240
in response to stated criteria, often CloudWatch rules.

20
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,770
This is what happens when a load balancer adds instances

21
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,690
whenever a web application gets a lot of traffic.

22
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:22,190
Scalability is required for elasticity, but not the other way around.

23
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:25,340
Not all AWS services support elasticity,

24
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:30,540
and even those that do often need to be configured in a certain way.

25
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,780
It might seem redundant,

26
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:38,440
but the services in AWS that start with Elastic often support elasticity.

27
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,980
Scalability gives you the ability to increase or decrease your resources,

28
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,520
and elasticity lets those operations happen

29
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,740
automatically according to configured rules.

30
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,400
Together,

31
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,300
they let you sleep soundly at night with the assurance

32
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:57,640
that your applications are healthy, no matter the situation.

33
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,270
Now in the next clip,

34
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:04,000
we're going to start our path towards elasticity by creating a launch configuration.
