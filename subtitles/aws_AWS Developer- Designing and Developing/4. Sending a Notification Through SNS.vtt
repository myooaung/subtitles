00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:04.908
Now that we have a topic with one subscription,

2
00:00:04.908 --> 00:00:09.219
any message published to that topic will be sent to the subscriber.

3
00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:11.952
I've prepared some of what you need to do this.

4
00:00:11.952 --> 00:00:15.460
We just need to implement a publish function.

5
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.373
In your code editor, navigate to the lib/data/lib folder,

6
00:00:20.373 --> 00:00:23.649
and open the sns.js file.

7
00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:27.763
This files exports a publish function that is used by that same

8
00:00:27.763 --> 00:00:31.704
simulation file that we modified in the last module.

9
00:00:31.704 --> 00:00:36.882
Let's get started completing this file by adding your region on line 3.

10
00:00:36.882 --> 00:00:40.169
The next change in on line 6 where you should paste

11
00:00:40.169 --> 00:00:42.185
the ARN of the topic we created.

12
00:00:42.185 --> 00:00:44.893
You may still have it in your clipboard,

13
00:00:44.893 --> 00:00:50.610
but if not, go to your command line and copy it from the createTopic output.

14
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.759
Now let's implement this publish function.

15
00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:57.731
Create a params const object on the first line here.

16
00:00:57.731 --> 00:01:00.962
Just like the topic creation and subscription,

17
00:01:00.962 --> 00:01:03.270
there aren't many properties required.

18
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.657
The first will be TopicArn,

19
00:01:04.657 --> 00:01:11.707
which you can give the value of the TOPIC_ARN const that you configured above.

20
00:01:11.707 --> 00:01:16.763
The next property is Message, which you can set to be the msg function argument.

21
00:01:16.763 --> 00:01:20.080
With our parameters set, let's publish out the message.

22
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.242
Inside the Promise below, call sns.publish,

23
00:01:23.242 --> 00:01:27.680
passing in params as the first argument and a callback function

24
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.586
with err and data arguments as the second.

25
00:01:30.586 --> 00:01:34.931
If there's an err object, then call reject and pass it in; otherwise,

26
00:01:34.931 --> 00:01:37.060
call resolve with the data argument.

27
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.616
That's all the changes we need to complete adding

28
00:01:40.616 --> 00:01:43.469
SNS functionality to our demo app.

29
00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:51.000
Now in the next clip, we're going to configure a CloudWatch alarm to keep our application safe.
