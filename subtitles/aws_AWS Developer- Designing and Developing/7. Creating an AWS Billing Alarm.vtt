00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.140
As we begin this course, I'll assume that you already have an AWS account set up.

2
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.160
If you don't pause the video and go sign up for one now. New accounts receive

3
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.300
access to the free tier for one year so you might just want to create a new

4
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.540
account anyways for the purposes of this course.

5
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:18.750
Now,

6
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.120
one of the first things I like to do on a new account before creating

7
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.840
any resources in AWS is to set up a billing alarm.

8
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.500
This will let you know once you've accrued a certain amount of charges

9
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.490
on your account. It's nice piece of mind in case you spin up some

10
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.240
resources without being aware of the costs. I can say it has saved my

11
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.420
bacon a few times. To do this, first,

12
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.280
log into your AWS account with the root user, this will be the email address

13
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.280
that you first started the account with. In the upper right‑hand corner, click

14
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.070
on the drop down with your name to the left of the region drop‑down, select

15
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.140
the My Billing Dashboard menu option.

16
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.460
This billing dashboard will have all of your information about what

17
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.920
costs you're incurring. On the left‑hand side menu,

18
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.540
select Billing Preferences.

19
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.840
There are three options here, one is labeled Receive Billing Alerts.

20
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.840
This option can only be enabled once and then it cannot be disabled.

21
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.770
That's why I can't really demonstrate selecting it because

22
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.490
I've already enabled it on my account.

23
00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:25.670
Once it's selected,

24
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.440
we'll configure the alert by clicking this Manage Billing Alerts

25
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.440
link at the end of the section description.

26
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.940
This will send you to CloudWatch so you can create a new alarm.

27
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.710
Now select alarms in the left side menu, and then click the Create

28
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.260
Alarm button. We'll first need to select the metric we'll be

29
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.940
creating an alarm for so click Select Metric.

30
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.710
Because we already enabled the billing alerts from the billing dashboard, you

31
00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.310
should see an available metric section called Billing. Click Total Estimated

32
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.240
Charge and then select the row with your currency.

33
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.590
This is the only metric we'll select, so click Select Metric.

34
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.540
Now we will configure the amount threshold.

35
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.910
This is a dollar amount where you want the alarm to

36
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.740
trigger and send a notification.

37
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.520
Put whatever currency amount you feel comfortable with here.

38
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.600
It could be 0, it could be $5 like mine, it could be more.

39
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.540
Then click Next.

40
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.480
Now we need to configure the action to happen when the alarm is triggered.

41
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.530
You may not have a notification list already created so select Create new topic.

42
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.440
This will create an SNS topic.

43
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.140
So give the topic a name, something like Billing‑Alarm‑Topic.

44
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.940
Now enter an email address to send the notification to.

45
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.500
If you want to configure SMS instead,

46
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.410
you'll need to manually create that topic in SNS, instead of here.

47
00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:03.340
Once you enter an email, you can click Create topic, then click Next.

48
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.440
Give the alarm a unique name like Billing Alarm,

49
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.880
then hit Next, and if all the details look good in review,

50
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.190
click Create alarm.

51
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:20.440
Since we created a new SNS topic and subscription, you will need to confirm it.

52
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.040
You can use this prompt to go to SNS and resolve that.

53
00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.250
And when that's complete,

54
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:33.000
your billing alarm is fully configured and ready to let you know if charges sneak up on you.
