00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,220
Developing an application in the cloud is not always quite

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,720
the same as typical nonâ€‘cloud development.

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,410
As companies migrate to the cloud,

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,060
more and more developers are getting their first taste of

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,480
operations and infrastructure as they're directed to do

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,640
their own cloud deployments.

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,740
In your past experience,

8
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,920
you may have been used to just building your application and

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,130
then handing it over to another team or engineer to do the

10
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,940
actual deployment of the application.

11
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,090
Because of that process,

12
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,810
you may have thought of your application as only the code

13
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:36,000
you wrote and other parts as outside of your domain, but

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,460
as with everything in tech,

15
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,250
the world is changing and operations concerns are

16
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,480
consistently falling into developers laps.

17
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,110
I believe this is a good thing and will ultimately

18
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,540
improve your career as a developer.

19
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,360
It also does something else, though, and that's a sort of mind expansion.

20
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,880
Once you can utilize everything that AWS offers,

21
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,690
it changes how your applications work and how they're designed,

22
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,700
which really changes the way you think about your applications.

23
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:09,820
I've experienced this personally over the past few years when I began steady AWS

24
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,940
development and it's only improved the quality of my work.

25
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,920
I like to describe cloud development like this.

26
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,010
Basically, when you begin thinking about a new application,

27
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,540
you'll want to start with the infrastructure.

28
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,420
There are certain decisions you'll need to make,

29
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,320
such as computing, persistence,

30
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,440
routing and AWS gives you multiple options for each.

31
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:37,040
Each decision you make fundamentally shapes how your application is structured

32
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,610
and this approach is what I like to call cloud development.

33
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:43,200
With each service that we cover in this course,

34
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,870
you'll add another tool to your application development tool belt.

35
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,840
And when you approach a new feature or application,

36
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,240
you'll be able to consider how certain AWS Services might best be used.

37
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:55,880
Eventually,

38
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,880
your application will be a distributed and scalable combination

39
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:10,000
of code and services, this adds resiliency, improves maintainability, and ultimately, results in a better application.
