00:00:01,595 --> 00:00:04,041
One of my favorite things about SNS is the different

2
00:00:04,041 --> 00:00:06,167
types of notification options available.

3
00:00:06,167 --> 00:00:11,453
You're not only able to send emails, but also SMS,

4
00:00:11,453 --> 00:00:17,982
hit HTTP endpoints, trigger lambdas, or even send the messages to an SQS queue.

5
00:00:17,982 --> 00:00:22,474
We'll keep it low key for this course and just set up an SMS notification.

6
00:00:22,474 --> 00:00:26,445
We do want to know what happens with the hamster races after all, don't we?

7
00:00:26,445 --> 00:00:30,585
Open up the create‑sns‑subscription.js file.

8
00:00:30,585 --> 00:00:33,363
We'll start by adding a few values.

9
00:00:33,363 --> 00:00:36,142
First, update your region on line 4.

10
00:00:36,142 --> 00:00:41,272
Then on line 9, add your mobile number with country code and no hyphens.

11
00:00:41,272 --> 00:00:45,491
If you've got an American phone number, your country code is 1.

12
00:00:45,491 --> 00:00:46,257
You're welcome.

13
00:00:46,257 --> 00:00:52,001
On line 10, we need to enter the ARN of the topic we just created.

14
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:56,163
You can get that from the command line output from the previous clip.

15
00:00:56,163 --> 00:01:01,710
Copy this TopicArn value right here, and then paste it in the string on line 10.

16
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,844
Now we're ready to implement the createSubscription function.

17
00:01:05,844 --> 00:01:10,966
Go ahead and start by creating a params const object at the top of the function.

18
00:01:10,966 --> 00:01:12,402
The first property is Protocol,

19
00:01:12,402 --> 00:01:15,784
which we are passing in as the function argument type.

20
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,069
The next property is TopicArn,

21
00:01:18,069 --> 00:01:24,139
and you can give that the value of the topicArn function argument.

22
00:01:24,139 --> 00:01:25,311
The last property is Endpoint,

23
00:01:25,311 --> 00:01:28,677
and you can give it the value of the endpoint function argument.

24
00:01:28,677 --> 00:01:33,751
These are the only three properties you need to subscribe to a topic.

25
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:36,491
Now inside the Promise, call the sns.

26
00:01:36,491 --> 00:01:41,113
subscribe function, passing in the params object as the first argument,

27
00:01:41,113 --> 00:01:45,028
then a callback function with err and data arguments as the second.

28
00:01:45,028 --> 00:01:49,148
If there's an err object, then call reject and pass it in; otherwise,

29
00:01:49,148 --> 00:01:52,299
call resolve with the data argument.

30
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:53,750
This will make our file complete,

31
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:58,673
and we can switch over to the command line to run it.

32
00:01:58,673 --> 00:02:03,840
In your command line, execute node create‑sns‑subscription.js.

33
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,916
It will output the subscription details, and you should be up and running.

34
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:20,000
Once we connect up our demo application to SNS in the next clip, you'll start getting the freshest race results directly to your phone.
