00:00:02,078 --> 00:00:04,566
API Gateway is one of the newer AWS services,

2
00:00:04,566 --> 00:00:08,902
and it reflects an evolution of routing with cloud resources.

3
00:00:08,902 --> 00:00:11,395
While there is API directly in the name,

4
00:00:11,395 --> 00:00:14,732
it is by no means only for use with APIs.

5
00:00:14,732 --> 00:00:18,584
It actually really works well for all types of routing.

6
00:00:18,584 --> 00:00:21,296
So what exactly is API Gateway?

7
00:00:21,296 --> 00:00:25,417
It's essentially a routing layer that allows you to configure many rules on

8
00:00:25,417 --> 00:00:29,787
the same domain and connect it to many different resources.

9
00:00:29,787 --> 00:00:34,217
The language of API Gateway is couched in classical REST terms.

10
00:00:34,217 --> 00:00:37,937
Each part of a URI path is called a resource,

11
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:40,466
and on those resources you configure methods.

12
00:00:40,466 --> 00:00:44,145
Each method can be configured to have a certain behavior

13
00:00:44,145 --> 00:00:47,761
and send the request to some AWS service.

14
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:51,066
You can transform the request before sending it on,

15
00:00:51,066 --> 00:00:53,686
and also transform the response as well.

16
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:56,739
Each method on a resource is configured separately,

17
00:00:56,739 --> 00:01:00,304
so you could have different operations on a path

18
00:01:00,304 --> 00:01:02,923
going to different AWS resources.

19
00:01:02,923 --> 00:01:05,968
It's really flexible and powerful.

20
00:01:05,968 --> 00:01:06,748
In this module,

21
00:01:06,748 --> 00:01:11,133
we're going to set our demo project up to respond from an API Gateway resource.

22
00:01:11,133 --> 00:01:16,508
I'm using this example because you could then see how you could route other

23
00:01:16,508 --> 00:01:26,000
paths on that same domain name to other applications. Now let's get started with creating our API in the next clip.
