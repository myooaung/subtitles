Hello there, and welcome back to AWS Developer:

2
00:00:04,012 --> 00:00:06,910
Designing and Developing. In this module,

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:09,140
we're going to look at two different ways to

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,540
communicate between services or applications.

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:18,380
Simple Queue Service, or SQS, is a way to send messages via a queue system.

6
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:23,340
Individual messages can be taken off the queue and processed by consumers.

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,320
Kinesis Streams are a real‑time, stream‑based messaging

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,400
service that works similar to SQS,

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,380
but with subtle differences that change the ideal use case.

10
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,680
We'll be looking at both in this module and configuring

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,940
them to work with our application.

12
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,140
Let's go over what will be covering in this module.

13
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,630
We'll start by looking at some of the specifics of

14
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:49,340
polling in SQS and how messages work.

15
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:53,400
Then we'll create an SQS queue to send race results and look at

16
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,640
how to consume and process those messages.

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,650
Next, I'll introduce you to Kinesis streams,

18
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:03,260
and we'll set one up for our application to send race results to the

19
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:11,000
races table. And, finally, will cap it off by looking at some of the restrictions and limits with both services
