00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:06.080
Both EBS and S3 have limits that you might actually hit a little bit more

2
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.110
than some of the other services is that you've seen. With EBS I've already

3
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.680
mentioned the limits around attaching and detaching,

4
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.830
but I'll reiterate them here.

5
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.690
An instance must be stopped in order to detach a root volume. If the

6
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.820
volume isn't a root volume, then it can be detached at any time

7
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.200
without the instance having to be stopped.

8
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.620
An EBS volume can be attached to a running instance at any time as

9
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.430
long as it does not have an AWS marketplace product code. If that

10
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.780
exists, then the attaching instance must be stopped. One limit that I

11
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.800
haven't mentioned is that EBS volumes can only be attached to

12
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.110
instances in the same region.

13
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.190
Attaching volumes across availability zones is okay,

14
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.800
but you can't migrate or attach a volume across regions. With S3

15
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.660
there's a soft limit on the number of buckets allowed,

16
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.520
and it's set to 100 at default. Within a bucket, there's no limit to the

17
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.000
number of objects assigned from the size of your wallet.

18
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.650
As mentioned before, bucket names must be globally unique,

19
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.240
not just unique in your account,

20
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.000
and that's most of the limits you may hit in your daily usage with either service.
