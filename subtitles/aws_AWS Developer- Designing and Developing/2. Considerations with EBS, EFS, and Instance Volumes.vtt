00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.290
EC2 provides you three different storage options, Elastic Block

2
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:11.490
Store, or EBS, Elastic File System, or EFS, and instance store

3
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.800
volumes. Each were introduced at different times,

4
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:21.140
showing a sort of evolution and process for AWS EC2 storage.

5
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.840
Instance store was the first storage type for use with EC2 instances.

6
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.970
These volumes are physically connected to the server

7
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.280
where your instance is running.

8
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.920
They used to be the default storage option,

9
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.910
but there are a few reasons why they're not best for general use anymore.

10
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.330
EC2 data on an instance store volume is completely wiped if the

11
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:48.070
connected instance stops or terminates. Data stored on an

12
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.930
instance store volume is basically stuck.

13
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.340
You can't create a snapshot from an instance store volume.

14
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.450
You could move the data off the volume,

15
00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.350
but it's completely up to the user and it's a manual process.

16
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.290
EBS is the preferred way to store data with an EC2 instance

17
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.690
these days. EBS volumes live independently from the EC2

18
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.020
instance and can be detached for reuse,

19
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.540
backed up with snapshots, and allows the instance to be stopped.

20
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.670
There are also lots of options in regards to the

21
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.070
types of volumes you can connect.

22
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.070
This table shows you the options you can choose when creating a new

23
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.040
EBS volume. EBS volumes are also replicated across multiple

24
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.440
availability zones to ensure there's no data loss.

25
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:43.440
EFS is an evolution past EBS, but also serves a very specific need.

26
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.480
EFS is built to connect to multiple instances at once and

27
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.860
scale the file system capacity as needed.

28
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.750
The product documentation advertises capacity growing to

29
00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.000
petabyteâ€‘scale, but I haven't been able to test that.

30
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.860
EFS is good for big data type operations and is more of a dedicated file system,

31
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.160
which isn't optimized for a root disk for an EC2 instance. EFS

32
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.370
provides the same data durability as EBS volumes being replicated

33
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:23.000
across multiple availability zones. In the next clip, we'll play with an EBS volume to see how it can be reused.
