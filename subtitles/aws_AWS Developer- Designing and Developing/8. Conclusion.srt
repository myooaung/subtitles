00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,410
While SNS is powerful and quite useful, when coupled with CloudWatch alarms,

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:09,440
the true potential of realâ€‘time notification is realized.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,410
There are an endless number of uses for both services, so I hope this

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,960
module has inspired you to try out things with each.

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,240
Let's take a look at what we covered in this module.

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,440
We started by creating an SNS topic.

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,750
Then we made an SNS subscription with that topic and your mobile number.

8
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:33,640
Next we modified our app to send notifications to the topic and

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,400
ultimately our mobile phone when race results were finished.

10
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,640
Then we created a CloudWatch alarm and hooked it up to notify

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,140
us through the SNS topic.

12
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:43,680
Finally,

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,700
we looked at some of the few limits on SNS and CloudWatch

14
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,110
alarms. And we've reached the end of this course, AWS

15
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,500
Developer: Designing and Developing.

16
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,940
I sincerely appreciate you taking this journey with me to

17
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,140
learn more and more about AWS. At this point,

18
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,080
you're in a good place to start doing some damage in AWS. Find a

19
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,820
personal project or a side project at work that allows you to try out

20
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,970
some of the services discussed in this course, and consider finishing

21
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:18,920
the other courses in the AWS Developers Certification path to prepare

22
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:28,000
to master the AWS Developer Associate Certification exam. Again, my name is Ryan Lewis, and thank you for watching this course.
