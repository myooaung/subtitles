1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,940
Amazon provides a few different ways to interact with their cloud.

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:08,040
The web console is one of the first you'll interact with,

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,440
and the CLI is probably the second as you configure your local credentials.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,230
But the AWS SDK, software development kit, is likely what you'll

5
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,940
use most of the time in your role as a developer.

6
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,710
This is because the AWS SDK provides a simplest

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,040
interface between your code and the cloud.

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,950
AWS distributes and maintains these SDKs in multiple

9
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,610
languages so you can develop in the cloud in whatever

10
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,540
language your application is built with.

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,500
There are some other open source SDKs for languages that aren't

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,320
supported already by AWS. These are typically very usable,

13
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,630
but it's important to know when an SDK is officially supported so that you

14
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,740
can understand the level of support it will receive.

15
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:01,840
Let's take a look at the official SDKs available from Amazon.

16
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,500
First of all,

17
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,330
AWS provides SDKs for the current most popular

18
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,540
serverâ€‘side development languages.

19
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:14,730
In no particular order, these are Java, .NET, C++,

20
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:15,940
Python,

21
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:21,670
Ruby, Go, and Node. On the client side, you can use the

22
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:27,040
same JavaScript SDK that is used with Node. On mobile, you

23
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,240
have some interesting options.

24
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:37,340
There are official SDKs for Android, iPhone, the Xamarin platform, and Unity.

25
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,540
With all of these offerings,

26
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:41,150
it's very likely that your language of choice has a

27
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:44,340
fully supported SDK from Amazon.

28
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,510
In this course, we're going to be working with an application built on Node,

29
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:53,540
so we will be using the JavaScript SDK extensively.

30
00:01:53,540 --> 00:02:02,000
If you want to get a head start with it, here's the URL for the documentation site for the JavaScript AWS SDK.
