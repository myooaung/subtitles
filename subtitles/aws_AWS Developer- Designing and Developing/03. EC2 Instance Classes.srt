00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,330
There are a few high‑level instance attributes that you have to

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,530
decide on before starting an EC2 instance.

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:12,330
One of them is instance type, which I covered in the Getting Started course.

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,400
Another attribute is the instance class.

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:21,920
These classes are spot instances, on‑demand instances, or reserved instances.

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,590
You may have seen these terms,

7
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:27,580
but I'll define them here and give them a little more explanation.

8
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,050
In this course and the Getting Started course,

9
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,740
we're only using on‑demand instances,

10
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:37,540
but based on the descriptions, consider giving the other classes a try.

11
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,020
Instance class doesn't have anything to do with what the instance

12
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:45,350
can do. It really defines the conditions in which the instance

13
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:48,840
lives and how much you'll pay for it.

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,500
On‑demand instances are the usual pay‑only‑for‑what‑you‑use, no‑commitment

15
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,680
instances that we spin up and spin down like nothing.

16
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,700
These instance types are good for applications that

17
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,140
need to be scaled up and down.

18
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,960
It's also the best kind of instance when you're learning

19
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,910
AWS, like we are, because you can kill the instance when

20
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,260
you're done playing with it.

21
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:16,060
Reserved instances are just like they sound where you make

22
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:20,320
a commitment to AWS and reserve a set number of instances

23
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,940
for a certain period of time.

24
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,130
There are different links to the commitment time,

25
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,600
typically between one and three years,

26
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,770
but the discounts can be massive, some up to 75% off.

27
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:36,230
If you're a stable company that will reliably need certain

28
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:39,240
instances running for that period of time,

29
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,840
reserved instances might be a great way to save some money.

30
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,780
The final class of instances is called spot instances.

31
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:53,720
These are instances that you bid on, and they utilize spare EC2 computing power.

32
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:58,460
Think of it like the unused hotel rooms or airline seats that are

33
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:03,080
sold at rock bottom prices at the last minute just because it's

34
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,940
better to get some money than no money.

35
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:10,920
Discounts can be even deeper than with reserved instances, up to 90%

36
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,720
off, but there's no real guarantee on availability.

37
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:21,090
It's suggested that only extremely flexible compute jobs utilize spot instances.

38
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:31,000
A web application is not a good use case for spot instances, but a research job or data processing job might be a good fit.
