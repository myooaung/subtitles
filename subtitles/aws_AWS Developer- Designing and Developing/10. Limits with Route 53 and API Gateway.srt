00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,780
Route 53 and API Gateway are both constrained by restrictions and limits,

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,400
but they come from different concerns.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,900
Route 53 has many restrictions due to the nature of DNS changes,

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,640
whereas API Gateway has many restrictions due to it being a new service in AWS.

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,320
Let's look at a few of both. In Route 53 you'll notice

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,790
quickly that there is a restriction on how fast record set

7
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:30,940
changes are propagated to the internet, and this is based on DNS rules.

8
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,850
Usually, I've found that if you change your record set,

9
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,450
the change can be observed almost instantly.

10
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,510
If you make an error for some reason, though,

11
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,230
and need to change that same record set again,

12
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:44,720
the change will be delayed by around 5 minutes.

13
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,650
I've encountered this several times,

14
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,240
so make sure to be careful when changing records sets.

15
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,990
Aside from that, there are the normal resource limits,

16
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:57,880
but they can all be raised by AWS. API Gateway has limits around

17
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,710
the number of requests you can make to create,

18
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,510
modify, or delete something in your account.

19
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,890
These are hard limits and say, for instance,

20
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,940
that you can only send two create API requests per minute.

21
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,960
All the rest are blocked, and then you just have to wait.

22
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,140
It's kind of inconvenient.

23
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,720
There are also many known issues with API Gateway that

24
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,390
restrict certain types of operations.

25
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:24,110
AWS maintains a page with these, found here,

26
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:28,410
and it's a good idea to be aware of some of the issues it currently faces.

27
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:32,220
I ran into some in the past around the way that API Gateway resolves

28
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:41,000
requests and spent a few months figuring it out. Beyond that, there are the resource limits as usual, and those can be raised.
