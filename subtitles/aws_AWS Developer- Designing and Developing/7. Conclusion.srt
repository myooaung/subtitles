00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,570
In this module,

2
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:05,590
we looked at a few different ways to deliver content to your users.

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:08,460
CloudFront finds its way into most web projects,

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,470
but S3 static hosting is a little more of a special use tool these days.

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,340
Let's recap what we covered in this module.

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,100
We started by discussing CloudFront invalidations and

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,610
why you might not want to use them.

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:26,340
Then we created a CloudFront distribution with all of those parameters.

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:26,800
Next,

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,540
we moved on to S3 static websites and set one up

11
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,400
based on our existing S3 bucket.

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,220
And finally,

13
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:39,060
we looked at the few limits concerning CloudFront. In the next module,

14
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:44,900
we're going to look at interservice communication inside AWS. Both Simple

15
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:54,000
Queue Service and Kinesis Streams provide ways for services to decouple and communicate in an asynchronous manner.
