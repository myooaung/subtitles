00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:05,860
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:09,280
I'd like to jump into another quick challenge with you all.

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:14,950
I'd like you to think about being a bit more designer friendly when you're constructing your code.

4
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:20,380
This is not only a benefit if you're working in the team being able to expose values make sure there's

5
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:26,320
nothing hidden away but also it's a great thing for you as well and having to go into your code every

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,320
time to change a simple value when it could be right there in the editor was perhaps something that

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,930
we should all think about when we are writing our code.

8
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,130
So I'd like you to think about removing magic numbers from the code.

9
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,770
Obviously sometimes you do want to hard code something in.

10
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:47,330
So for instance let's take the speed at which the doors will open and shuts.

11
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:53,140
And of course we've got that delay as well exposing those values may or may not be beneficial that delay

12
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,060
definitely.

13
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:58,540
Because then we put a door elsewhere we can adjust the delay that it's open for.

14
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:04,430
But perhaps you want to keep the speed at which the doors open and shuts permanent.

15
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:08,500
In which case you do want to hide those things in now.

16
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,890
The next thing I would say is think about which parameters you want to expose.

17
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:19,060
Often they'll be the things that you are accessing most often and you'll only really know that after

18
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,350
you start playing with your game itself.

19
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:26,520
And the other thing to think about is perhaps you could expose all of those parameters.

20
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,060
It's entirely up to you.

21
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:34,900
And then of course if they're all exposed then everybody's got a an idea of what will happen of course

22
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,480
at that point if you do expose something you probably want to give it a default value as well just to

23
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:45,750
make sure that a it's a sensible figure when you start using it.

24
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,730
And of course expose them to the editor as well with you property edit anywhere.

25
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:50,990
OK.

26
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,250
So go ahead pause video.

27
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:58,600
Go through your code and make this more designer friendly so that anybody who is using your open door

28
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:04,840
component could tweak the parameters that they would need in order to open and close the door.

29
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:10,460
Paul's video now and give that a go OK everybody welcome back.

30
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:16,120
Let's go ahead hop on over into unreal and make this a little bit more designer friendly.

31
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:16,630
Okay.

32
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,240
I'm glad we've jumped straight into the head the far because this is where I need to do most of my editing.

33
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:31,790
Now I think that I would quite like to be able to control the clothes the lay so I'm going to copy you

34
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:36,880
property at anywhere so I don't have to keep typing it over and over again.

35
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,890
Now the door last open that's absolutely fine actor that opens.

36
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,780
I'll leave that there for the moment as well.

37
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:47,420
The angle of the door when it's open the target your.

38
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:52,910
Well that's a good question that we've said target your because we're dealing with the actual names

39
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:56,530
of the Afro taters values.

40
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:04,070
However it's might be a bit more friendly to not call this target your but open angle.

41
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:10,220
So I'm going to cut that out of the way and go open angle and then I'm going to go over to the implementation

42
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:21,500
Find and Replace target your with open angle and we can happily replace them all.

43
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,680
OK so that's a that's a great start though.

44
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:30,320
That's much more readable so it's not just about exposing parameters but making sure that it's clear

45
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,440
as to what it is that you're setting.

46
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:41,300
I would also like to give the designer an option to both adjust the opening speed and closing speed

47
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,950
of the door myself.

48
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:47,600
So this is another you profit property edit anywhere and it's going to be a float.

49
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,700
It's a completely new one in this case is going to be a float and that's called it.

50
00:03:52,700 --> 00:04:00,290
DOOR OPENS speed something like that so DOOR OPENS speed we could call it velocity as well as entirely

51
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,290
up to you.

52
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:09,980
And then we need another one which will be a float DOOR SHUTTING speed or door close speed to be consistent

53
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:15,600
with our other other naming that we have there's a door clothes speed.

54
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,080
There we go.

55
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,330
So we need to use these somewhere and that will be over in the implementation itself.

56
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:25,250
We have the door open speed that is here.

57
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:29,880
So that's go ahead and at the end so DOOR OPENS speed.

58
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,420
Excellent.

59
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:38,330
And this one here is gonna be the door closed speed as the door closed door opens Pete silly me door

60
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,140
close.

61
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,010
Speed.

62
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:40,800
Okay.

63
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:46,580
The other thing that I need to do is give them sensible values to begin with so the door opens speed

64
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:53,880
was nice and slow to be enticing that was point eight so that's that with a default value.

65
00:04:53,960 --> 00:05:00,830
And this was to I believe if I remember correctly that wasn't safe.

66
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,910
I have just smash the keys.

67
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,120
Okay.

68
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:10,520
I think that is the ones that I want to expose this go over into here and see is is there anything that's

69
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,290
a magic number left in here.

70
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:12,950
No there isn't.

71
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:13,760
Excellent.

72
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,840
That's a great job going through there and sorting that out.

73
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,600
Now of course we've changed quite a bit to code there.

74
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,780
Let's go over into unreal and make sure it's all working Excellent.

75
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:30,500
Let's go and compile our code and with a compile complete list Go ahead press play.

76
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,930
So a game still appears to work.

77
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:34,620
SHUTS.

78
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,480
Perfect.

79
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:40,130
Let's come out of that and go and have a look at our open door component.

80
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,250
And here we go.

81
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:48,000
We have the open angle the clothes that lay the open speed and the close speed.

82
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,610
Now the pressure plate in the act of the opens I'm going to puts all the pressure plate is actually

83
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:58,380
something that is kind of important when you're using this but you only set it once.

84
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:05,310
I might move that further down and the actor that opens that may go in in to be quite honest in the

85
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:11,100
end so let's go back into our code and I do want to tweak that ever so slightly so this block of code

86
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:18,660
here I'm going to keep the door last open with the rest of the door stuff and his ult and the up marriage

87
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:25,510
to move this block of code up OK inserts just another line there for readability.

88
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:26,510
OK.

89
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:31,650
And looking down this code actually we've got an issue here with the door last opened.

90
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:37,980
Now I know I created that in the last lecture so I'll go back and have a little Arto there because I've

91
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,410
managed to make this undefined.

92
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:48,120
If we have a look in our implementation file here the only time we're actually setting door last opened

93
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:55,140
is here so we have to actually be on the pressure plate in order for that to be initialized with anything.

94
00:06:55,510 --> 00:07:00,340
Otherwise it remains unfinished allies and whatever was in that memory address when we declared this

95
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,390
new variable.

96
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,680
That's what it's taken hold of.

97
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:06,250
So let's actually give it a value that is a float.

98
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,770
So in this case I'm just going to set it to zero.

99
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:09,170
Okay.

100
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,020
Excellent.

101
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:10,280
Yep.

102
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,380
I am happy with that.

103
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,660
Let's save the file and go over into on real.

104
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:19,660
And then when we go ahead and recompile because this is already open we will see it updates and that

105
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:26,140
will just reorder to what I think is a better order again later on if it turns out that it's not no

106
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:33,040
hard you know no hard times we just go in and we reorder the code itself which is just really easy to

107
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,260
do.

108
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,600
So no sweat.

109
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:34,990
There we go.

110
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:39,040
So everything is reordered how I want it now.

111
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:43,720
What did you expose did you expose a similar set of things that I've done here.

112
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,040
Did you do less.

113
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:50,440
Was there something else that you tweaked did you change the order of everything that's there.

114
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:56,290
Share your thoughts and how you handle your doors set up over in the discussions and I'll see you all

115
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,430
in the next lecture.
