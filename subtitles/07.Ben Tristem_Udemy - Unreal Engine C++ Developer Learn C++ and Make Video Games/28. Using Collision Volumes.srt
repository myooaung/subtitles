00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,310
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:11,710
In this lecture we're going to start using the trigger volume in anger so trigger volumes are extremely

3
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:12,430
useful tools.

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,270
We've covered some of the examples in which you could use them.

5
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:20,150
However you can pretty much use them to trigger any behavior in your game that you want.

6
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:24,470
It's simply a volume that can detect things entering or leaving.

7
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:28,480
And that's really useful because that means we can walk into the trigger volume and trigger the doors

8
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,070
open and if we leave it we can trigger it to shut.

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:37,540
And that's very key to the dynamic for simple game mechanics that we've got now.

10
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:41,470
We're using one as a pressure plate and you can use one as well.

11
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:45,430
Anything you like you can trigger any other thing to happen in the scene.

12
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:50,950
Now one of the really useful things that you can do is control what when it enters that trigger volume

13
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:55,090
will trigger the pressure plate to activate and open the door.

14
00:00:55,090 --> 00:01:02,710
So we're going to choose what can open our door and we're going to use is over lapping actor on a trigger

15
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,510
volume in order to do that.

16
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:10,780
Now we're going to you be using something called polling versus events a brief word on that so polling

17
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,060
is simply just checking all the time.

18
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:15,090
Similar to when your kids are in the back of a car.

19
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,480
Are we there yet are we there yet.

20
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,430
Are we there yet.

21
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,680
Whereas an event driven system the parent would turn around to the child and say oh we have arrived

22
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,580
and events are something we will cover later on in the course.

23
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:27,920
Okay.

24
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:34,690
So to start off what I'm going to do is currently we have a pressure plate here being what is going

25
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:40,840
to be opening the door and we really want something else to just define what can activate the pressure

26
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,070
plate.

27
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:46,320
So perhaps an actor that opens and then we can go and select ourselves in order to test it.

28
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:53,440
Now at the moment I will just give you this hint as we move forward when we press play we suddenly exist

29
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,300
in our scene.

30
00:01:54,310 --> 00:02:01,090
If ICE open up the hierarchy the world outline or a bit more you can see all of these yellow items that

31
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:05,810
appear but only when we press play they're temporary actors that are spawned in.

32
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:12,400
And if we press eject at the top here and just have a look back at ourselves this is what we currently

33
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,620
look like when we start playing the game.

34
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:20,420
It's a very basic porn which is simply a player controlled actor.

35
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:24,980
There is another type of actor called a character which is a much richer actor.

36
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:29,710
However it does come with a ton of boilerplate code so we want to keep things simple at the moment and

37
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,240
we'll approach that again later on.

38
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,750
So now I can go ahead.

39
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:41,170
I can stop that for the moment and let's go and expose a property on our open door component so we can

40
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,180
select the actor that opens.

41
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,030
So let's go ahead and open that up.

42
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:46,280
Okay.

43
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,670
So this is going to be another you property.

44
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,540
Hayes is working nice and quickly.

45
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,520
Is it going to come up with edit anywhere quickly.

46
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,610
No it's not going to.

47
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:55,470
Okay.

48
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,380
So what are we going to put in here.

49
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:02,230
So what do we need here What type is going to open our door.

50
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:08,470
Well currently we're thinking about when we walk into that trigger volume so if that would be a pawn.

51
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:14,290
So we start typing a pawn then we can use that in order to open the door.

52
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:19,600
However later on we want to be able to put something else in there which is probably not going to be

53
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,680
a pawn or a character it's more likely to just be a standard actor.

54
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:28,230
And remember that a pawn inherits from the Actor class.

55
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,180
So we can be a bit more generic and have an a actor.

56
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,540
Once again this is going to be a pointer.

57
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,610
And what can we call this.

58
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,920
Well I'm going to call it the actor that opens.

59
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,750
Be very specific about how you're naming things.

60
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:48,850
Okay so that save our code go over it's unreal and compile and what we should see is down on the open

61
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:53,680
door this will update in a moment we should have our target your the pressure plates that it's linked

62
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,340
to.

63
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,030
And then finally the actor that's going to open it.

64
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:04,630
Now this is where you can potentially end up having a crash if we're not careful because in a moment

65
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:11,110
when we actually go to this implementation of this and starts coding in the actual opening of the door

66
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,660
this is where we're going to start having a problem.

67
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,440
Okay so we wants to enter this volume but we don't exist at the moment.

68
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:23,450
So in this dropdown we can have a look down the various actors we don't exist yet because we only exist

69
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,820
when we press play.

70
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:31,720
So we can actually go in and inject select the door go to the open door component.

71
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,390
And now we exist as the default pawn in the scene.

72
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,870
So we'll be able to test that in a bit but we cannot do that at the moment because we haven't got the

73
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:45,410
code in place so let's go over to the implementation and pop that in now.

74
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:45,790
Okay.

75
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:52,030
So over in the implementation file I'm going to jump in straight away with a challenge.

76
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:52,320
Okay.

77
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:57,250
So it's time for a bit of practice with your refactoring and then we'll get back on to just finalizing

78
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:57,990
the code.

79
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:03,970
So I'd like you to go ahead and put the code we have created into in the tick component function into

80
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,540
a new function called Open Door so we're gonna refactor all of that out.

81
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,730
And then of course we can call open door.

82
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:15,310
This is the reason for doing it when we need it rather than just every frame which is not how we want

83
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,260
to play our game.

84
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:19,840
Now remember you will also need to add code into the header file as well.

85
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:24,130
Now it's the first time we've done that in this section so you might have to refer back to your previous

86
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:24,780
notes.

87
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,840
I'm sure you'll be absolutely fine.

88
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,040
And then of course we'll finish off our code.

89
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:35,380
So go ahead pause the video now refactor your code and I'll see you back in a few minutes Okay everybody

90
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,250
Welcome back.

91
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:40,690
Let's go ahead now and refactor our code okay.

92
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,320
Welcome back.

93
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:46,000
So let's go ahead and do the refactor now I'm going to go to my head of our first line like doing it

94
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,140
in this order.

95
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,940
So it's not going to return anything.

96
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,790
It's going to be called open door.

97
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,150
If I spelled that correctly open door.

98
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,380
There we go.

99
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,270
And what do we need to pass into it.

100
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,660
We are going to have to pass into the delta time but I don't think there will be anything else at the

101
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,750
moment.

102
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:08,730
Otherwise we can't use delta time or not also delta time and a semicolon on the end.

103
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,670
Okay.

104
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,080
I think that's all we need to do there.

105
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:18,020
So it's not returning anything as we've discussed it's parts of the class open door so open door come

106
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:27,390
along code on open door that's fine and we're passing in the floats for Delta time let's make sure we

107
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:34,020
spell things correctly and then we can open up our curly braces and then we should be able to just move

108
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:40,350
this chunk of code down and into it's using ult and the up and down arrows.

109
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:40,940
Okay.

110
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,320
Now this here was just a test.

111
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,820
I'm going to comment it out for the moment.

112
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,300
Do I want it down here as well.

113
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:53,580
I will keep it here for the moment but we're going to have some different comments in a bit.

114
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,700
So get the expectations a string.

115
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,170
Yes that's fine.

116
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:00,820
That can that can go reading it's absolute clear what that does.

117
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,090
Okay.

118
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,670
So we've refactor that.

119
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:08,180
So the final thing to do after any refactor is to go ahead and call the function we've just created

120
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,860
and make sure everything works as we would expect it to.

121
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,600
Let's go ahead over into unreal.

122
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:19,850
Now it should once we compile it behave exactly like it did before providing I've not missed anything

123
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,050
silly okay.

124
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:25,620
The compile has failed what have I missed.

125
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,810
Oh I've not passed out to there you.

126
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:33,280
I have missed something silly too few arguments in here so let's pass in delta time.

127
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:33,950
Silly me.

128
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:34,880
OK.

129
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:39,250
Let's compile a complete let's press play.

130
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,260
Excellent.

131
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,500
It opens up.

132
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:50,130
OK so let's go ahead back into the implementation file and we need to say open door but only if something

133
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,070
happens.

134
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:57,660
So let's start this off if so what are we saying here we're talking about the pressure plate itself.

135
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:58,280
So.

136
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:03,110
So if the pressure plate and we know that that is a pointer.

137
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,790
So we need the arrow operator.

138
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,310
Okay let's.

139
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:10,820
Using tele sense here as well as the documents if we need them.

140
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:15,000
So if I type in overlap which is something I'm looking for.

141
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,820
Excellent look at that is overlapping actor returns a boolean that's really useful because that's what

142
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:26,780
we want is overlapping actor that's fine it's going to need something coming into it.

143
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:31,460
And that is the actor that opens now is open.

144
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,540
If I missed the s Yes I have.

145
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:33,890
Okay.

146
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:39,330
So actor that opens actor that opens let's make sure those are saved.

147
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,870
And I don't think that's used anywhere else at the moment.

148
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,580
So watch out for spelling mistakes like that.

149
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:51,270
And then what do we want to do what we want to open the door now that we have this implementation of

150
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,180
our code.

151
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:59,250
This is where it's very easy to start crashing because we can have what's called a null pointer which

152
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,610
simply means that the pointer doesn't point to anything.

153
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:08,940
If you did reference a null pointer which results in undefined behavior which quite literally means

154
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:13,140
that the C++ standard doesn't say what the behavior should be.

155
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:20,580
So literally anything can happen but most likely it will end up in a crash without any useful error

156
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,930
messages.

157
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:22,220
OK.

158
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:27,570
So before we go we've got a couple of red squiggles here and I think yeah we're missing a brackets at

159
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,150
the end of that.

160
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:37,180
OK perfect let's save our code go over into unreal and I want to press play I don't I need to compile

161
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:40,600
first and this is where you need to make sure I know I've got it.

162
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:46,960
But on the open door component you need to make sure you have a pressure plate selected on any of the

163
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,810
objects that have open door on them.

164
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:57,460
Otherwise when you press play on real crash at that point due to the referencing a null pointer will

165
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,990
go and protect against that in the next lecture.

166
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:06,400
But for the moment if we eject and then we can look back it's our lovely port but what we can now do

167
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:14,220
is go to our door go to the open door component in the act that opens we can set it to the default porn

168
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,600
just for testing.

169
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,060
We can repossess and now hopefully if I walk into this corner I'm going to walk backwards.

170
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,340
We should see that our door opens.

171
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,330
Awesome.

172
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:27,790
Now notice here that it's only opening on that one door.

173
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:30,730
Let's eject again for a second so I'm going to Whoops.

174
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:31,490
Okay.

175
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,860
Now the reason why was this door over here on the far side had active open set to something.

176
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,540
This one was still none.

177
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:43,110
However we don't want to have to do things like that and we're going to setup programmatically in the

178
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,840
end anyway excellence.

179
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,190
We've now got our trigger volume doing something.

180
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:53,850
We just need a bit of protection in place because otherwise it will crash and we'll sort that out in

181
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:54,750
the next lecture.
