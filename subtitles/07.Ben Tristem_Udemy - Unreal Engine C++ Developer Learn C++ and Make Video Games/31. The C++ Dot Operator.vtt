00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.790
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:12.210
In this lecture we are going to talk about the dot operator which allows us to access functions of an

3
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.770
F string and in order to do this.

4
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.230
It's very straightforward.

5
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.760
Let's have a look at it now and then I will challenge you to do a check.

6
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.360
So let's just go to where just under this clear screen here.

7
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.360
So we're talking about on impulse.

8
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.080
And I've also noticed this white space down here that's completely unnecessary.

9
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.920
So we should get rid of that as well.

10
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.570
So here on line 22 if we were to have a look at let's save a hidden word let's do that.

11
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:48.510
So if we have a hidden word and impress the full stop or period key we get a list of a series of functions

12
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:56.100
that we can access and then you will see quite a few options and towards the bottom we have to lower

13
00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.440
and to upper they're going to come in use later on as well.

14
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:08.280
But the one we're looking for to get the length of our hidden word so we can check it is L E N Len and

15
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.430
to finish it off.

16
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.890
We're going to have to make sure we have our parentheses because we're calling a function and if we

17
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:22.660
hover over we can see that it's getting the length of our string incredibly useful to hover over things

18
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:29.240
if you want to know more details and importantly what we can see here is the type that this function

19
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.230
is returning is an integer that be quite important in the next lecture.

20
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.680
Now armed with this it's time for your challenge.

21
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:45.960
Okay see your challenge is to compare the hidden word to the inputs so add a check that the number of

22
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.650
letters that the player types.

23
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.140
That is the inputs is the same as the hidden word.

24
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.850
So we already have an if statement seeing whether the hidden word is right or not.

25
00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.650
But let's also check that the number of letters the player types is correct as well.

26
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.610
Now this will create a nested IF statement.

27
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:12.000
So the if statement you're about to type will exist in the else of the current if statements and a little

28
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.610
tip to help you forward when you we're talking about if two things are equal to one another will use

29
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.320
the double equal sign.

30
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.770
You can also say if it's not equal to with an exclamation mark and an equal size.

31
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.330
So if you want to say if this is not the same as this then do that.

32
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.940
That is how you'd format your code.

33
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.120
So go ahead pause video now and give it a go OK.

34
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.210
Everybody welcome back.

35
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:45.760
Let's go ahead and compare the length of our hidden word and our inputs in word Okay so the first thing

36
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.830
I'm going to do here is just remove this line of code that we were typing and we're going to be down

37
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.220
here in the else statement.

38
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.980
Somebody typing.

39
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.640
If and then press tab it will also fill the rest.

40
00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:04.390
So what we want to assess here is whether our inputs or rather the length of our inputs its capital

41
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.310
l remember that.

42
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.130
Now do we want to say if it's equal to or it's not equal to.

43
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.460
Let's let's run through it.

44
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.910
If it is equal to the length that we're just going to continue so that's not a valid check.

45
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.200
What we're really checking here is whether or not it's not equal to.

46
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.810
So not equal.

47
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.270
So the hidden word then we need to do something about it.

48
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.420
Spell hidden word correctly dots length.

49
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.200
There we go.

50
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:36.130
So if the input length and the hidden word length are not equal to one another we're going to do something.

51
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:45.550
So here we could print line and say because we're saying something we need text macro so we can say

52
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:51.210
here the hidden word is fork characters long.

53
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.540
Try again.

54
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.500
Let's save that and see what happens.

55
00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.270
Oh I've forgotten semicolon at the end.

56
00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.800
They're rushing to check it.

57
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:06.350
I didn't bother to finish off my coat so let's make sure that this works let's compile our code

58
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.730
okay and play our game.

59
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.200
So welcome to both Cal guess the fallout to WordPress and continue right.

60
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:20.580
So if we typing something that is not the right length.

61
00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.170
The hidden word is for characters long.

62
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.450
Try again.

63
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:31.530
And of course then it's saying you have lost because when we have a look at our code that is exactly

64
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:37.210
what's happening we're going through is it's equal to the hit word word is it the same thing.

65
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.430
Nope.

66
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.900
Otherwise we're going to do this.

67
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.120
We're going to check whether the lengths of the same.

68
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.490
And if you've not typed incorrectly.

69
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.340
Eventually at this point in time you've lost the game.

70
00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.440
So there we go.

71
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.990
That's how far we're going to take this at the moment.

72
00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:01.110
Now can you see a potential issue here if we start building up nested if statements is going to be very

73
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.030
complex to handle.

74
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:08.080
Now we'll get to how we can flatten that out in a few lectures time.

75
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.380
But for now we've just introduced another magic number.

76
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.580
So you've got a number hard coded into our text.

77
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.250
This is going to cause us issue.

78
00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.470
We've got one at the top here and now one down here.

79
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:28.590
And I think now would be a great time to introduce you to how you can format your strings to include

80
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.220
proper data in there instead of hard coded numbers.

81
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.470
How did you guys get on please show your work over in the discussions and I'll see you will in the next

82
00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:37.920
lecture.
