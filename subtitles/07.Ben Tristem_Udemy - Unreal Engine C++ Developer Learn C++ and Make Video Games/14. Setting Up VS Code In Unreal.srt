00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,340
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,300
Now when it comes to setting up your idea with an unreal.

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:15,010
If you're working from the default settings then Visual Studio community will already have been set

4
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:15,880
up for you.

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:20,650
However we're using v s code for cross system compatibility.

6
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:26,860
Now we can see what the current one is straight away if we go to file and where we have generators.

7
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:29,380
We've then got Visual Studio project.

8
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,580
I don't want to use Visual Studio projects.

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,590
I want to use Visual Studio code how do we go ahead and change that.

10
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:40,540
Well what we need to do is go to the next menu along the Edit menu and go down to edit editor preferences.

11
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:45,140
Once we've gone ahead and done that we can go to the source code area on the left hand side.

12
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:48,670
When we've done that we have a dropdown it's a nice simple one to work with.

13
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:54,260
We click on that and we get a list and here we can see Visual Studio code.

14
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:58,140
Select that you will notice that a restart is required.

15
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:01,930
So let's go ahead click restart now and we've got to save.

16
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,820
So let's go ahead and save.

17
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:09,910
I'll take a few seconds to reopen the project and what we should then see when we go to file is the

18
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:13,260
fact that we can generate a visual studio code project.

19
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:19,660
So the editor preferences have opened up once again that's closed those down go to file and yes look

20
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:22,550
generate Visual Studio code projects.

21
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,770
Perfect.

22
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:29,920
Now before I go ahead and do that let's have a look at my file system and we'll see what's being generated

23
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,850
when we do that.

24
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:32,280
Okay.

25
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,240
So we have here the file system.

26
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,610
Look at what it looks like at the moment.

27
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,430
Looks good.

28
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:42,610
If we go ahead and go file generate visual studio projects this may take a few moments to do.

29
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,500
But what unreal is doing is setting everything up.

30
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:51,420
So it's ready to work and we can see it added here bull Cal game Doc code dash workspace.

31
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:55,800
Now this is something that's unreal can generate to any point which is useful.

32
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,690
So we're not going to open it up through this method.

33
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:05,060
What we are going to do is go to file and then we can open visual studio code.

34
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,950
So let's go ahead and click on open Visual Studio code.

35
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:14,620
What we should then say I've got the welcome screen here I'm going to toggle off show the welcome page

36
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:20,140
on starts up and then close down the welcome.

37
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,340
Now if you don't see this hierarchy here on the left you may need to open up source Volkow game and

38
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,550
inside there will have these files the ones where you're going to be focusing on mainly the ball cap

39
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,630
cartridge C.P. and the ball cowl cartridge Doc H.

40
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,760
And we can go ahead and single click on bulk how cartridge the H.

41
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,650
The head of files now load it up and also the bulk cartridge CBP.

42
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:48,260
Now you'll notice here that as we click on them they just open up.

43
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:55,190
But what we can do is then double click on CBP and double click on H and then they're all open up the

44
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,700
two files individually.

45
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:02,550
So we've got the C++ file ready to type our code into really exciting was so close to getting there.

46
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,370
And also the header file as well.

47
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:09,850
Now this will be a bit overwhelming if you've never seen this type of code before.

48
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:16,200
But what we have here is just the basics of making sure that the terminal within the game works as we

49
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:22,730
expect it to and don't be scared because by the end of this section we'll be able to understand exactly

50
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:25,130
what's going on within this file itself.

51
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,390
So there we go.

52
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:30,090
We've got visual studio code all set up to work with unreal.

53
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,920
Now if you've just been watching I've got a challenge for you.

54
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:40,370
So your challenge I'd like you to get your I.D. set up so set up your I.D. as the default editor in

55
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:40,970
I'm real.

56
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:46,490
Now you may choose to stick with Visual Studio code or if you're on the Mac you may be using x code.

57
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:52,200
It's entirely up to you which I the use but I'd like you to set up your idea as the default editor in

58
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,730
Unreal Engine 4.

59
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,810
And then once that's done make sure you can open up the bulk cartridge dot H.

60
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:03,260
The header file and the bulk cartridge dot CPB are main code.

61
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,910
Now I've already got mine set up.

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,350
I hope you have as well.

63
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,800
And then we can start cracking on with the coding in the next lecture.
