00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.040
Hello everybody and welcome to find component by class.

2
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.480
So we're gonna find out what it does and how to use it to find attached components.

3
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.790
We will be introducing angle brackets for generics.

4
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:23.130
We will use non pointer to initialize our pointers and we will log a useful error as we've done in some

5
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.360
of the other lectures.

6
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.860
If the component isn't attached specifically a physics handle.

7
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:34.650
Okay so because we're going to use a physics handle in a few lectures time let's use it as an example

8
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.230
as to what we're going to add as a component.

9
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.750
So let's go ahead and open up our default poem blueprint put mine in my blueprints folder and I'll double

10
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.570
click on that.

11
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.390
Now yours might not open up like this if it looks a bit different there's probably something you can

12
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.020
click along sort of like this top middle area here which will bring you to this screen and if you go

13
00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.410
up to add component we've got a lot of options now instead of just searching for it let's scroll down

14
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.350
to just see the breadth of what there is here and eventually we'll get down to where we've got our physics

15
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.780
handle component and we hover over it's a utility object for moving physics objects around.

16
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.990
That sounds perfect to what we want.

17
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.510
Just go ahead and double click that and it will add it to our default porn.

18
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.850
So the default porn now has that extra physics handle on it as well as the grabber that we've added

19
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:27.680
as well.

20
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.540
Let's go ahead and compile and save.

21
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.580
Now we're going to in a moment refer to the physics handle whilst we're in our grabber code.

22
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.930
Now it does mean that we will also whatever the grab is on it must also have a physics handle on.

23
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.980
But that's okay.

24
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.000
We'll make sure that's the case by writing an error if it's not.

25
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.120
Okay.

26
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.420
So with those all set up let's go over to V.S. code.

27
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.960
Okay.

28
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.650
So let's go over to our header file and we've got our private members just here.

29
00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:02.520
Let's go further down now in order to find the new physics handle we can employ fuzzy search.

30
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.610
All we could go and have a look at the documentation itself.

31
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.130
So I know some people perhaps on X code the fuzzy search might not work as well.

32
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.230
Plus I think we also need to hash include something.

33
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.750
Mm hmm.

34
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.950
Well let's go and have a look for the you physics handle and see what we need to include.

35
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:21.210
Okay.

36
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.770
So searching online are you physics handle component found that's in the unreal docs.

37
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:33.340
We scroll down here we can see that we've got to include hash physics engine physics handle components.

38
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.400
I'm going to go ahead and grab that.

39
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.780
Go back to our code C.C. and let's place under here.

40
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:47.060
Now when we go ahead and start typing you physics handle component.

41
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.740
There we go.

42
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.000
So that's all type.

43
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.980
And we want a pointer to it.

44
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.780
So we need the asterisk there and let's call that's just simply physics handle.

45
00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:04.930
And then I'm going to initialize that to a null PCR or null pointer that ensures that we're not going

46
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:11.710
to have any issues because otherwise if one isn't on our component and it's not set to a null pointer

47
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.610
it will probably just crash on real P T.

48
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:17.590
Ah there we go.

49
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.890
So we're pointing it's a null pointer right now because in the very beginning let's go over to unravel

50
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.290
when we're constructing this object.

51
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.530
We won't know whether the physics handle has spun up yet before the grabber has so that will just protect

52
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.880
us against some random crashes.

53
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:42.430
So if we go back to our code in the implementation on begin play we're going was begin play up here.

54
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:48.080
Okay we're going to check for the physics handle component.

55
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.370
Okay.

56
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.480
So how are we going to do that on a new line.

57
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.930
Let's go ahead and bring up how physics handle.

58
00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:03.250
Now we know that that if we hover over it as well is a pointer to a new physics handle component and

59
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.330
we're going to set it so.

60
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.350
Well first of all let's have a look at how things are arranged.

61
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.370
So at the moment we're within grabber.

62
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.680
So if we go ahead.

63
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.250
How do how do we get the relationship.

64
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.650
What's the commonality with our physics handle.

65
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:24.250
Well if we get the owner which is the default pawn then we can start looking for the physics handle

66
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.420
itself.

67
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.000
That's the only relationship is that they both have the same owner.

68
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:36.400
So we're going to get owner and because it's a pointer we will use the arrow operator and then we need

69
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.210
to find component by class.

70
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.210
Now fortune has come at the top there but just bear in mind there may be other things that are named

71
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.580
very similarly.

72
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:50.820
So here we go find component by class now there is something slightly different now because this is

73
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:57.840
a function template we're going to be using an angled brackets or a Chevron depending on what you want

74
00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.380
to call it.

75
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.560
And within these angle brackets is where we will specify the class that we're looking for.

76
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.970
So in this case it's going to be you physics handle component.

77
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.000
Let's let that auto complete.

78
00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:17.340
And it will return the first component found and then you do need some brackets at the end just like

79
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.510
normal.

80
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.740
Okay.

81
00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:24.180
So this works because we're getting the owner and then we find a component by its class and there's

82
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.640
only one physics handle component on there.

83
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.710
So we'll initialize the physics handle.

84
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:34.740
Now of course the physics handle itself is a new physics handle components of the types match there

85
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:35.930
that is important.

86
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.090
See how that's all linking together okay.

87
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.820
So when you've done something like that it could be quite dangerous to just assume that it has worked.

88
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:50.160
I could have made a typo or many many other things that still allows it to compile but it will result

89
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.300
in a crash.

90
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:58.860
So immediately afterwards we can go if physics handled in very much the same way we did down here with

91
00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:04.540
the actor hit it helps protect us as a clue as to what might be coming up for your challenge.

92
00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.330
Now in this particular case we do not need any code in here.

93
00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:17.430
This is just to protect us but we can go else and this is where we line up for your challenge so your

94
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.880
challenge I'd like you to logon era if no physics handle is present.

95
00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:27.750
So we're going to log at Aero verbosity so it's going to start to get a bit more serious with our error

96
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:28.440
codes.

97
00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:34.340
If no component is found right an error that helps the reader fix the issue that's always important

98
00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:40.470
put in the area as much detail as is necessary to help identify things find and include the name of

99
00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.750
the object that's also critical.

100
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.740
Otherwise we won't know what the error refers to.

101
00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:53.270
In this case it's going to be our default porn the other thing I'd like you to do is also clean up any

102
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.630
of the other things that we're no longer using.

103
00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:02.270
So whilst you're in there I don't think we need any position reporting and instead of just deleting

104
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:08.750
or altering the code within anything that's got the position reporter on it I would just remove that

105
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.920
component from any objects in our scene at the moment.

106
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:17.810
Paul's video now and give that's a go Okay everybody Welcome back.

107
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.920
Let's go ahead and log our era.

108
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.820
Okay so a couple of things here.

109
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:27.110
I think we should add a little bit of a comment here especially as when you just say that the physics

110
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:29.970
handle is found.

111
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.190
It's as simple as that.

112
00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:35.600
We don't need to output anything but it just says Why we've left that blank.

113
00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.910
I think that's important right at the beginning.

114
00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:38.150
Okay.

115
00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.220
So here what are we going to say.

116
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:42.000
Okay so let's log this out.

117
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:49.070
You a log and then it's going to be a log temp tempers normal and the verbosity Well we've said here

118
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:50.510
is going to be an error.

119
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:54.660
Okay let's then say what it is.

120
00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:55.680
That's wrong.

121
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:57.500
So what are we going to say here.

122
00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:02.830
No physics handle found on percentage.

123
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:12.300
S So we've said oh no physics handle let's say a component as well let's be more specific found on percentages.

124
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:13.500
Exclamation mark.

125
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:14.580
Okay.

126
00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.700
Let's put the semicolon on the end.

127
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:24.080
So first of all asterisk and then we are going to get owner and of course that's a pointer so we're

128
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:31.010
going to use our arrow operator and then we can go ahead and get name and of course that is going to

129
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:35.410
return an F string which is exactly what we're looking for.

130
00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:37.780
And it will be passed into here.

131
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:38.390
Okay.

132
00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:43.340
Let's go ahead and save our file and go over into on real.

133
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:43.630
Okay.

134
00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:49.490
So let's go ahead over into our scene here compile our code w few moments and then what we'll do is

135
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:53.940
we'll play check the logs and then we'll remove the physics handle.

136
00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:57.580
We'll press play again see if it reports the error.

137
00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:58.850
Okay so the compiler is complete.

138
00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:04.070
If we go ahead and press play and have a look in the output log okay we've got a series of things here

139
00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:05.940
that I think we can clean up now.

140
00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:13.760
And also when we're looking at it I want to change that to yellow in a moment as well rather than leaving

141
00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:14.900
it as red.

142
00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:16.560
So that seems to be working.

143
00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:17.460
Let's go ahead.

144
00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.040
I'm gonna right click here and clear the log.

145
00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:25.400
So some nice fresh log and then we go to my default pawn and remove the physics handle.

146
00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.820
I'm going to compile and save should be very quick to do.

147
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.110
Now when we press play we should have an error and we don't.

148
00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:39.260
So I am just going to press compile again because has I've experienced in the past occasionally when

149
00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:44.940
you think you've got everything working and a real doesn't behave or behaves exactly like it did before.

150
00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.440
Well let's try it now.

151
00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:47.000
Here we go.

152
00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.760
So that was exactly the issue.

153
00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:53.200
So no physics handle component found on the default porn BP.

154
00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:55.850
And then it's got some suffixes on the end of it there.

155
00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:01.480
Okay so let's go ahead and tidy up the rest of this stuff okay.

156
00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:06.000
Let's find where we've got our log here.

157
00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:08.450
That's not going to be an error anymore the actor hit.

158
00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:12.350
I'm going to make that a warning so it's just a different color.

159
00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:13.740
It's not an error.

160
00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:19.520
I don't think there's anything else being logged out here is there grabber reporting for duty.

161
00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:24.460
We know it's working and let's go up and here is at the top of begin play.

162
00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:25.820
I'm just going to delete that.

163
00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:31.400
We know that the grabber is working and it's in our scene and everything else so that's fine.

164
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:40.160
The other thing to do is on some of our objects in our scene in fact what objects was it it was cube

165
00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.630
two and spear five have a position in the world.

166
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:51.830
Well it's come out select that and well the sphere first of all and well position let's go ahead and

167
00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:59.240
remove that and we can do the same with our cube as well we will remove world position.

168
00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:02.010
Okay so both of those are gone.

169
00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:08.270
The only other thing that I wants to do here is when we press play grab a reporting for duty that will

170
00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:11.670
disappear the moment that we've re compiled.

171
00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:12.850
I think we're good.

172
00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.120
So let's recompile.

173
00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:15.470
Excellent.

174
00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:19.300
Let's press play everything else is gone.

175
00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:23.100
We've hit the cube we've hit the cone yet.

176
00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.580
That's all working as I'd expect it to.

177
00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:26.400
Excellent.

178
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.750
How did you guys get on.

179
00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:35.340
And before I forget I'm going to quickly go back into my default pawn blueprint and add back onto it.

180
00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:40.650
The physics and or otherwise I'm going to forget on site and then wonder why something's not working

181
00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:41.250
later on.

182
00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:45.560
Okay so that's it for this lecture and I'll see you all in the next one.
