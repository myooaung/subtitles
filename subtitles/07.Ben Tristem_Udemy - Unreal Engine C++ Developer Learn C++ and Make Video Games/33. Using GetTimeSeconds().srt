00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:06,010
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:09,040
Let's go ahead and see what we're aiming for for this lecture.

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:14,740
So in the last lecture we couldn't escape through this door because it's shut too quickly.

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:20,380
However what we can do is implement a delay and I think there's a delay of two seconds in this particular

5
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:20,920
example.

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,450
So one two.

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,730
And the doors were shut.

8
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,700
And obviously that will give us plenty of opportunity to escape the room.

9
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:34,250
And of course this interestingly gives us the opportunity to also lock someone out of an area.

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,000
So if you wanted to gate someone in your gain.

11
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:42,880
So when they passed through there's now no way of reopening that door from this side.

12
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,860
So that's quite an important gameplay decision if you're making it if you want people to go back through

13
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:48,730
this door.

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,340
They now have no means.

15
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,870
You've got to think about that quite carefully okay.

16
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:58,780
So in this lecture is really about play tuning our game and being able to configure it.

17
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:03,250
So if you've got a room that's larger or smaller we'll be able to cater for it.

18
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:07,210
So we'll be using get world get time seconds.

19
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:13,070
We're going to be using that so we know how much time has passed and therefore we can actually make

20
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:18,000
the door open and hold there and then shut again when we need it.

21
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:23,720
Now this is going to make our game highly play tunable because it's going to enable us to just configure

22
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,370
it however we want.

23
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:29,170
And of course we can expose that to the editor as well.

24
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:32,900
We don't even have to go back into the code once that's set.

25
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:37,910
Now I think I mentioned this in the last lecture so I put it on the slide now so I have to do it.

26
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,770
I don't put a spotlight in that corner to just provide some performance that there's something interesting

27
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:43,550
over there.

28
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:48,950
And of course we're going to be play testing to ensure that the game is as annoying as it needs to be

29
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,410
in order to be a challenge for the player.

30
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,950
OK everybody welcome over interface code.

31
00:01:54,950 --> 00:02:00,640
Now what I need to do first of all is just go through the function that will going to be looking at

32
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:00,830
here.

33
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:05,590
So we're looking at gets world and then gets world time.

34
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,860
If I remember correctly get gets time in seconds.

35
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:10,430
Excellent.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,030
So what is that's returning.

37
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,250
That's returning a float which is good.

38
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:21,140
That means we can take it from another floats in order to do the calculation we need to do your returns

39
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:27,890
in the time in seconds since the world is brought up for play is stopped when the game is paused.

40
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,590
So is dilated and cramped.

41
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,100
Okay.

42
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,520
So that's really good we can use that in order to count from where we are.

43
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,680
So we can use it to make a timer.

44
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:46,190
So that means that in here we can say when the door was opened and in fact here we can say something

45
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:53,420
like door last open because this is going to enable you to open the door and shut it again.

46
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,770
It needs to reset the time.

47
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:59,330
So the door last opened equals when the door was opened.

48
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,940
Will be the time in seconds which is fine.

49
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:06,100
And then further down here there's going to be another if statement.

50
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:19,260
But basically if the door has been open longer than X seconds then closed the door and that will keep

51
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,510
it open for the length of time that we need.

52
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:25,160
So there are a couple of variables that we need.

53
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:25,500
Okay.

54
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:32,940
So we definitely need the float door last open I think this longer than X seconds can be a door delay

55
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:38,340
or door closed the something like that for longer than the door closed.

56
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:38,860
Okay.

57
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:44,100
So we need to make sure that those two variables are available let's go into the header file and I'll

58
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:49,920
just pop them at the bottom here we're going to have two floats two floats.

59
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,490
There we go.

60
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:56,850
We're going to have this one here the door last opened and we're going to have the door closed the lay

61
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:57,610
as well.

62
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:05,200
And then our last float will be the door closed the lei and we can set that.

63
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:08,970
Let's give it an initial value of two seconds.

64
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,350
That's 20 seconds.

65
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,990
There we go.

66
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:18,180
And of course the door last Open will be set within the implementation itself.

67
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,590
Oh this is Mike from the future.

68
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:28,660
Unfortunately leaving the door last opened without it being initialized is going to cause us a problem.

69
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:34,320
This will be undefined behavior unless the player and you'll see later on unless the player themselves

70
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:39,420
starts within the trigger volume then it just won't half of value.

71
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:45,480
And that can result in undefined behavior because whatever that variable has in its memory address will

72
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,560
be what's assigned.

73
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,750
So I thought it was going to be assigned but it's only assigned if the player starts in the trigger

74
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,140
volume.

75
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,230
So in this particular case I made a mistake there.

76
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,170
And I'll come back to it later.

77
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,030
Slap on the wrist and I'll fix it in a bit.

78
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:07,490
So for the moment initialize your door last opened to any value zero is absolutely fine.

79
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,440
Remember this is what you're going to need in order to do your calculation.

80
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,010
In fact I'll give you a helping hand just here.

81
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:18,400
And we'll set the door last opened to that value.

82
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:23,970
That is what we need in that particular place so the door last opened is whatever the time is in the

83
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:28,290
world that I give it a stamp then and then we can start counting from then.

84
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:32,810
And if it's been open longer than the door closed delay then we can close the door.

85
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:39,840
Now of course that'll be when we're no longer in the trigger zone the trigger volume itself that's when

86
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,650
it will switch down to the else statement down here.

87
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,420
Okay.

88
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,880
Time for your challenge.

89
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:50,300
Casey your challenge is to go ahead and write some simple time in code.

90
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:56,010
We've just got to fill in that remaining if statements and get the doors closing after a two second

91
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:56,960
delay.

92
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:59,260
Now of course you can change that.

93
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,150
That's the initial thing.

94
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:06,590
Make sure it stays open for two seconds and then you'll need to play test to ensure that you can't escape.

95
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:13,590
So see what values you can use so that you can escape and then dial it back until it's just you just

96
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,170
can't get to the door in time.

97
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:21,290
I know we almost had it before that was a pure coincidence of how everything worked out but play tests

98
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:27,120
that you can't escape and that will lead us on to needing something else in the scene in order to escape.

99
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:27,840
OK.

100
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:33,160
PULLS A video now and give it a go OK everybody welcome back.

101
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,640
Let's go ahead now and delay the doors closing.

102
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:36,870
OK.

103
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,710
So it really comes down to this potential if statement here.

104
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:49,270
So we want to say if something then shut the door so this bits of code can go in here.

105
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,100
That's that's crucial there.

106
00:06:51,640 --> 00:07:00,460
Now what do we need so we need to say if the current time take away when the door was last open is greater

107
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:07,120
than the door closed the delay that we've set up here we've already got two equals two seconds then

108
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,200
we want it's closed the door.

109
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:13,900
Okay because this door last Open is being updated every frame.

110
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:20,080
That's the important thing that is always going to be equal initially until it's not for at least two

111
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,190
seconds.

112
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:28,700
So we're going to get the world and then we're going to gets time seconds again.

113
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:34,310
Now we could stall that we could we could store this as the current time.

114
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,640
That would be absolutely fine.

115
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:42,110
So if you wanted to do that then by all means go ahead and then you wouldn't have to tie pin get well

116
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,930
get time seconds every time.

117
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,400
If I had to type it once more I would probably do that.

118
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:56,510
So if the world gets home seconds at the current time minus the door last open so if it is greater than

119
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,540
the door closed the light.

120
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,000
There we go.

121
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:04,880
I was wondering if I'd call it that I was thinking I was going to have to hop over here and find out

122
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,480
what it was called.

123
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,700
Okay so let's save that.

124
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,370
Oh we got a bit of funny white space here.

125
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,670
So let's do a tiny bit of tidying as well.

126
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:20,600
Obviously if you've got funny white space over your document go ahead clean it up as you go entirely

127
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,380
up to you.

128
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:24,180
And I'm going to just remove this extra bit of white space there.

129
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:24,900
Okay.

130
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,170
Save my file.

131
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,770
Now I've got some pretty code but it's a functional code.

132
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,970
Let's go find out okay.

133
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,180
So let's go ahead and compile.

134
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,620
Fingers crossed.

135
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:43,460
Oh I've got a failed pile all during my tidy up I think I've been a bit overzealous at the top here.

136
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:43,870
Yeah.

137
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,480
Have deleted the quotation mark.

138
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,900
OK no problem.

139
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:54,140
It's sometimes you know it's good to read these error messages to work out what have I done.

140
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,700
Oh dear silly me right.

141
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,400
It should be all okay now.

142
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:58,790
Brilliant.

143
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,570
Let's go ahead and press play.

144
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:04,340
Excellent as back up into the corner.

145
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,990
That looks good.

146
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:09,020
And one two.

147
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,400
And off it goes.

148
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:15,720
So when it's fully open obviously at the moment I can get all the way out.

149
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:22,370
So I need to change those figures to to play Tests but I also want to add in a tiny bit of a fortnight

150
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,060
in the corner.

151
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:30,040
So might as well do that now going to get my lights drag a spotlight into the corner.

152
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:38,600
I'm going to go to the four views here by clicking in the top right there so I can just line this a

153
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:45,090
little bit better with the world Okay where is our torch.

154
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:45,720
There it is.

155
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,610
Torch.

156
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,340
Spotlight.

157
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:53,230
It's definitely over the center there gets it over the center here as well.

158
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,500
That looks good.

159
00:09:54,500 --> 00:10:00,970
Now we're gonna go down to the details for it and narrow that cone that cone is far too wide at the

160
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:07,270
moment so the intensity is fine in a cone angle out Kurt Angle let's bring that in and really focus

161
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:10,250
in in the cone angle.

162
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,910
Not too fast with that to be honest.

163
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,730
There we go.

164
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,160
Does that push the outer cone angle.

165
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,480
Yes it has.

166
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,210
Fair enough.

167
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:17,590
There we go.

168
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:22,720
We've got some performance in the corner of the room and I'm going to adjust my timing now and also

169
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,740
I'm going to have the doors open and shut.

170
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,800
Just a little quicker so that the timing makes a bit more sense.

171
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:36,460
Let's go back over into our code and the first thing I want to do is have the door slammed shut.

172
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:39,840
Essentially I'm going to increase that all the way to two.

173
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:47,920
Then if they extra zero there and the door opening I think I still do want them opening relatively slow

174
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,840
but maybe just a little bit faster there.

175
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,080
Okay.

176
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,130
So now that I've got that what else do I want to do.

177
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:58,300
I want to change the actual delay itself.

178
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:04,190
Let's delay it for half a second and see if that's going to give us what we need.

179
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:10,980
Cause every time you do this you're going to need to compile let's maximize here and might as well build

180
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:18,270
the lighting as well remember building the lighting only is going to be quicker than building everything

181
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,560
of course.

182
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,170
And once that's done we won't have the error message.

183
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,620
Compiling is complete and we can press play.

184
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:28,370
So.

185
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,050
Oh look for something in the corner.

186
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:31,280
We go and stand in it.

187
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,980
The doors open which is really good.

188
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:38,230
Look they slam really well so let's see if we can get out.

189
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,240
Well that was close.

190
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,470
If we can try again.

191
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,550
It really needs to be felt like it.

192
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,130
You could make it you can make it.

193
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:49,010
Ah that's really close I think I've got the right values there.

194
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:50,760
I like the way it slams shut.

195
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,090
Oh that was really close.

196
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:59,310
So I think there is a chance that you could possibly escape but I think we've I've actually made to

197
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:01,390
tune it first time relatively well.

198
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,870
Now you may think oh of course you've done Mike because you've got the fingers written down.

199
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:05,620
Nope.

200
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:09,230
I just guessed that I bought it thought two seconds was slightly too long.

201
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,400
I thought a second would also be too long.

202
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,940
Half a second gives us that little bit of delay there.

203
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:19,560
And I like the difference between them opening slowly it's like they're teasing you.

204
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:25,020
Come on then go through and then you start going and they slam shut on you.

205
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:31,870
That's exactly the frustration you want to feel like if I can't get through like that how else am I

206
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,170
going to get through.

207
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:38,470
Of course we're going to have to add something to our scene soon so we can place it in that volume so

208
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,860
we can escape.

209
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,620
Now what values did you end up with.

210
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:47,170
Did you do a different opening and shock value like me so it slammed shut but teased when it opened

211
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:52,630
to share your values over in the discussions and I'll see you well in the next lecture.
