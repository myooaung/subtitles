00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,250
Hello everybody and welcome back in this show.

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:11,320
We're going to be modifying the default porn actor it's going to be the first step in making our grabber

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,070
system.

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,970
So first of all why blueprint is helpful in this particular case.

5
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:21,040
So there will be some times when coding things is better and sometimes why blueprint would be the right

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,240
way to go.

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,750
In fact let's go over that right now.

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:29,160
Blueprints is really helpful when you're making templates of assets because it's very visual.

9
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:35,590
It's very clear in the ED WHAT YOU'RE CHANGING AND You're preventing yourself from hard coding changes

10
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:41,830
to assets into the c++ code which makes it a lot harder to edit things later on.

11
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:47,350
And also if you wanted to change like the name of an assets then the editor will actually track those

12
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,240
changes.

13
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:51,250
Otherwise it would have to be done in code.

14
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,310
We'll go on to show you how to make a blueprint from the default porn.

15
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:01,290
Now are notes here that this blueprint class that we create is going to inherit from the default porn.

16
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:06,180
So therefore an is a relationship from the standard default porn class.

17
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:07,530
Now blueprints themselves.

18
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:12,940
They're like a template there a plan for building something which is great because it gives us a structure

19
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,780
by which we can place our grabber a.

20
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:24,050
We'll be going ahead and making an instance of our new blueprint in the scene itself and we'll explore

21
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:30,000
instantiating from the blueprint and modifying and seeing how those behaviors interact.

22
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:35,540
So creating an instance is instantiating and then we'll look at what happens when you go ahead and modify

23
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,160
its whilst it's in the scene when you modify in that instance.

24
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:39,780
Okay.

25
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:45,840
So over in on real if we go ahead and press play and then immediately inject ourselves we can look back

26
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:53,330
at our current default porn now the way that this is being set up is over in your project settings.

27
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,780
As I've indicated before over on your maps and modes the default game mode.

28
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:05,940
This is a C++ game mode which means that anything that was setting down here needs to be done in code.

29
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,210
However what we'll be doing in a moment is making a blueprint version of that.

30
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:16,290
We shall then enable us to select our own default pawn a blueprint version of it in the selected game

31
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,340
mode.

32
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:24,130
So this default form being specified here is this one here that appears the moment we press play.

33
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,220
So how do we go ahead and modify the pawn itself.

34
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,180
What if we go ahead and select sets you can select it's in two different ways.

35
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:36,240
Remember we're going to have to make sure that we play the game ejects ourselves look back upon the

36
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,850
default pawn that's in our scene.

37
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:43,440
You can either select it in the editor window itself or over in the world outline that once you've done

38
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,000
that.

39
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,820
We can go up the top here it's a blueprints and there's a couple of options.

40
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:52,790
And what we want to do is convert the selected actor into a blueprint class.

41
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,270
We'll go ahead and click on that.

42
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,660
It gives us a couple of options.

43
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,440
Let's pop it in our blueprints folder.

44
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,360
That would make sense and we've got a blueprint name here.

45
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:07,020
Default porn blueprint but we could also just append it with the name BP so we know it's a default porn

46
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,730
and it's a blueprint.

47
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,250
Let's go ahead and click Create blueprint.

48
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:11,510
Okay.

49
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,900
So that's opened up a new window unfortunately a multi monitor setup so I'm gonna have to drag that

50
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,400
down so you guys can see it.

51
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,370
You probably have this that's now appeared.

52
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,170
Now I could dockets at the top here so easily accessible but for the moment we'll come back to this

53
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:25,810
in a sec.

54
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:31,140
But for the moment let's just close that down and have a look at our world and see what we can do now

55
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:37,110
in our contents folder we now have our default porn blueprint and we can click and drag and create an

56
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,360
instance of that in our world.

57
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,170
Pretty awesome Hey.

58
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:41,340
Okay.

59
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:49,530
So that is just a copy of our original default porn and has all of whatever the default porn had as

60
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,020
well.

61
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:56,310
So if we go down into the content browser and double click on our default porn a new window will open

62
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,300
up because back to our blueprint again.

63
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:04,260
And if we have a look here we can see at the very top right the parent class is the default porn.

64
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:10,260
So that's where it's inheriting all of these settings from which is pretty awesome that we've got this

65
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,000
copy of our default porn.

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,630
And of course the great thing is that we can now go ahead and edit this.

67
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:20,010
So what we can do here is if we want to add some books we can't change any these at the moment.

68
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:24,860
We can go ahead and open up the full blueprint editor go ahead and click on that.

69
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,310
And of course it's opened up on another window for us.

70
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,590
We can bring that back down.

71
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,110
And wow we've got a lot of options here.

72
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:35,650
We've got all of our details that we were just looking at a moment ago over on the right hand side.

73
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,680
And we've got this big area in the middle.

74
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,620
Pretty awesome.

75
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,370
And we've got these three tabs of the top.

76
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,780
We're not going to worry about the event graph construction script at the moment but the viewport itself

77
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:49,830
this is where we can start let's say perhaps altering how our porn looks.

78
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,230
So we didn't wanted to be a sphere anymore we could modify it.

79
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,750
So it looks a different shape.

80
00:04:54,750 --> 00:05:01,250
In fact I think that's what we'll go ahead and do now as your challenge Okay so your challenge was I'd

81
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:07,520
like you to do is try making a rugby ball porn on American football if you're watching this over the

82
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,030
pond now modify the default porn blueprint somehow.

83
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:14,630
Now we know about the various transformers you can do.

84
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:21,260
So go ahead and play with those for example scaling on one axis would tend to make that kind of shape

85
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:28,590
that we're looking for Create an instance by dragging it into the world so close the blueprint editor

86
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:35,030
and then drag it from the content browser into the world and then once you've done that.

87
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:40,560
See how modifying the instance the one we've just dragged into the world so scaling on a different access

88
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,800
or rotate it around doesn't change the original blueprint.

89
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:51,030
And then when you're done just revert your changes to the default porn itself.

90
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:56,850
Okay so go ahead pulls of the now and give us a go Hello everybody and welcome back.

91
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:00,020
Let's hop on over internal rail and make ourselves a rug people.

92
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:04,580
Porn Okay so I've got the default porn open in front of me here.

93
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,360
I can close that down if I want and reopen it.

94
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:13,240
So just in case you guys don't have a open for a drag it once into my scene well I can delete that from

95
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:13,800
the scene.

96
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:14,410
Let's go ahead.

97
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:19,830
Double click it go to the viewport options here and going to select it and I'm just gonna scale there

98
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,160
on its y axis.

99
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:27,040
So this is going to be a very elongated I'm going to try and make it a bit more rugby ball shape.

100
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,710
Yeah about there that although I'm going to save it.

101
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:30,820
That's important.

102
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:36,280
And then we can go up and I could close that down but I'm going to come back to it in a bit so can undo

103
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,380
those changes.

104
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:43,510
Let's go back into our scene we can see that immediately the thumbnail associated with the default porn

105
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,450
looks different.

106
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:50,200
And when we drag it in look at that it's a completely different shape and because it's an instance of

107
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,150
it it doesn't really matter what we do here.

108
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:57,430
And if we go ahead now and change something about this we could make it wider we could make it even

109
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,900
longer.

110
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,890
It does not change the original blueprint.

111
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,530
We can go back here will always look like this.

112
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:10,950
And that's useful because that means you can have different instances having different properties so

113
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:14,620
the changes themselves don't get written back to the blueprint.

114
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,890
Now there is a way of doing that but we're not going to complicate things at the moment.

115
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:24,070
Now we're in the world and playing at the moment and that's one of the things why a lot of this lot

116
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,460
is all great out some of the click stop.

117
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,180
These will all come back again.

118
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,470
The details here.

119
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,940
We've also got this option at the top left to compile.

120
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:36,540
Now in general as you could see there that wasn't really changing much.

121
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,420
There's not anything really compile worthy at the moment.

122
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:45,900
But with our blueprints as we generate ones that are far more complex we can go ahead click compile

123
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:50,350
and it will just make sure the blueprint is working as expected.

124
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:55,080
Now you probably know this is where we can add components and we'll be doing that in a bit by adding

125
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,300
a grabber component up here.

126
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:02,480
And I asked you guys to set this back to being spherical and we can do that very easily.

127
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,770
Over here we've got all three scales and at the moment they're not set evenly.

128
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:13,470
So I'm going to come along here go point five and just tap between them and then I know I've got myself

129
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:16,450
a sphere back slightly bigger than it was before.

130
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:21,620
It's perhaps the sorts of thing that if I was paying attention to its original scale I might have I

131
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,580
might assumed in too much as well.

132
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:28,000
But when I clicked compile click save have a look in my world it looks pretty big.

133
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,350
So it was probably smaller than that before.

134
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,490
But I'm happy with the overall scale there.

135
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:33,730
Okay.

136
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,090
And we'll get rid of that default porn in the scene.

137
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,380
And now it's time to go ahead and make the grabber.

138
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:46,420
So what we can do here is go down to to add new we're going to add a new C++ class.

139
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:49,040
It's going to go on the actor itself.

140
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,690
It's going to be an active component.

141
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:55,370
Remember our default pawn here pawn inherits from actor.

142
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,350
Going to be an actor component.

143
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,470
Let's go ahead and click next.

144
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:05,250
And once again we're going to have to give it a name so I'm going to call it grabber oh dear I've hit

145
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:11,640
caps lock obviously so I'm going to call it grab there and go ahead and create the class.

146
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:17,720
Now it's going to take a few moments to do that okay so there we go he's opened up the grabber header

147
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:23,420
file and implementation file that's absolutely fine it's got all the boilerplate code you'd expect to

148
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,110
see in there as well.

149
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:29,030
Skip back over into unreal and you can see down at the bottom.

150
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:32,850
That's our content browser now has a grab a component in it.

151
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:39,260
So what we can now do is go to our default porn blueprint and add components.

152
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:42,370
And this is where we can search for our grabber boom.

153
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:47,080
So now our default porn has the grab component on it.

154
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:54,210
Now we have changed something here so we're going to have to click compile and I'm gonna save that and

155
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,620
just shut that down for the moment.

156
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,900
I don't think we need to go back to that just yet.

157
00:09:58,990 --> 00:09:59,250
Okay.

158
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:05,460
So let's go back to our blueprint strike in the default porn once again and lift that up and out to

159
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,510
the floor.

160
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:11,880
Now if we go over to its details panels it's going to be almost the same as it was before.

161
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,080
But there we go.

162
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:17,800
We have the grabber component attached to its already brilliant.

163
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:23,940
So this is now the reusable objects that we are going to be able to replace our standard default porn

164
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:30,560
with because remember when we go ahead and press play and then injects ourselves from the scene look

165
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:37,000
back at ourselves and look at these two actors that are in our scene one of them doesn't have the grabber

166
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,250
on.

167
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,470
So we do need to have the grappa there.

168
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,650
Otherwise we're just not going to be able to pick up anything.

169
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:46,270
So what we need to do next is changing out our game mode.

170
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:53,430
So we're using the default porn blueprints that we've just made here and we'll do that in the next lecture.
