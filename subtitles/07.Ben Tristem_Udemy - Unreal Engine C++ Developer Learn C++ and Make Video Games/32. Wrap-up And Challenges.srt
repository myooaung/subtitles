1
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:08,240
They're going gonna be a few finishing touches that we can add to our game to make this really feel

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,910
like a final small full featured Jamm entry.

3
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,220
And that's what we're gonna be doing in this lecture.

4
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:19,130
The first very small thing I've noticed is that our projectile is moving through the air in a very kind

5
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,300
of rigid flat way.

6
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:25,200
It's being launched without any rotation and then flying through the air with accounting for velocity.

7
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:30,410
To show you a better idea of what I mean, I'm just going to remove the particle system from the projectile

8
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,940
so that we can see it in motion and also slow the velocity so that we can see it moving for a little

9
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,410
bit longer on screen.

10
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,720
And I'll be resetting these changes in a moment.

11
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,910
So don't feel that you need to follow these two steps.

12
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:45,740
So hopefully you can see from the demonstration in the background, the projectile kind of falls out

13
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,650
of the barrel and then just very rigidly moves to the floor.

14
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:53,930
And we can really easily improve this with one simple change on the projectile movement component.

15
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:58,460
So let's go back to the projectile, select the projectile movement component, and we just want to

16
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,700
take the rotation follows velocity option.

17
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,130
And the name here really describes what this is doing.

18
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:05,690
So I'm not gonna go into detail on that.

19
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,390
But with the speed and everything set back to how it was, we can see here that we get a kind of nice

20
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,140
arc to the path of the projectile now.

21
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,150
So I'm going to put the projectile particle system back on.

22
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:18,710
And that has fixed that one.

23
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,300
The next thing is that we're currently making the tart's face towards the mouse cursor and we can improve

24
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:24,720
this, too.

25
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,590
So let's go over to the player, control the blueprint klutz.

26
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:33,030
And as the controller is in charge of the cursor visibility, we can also change how it's visualized

27
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,510
here as well.

28
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:39,170
So if we go to the default, Mosko struck down and pick something a little bit more combat themed,

29
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,550
like the cross-hair option that we have here, and then we go another very small change.

30
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:47,930
But just another quick look at a bit more of what the player controller can do.

31
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:53,240
And also, neither curse just feels a little bit less default and a little bit more themed.

32
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,290
So one of the bigger things I've noticed is that we can actually drive through walls and other points.

33
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:05,630
And this is likely because we have all of the porn's default collision set to overlap rather than block

34
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:05,830
check.

35
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,000
So let's return to the classes and we'll check that again.

36
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:14,670
So all we should need to do is change this to block all on the collision setup and then we'll do the

37
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,650
same for the pawn Taric class as well.

38
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:23,410
And again, we've got a very small, quick change here, but this feels much better as this reacts a

39
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,510
lot more high, the player would expect it to.

40
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:30,220
And then the final thing, and this is definitely something that you can expand on, but that is to

41
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,540
set the level.

42
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:37,370
So I've created a very small map here with some simple rules just to act as dividers between the targets.

43
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,310
This was intended to allow multiple targets to be used when testing, while also allowing the player

44
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,660
some wiggle room to kind of move around and avoid the shots by hiding behind these walls.

45
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:52,420
So now that we have something resembling a small game ready to play from start to finish and with a

46
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:56,710
win lose stakes, we're going to want to share our end product with other people.

47
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:02,860
So we'll go through the steps needed to package the project, ready to play or hand to a friend or family

48
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:08,380
member to test three or again for a game of entry ready to submit to the platform of your choice.

49
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,550
Before actually packaging anything, we have a few different things that we can check and update in

50
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:19,010
the projects setting settings, so the most important of these is going to be in the maps and mode section.

51
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,990
We want to change the default map that the user will be brought into when they launch the game.

52
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,760
So we can see that we have two options here.

53
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:32,660
And before uploading and sharing the kind of starter project I had already set the default Edita map

54
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,570
or the Start-Up map to be the main map that I've created.

55
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,690
And this just means that whenever you open the project from the epic launcher or by running the You

56
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,980
Project file, we'll be greeted with the main map.

57
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,800
And this just saves us from opening at each time that we start.

58
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:51,320
Then in a similar way, the game default map is currently set to the entry map, which is the default

59
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,330
empty map generated by the engine.

60
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,120
And the game map is the level that will be loaded when the packaged project is run.

61
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:03,110
So this means that at the moment, if we gave this to somebody to play, they'd be stuck in an empty

62
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:03,890
demo map.

63
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,740
So we're gonna want to change this to also be our main map.

64
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,060
Then everything else here is fine as it is.

65
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:15,020
We can just leave the maps and a moat section and scroll down to the platform section and select windows,

66
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,250
which I'll be demonstrating how to build four.

67
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,250
So we get some pretty interesting options here.

68
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,630
And these are very simple things.

69
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:27,110
But again, in kind of terms of full developed games or just a game jam injury, things like this can

70
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:30,500
make your games done that little bit looking a little bit more as though you've gone through the whole

71
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:36,830
process, adding these splash screens and the lone Tricon just makes your entry standout is a more unique

72
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,660
and refined experience.

73
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,760
And the main benefit has all of these can be customized to fit the same aesthetic or style is your game.

74
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,220
So everything feels like one more kind of complete package.

75
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,780
Now, I don't have any assets here to change these, but do feel free to jump into a Tudi up package

76
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:54,170
of your choice and come up with some cool designs to swap these out with.

77
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:58,970
And just in case you're wondering, you can get the desired sizes of the images by highlighting the

78
00:04:58,970 --> 00:04:59,390
elements.

79
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:04,790
So if you ever forget how big the meant to be, you can just find out what the default icon sizes are

80
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,500
just here.

81
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:08,660
Okay, so that was just more of a look at the options you can get.

82
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:12,800
We've made the important changes to our map so we can go back to the main tab.

83
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:18,350
And from here, if you go to these settings, you can also change some of your project quality settings.

84
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,360
I'll be leaving Meinert Cinematic.

85
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:25,850
Do note that if you start checking and changing things here, that this can cause the project shaders

86
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:26,690
to recomposed.

87
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:31,670
If you don't have time to wait for however long your your system takes to recompile shaders.

88
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,620
Don't go changing too much right now.

89
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:36,380
So again, just wanted to let you know, though, that that option is there.

90
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,170
But with everything set, we can go and package our project.

91
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:45,560
We need to this from the file menu, go down to package projects and then select the Windows 64 bit

92
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:45,980
option.

93
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:51,920
Now, before this final step, you can also choose your build type between debug game development and

94
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,370
shipping.

95
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:57,650
So these control how much of the engine specific content is included, such as debug symbols, which

96
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:02,540
will be included in the debug game option so you can still run through and debug your code this way

97
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:06,410
or the more stripped out and performance option is the development belt.

98
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:12,170
But it still retains some of the engine content, such as console commands and some games even released

99
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:12,440
with this.

100
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:18,740
I remember playing Ike on the PS4 and I realized that we could actually still run a lot of the unreal

101
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,340
specific debug commands to get some of the stats from the games and stuff.

102
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,750
That was pretty fun to find out.

103
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,590
And then we've got the shipping option, which will take a little bit longer to build.

104
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:33,470
It's the most performance friendly option, stripped out everything from the unreal systems to us and

105
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,840
only containing the things you need purely to run your game.

106
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,270
So you'll lose things like console commands and stuff like that.

107
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:43,580
And this is the option usually used for the kind of final gold disc development build release.

108
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,730
For this example, though, I'm just going to leave this as development.

109
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:50,210
It's the default option and just very easy to work with for our needs.

110
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,670
So let's click to package to Windows.

111
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:58,940
You're going to need to choose a folder to package the project to and then click the select folder button

112
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,140
to start the process.

113
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:04,940
So I've packaged mine to the desktop and when everything is ready, you can go to your Windows.

114
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,970
No edit a folder, which generally you're gonna want to rename straight away.

115
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,430
So I'm just going to change this to Toon tanks then inside of the folder.

116
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:15,530
You just want to launch the application file, which will take us into our main map and we can begin

117
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:15,890
playing.

118
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:20,390
And here just to mention as well, a quick step back to the map settings.

119
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,630
When you've got things like the game main map, you'd usually set that something like an animated splash

120
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:30,260
screen that you might want to introduce to the player when they first load up the game, which would

121
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:34,790
then transition to the main menu or just go straight to the main menu and let the player then transition

122
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,850
into the level select or however your game set up.

123
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,590
So just an example for this, because we only have the one map going straight to gameplay makes sense,

124
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,500
but in larger kind of more scope like games.

125
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:51,110
That's how you would use the game default map and the editor default map and the other city for maps

126
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:54,470
are really handy for when you want to swap the level that you're working on.

127
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,340
So if you know that you're going to be changing focus, you've completed level one and you're gonna

128
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:02,600
be changing focus and working solely on level two for a while, then you can change your edit a default

129
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:07,730
map to level two so that every time you close and open the project, that will be the map you immediately

130
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:08,270
brought into.

131
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:09,630
OK.

132
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:13,270
So with all of that done, we've now wrapped up the project in its entirety.

133
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,950
We have the full gameplay loop.

134
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:20,020
We've looked at some the concepts of inheritance and reusability of classes.

135
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,140
And then also not just making things functional and leaving them.

136
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:28,960
We've went back and added a Polish pass as well to see how we can make some really simple changes to

137
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:33,160
our core mechanics or just to add some flat to the mechanics that were already there.

138
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:38,350
So we're going to exit out of this section and I'm going to leave you with a mega challenge of a sort.

139
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,420
So these are just some things that you can go through.

140
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:45,370
And I think all of the stuff that we've covered in the section should allow you to easily tackle a lot

141
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,170
of these tasks they'll be providing.

142
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,040
And if you want to do all of them, you can, of course, pick and choose the ones which best suit your

143
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,400
interests.

144
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:54,940
But there's going to be a nice way to build upon the project that we've just created.

145
00:08:55,150 --> 00:09:00,400
So the first thing would be to add some more level design, maybe bring in your own props or even follow

146
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:06,130
the kind of aesthetics that I've gone with and just create some extra sections and bring in the use

147
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:10,210
of more enemies and think of ways that you could make the game play or the level just a little bit more

148
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:10,750
interesting.

149
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,540
What we had for our development purposes.

150
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,430
So the next thing is a little bit more of a code task, and that would be to add a score system.

151
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,260
So we've already seen the use of blueprint quotable events.

152
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:27,610
We've seen a way that we can still pass information from our C++ class to our blueprint classes controlling

153
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:28,300
the widgets.

154
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:32,380
So you could add something into the game mode, parent class to start tracking the score of individual

155
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:37,810
targets and then pass that down in a similar way that we're calling a start timer to begin.

156
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,280
You could do this a similar thing to update the amount of score the player has and track this through

157
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:42,970
the gameplay.

158
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:47,240
Now, something that kind of goes hand in hand with this would be to create some new enemy types.

159
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:53,020
So maybe trying to create a new C++ anime porn type in the same way that we've got our porn tank and

160
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,340
our porn at Tarique class.

161
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:59,980
And then the blueprint derived classes of those or even just make a simple blueprint variant of the

162
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,200
porn star class.

163
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,310
If you were to incorporate a score system into these, then you could set different scores for each

164
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:08,830
of your different anime porn types.

165
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,940
And on top of this, we've really exposed variables, slight change, things like giving them different

166
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:17,790
health values, different fire rates, and visualize them with different matches.

167
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,900
So do go ahead and give those a go.

168
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:25,090
The important thing is, once you've started creating your own take on the projects that I've provided,

169
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:29,860
start sharing them with the community, get some feedback from other students and definitely look at

170
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:33,850
helping each other out with the changes that you're you're going through in the projects and see if

171
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:38,080
you can share any hints and tips between the different new ideas that you'll be coming up with.
