1
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:05,580
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:11,430
In this letter, we're going to be introducing you to Animation's How We can use the same animations

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,580
on multiple different types of measures using something called a scouten.

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,010
Let's dive in and see what all that's about.

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:24,400
So as I said at the end of last lecture, this is looking weird without any sort of animation.

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,220
So it's time to do a one on one on animations.

7
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:33,470
The first thing to do is to see if we can find some animations in our asset pack.

8
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:37,190
An easy way to do this is using the filters in the content brands, which you've probably come across

9
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:40,280
before, and fildes by all sorts of stuff here.

10
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,620
And one of them is the all animation assets.

11
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:43,220
And it's going to go ahead.

12
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:44,130
Check that.

13
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,270
Is it ads in all of the animation assets?

14
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:48,500
You can see there is a bunch of stuff in here.

15
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:53,690
We're particularly looking for the green ones because these are basic animation sequences, as they're

16
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:54,020
called.

17
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:59,780
Ben, go ahead and double click on one of those and you can see it automatically starts playing in the

18
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:00,410
animation.

19
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:06,020
Ed, there's a lot going on here in the animation, Ed, but the main thing to see is this timeline.

20
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,220
That's the main difference.

21
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:11,540
We've also got the asset details, which is, you know, a desales pain.

22
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,830
We've seen that sort of stuff before.

23
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,730
There's also this stuff up at the top, right, which we can dive into into second.

24
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,540
But the main thing to look out for is that it's looping through this timeline, which you can go ahead

25
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,720
and grab points to any keyframe in this timeline, if you like.

26
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:27,950
You can play it forwards.

27
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,080
You can play it backwards as your heart desires.

28
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,940
You can step through frame by frame.

29
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,510
You can also use this asset browser over in the bottom right.

30
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:41,270
And that asset Browse just allows you to search through all of the animations related to the skeleton.

31
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,210
Now, I just use the word you probably don't know a skeleton.

32
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:44,710
What is it?

33
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:48,000
Well, we're dealing with a skeletal mesh animations.

34
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:48,920
What is that?

35
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,680
That's a mesh that has a skeleton.

36
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:56,450
It's a mesh that you want to manipulate through a bunch of bones.

37
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:02,180
So if we click up here in the top right on the skeleton, you can see that this guy is in an ape pose.

38
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,350
Here's a mesh.

39
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,890
But then he's got a bunch of different bones here.

40
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:11,270
We can select any one of these bones and we could do something like rotate it.

41
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,930
And you can see that that one wasn't a particularly useful one to select.

42
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:22,670
Maybe if I select with my mouse the spine and I rotate the spine, you can see how that changes the

43
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,430
rest of the mesh based on changing the spine.

44
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,010
So great.

45
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,970
That's kind of what a skeleton is.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,410
But that's not all.

47
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:36,800
The skeleton kind of exists within the modelling program that was creating this mesh, but a skeleton

48
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,990
unreal has a slightly different function.

49
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:46,690
So this skeleton asset here, its main function is to tie together the meshes and animations.

50
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:54,080
You can have multiple measures which all use the same skeleton asset in Unreal and set multiple animations

51
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,190
that use the same skeleton.

52
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:59,870
And because of that, we can share those animation assets between different meshes.

53
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,610
The example here is the Arrow, a couple of different Raith measures that I've included, different

54
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:09,140
skins on that Wraith mash and some of them have extra bits and bobs on the mesh.

55
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:14,000
But they're going to use the same animations because those animations are based on a skeleton that they

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,780
all share.

57
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,460
So that's why we have this a little UI setup widget in the top.

58
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:19,680
Right.

59
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,650
We won't look at the blueprints just now.

60
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:26,690
That's another asset that depends upon the skeleton, but not one that we're currently interested in.

61
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:30,520
So the skeletons, what hangs or all of this together brings it all together.

62
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:35,630
They all depend upon that same skeleton, which means that this dropdown allows us to choose between

63
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:38,030
different matches that use this skeleton.

64
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:44,330
And the dropdown next to animation allows us to choose different animations that rely upon this same

65
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:44,840
skeleton.

66
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,330
So I can go and swap out to a different animation.

67
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,740
I can swap out to a different mesh if I so choose.

68
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,330
And you can see how that meshes different, got different spiky bits.

69
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,830
It's got different textures on it.

70
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,550
So let's try out a challenge.

71
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:06,050
Let's see if you can find a suitable running animation that we can play just on a continuous loop at

72
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:06,350
the moment.

73
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:11,720
It'll look a little bit weird in the game, a less weird than a guy running around in an ape pose.

74
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:18,050
So look through the available animations using either the content browser or that browser.

75
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:25,430
Inside the animations, editor set one for the Wraith carrot's to go into our BP character that we've

76
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,480
already created.

77
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,830
Go and find the MASH and see if you can find a way of setting the animation.

78
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:31,730
A little bit of a challenge there.

79
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:36,290
Haven't shown you have to do it, but see if you can find the right property for setting an animation

80
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:42,410
and then try swapping that the Wraith character for a different mash that has the same skeleton and

81
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,180
see if that continues to work.

82
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,710
Pause video and have a go.

83
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:47,820
Kay, welcome back.

84
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:54,360
So let's see, first of all, I need to find a run animation, so I'm gonna do this via the asset browser

85
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,020
in this.

86
00:04:55,150 --> 00:05:00,090
Ed, you could do it by either searching it through the asset browser or doing the dropdown on the animations

87
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,050
and searching.

88
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,610
They're going to look for run.

89
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:07,610
And interesting love doesn't come up with anything automatically there.

90
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,120
So I'm against searching the asset browser run.

91
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,000
Not coming up.

92
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:15,440
Let's see, maybe there's a walk see ability.

93
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,310
Let's see this one.

94
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,400
Maybe that's with the right mouse button held down.

95
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,510
So he's aiming.

96
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,740
That's probably a good one.

97
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,660
Start off with you want the forward one.

98
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,910
So we gonna hit play forword.

99
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,520
There's one for Backwords left.

100
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:30,240
Right.

101
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,060
You can see how this stuff is going to start slotting together.

102
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,540
Right now we're just doing a one oh one on skeletal animation.

103
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,790
So let's use this ability.

104
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:47,070
Are M b walk forward and let's go and find ourselves, first of all and get to cancel out this filter

105
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,800
for Animation's gonna go and select out BP.

106
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:57,690
She's a character and open up that blueprint, go to the mesh in the components hierarchy and then select

107
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:00,480
the in the details pain down in the mesh setting.

108
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,110
We've got different skeletal measures that we could swap out.

109
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:10,290
And just to clarify, the scandal meshes of the ones that have skeletons, the ones that are able to

110
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:15,140
deform themselves with a skeleton, whereas static measures are the ones that can't deform the cells

111
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,550
usually used for rigid things like cars.

112
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,400
So in the section above this, we have animation.

113
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,640
You can see this animation mode and anime class.

114
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:28,140
So we'd have to do a dropdown on the animation mode if you had figured that out.

115
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,230
Don't worry if he didn't, but it was good to have a little look around.

116
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:39,260
Then you can see we can use animation asset in here and we can swap that animation asset out for what

117
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:43,050
was it, AAB M B and then underscore walk.

118
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:47,730
I believe they'll go walk forward and that's gonna be on looping.

119
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:51,330
We're going to play it initially from the initial position of zero.

120
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,530
Let's try that out.

121
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,650
If we go to the viewport, you can see he's already doing that walking animation so I can go ahead and

122
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:03,120
play and he's going to be walking in my game as well.

123
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,260
And as long as I'm moving forward, that all looks hunky dory.

124
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:11,820
But as soon as I start moving backwards and sideways, it all falls apart.

125
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,870
We're gonna fix that.

126
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,320
Don't worry.

127
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,900
But for starters, we've figured out how to do this.

128
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:20,070
The other thing we need to do is try with a different mesh.

129
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,160
So we've done it with a basic raith mesh.

130
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,080
There are other measures in here, but they're not gonna work because they're not based off the same

131
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,370
skeleton as the animation.

132
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:32,180
In fact, you can see unselected the animation to play.

133
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:41,670
So if we go back to our mesh and change that out for the Wraith skeletal mesh, then go to our Annam

134
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:48,510
and look for the walk again, walk forward, then swap out a mesh for one that has a compatible skeleton

135
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,700
such as the Luna Ops skeleton.

136
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:56,670
You can see it hasn't removed the animation because they share a skeleton, so they are compatible with

137
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,330
one another.

138
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,010
Awesome stuff.

139
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:04,740
So now hopefully you understand a little bit more about what an animation is, how you're able to play

140
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,880
it and how it relates to skeletons, and it's a skeletal meshes.

141
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:15,670
Next video will be a brief interlude on how to fix a little collision bug that we may have seen just

142
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,750
glitching in the background there.

143
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,010
So I'll see you there.
