00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.590
Hello and welcome in this lecture.

2
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.970
We're going to introduce a new node called the BLENDE Poses by Boolean, which will allow us to check

3
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.670
a checkbox and kill off our character.

4
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.200
Let's dive in and see how it works.

5
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:15.440
OK.

6
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.190
So we want to get our character to die when we reduce the health down to zero.

7
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:27.900
So the first place we're going to be looking at is animation blueprint, because that is the place that

8
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.580
we're playing our various animations and we want to switch over essentially from playing.

9
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:38.670
If we go over to our Adam graph, we want to switch over from playing this BLENDE space over into playing

10
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.030
a death animation and basically to never go back from there.

11
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.510
So the way we're going to do this is to use a new type of node called a blend by Boolean.

12
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.140
So if we.

13
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.320
Right.

14
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.870
Click here and look for the different types of Blende that we can get in here, I'm going to scroll

15
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:55.200
to the top.

16
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.950
There's a whole bunch of BLENDE poses down here that is selected for me by default, in a way.

17
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.670
But if we do a blend poses by boolean, you can see quite clearly that we've got two options here.

18
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.760
A true pose and a false pose.

19
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:17.640
So basically what we'd want to be doing is to play our B asplin space locomotion animation when we are

20
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.080
not dead.

21
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.730
And otherwise we want to play added animation as the true pose.

22
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:30.060
And then here we've got some options for how how quickly it's going to blend between the two animations

23
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.460
when the boolean value changes now.

24
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.890
In our case, we're not gonna have players resurrecting.

25
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.130
So the most likely case is that we're just going to hit that boolean once and not go back.

26
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.730
So what we need here, we need a death animation.

27
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:45.180
So I'm going to.

28
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.390
Right.

29
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.530
Click and search for death and see if we can find a few ones here.

30
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.180
We've got death backwards or death forward.

31
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.590
So let's just have a look at the differences between those by going to our animation view.

32
00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.920
And we'll look for death in there just to preview those animations.

33
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.850
So death backwards.

34
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.720
Let's have a look.

35
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:02.700
Let's do that again.

36
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.940
So.

37
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:03.320
Okay.

38
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.200
Is being shot from behind and falling forwards is kind of the opposite of what I would expect.

39
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.990
Death forward is probably the one we want.

40
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.090
Where are you being killed from in front?

41
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.950
I think that's what it's trying to say.

42
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.530
So let's go and open up the death forward.

43
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.740
They go we kind of get shot and fall backwards.

44
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.080
So that's the one I'm going to want.

45
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.750
Going to dock my shooter animation blueprints to the main window.

46
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.560
And in here, we're going to look for death.

47
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:36.120
Forward how we're going to play that through the true pose and then hook up the output pin of the BLENDE

48
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.560
poses by Boole to the output pose.

49
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:39.960
We hit compile now.

50
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.950
You should see it's playing that B.S. locomotion.

51
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.690
If I hits the checkbox and recompile, you can see it is playing at death animation.

52
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:49.950
But note it's looping.

53
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.750
So one thing we can do here to prevent that is by selecting that node.

54
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.080
The play death forward.

55
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.980
We can uncheck the loop animation in details.

56
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.850
Painter from the right and hit compile and now it should play the death animation and then come to a

57
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.250
rest at the end of it and stop, not go any further from there, which is exactly what we want here.

58
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:18.120
It's time for your challenge to add a death boolean, we've been controlling everything else via those

59
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.660
variables on our animation blueprints, time to add a variable to the blueprint for death and whether

60
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:25.770
we are dead or not.

61
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:33.380
Set the BLENDE based on this variable and then test it without compiling within the blueprint or compile

62
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.770
first.

63
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.120
B what had to recompile every time you flip the switch and you should be able to see it.

64
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.520
Switch between our death animation and movement animation.

65
00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.230
And with that information, you should be able to see whether the timings on that blende node are correct

66
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.530
or not.

67
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.900
So pause the video and have a go.

68
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.400
Okay, welcome back.

69
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.560
So hopefully this was fairly simple to do, let's go into the variables in my blueprint, pain at any

70
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.100
variable.

71
00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.410
It's automatically a boolean for me for some reason.

72
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.780
And I'm just gonna have this as is dead.

73
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.910
That's gonna be the state that we're going to then Grampian the character in the next lecture.

74
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.670
Not in this lecture, going to drag this into our Annam Grauwe get is dead and then I'm going to hook

75
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.790
it up to our active value like so.

76
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:22.170
And now if we compile, we should see is dead shop in the anime preview.

77
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.610
Ed, over on the right bottom.

78
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.910
Right.

79
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:31.660
And if I check the is dead checkbox then it goes ahead and switches from our locomotion to playing at

80
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.030
death animation.

81
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:34.140
Fantastic.

82
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.600
So that's what I wants to achieve in this lecture.

83
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.960
And in the next sets, we're gonna hook that up to the actual gameplay.
