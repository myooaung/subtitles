Hello everybody and welcome back.
1

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.150
Hopefully just a quick one here before we dive on over into Unreal and on asking for help and how you
2

3
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.020
can have better help from not only us but other people you're asking questions of.
3

4
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.170
So give us your project log.
4

5
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.570
Now that won't mean anything to you quite yet.
5

6
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.780
I will show you where to get your project log in a few moments.
6

7
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:30.420
Help answer other students questions is one of the big ones that I find has really helped me gain a
7

8
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.870
big understanding of any topic that I'm working on.
8

9
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.040
Once you're able to answer other people's questions you really have got a grounded knowledge in the
9

10
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.230
subject you're talking about.
10

11
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.400
Be specific when you are asking a question make sure you say exactly what you have done to cause your
11

12
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.380
issue.
12

13
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.680
Please don't say help.
13

14
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.410
Unreal has crashed.
14

15
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.000
That's not going to help anybody.
15

16
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.860
We need to know what an error code was or what you were doing right up to that point.
16

17
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.060
That's incredibly important for us to be able to help you.
17

18
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.190
You could have accidentally kicked your power plug briefly.
18

19
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.340
You know it could be absolutely anything if you're not specific it won't help us help you tell us what
19

20
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.140
you've tried.
20

21
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.730
And I know I get frustrated with this personally if I've got a problem and I forget to tell people I've
21

22
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.710
tried already and they just keep giving me things that I've tried.
22

23
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.230
Well if I told them that in the first place they wouldn't have probably come back with those things.
23

24
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.930
But do tell us what you've tried so far so we can help you solve your issue and let us know when you've
24

25
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.880
solved your issue as well whether that's from our help or whether you found out the solution straight
25

26
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.130
away leaving a hanging question means that we've got something to answer all that we end up hassling
26

27
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.320
you to say Well have you solved it because we want to make sure that you are back on the track of learning
27

28
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.360
and improving in Unreal.
28

29
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.960
Let's talk about this project log real quick.
29

30
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.300
OK so in front of us here we have the Unreal projects folder where we've extracted the Bull Cow Game
30

31
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.250
starter kits.
31

32
00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.890
We double click on that.
32

33
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.800
We have a series of folders.
33

34
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.880
We've already talked about some of these folders one of the other things that we can do is go into the
34

35
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.820
saved folder and within here we've got our logs we go into our logs folder.
35

36
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.870
We get this Bull Cow Game the name of the project and it's log.
36

37
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.660
This can be really helpful when you've got a specific crashing issue for instance being able to give
37

38
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.660
us a copy of that log either attach it or link to it or even just to cut and paste of what's inside
38

39
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.430
it can help us help you.
39

40
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.460
If you do do that cuts and paste by the way please use code formatting when you go and paste it otherwise
40

41
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.810
it may look a big mess.
41

42
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.090
Hi there Sam from the future with one common issue that you might be having if you already had Visual
42

43
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.400
Studio installed and it is an older version than 16.3
43

44
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.760
Then you need to upgrade to a version of 16.4 or greater that will not have bugs when
44

45
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.620
trying to compile code in Visual Studio so do make sure you check that version number if you already
45

46
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.750
had Visual Studio installed before this okay.
46

47
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.190
So I hope you don't run into two issues on your journey with Unreal but when you do we're here to help
47

48
00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.780
you and please help us help you the best we can by giving a specific information.
48

49
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.590
And tell us what you've already tried and when you've solved it.
49

50
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.250
Brilliant.
50

51
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.630
Tell us you've solved it.
51

52
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.960
And of course if you're in a position to answering other people's questions is a great way of demonstrating
52

53
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.110
and solidifying your knowledge with Unreal.
53

54
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.690
I'll see you all in the next lecture.
