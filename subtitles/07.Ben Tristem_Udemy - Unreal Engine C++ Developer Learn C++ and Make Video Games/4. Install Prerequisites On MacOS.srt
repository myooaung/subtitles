Hey Hey fellow wonderful Mac people.
1

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,710
So if you're on P.C. or Linux you may as well completely skip this video because I don't think there's
2

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,450
any value in it for you.
3

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:18,690
But if you're on macOS first thing we need to do is check whether or not you have at least macOS
4

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,140
10.14 Mojave
5

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,020
Because if you don't then you're going to have trouble with Unreal Engine later.
6

7
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:30,290
So if you don't then upgrade and I hope that you can upgrade that's part of the course prerequisites.
7

8
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:30,730
Awesome.
8

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,930
With that out of the way and talking about prerequisites.
9

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,910
The reason we're doing this as a reminder is that Unreal Engine is going to need something called a
10

11
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:39,480
compiler.
11

12
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,430
Now to find a compiler in the previous video if you didn't watch the previous video watch the first
12

13
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:49,230
two and a half minutes or so because they will go through some of these basics and explain this diagram
13

14
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,960
in more detail but we're over here on the right hand side.
14

15
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,850
Installing Xcode to go alongside Unreal Engine but also to make sure that the compiler is available
15

16
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,050
to do its magic and work between Unreal Engine and the disk and make things that are actually runnable.
16

17
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,160
Okey dokey.
17

18
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:08,790
So later in the course we're gonna be compiling C++ code ourselves from the terminal or at least from
18

19
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,130
within inside Visual Studio Code.
19

20
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:16,460
And for that to work then a command called a g++ would need to work and at the moment you don't
20

21
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:17,460
need by the way to follow this.
21

22
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,940
I'm just demonstrating that if you were to open a terminal and try that now you'll get the following
22

23
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:25,830
dialog which will say it can't run because you don't have the necessary prerequisites.
23

24
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,300
Well you may have the necessary prerequisites but even if you do what I want us to do is make sure that
24

25
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,860
we get Xcode.
25

26
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,300
So that's gonna be your challenge in a minute.
26

27
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,430
You can have two things in your challenge one is gonna be to get Xcode.
27

28
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,770
The other thing we're going to need installed is the Epic Games Launcher.
28

29
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,020
So I don't need to teach you how to install software.
29

30
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:48,600
He is a very simple challenge for you install Epic Games Launcher and Xcode. Get Xcode installing from
30

31
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,450
the AppStore agree to any terms and conditions.
31

32
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:55,610
If you're on a slow broadband you might want to let that finish before also getting the Epic Games Launcher
32

33
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:02,220
going that's up to you but also get the Epic Games Launcher installing and we're gonna use that later
33

34
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,720
to get Unreal downloading but not in this video we'll do that all together with the P.C. people and
34

35
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:15,040
any issues help each other in the community so go ahead get Epic Games Launcher and Xcode downloading.
35

36
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:15,960
All right welcome back.
36

37
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,630
So well I've got this Epic Games Launcher page open up for a start that going pretty simple.
37

38
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:24,360
You need to download for Mac and that will start.
38

39
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,720
So I'll leave that going in the background and go back to the App Store.
39

40
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:32,260
Now in the App Store of course you need to be signed in pretty obviously so I'm going to click on get
40

41
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,330
Xcode and then install Xcode.
41

42
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:38,560
It's a free program and don't worry about the low ratings that's people complaining about various things
42

43
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,700
it's actually a pretty good system and required for us to work inside Unreal with C++.
43

44
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:52,720
So sign into your Apple I.D. If you haven't already. username and password let the App Store do its thing
44

45
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,070
its whirligig is going to go round in circles until it's convinced that you have a valid Apple account
45

46
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,200
and then you are worthy of downloading the mighty Xcode.
46

47
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:04,690
All right so while that works out whether I'm worthy or not I'm going to pop back to safari and see
47

48
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,600
how we're doing with our Epic Games Launcher download.
48

49
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,710
I think it's done. Yep.
49

50
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,080
And I'm just gonna install that.
50

51
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,010
It also mentions Unreal Tournament.
51

52
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,150
You'd also use the same launcher to launch things like Fortnight and other games.
52

53
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,210
It's basically Epic Games launcher.
53

54
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:22,810
If anything to do with Epic Games this is how you launch. Normal software install not going to talk you
54

55
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,960
through how you do that just go ahead get that installed.
55

56
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,240
I'm going to eject the image file there.
56

57
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,880
I always eject my image files on the Mac by the way immediately just for cleanness and also to make
57

58
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,070
sure I'm running the program actually from my install directory not from that image.
58

59
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,440
If you end up with a whole load of images sitting there needing to be ejected maybe that's the time
59

60
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,730
to tidy that up.
60

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,460
Okay now the Eepic Games Launcher won't actually open on my virtual machine but I'd like you to get this
61

62
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,110
far and try and open it.
62

63
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:54,640
It should open on your machine and that is a good indication that you are ready to go.
63

64
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,760
Don't download Unreal Engine yet just get the installer going and then we just need to wait for X code
64

65
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,530
to finish downloading and installing and I'll resume the video.
65

66
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,690
When that's happened on my machine.
66

67
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:04,980
All right.
67

68
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:10,780
So after some patience we're at this point where we agree to the Xcode software license which may
68

69
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:17,890
require you to put in your macOS password and then the final installation of components will go on
69

70
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,650
and the last thing I want you to do is just make sure that Xcode is actually going to open.
70

71
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:28,340
So I'll come back once this component installation is finished and eventually you'll get to a screen
71

72
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,040
something like this just to check it works.
72

73
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,680
I'm going to create a new Xcode project but we're not going to concern ourselves with Xcode at all
73

74
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,310
in this course as long as you end up with something like this template view for your project you can
74

75
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:44,660
cancel out go to Xcode and quit Xcode and we aren't done.
75

76
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:50,300
We are on the same page as the P.C. guys now we have our prerequisites installed in their case it's
76

77
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,720
Visual Studio Community.
77

78
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:58,730
In our case it is Xcode and we have the Epic Games Launcher installed so that we can all together install
78

79
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:03,530
the Unreal Engine the appropriate version 4.22 and move on from there.
79

80
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,640
So I'll see you shortly.
