00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.590
Hello everybody and welcome back in this lecture we're gonna have a look at Delta time.

2
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.510
It's not something we've used yet.

3
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.220
You've probably noticed it is on the tick component there as well.

4
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:20.930
At the moment whether you realize it or not but everybody is going to have a different door speed depending

5
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.440
on the speed of their computer.

6
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.360
It's directly linked to the frames per second and that's not right.

7
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:33.230
The doors should open a consistent speed regardless of the computer that the games being played on Now

8
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.670
currently they will open up faster on a faster computer which is just obscene.

9
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.510
It makes it a bit more challenging for those that have got a faster computer because obviously they

10
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.390
could shut again a lot faster.

11
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.380
Now the delta time that we're going to play with is the time between frames being rendered.

12
00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:00.260
So for instance 60 frames per second or 160 for the second or nought point nought 1 6 6 6 recurring

13
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:07.550
seconds all and you've probably seen this before around 16 milliseconds 16 17 milliseconds.

14
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:14.360
So if we include delta time when we actually do our look that will mean that it will be frame rate independent

15
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.930
which is really useful and something we do need to consider when we're doing any source of movement.

16
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.490
We don't want it to be based upon how fast someone's computer is.

17
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.900
So first of all let's go over into on real and actually enable frames per second and actually see what

18
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.060
the difference is.

19
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:39.960
OK so if I only go to the top left of the viewport we can show our frames per second or control shift

20
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.240
an h we go ahead and do that we see we're currently hovering around 60 frames per second.

21
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:54.720
So when we press play One two three four around four seconds or so starting at 1:00 we have our door

22
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.410
fully open.

23
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.860
OK.

24
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.260
So what happens if we change the frame rate.

25
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.610
Well let's go to edit project settings opens up in a new tab.

26
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.280
I I'm happy for open opening there.

27
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.290
If it opens up in a separate window for you remember you can dock the taps under the engine.

28
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:18.250
If we keep going down to general settings and at the bottom of this there's an option or several options

29
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.760
under frame rates I'm going to put a ticking use fixed frame rate and take it down to 15 frames per

30
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.270
second.

31
00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:33.250
Now if the door opening speed is directly linked to our frame rates should now take around four times

32
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.330
longer or greater than 10 seconds to open our door.

33
00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.770
Now because the frame rate is being shown we can confirm it is now running at 15 frames per second.

34
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.670
And when we press play I'm expecting this thought's taken eons open you ready play.

35
00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:54.260
One two three four five six.

36
00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.240
You get that you get the point here.

37
00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.260
Now if we were trying to escape the room and the door was shutting on us it would be much easier on

38
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.320
a slower system than it would be on a much quicker system.

39
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.750
And this is something that is even played triple-A games.

40
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.440
There is a need for speed.

41
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.420
That did suffer from it very very badly.

42
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.330
It was locked at 30 frames per second.

43
00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.570
And if you increase this to 60 frames per second the game broke basically.

44
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.620
So it's easy to forget about and very easy to prevent.

45
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:32.780
So let's go over into V.S. code and type in one word that will solve our problems and I'm going to open

46
00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.700
up Visual Studio code in this case by clicking on my door going over to the component right clicking

47
00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.180
and open door or H.

48
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.850
And we do need the implementation and you will notice here on line 30 that we have something called

49
00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.000
Delta time so it's available for us to use.

50
00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:57.530
So if we come down and instead of here with our current yaw instead of just changing by this amount

51
00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:58.660
every frame.

52
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.550
If we multiply that by delta time that will solve our issue.

53
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.120
However Delta time at 60 frames per second is 16 milliseconds so this is going to end up being a very

54
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.480
small number at the moment.

55
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.990
I'm going to say times by one point f.

56
00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:23.260
Now bear in mind that this is actually just equal to delta time.

57
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.190
This is just I'm leaving this here to say look we can change how quickly opens it doesn't just have

58
00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.930
to be delta time.

59
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.750
Now I know through experimentation that this is going to be roughly right again.

60
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:42.170
But if we come back out into for recompile with the frame rate still at 15 frames per second I'd expect

61
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:47.080
it to only take three seconds or so to open the door again there we go.

62
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.690
Compiles complete it'll be jerky but one two three.

63
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.040
There we go we're open again even though we're only running at 15.

64
00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.670
And just to prove that it's now not going to open stupidly quick we can even set that back to 60 or

65
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.280
toggle used fixed frame off.

66
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:11.000
We can confirm it's bounced back up press play and it opens up at the same rate again.

67
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.110
Now if we want we can come back into here and change that value obviously at one it's the same as delta

68
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.730
time but if we wanted it to open slightly quicker we could put a larger number in there.

69
00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.850
We still wanted it open slower.

70
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.710
Then of course we can put a different number in here something like maybe nought point five.

71
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.550
Something along those lines.

72
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.620
Make sure you save your code come back in compile okay and press play.

73
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.250
And now opens a little bit slower than it did before.

74
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:46.470
So these are all play testing tweaks and tunes that you can do now that you're aware of delta time and

75
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:52.860
delta time doesn't just affect things like doors opening it can affect the physics of a game it can

76
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.580
affect how a player moves as well.

77
00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:03.970
So we do want to make sure that anything we put in to do with movement or physics or player input always

78
00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:08.610
is multiplied by delta time to prevent some crazy stuff from happening.

79
00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.830
That's it for this lecture and I'll see you all in the next one.
