00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:10,040
Hello, welcome, in this lecture, we are going to be making sounds, so we'll have a muzzle sound

2
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,590
and we'll have an impact sound.

3
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,650
Let's dive in and see how we're gonna do that in the process.

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:23,300
We gonna learn how we can attach sounds to other components so they move with them, such as the muzzle.

5
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,270
So now that we've got a nice and tidy pull trigger function, it's quite clear where we want to be making

6
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:30,990
sound effects.

7
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:38,730
Now, in my game, the only real sound effects I want are on the muzzle flash and on base of the impact.

8
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,500
So the places where we're already spawning emitters, I just want to add sound to that.

9
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,720
Now, that's relatively straightforward.

10
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,350
We've done some similar things in the past with the game play static's.

11
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,870
You can do a play sound at location, which is going to play that sound unattached to any object.

12
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:59,250
So it won't be moving around, it'll just stay fixed in that location until it's finished.

13
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:05,910
However, we also wants to be able to play an attached sound in the same way as we're playing an attached

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,100
emitter up at the top.

15
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,020
And that's that's fairly straightforward.

16
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,870
What we're going to look for, though, is, first of all, we're passing in this type and let's try

17
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,050
to understand a little bit better.

18
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:23,760
So we've got the play sound at location, which takes in the world context, but it also takes in this

19
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,380
you sound base.

20
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,160
Now, why is it a sound base and not just a sound wave?

21
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:35,760
Because if we go over into one real go into our asset packs, shooter game sounds, weapon, assault

22
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:41,730
rifle and mono, you're going to see that if we hover over any of these clips, then the type here is

23
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:42,670
sound wave.

24
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,910
And that actually corresponds to a type in unreeled called You Sound Wave.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,710
And if you go and have a look at that sound wave class, you can see that it inherits from you sound

26
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,190
base.

27
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,200
So what is sound bass?

28
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,520
What else inherits from it?

29
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:01,590
Well, something called an audio cue or sound cue, which you're gonna be using in the next lecture,

30
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,030
which allows us to do more complicated things with sound waves such as randomise them than modulate

31
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:06,660
their pitch.

32
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:13,080
So we're not interested in those just yet, but just know that these functions will work just as well,

33
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,180
whether we're passing in a single soundwave or a collection of sound waves gathered together in a sound

34
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:18,630
cue.

35
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:24,480
And that's by virtue of the fact that they take in a sound base which encompasses both of those types.

36
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:31,380
So what's useful is if we go and look through our game, play statics for the use of sound bass, what

37
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,660
else can we play a sound with?

38
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,750
Well, here there's a Sporn sound at location, a slightly different variation on the previous function

39
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,460
you can see here.

40
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,880
It returns the audio component that it spawned.

41
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,440
We're not interested in that one, though.

42
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,860
Well, we are interested in is our Sporn sound attached?

43
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:53,070
Now, this takes in our sound and then it also takes in a component that we want to attach it to, as

44
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,900
well as an optional attach point.

45
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,990
If we're dealing with a skeletal mesh.

46
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,310
So that's the one we're going to want to use.

47
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,080
So I'm going to go over into a gun, see?

48
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,730
And in order to call it, we're going to need a sound to call it with.

49
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:11,160
So we're going to add that to our configuration in the header file, where I'm going to add ourselves

50
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:17,400
a new property and I'm going to add it just under our muzzle flash called you sound bass is going to

51
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:24,660
be the type star and it's going to be the muzzle sound like so that we can then configure in the editor.

52
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,650
And I'm gonna go over to the gun c.p and we're going to spawn.

53
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:35,490
So as you gain play static's again and we're going to call spawn sound attached and we're going to pass

54
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:38,350
in this time set of the muzzle flash, the muzzle sound.

55
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:41,010
Then we've got to attach it to a mesh and to a socket.

56
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,930
Actually for that I'm just gonna copy both the mesh and the socket from above because we want to be

57
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,690
doing it to exactly the same location.

58
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,920
Essentially having the sound come out at the end of the barrel of our gun.

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:02,280
And if go ahead and compile, we should be able to go over to our rifle, BP and find a new property.

60
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,200
Sure enough, when the compile finished, the muzzle sound property popped up here and we can select

61
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,010
from the dropdown.

62
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,850
One of the Soundwave files, we don't currently have any sound cues or we do.

63
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,770
They come from the engine, but we don't want any of those.

64
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,470
We're just gonna go with the assault rifle shot.

65
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:23,580
And if we go and play, you can see that we are getting the correct sound effects when firing the rifle.

66
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,880
It's now time for your challenge to play the sound at location.

67
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:33,720
That is the function you've probably used before to play an impact sound of which we have a few in here.

68
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,720
When I did my drop down, you could see those the assault rifle shots.

69
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:43,830
But if we also look for assault rifle, we can see that they are these impact concrete sounds as well.

70
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:48,800
So you might want to choose one of those who are going to play an impact sound and use the L.A. sound

71
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,270
at location from gameplay static's hook it up and test it out to see that you're getting both of those

72
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,800
sounds in your world.

73
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,480
Pause a video and have a go.

74
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,590
Kay, welcome back.

75
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,830
So let's give this a shot.

76
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,980
First things first, that s the configuration.

77
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,450
So I'm gonna mostly copy the configuration from the muzzle sound.

78
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,750
Put it underneath the impact effect, and I'm going to call it the impact sound.

79
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,900
Then what we're gonna do is just set it off.

80
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,450
Compiling this.

81
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,980
We made a change to our head of file and I wants it to be quick.

82
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:23,570
Then we're gonna go down to where we're spawning our emitter at a location.

83
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:29,890
We're gonna do a new game, play Static's Kolon, Kolon, and we're going to be doing a instead of Sporn.

84
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,290
Sound attached is gonna be a play sound at location.

85
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,760
We're going to have to give it a world context.

86
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,720
I'm to do a get weld.

87
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:39,370
Then we're gonna give it the sound that we want it to play, which is gonna be the impact sound.

88
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,740
And then we need to give it a location to play the sound, which is gonna be the same as the location

89
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:48,700
for doing our particle effect and direction.

90
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:54,170
Doesn't matter in this case because our sound is going to be the same in all directions.

91
00:05:54,280 --> 00:06:00,010
But some echo on the end of that line and go and compile it and head over to the BP rifle where we now

92
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,830
have the new configuration variable for the impact sound.

93
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:06,140
As I said, there's gonna be something with impact concrete in it.

94
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,680
So I'm gonna go and select number one from that.

95
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,530
Go ahead and play and try this out.

96
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:16,870
And as you just heard there, we were getting an impact sound when we were hitting something.

97
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:22,390
And if we weren't hitting anything but just shooting, all you were hearing was the rifle muzzle sound.

98
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,560
So that's it for this lecture.

99
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,040
We've seen how we can spawn a sound attached to an object.

100
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:31,990
The next lecture, we're gonna be looking at how we can randomize those sounds so they aren't always

101
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,090
exactly the same every time they played.

102
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:34,810
See, they're.
