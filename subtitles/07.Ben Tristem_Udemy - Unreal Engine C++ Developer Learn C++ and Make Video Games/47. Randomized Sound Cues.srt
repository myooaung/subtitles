00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:05,990
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,510
We are going to be randomising our sounds in this lecture.

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:14,000
You can hear the soundscape is far less boring than it was in the last lecture.

4
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:18,980
We're going to be using each built into one real cold sound cues that allow us to do this.

5
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,530
Let's dive in and see what they are.

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,540
So our sounds are a bit monotonic.

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:28,640
As it stands and I have alluded to the fact that there's something called a sound cue which allows us

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,720
to fix this in Unreal.

9
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,400
It's a new type of asset.

10
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,380
So let's see how to create it.

11
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:39,210
First of all, I want to create a new folder for the sound cues for both of our shot and that impact.

12
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,020
So this fall is going to be called SFX for sound effects.

13
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:47,690
And we're going to go into there right click go to the sounds menu and then select the sound cue in

14
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:47,990
here.

15
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:52,190
Now, the naming convention here that we start with an a underscore, as we would with a sound wave.

16
00:00:52,310 --> 00:01:01,170
Then I'm going to give it a useful name, such as the rifle shot and then underscore capital C Q.

17
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:06,860
So it's saying that it's an audio asset and it's specifically a sound cue at the end.

18
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:12,200
Now we can go ahead and open this asset and you can see we get this fun little blueprint editor with

19
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,300
a node editor in the middle, just a bit like the material editor, the animation editor, in that it

20
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,660
has this output pin ready for us to plug stuff into.

21
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:26,990
And the way we could start plugging something in is if we write clicked and looked for wave.

22
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:31,470
You can see there is a wave player node, select the wave, play a note and get to the details painted

23
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:32,030
on the left.

24
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:40,340
I could select one of the sound wave files to play and then I can pull out of its output pen and plug

25
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,810
it into our output node.

26
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:46,230
And essentially I can use the play buttons at the top of the queue to preview what this cue is gonna

27
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,830
sound like, but unimpressive.

28
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,950
Li is just going to play that one clip.

29
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,490
Obviously this is not why we put a sound cue in place.

30
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,590
Well, we really want to be able to do is to do other cool stuff.

31
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,320
And he right click.

32
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,470
You can see there's a whole load of nodes that we could choose from.

33
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,350
There's attenuation branching concatenation so we can do all sorts of stuff, such as play different

34
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:12,260
sounds depending on the material of what's being impacted.

35
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,580
We can add some looping.

36
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,980
We can do Crossfade and so on and so forth.

37
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,830
But what I'm really interested in here, some randomisation.

38
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:23,150
So there is a random node here where you can add as many pins as you like.

39
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:28,730
And what it's going to do is it's going to switch between its inputs and give one of them out randomly

40
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:33,400
as its output has a few properties that you might be interested here in the details, Pane.

41
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,000
The most interesting one for me was the randomise without replacement.

42
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:45,170
And this is basically saying that the type of random it is going to use won't cause you to replay anything

43
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,840
until you've played all of the clips on the left hand side.

44
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,820
It's basically a random shuffle.

45
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:56,660
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna output an assault rifle, shot one in to the random node and then

46
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,540
output that in to the global output here.

47
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:05,060
And I'm also going to copy and paste that assault rifle, shot one and do a shot, too, and put that

48
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,380
into the random note as well.

49
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,890
And I'm just going to delete the extra inputs that we had here.

50
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:16,670
And now you can hit the play cue and you can see how it's basically just switching between these random

51
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,460
outputs because of this randomize without replacement.

52
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,080
We uncheck that.

53
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:28,700
Then you're going to see that occasionally it will play the same clip two times in a row.

54
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:35,270
And that's why often times is useful to have that randomise without replacement so that we don't hear

55
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,400
the repetition in our game.

56
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:37,830
Okay.

57
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,600
So that's cool.

58
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:43,730
What other interesting nodes do we have here to help us have a more random sounding effect?

59
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,490
Well, one of them is the modulator node.

60
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,810
And if you select that, the details should give you a bit of a hint as to what's going on here.

61
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,650
It's got a min and max pitch and a M. Max volume.

62
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,810
And as you might guess, the whole purpose of this much lighter note, if we just plug it in to one

63
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:05,600
of our clips and to the output, is that it's going to randomize the volume and the pitch.

64
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,440
Let's try it out.

65
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,160
Now, the effect is not very noticeable there because we don't have very big ranges.

66
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:15,500
So I'm going to go between half volume and two times volume and see if we can hear that.

67
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,810
Now, hopefully you're able to hear the variations there.

68
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,730
Let's also try some bigger variations in pitch, two times pitch and half pitch.

69
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,280
And let's just reset the volume.

70
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:29,720
So hopefully you're able to hear the difference there in the Min and Max pitch as well.

71
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:35,000
So then what we can do is we can put these two nodes one into another and we're then going to get random

72
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,780
clips and additional modulation on top of that.

73
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:43,730
Now, we have a lot more clips here than just these assault rifles shot one and two.

74
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,050
So I want to get bring all of these in.

75
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,620
But it can be a bit tedious to duplicate and select the clips.

76
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,240
So here's a little shortcut for you.

77
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,820
We go over to our content folder.

78
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:58,220
Go down into the asset packs, shoot game sounds and then the weapon assault rifle, Monzo.

79
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,480
You can see we've got the clips that we want here.

80
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,960
So I'm going to select from shot one to shot six.

81
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:07,280
Then I'm gonna go over to my Q editor and I'm gonna right.

82
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,410
Click in there and you can see there's this from Selected Option which allows us to bring in multiple

83
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:16,400
clips in it to various nodes that take multiple clips.

84
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,430
And the one we're interested in is the random node.

85
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,990
And if you select that, then you get.

86
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:28,820
Six different wave players all inputting in to a random note so we can now delete the other random note

87
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:33,630
we had manually created and we can use this new random note instead.

88
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,680
And that's sounding much better now.

89
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,110
I just want to tweak the settings here for our pitch.

90
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:42,080
I don't think we want such a big variation in pitch.

91
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,200
It's going to reset those down to the defaults.

92
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:53,120
I do want a slight more variation in volume, though, so I'm going to go four point seven to one point

93
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,680
three and then let's go ahead and play that.

94
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:00,800
I think that's a good variation and definitely doesn't sound boring anymore.

95
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:06,110
I'd like you now as a challenge to apply the same process to the impact sound effect.

96
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:11,810
So create a sound cue, add randomization, add a modulator, and then play around with the volumes

97
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,000
and the values, rather, to see what works best for the impact sound.

98
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,110
Pause video and have a go.

99
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:18,560
Okay.

100
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:19,220
Welcome back.

101
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,210
Let's give this a shot.

102
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:27,080
So we're going to go over to our content SFX right click and we're going to try and create a new sound

103
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,530
asset.

104
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,430
And it's a sound cue.

105
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,660
So a underscore.

106
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,200
We're gonna call it reifel impact and then underscore cue.

107
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:36,500
Let's go ahead and open that one up.

108
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,940
And we essentially want to do the same thing here.

109
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:43,730
So first of all, I'm going to add in a modulator, an output that's the output note.

110
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:49,100
Then we're going to go over to our sandbox again, up to the root content asset packs, shooter game

111
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:55,040
sounds, weapon mono and then on gainst select from all of the impact sound effects, there should be

112
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,710
six of them and then gonna go over to the impact cue.

113
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:04,640
Right, click and add in the random node and output that random node into the modulator.

114
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:11,240
And then from my playing around I found that the modulator works better here to have a bigger pitch

115
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:17,450
difference because something plinking off concrete's or whatever substance that is could make various

116
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:20,300
sounds depending on what angle it's hitting it at.

117
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:25,640
So I'm gonna go between point five and two with less of a volume variation here.

118
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,640
Let's go ahead and try playing this cue.

119
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,070
Okay.

120
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,580
So I think that sounds good with a good amount of variation.

121
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,990
Now, all that's left to be seen is if we can put this into our rifle.

122
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,580
And you may have already tried doing this.

123
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:44,360
We can just go over to where we have our sound effects in the BP rifle and change out the wave that

124
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,760
we were using for a sound cue so we can swap it out for the rifle impact or shot.

125
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:56,660
Q On this a muzzle sound, then the impact sound we're going to switch out for let's go and find it

126
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,790
should just be something called impact.

127
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,720
They get rifle impact.

128
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:06,110
Q We can go ahead and play that now and we can hear a good amount of variation in the sound that was

129
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:06,940
going on there.

130
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,630
That the different muzzle flashes sounded different and the impact sounds sounded different.

131
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:16,220
Now if you're playing this with headphones, you will notice that it all sounds a little bit flat,

132
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,870
like there isn't a sense of space.

133
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,750
That's what we're going to be dealing with in the next lecture.

134
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:25,820
So in this lecture, what we have done is we've over viewed what a sound cue is and how it can allow

135
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:32,780
us to do lots of cool stuff with sound, including adding randomization and making sounds less boring.

136
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,160
I'll see you in the next lecture.
