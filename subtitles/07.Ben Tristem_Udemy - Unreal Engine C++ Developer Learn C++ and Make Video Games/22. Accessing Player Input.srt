Hello everybody and welcome.

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:11,950
In this lecture I'm going to make sure that we can use the player input itself before we start assessing

3
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:15,670
it we need to make sure that we are happy with retrieving it.

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,480
So go ahead and play our game and see what we're going to have by the end of this lecture is really

5
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,430
straightforward.

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,180
I really want to make sure that we're not losing any of you at these beginning stages so go ahead.

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,870
Press tab presents to continue.

8
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:31,870
Okay so if I start typing something like our head and work it will assess it at the moment but it's

9
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:37,780
gonna repeat it back to us it's going to say cake which proves to us that we're taking the user's input

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,520
and we're doing something with it.

11
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,520
We're just repeating it back at the moment.

12
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:45,580
And if I was just typing something else it would repeat it back.

13
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,180
Of course it's not a nicer gram.

14
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,970
So we could try something else.

15
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:49,450
There we go.

16
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,270
So they're all repeating back to us.

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,790
And that's key there because that shows us that we're using the player's input for something else.

18
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:58,150
Okay.

19
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,730
Welcome back over to visual studio code.

20
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:06,330
The first thing we need to know is what are we going to use what we already know that we're going to

21
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:12,640
print a line out to our console so we can put that in straight away but at the moment we're not actually

22
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,710
printing anything and our inputs got to be stored somewhere.

23
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:23,330
Now some of you will automatically have already reached for this word input.

24
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:30,730
Now let's break down what's going on here we have a function that's called on inputs essentially and

25
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,910
it's referencing the user input which is of type f string which is good.

26
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:42,430
That means that in here we don't have to type anything else other than that variable name.

27
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:47,320
So if we type in inputs within here everything should clear down which is great.

28
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,950
We can save our file.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,110
We can go over into and rail and stop the play that was going on.

30
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,760
I can reap compile my code.

31
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,740
It should take a few seconds to do.

32
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:05,050
And once we've done that we should find we're able to access and repeat back whatever the user has typed

33
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:07,760
in essentially parroting.

34
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:14,870
So now of I typing cake badly it all repeats it's if I type it incorrectly it will also repeat it back.

35
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:19,730
So that's brilliant we're able to now grab the user's inputs if we have a look.

36
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,860
It's this variable here inputs.

37
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:27,520
It also means when we go ahead and create our variables we cannot call anything inputs.

38
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,220
In this case because it's already been declared and we're going to leave that as it is as that's parts

39
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:37,120
of the base code we're working with do run through this very simple projects here and make sure when

40
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:43,900
you compile in unreal it behaves exactly how we're expecting which will mean that we're now able to

41
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:50,920
assess the user's inputs which means we can start making our basic game loop and we'll continue this

42
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,300
in the next lecture.
