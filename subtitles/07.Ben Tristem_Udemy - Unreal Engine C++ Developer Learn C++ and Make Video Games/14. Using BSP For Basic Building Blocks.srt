00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:10,170
Hello everybody and welcome to this lecture on binary space partitioning sounds pretty fancy but it

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,700
is pretty awesome because we're going to be able to mock up a level incredibly quickly.

3
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:20,250
Now this is great if you've got an idea and you want to see whether it works or in fact you want to

4
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,820
pass the level design onto an artist to make some awesome assets for it.

5
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,910
We're going to look at the various different brush types we can get and we can look at additive and

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:37,360
subtracting modelling the order matters mainly because of what I just talked about additive and subjective.

7
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,560
If you put something in later on we'll see that it won't work as expected at rebuilding needs something

8
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,600
that we've talked about with the lighting.

9
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,540
But rebuilding works would BSP as well and can fix some of the issues that we can have and it is highly

10
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:55,350
recommended that you work aligned to the grid.

11
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:01,920
It will be far more performance and also it will mean if you to swap things out with models that have

12
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,870
been made you know that they're going to fit without having to rejig the entire level.

13
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:07,130
Okay.

14
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,540
So let's hope over to unreal.

15
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,600
Okay so now that we're over an umbrella let's go ahead and start adding some of these BSP what are they.

16
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,810
How do we get to them.

17
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:22,880
So over on the left hand side if you go ahead and click geometry when that appears we will see that

18
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,880
we've got a series of brushes that we can use.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,920
Let's zoom out a little in our 3D view here and I'm going to come up because some of these pieces are

20
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,760
quite big.

21
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:38,870
So you can drag in a box you can drag in a cone and you can drag in some curves there as you can see

22
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:44,660
how very quickly you could build up a level especially with these stairs and there's some straight stairs

23
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:51,060
here and some spiral stairs as well so before long you've got a level coming together really well.

24
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:58,700
Now with each of these BSP is they're configurable so we can change them in real time so I can select

25
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:06,170
this cone go over to the details scroll down and say well actually I want it to.

26
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:11,630
Here we go the brush settings got scroll down a little further on the on this one and we can go ahead

27
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:17,640
and increase the number of sites it will updates and we've got more detail geometry there.

28
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:22,440
Now if I'm going to say this now and I'm probably going to say it several times this is no substitute

29
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,710
to actually modelling geometry properly texturing et cetera.

30
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:28,030
Okay.

31
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:35,450
So we can add things to our scene day in day out and we have a little taste of there of the setting.

32
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:40,740
So if we go ahead and click back on the cone have a look there's quite a few set brush settings there.

33
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:44,550
The cube is going to have a few less because it's a simpler object.

34
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:49,460
Now you can change the dimensions of everything there and just like any of the mesh objects you can

35
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:56,690
click and drag a material directly onto the surface of these objects which is incredibly useful but

36
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:00,170
building up your level like this is not very good for performance.

37
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:05,450
We do have to watch out great for testing and making sure that the level flows well or it's the right

38
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:06,830
size and feels right.

39
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,340
But don't rely on BSD to create a final product.

40
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,120
It won't be very performance.

41
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:16,720
And as you'll see in a bit we can get quite complex with these BSD.

42
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:21,830
Now we can bake them down to a static mesh so at any point let's say this cube we were happy with it.

43
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:27,740
We go to the brush settings towards the bottom here we've got create a static mesh and if you did this

44
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:35,150
to all of your BSD in your scene then the aforementioned performance issues that you have by using BSD

45
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,220
essentially do go.

46
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:43,210
However of course the quality of your models will suffer by just being basic BSP shapes.

47
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:49,160
Now if we were going to do this I'll pop it in my model's folder and I would name it S.M. which stands

48
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:54,230
for static mesh as you might have guessed underscore that's me my maths out the way.

49
00:03:54,230 --> 00:04:00,410
And in this case cube example or something along those lines because it's just a cube example we create

50
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,760
the static mesh.

51
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,330
Now that reminds me a bit of a Segway here.

52
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,470
I'm going to open up my content browser for a moment.

53
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:16,070
Now you may notice that when I went along and brought in my two by one door and frame they were actually

54
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,240
within one blend file.

55
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:23,420
So I exported them and both in the same esp FBI exe file.

56
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:31,070
Now in hindsight what I will now do in the future whenever I'm exporting models is that I will go ahead

57
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:38,690
and the two by one door and frame I will export them as separate objects want rather than relying on

58
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:41,670
the name of the file because that's why it's got this here.

59
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:49,220
So let's let's sort this out now and just be aware that if you ever do anything like this renaming them

60
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,950
in the content browser is fine it's going to rename them on the disk as well but it's not going to rename

61
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,520
my original models.

62
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:59,950
So I've got to remember to rename them elsewhere.

63
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:05,420
Not a problem in the case of this one objects but if this was a series of objects you'd quite easily

64
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:12,410
end up with something or many things out of sync with everything else not doorway doorframe.

65
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:13,830
Okay.

66
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,460
So I've got my all my objects.

67
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:20,510
They're named next come back from that little bit of a distraction there what else can we do.

68
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:24,920
Well let's get rid of these extra objects over added into my scenes.

69
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,280
I'm going to just highlight them and press delete the stairs over there.

70
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:29,790
Okay.

71
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:36,650
I'm going to create my a new instance of this stone material so I'm going to right click Create material

72
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:40,400
instance and I'm going to just call this wall for the moment.

73
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,450
It'll enable me to change the settings on it later on.

74
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:49,700
Now I can obviously click and drag and drop things on and you can see this is going to be a very tedious

75
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,090
process to do this cone.

76
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,530
Well I'm going to get rid of that cone because with that material selected when you go ahead and drag

77
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:04,640
and drop it in will you look at that it has the material applied to it's straight away which is incredibly

78
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,580
useful.

79
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:12,260
Now here is a great example of where the materials and its alignment on our on our objects here is just

80
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,930
not working out well it looks a mess.

81
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:20,990
And this is a prime example of really why you don't want to do anything like this just using you're

82
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:25,910
really going to need to use a 3D modeling program like blender in order to apply textures to a model

83
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,020
in a more meaningful manner.

84
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:33,950
Now saying that you can tweak all these textures and align them but that's a lot of hard work considering

85
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,600
what you're getting as the end result.

86
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,520
Okay so you can drag things in like that.

87
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,830
What else can we do with BSP experience just scratching the surface here.

88
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:48,260
Let's say we go ahead and grab a box and at the bottom of this list we've got subtract and we can change

89
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:54,410
the setting of anything that we drag into our scene that's just track this then pull it down so intersects

90
00:06:54,830 --> 00:07:02,360
with our current and we can see here is a nice little hole in it so you can see you can actually make

91
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,150
some quite detailed geometry.

92
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,180
We start building these things up.

93
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,940
Let's have a look at the settings just there.

94
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:13,640
So we've got a subtracted brush that's all box shape.

95
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,080
Oh that's interesting.

96
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:21,440
So we can change it and have something else and you can see there's some other options in there as well.

97
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,690
We can change its actual size as well here which is incredibly useful.

98
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,640
We can play with Wolf thickness.

99
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:34,120
Okay well wall thickness won't really come into effect until you've ticked hollow when you tick on holiday.

100
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:41,420
Now we've got a wall thickness and if we set something like 40 so we can really see it we can see here

101
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:46,880
that it's got an inner and an outer wall which is pretty awesome I'm not sure I like the shape that's

102
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,410
going on there but if this was a bigger box technically we could make a room out of it and then just

103
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:57,410
cut a hole in the size using a subtracted method and we end up with a room if I'll show you that now

104
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,340
because that is not the way that we're going to go.

105
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:03,720
And in order to see my view just a little bit better.

106
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:10,070
Obviously I'm going to hide things and move them out of the way but in the top here we've got an option

107
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,590
top right of your editor window maximize our resources viewport if we click that little button there

108
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:22,850
we get this quad view which is incredibly useful for trying to work things out and move around so I

109
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,370
can move this around place it now.

110
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:29,500
Now go off front a side and the back can we can say oh no it's not front sorry no.

111
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:33,780
It says at the top left here we've got a back a right and a top view.

112
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:37,300
And obviously we can change that to a front view if we wanted to.

113
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:43,850
And we can move things around in the viewport just like we can the 3D view with the right mouse button.

114
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:52,860
So this is incredibly useful if we make let's say this box brush a thousand by a thousand.

115
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,880
There we go.

116
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,130
A wall thickness of 40.

117
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:55,670
That's fine.

118
00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:00,680
And then we should be able to cover up our existing floor which we can do.

119
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,570
Perfect.

120
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:05,030
And let's set it to a additive brush.

121
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:06,680
Excellent.

122
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,830
So we now have a room there.

123
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:12,440
If we make it just a little bit taller let's make it maybe four metres tall.

124
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:19,360
So 400 we can then come along lift it up because it's going to be a nice high room.

125
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:19,510
Yep.

126
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,160
That looks good.

127
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,270
And then we can just grab another box.

128
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:27,530
I'm going to be rubbish at position it here but I can go in from the side pull that through and look

129
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,480
because it's subtracted brush.

130
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,800
Now if we go ahead and press play well let's stop that for a moment.

131
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:38,000
Let's make this full screen press build.

132
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,740
Now press play.

133
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,840
Look at that.

134
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,760
Now the floor is looking like a disco floor.

135
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,420
This is Z fighting.

136
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:51,110
And I've set it up deliberately so you can see it's at its worst you've probably seen this effect before

137
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:57,800
and it's because the surface that was already there our original floor that square floor that we had

138
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:03,020
and the new one that we've created are in exactly the same place.

139
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:06,950
So we can sort that out in the moment but here we go we've created a room.

140
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:12,640
Now I wouldn't create a room like this because it doesn't give us very much flexibility.

141
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:13,550
Yes we can.

142
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,390
That's just come out of it for the moment.

143
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:22,940
We can drag a different texture to the walls et cetera but if I go to build and then that will build

144
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:28,580
the lights in but if we look at the drop down first we can see we've got an option here to build geometry

145
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,660
all of this PSP that we've put in so far is geometry.

146
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:38,480
So when we go ahead and click the build button it doesn't just build the lighting like we've been playing

147
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,700
with so far it builds any geometry any B.S. piece as well.

148
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:49,070
So it's a slight optimization but what I'm expecting here is for our room obviously to get quite dark

149
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:57,320
because it's not got much light in the way of it's coming in but I expect it to not do the lighting

150
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,210
very accurately anyway.

151
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:03,490
I've always had problems with sealed geometry like this.

152
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,770
It's just not going to like it.

153
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:09,700
So it kind of works but then it doesn't and it's just not worth the hassle.

154
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:15,720
Now this particular Z fighting issue very easy to solve if you've got that site we've got the box brush

155
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:21,380
it's the entire room we could lift that up ever so slightly so we can just go to the z value of its

156
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,940
location and it's currently at 200.

157
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:30,620
If we just lifted it up to 220 or something like that it would be completely in the clear and not touching

158
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,190
this other bit here or we could lower that bit down.

159
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,220
It's entirely up to you when it comes about by would not construct the room like this.

160
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:41,990
I'd make it out the individual walls or even out of individual pieces itself.

161
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:42,900
Okay.

162
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,070
So we've added BSP sourcing in the brush types there we've subtracted.

163
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:53,150
We get things like this doorway really in the order does matter.

164
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:59,450
So if you put something down that's additive first and then put something that's subtracting it would

165
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:03,370
take away from it if you do it in the other order it won't do that.

166
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:09,740
So if we go ahead and let's say add in this attractive cube it's going to cut out of anything before

167
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:09,910
it.

168
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:17,120
So let's it's snapping here so let's cut another hole over here in the corner but then if we go ahead

169
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:24,020
and put a sphere next to it or did that appear and I've seen yet and make it over here in the brush

170
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:31,430
type settings an additive one and then drag it into that place we can see that it's not being removed.

171
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:36,980
Now if we were to go ahead and go to our order down in the details as an order here and say it was the

172
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:42,440
first thing that we created and we can see that's a bit of a mess how it's chopped everything up.

173
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:48,130
Not that great but of course you're probably not going to be putting together geometry like that very

174
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:48,890
often.

175
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:53,440
OK let's get rid of that let's get rid of our room let's get rid of our cone that we've got there.

176
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:59,450
I'm just gonna click Build so the final thing that I wants to go through with you.

177
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,320
Well there's two things really.

178
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:06,210
Okay so the first one is the fact that you can edit these brushes in a bit more detail so let's drag

179
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,520
a box in again.

180
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:12,270
It's gonna snap to the world of currently got my world snap settings set to 100.

181
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,190
Feel free to play with those.

182
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:18,290
I would suggest keeping them around that sort of level.

183
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,150
A hundred ten easy to move around.

184
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:26,160
In fact 50 is probably going to be a bit easier for doing these half grid squares at a time.

185
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,050
Let's change that to additive.

186
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:28,960
Okay.

187
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:33,290
I'm not liking that material applied there because I want to set up a wall.

188
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:38,350
And then in a few moments I'll get you to actually come along and design the rest of your room.

189
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,040
So I'm gonna select that box brush and delete it.

190
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,950
Look at this I've got two box brushes in my scene.

191
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:46,650
I can't see because the ones that take away.

192
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,780
So one of the things I would do here is just delete that and let's go ahead.

193
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,470
Right click Create a folder and call it building.

194
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:58,910
Because we're going to construct a building in a moment and we can put our pieces in there.

195
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,880
We can start by grabbing that the door and the door frame.

196
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:10,170
Notice their name hasn't changed from what we've changed our actual meshes to again.

197
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:15,900
Might be worth updating that might not entirely up to going to lift that up to the building so then

198
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,150
it's nested in there.

199
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:23,490
Just the bits of organization as we start building and we select my wall that I've created drag my box

200
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,070
in here.

201
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:32,610
Oh and change it to additive so we can set the scale of the face is just down here x y and z so we can

202
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:39,030
make it the entire length of this box by setting that to a thousand and then just dragging it roughly

203
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,050
to the right place.

204
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:40,890
There we go.

205
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:45,210
So definitely takes up all of that length and we can see that the Z fighting again.

206
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:47,960
So you just have to be aware of that and move ever so slightly.

207
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,610
That usually solves the issue.

208
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:50,840
Okay.

209
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,080
So we've got that there.

210
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,770
How about if we want to edit it and make it a slightly different shape.

211
00:14:54,780 --> 00:15:00,480
What we can do that if we have a look at the very top instead of going to place things let's go all

212
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,050
the way over to geometry editing.

213
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,660
You may not be able to select a face.

214
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,460
I have been able to there.

215
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:15,040
If you cannot select an entire face we should be really easy to do by just clicking on it like so then

216
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:21,900
you've probably got transparency mode turned on so click away so you don't have any objects selected

217
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,370
and pressed T.

218
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:27,910
Now when I come back I will find that I cannot select any faces.

219
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:34,470
It's very easy to do that and I've been caught out with that so many times I press t at some point and

220
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:40,500
then I can't select an individual face which I now can when you can select a face you can actually change

221
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,990
the size of it very very quickly.

222
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,400
So this is brilliant.

223
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:50,220
If you don't know the exact size that you're looking for and I've squished these down to a single plane

224
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,960
I'm not sure if I can recover from this hotel.

225
00:15:54,150 --> 00:16:01,350
Never mind let's drag a new one of these things in so it's very easy to drag them on top of one another.

226
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,790
I'd advise you don't do that.

227
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,180
There we go.

228
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,360
So we tracked anyone in go here.

229
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:11,490
We're on edit which is absolutely fine should be able to click a face here and move it to an appropriate

230
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:12,660
location.

231
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:18,660
Now this is the great thing about if you didn't know this was a thousand wide very easy to get it so

232
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,330
it matches like so.

233
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:25,800
And again you may need to try and edit the snapping settings at the top to make sure it fits perfectly

234
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:31,410
but it's not just the face we can go ahead here and grab an edge now an edge is one of the harder ones

235
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:31,830
to grab.

236
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:32,460
There we go.

237
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,010
And then I can push that back and we've got a wedge shape.

238
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:40,490
Pretty awesome but it's going to start distorting the textures if we're not careful.

239
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:46,680
But we can also grab individual vertices and move those around to really mess up the geometry.

240
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:52,170
Now we see at this point it doesn't know what to do with our textures we've completely destroyed any

241
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:57,060
hope of being able to map them and you can see here as well what we've done.

242
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:02,230
Even the basic default grid texture that appears and things absolutely ruined.

243
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,600
Here we go and put these war pieces on.

244
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,380
None of them are going to line up.

245
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:13,080
Now that may be fine for what you need but again this is the sort of thing that an external program

246
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,830
like Blender is going to be much better at sorting out.

247
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,880
We can select the face we can come in.

248
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:23,120
Oh here we go rotate rotate the texture.

249
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:26,480
Can we put an arbitrary amount in it.

250
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,240
Can we get it.

251
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,440
So it looks roughly right.

252
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,170
So that looks roughly Ryan's rotate that around.

253
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:35,640
No we're going to have to perhaps go 30 degrees all so close.

254
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:42,600
Let's try 15 now is going the other way so maybe you can see how this is just going to add up to a monumental

255
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:48,600
pain in the backside trying to get it right but it can be done to a certain extent but you'll be far

256
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:56,250
better going through an external program that does handle this natively rather than having texture because

257
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,190
this is a very simple object.

258
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:03,090
Imagine something that was a bit more complex it would be a real real nightmare.

259
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:09,200
Okay so the final thing here is just to remind you that this is not a replacement for proper geometry

260
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:17,670
by all means you can click on your object and in the details tab we go down to the brush settings we

261
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:22,680
can create that static mesh from it which is a step in the right direction but it's not ideal and you'll

262
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:29,210
probably be better off modelling it elsewhere might be okay for those distant objects that the player

263
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:33,960
never gets that close to and you just need something in your scene real quick is a great get out of

264
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:41,040
jail free card but it's not necessarily great for performance and leaving things as BSP does is a great

265
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:46,860
idea because you're able to manipulate and change things rapidly but then keeping them in the final

266
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,700
game that's something you want to try and avoid.

267
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:55,230
Now it's unlikely in our small level here that we're going to hit any performance issues so it's absolutely

268
00:18:55,230 --> 00:19:00,480
fine to leave them as a BSP and not convert them to a static mesh but ideally you probably do want to

269
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,130
convert them to a static measure and you're happy with them and then replace them with better static

270
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,470
measures later on.

271
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:12,830
And the final thing that I want to look at before I present you with your challenge is and I'm going

272
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:19,320
to get rid of that for the moment when you're adding in your brushes like the box let's say and you've

273
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,360
decided by thinking about how you're putting your level together.

274
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:26,390
You have decided to set it at a certain size.

275
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,400
So we go ahead.

276
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:34,560
We come in here we say well the the war piece itself is going to be in the x direction so that's just

277
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,710
its width here.

278
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:38,500
We're going to have it set to 100.

279
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:45,740
No no no English size walls let's set it is 20 says 20 thinks 20 centimetres thick.

280
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:51,000
Let's say we're going to have it four metres high and there we go.

281
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,980
We've got a for me to high wall that's two meters long.

282
00:19:55,020 --> 00:20:02,490
So if the pieces that you're producing outside for your game are roughly this size then you can set

283
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:08,690
it up in here and then later on you can swap it out with the real mesh that's going to go there.

284
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:10,720
So that's one way that you could do it.

285
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:17,110
Of course you could create your room by just putting the the side across completely.

286
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,110
And remember you've got this little button on the top right for alignment.

287
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:25,140
I do most of my stuff in here I'm quite comfortable in the 3D view ports.

288
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:30,740
So here for instance you can very quickly drag out a couple of wall sections by holding down out.

289
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,810
Remember you need to press down old as well.

290
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,720
Each time you want to make a copy.

291
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,860
You may end up with some seams.

292
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:43,020
I believe these are all seamless textures but you do run the risk of having some scenes where these

293
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:44,960
objects join but you can see there.

294
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:45,540
That's brilliant.

295
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:49,760
We've managed to get a war section built incredibly quickly and it's modular.

296
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:54,900
I can take that one out really quickly without having to worry about cutting a hole.

297
00:20:54,900 --> 00:21:02,820
However what I may want to do instead is grab this to make a duplicates which we have been doing and

298
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,720
then cut a hole suitable for the door in it.

299
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,100
I'll let you explore how you want to set up be seen.

300
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:12,960
This one's a bit more involved and I'll say this time and time again there's never a right or wrong.

301
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:19,330
This could quite easily be a piece that is instead of 200 y just a thousand.

302
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:22,200
And there we go we can slap it right there.

303
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,720
It takes up and looks exactly the same.

304
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,460
And for all intents and purposes is absolutely fine as a war piece there.

305
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:34,590
And I will let you decide whether or not you're going to bake these things down to a static mesh at

306
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,520
the moment.

307
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:41,540
Remember if you do that you lose all edited ability the moment you bake it like that so that buttons

308
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:47,460
just at the bottom of our brush settings in the details create a static mesh and remember to name things

309
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,140
appropriately as well.

310
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:55,490
So no point in creating a static mesh and not putting that save the box brush where's the other one.

311
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,360
That's it.

312
00:21:56,390 --> 00:22:00,410
Where is that all gone invisible.

313
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:01,130
Let's get rid of that.

314
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:03,040
Okay so we've got this one here.

315
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,170
It's part of the building.

316
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,600
Let's pop it in the building.

317
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,850
Do we leave it as Bob box brush six.

318
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:09,850
That's not very descriptive is it.

319
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,990
Probably rename that war room.

320
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:18,140
And of course you may want to be more descriptive with that and say four five six metre wall or whatever

321
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,840
its dimensions are.

322
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:20,900
That will really help.

323
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:21,980
Okay.

324
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:22,390
Wow.

325
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:26,500
That was a deep dive into the BSP system.

326
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,760
Lots to take in there.

327
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:32,590
And it's an incredible system in order to make your level quickly.

328
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:37,940
You can mock up a level incredibly quickly and you can add quite a bit of detail as well.

329
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:44,180
If you need to if you need to give your artist a better direction than then do is much better that way.

330
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,050
OK.

331
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:45,680
OK.

332
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:50,840
So we've been going quite a while learning all about BSD and in the following lecture you'll have a

333
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,120
challenge straight away to implement them.

334
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,080
See you shortly.
