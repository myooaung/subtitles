1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,370
Okay, everybody, welcome over into Unreal.

2
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:08,980
Now, a couple of things that I want to do before we get started.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,310
Just having a look at my hierarchy, the world outliner over here.

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,780
I'd like to just name these things here a bit more appropriately.

5
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,240
So we got down like two and down like three.

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,010
Well, actually, this would also be down like two in this particular case.

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,800
It's good that we can name the same thing.

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,910
Therefore, we know they're part of the same object.

9
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:33,730
Now, I'm also going to rename my folder here and set it down lights down lights because it contains

10
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:34,270
both of them.

11
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,650
I'm just going to minimize the building.

12
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:36,160
There we go.

13
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:37,030
Awesome.

14
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:41,740
I don't think I'm gonna add any more to the building for the moment, but what we do need to add is

15
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,420
potentially another component.

16
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:49,750
Now, when you're adding test code to your scene and you're working on, let's say, a component that

17
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:54,580
you've already got in the world, like the world position, there's no harm in just adding a bit of

18
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,160
code to that and just seeing whether or not it works.

19
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:03,130
However, in this particular case, we've got something that does something distinctly different and

20
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:04,930
we know we're definitely going to need it.

21
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,580
So let's select hold door, go and add a component.

22
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:13,570
It's gonna be a new C++ component and it's gonna be an active component on the actor.

23
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:19,540
We're gonna call this open door and let's go ahead and click create class.

24
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,690
Now, there is something we need to consider when we are going to move something in our scene.

25
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,200
All of these static measures have an option on them.

26
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,420
And this is incredibly important.

27
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:35,860
If we don't go ahead and set it, you're gonna run into problems.

28
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:39,400
Your code will work perfectly, but you won't be able to see anything.

29
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,500
So let's make sure we've got our doors selected.

30
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:46,870
So we're looking at the static mesh components of our door that have also just clicked on that.

31
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,220
And let's bring this area up here so we can see just a little bit more.

32
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,240
And we've got three options under the transform section.

33
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,500
We've under mobility.

34
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,040
We've got static, stationary and movable.

35
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,180
Now, if we leave our door a static, it doesn't matter what we do.

36
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,790
No amount of code will move it.

37
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,480
And what we need it to be is a movable object.

38
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,570
Okay, so let's go ahead and set this back from movable to static for a moment and get the lights coming

39
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:16,840
through.

40
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,470
So I'm going to rotate my door, make sure it's selected and just rotate it.

41
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:25,810
This is what we're gonna be doing, encode in the moment and it will just snap to a particular value.

42
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,770
And let's go to our world direction or lights.

43
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,120
Here we go.

44
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,090
The light source.

45
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:36,190
And I believe I need to tweak the Y value and the Z value.

46
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:36,940
There we go.

47
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,530
So that's a there.

48
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,510
See if I can get our longer shadow.

49
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,080
There we go.

50
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,300
So it's really coming into the doorway.

51
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,120
Now I'm going to shut my door again.

52
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,440
Here we go.

53
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,190
And it looks pretty good there, doesn't it?

54
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,960
But at some point, we're going to need to bake our lighting again.

55
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,930
So let's go and just bake the lighting only.

56
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:58,980
So it's nice and quick.

57
00:02:59,630 --> 00:02:59,890
Okay.

58
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:02,020
Now let's see what happens.

59
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,710
Oh, well, that's a that's a bit rubbish there, isn't it?

60
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,520
We have a look.

61
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:14,110
So it's it took a while, that update, but here we've got the light on the floor.

62
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,190
Looks good so far.

63
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,170
But when we open it, we kind of have a dynamic light there as well.

64
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,870
And we've got this shadow that shouldn't exist.

65
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,210
So this is something we don't want.

66
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:29,320
And this is an example of why we need to set this static mesh here too movable.

67
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,710
However, when we set, it's a movable.

68
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,020
It will update the rendering engine as well.

69
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:37,620
In that case, we're gonna have to build our lighting again as well.

70
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,370
And there we go.

71
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:45,610
Got a much better shape coming through Real-Time lighting like this is far more expensive.

72
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,610
And we can see here we've got a couple of issues with the lighting.

73
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,230
Again, that's something that you can sort out later on in when you start tweaking things.

74
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,470
But for a moment, that is good enough for our test purposes.

75
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,900
So let's make sure the door is actually shut.

76
00:03:59,110 --> 00:03:59,630
Zero.

77
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:06,990
And I want to draw your attention to the rotation values if we hover over X, Y and Z.

78
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,510
We can see they've got different names roll.

79
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,270
Pitch.

80
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,620
And your.

81
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,230
And that's what we're going to be editing in code.

82
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,690
Now, the reason why I'm just bringing that up is not only the names, but they won't necessarily be

83
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,330
in the order X, Y, Z.

84
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,340
When we come to coding it, that's something to bear in mind.

85
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,690
It's very easy to think that.

86
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,380
Oh, Z.

87
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,530
Well, that's the last value in the three, so I just need to alter that.

88
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,810
Now you do have to pay attention because it won't always be in that order.

89
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,460
In the code.

90
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,660
So let's go ahead.

91
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:44,400
I'm going to right click on my open door component and open open door header file and oh, it's just

92
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,660
opened up on another screen.

93
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,620
Let's bring that down.

94
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,430
Ready to edit.

95
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,280
This is typically where we could add our members, our member variables, any functions that we're going

96
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,540
to use in this particular case.

97
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,230
I don't think we're gonna have anything just at the moment, but later on we will do.

98
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,390
So let's go straight over to the implementation.

99
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:04,320
Now, we can put everything at the moment in Biggin Place.

100
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:11,570
So when we click play, what will happen is the door rotate instantly to 90 degrees, hopefully, and

101
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,670
in which case I should also pre-war knew at this point.

102
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,960
Notice here that the door value, it's your value is already zero.

103
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:25,710
If you happen to have constructed your room and the door is already at 90 degrees or minus 90 degrees

104
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,900
is not really going to do anything.

105
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,830
It's just gonna flip around and stick at this angle.

106
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:38,010
In fact, what I would do here is I'm just gonna shut the door back up and then I'm going to take a

107
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:44,220
duplicate of the door and the door frame for reference ALZ drag popper over here.

108
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,370
I'm gonna rotate these by 90 degrees.

109
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,220
There we go.

110
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,270
And we'll see that when we execute our code.

111
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,090
When we press play that this storm will move.

112
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:57,810
This door won't just to highlight the issue going on there.

113
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,390
And that's something we'll fix up in an upcoming lecture.

114
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,070
Let's go back over to the code.

115
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,520
So we're about to use something called float's.

116
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,880
This will be the first time that we've used any floats.

117
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:11,590
And the way that we would declare it is with the keyword float.

118
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,000
Then we'd give it a name.

119
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,600
So my float in this particular case.

120
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,510
And then we would initialize it was some value.

121
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,150
Now, unreal is quite clever.

122
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,400
And it will do some implicit conversion.

123
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,890
So if you were to just type in 10 and leave it like that, that would work.

124
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:33,660
It would implicitly convert the integer 10 to a float.

125
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:42,190
If you were to go ten point zero, that's what's called a double, and it would again implicitly convert

126
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,740
it from that double into a float.

127
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:49,540
And if we put the F on the end, we are literally saying to the engine.

128
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,670
This is a float.

129
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:55,040
And you've got two ways in which you can write your float.

130
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:59,180
You can write it with the decimal place in there that you're working to.

131
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,360
So if it was ten point five.

132
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,000
Like so.

133
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:06,770
But if you had it just at 10, you wouldn't have to have the zero.

134
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,430
There you could also leave it like that.

135
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:15,350
So when we're talking about 90 degrees, we could actually set it like so and we're saying this is a

136
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,960
float, not an implicit conversions from any other number.

137
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,680
So we're being very specific there.

138
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,570
And whether or not you include that zero, there is entirely up to your code style.

139
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:29,620
You will look through the unreal docs and you'll see a lot of the time it's written like that.

140
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:35,070
However, if you're looking online, you may find someone has a code style that includes the zero there.

141
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:42,010
I think that I'm going to remove the zero not only for speed of typing, but also it matches the unreeled

142
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:44,440
box and I want to stay as close to those as possible.

143
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,720
We'll come back to that in a moment.

144
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:50,860
Now, we're we already know how we can go ahead and get an actor's location.

145
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,980
So if we try, let's say, gets actor rotation.

146
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,290
I've seen that as we've gone through before.

147
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:57,830
So we can get owner.

148
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,390
That's absolutely fine.

149
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,900
Now nothing's happening.

150
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,430
Oh, dear.

151
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,080
Can you remember why?

152
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,100
Yes, you're probably correct.

153
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,540
We've not included what we need to use.

154
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:14,540
So let's go to the top of our file here and hash include.

155
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,650
What do we need to include?

156
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,360
Well, it's going to be the game framework.

157
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,700
Forward slash actor, the H.

158
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:24,880
Okay, so now that that's included, what we should find is the Arrow operator.

159
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:31,980
She comes out here so we could get the actor location attorney on rotation.

160
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:32,820
There we go.

161
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,560
So this here.

162
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,370
What is it.

163
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,030
What is this.

164
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:41,820
Returning we hover over is going to give us an F rotator.

165
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,500
Okay, let's go over to the docs and have a look at how an F rotator is constructed.

166
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:47,670
Okay.

167
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:52,740
So here we go over in the F rotator in the documents that scroll down F rotator.

168
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:53,670
And here we go.

169
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,060
This is the struts that contains the pitch, yaw and roll.

170
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,820
We can see there a float, which is awesome.

171
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:03,510
And look, it's not in the order X, Y, Z is in the order.

172
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,750
If I remember correctly, Y is pitch.

173
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,480
Let's go have a look.

174
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,340
Hover over.

175
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,630
X is roll.

176
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,830
Why is pitch.

177
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,450
Z is your.

178
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:12,940
Okay.

179
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:19,270
So this starts Y, Z and then X.

180
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:23,050
So you do have to pay attention to how that's constructed.

181
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:28,020
OK, so we know that get at a rotation is going to return an F rotator.

182
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:31,510
And currently line 26 is just throwing that value away.

183
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,920
So let's store it somewhere.

184
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,770
Let's go and f rotate.

185
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:39,940
So I'm going to give myself a space there so it auto completes for me f rotates and I'm gonna call it

186
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:45,190
currents rotation because that's what it will be and we'll set it to whatever this returns.

187
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:50,220
And what we could do here is we could go current rotation dot.

188
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:50,800
Here we go.

189
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,930
We've got your if we scroll up roll impact.

190
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,870
So we're able to access the members of that struct, which is really useful.

191
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,830
Now, this is just all about getting the active rotation.

192
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:06,520
What we really want to do is set the active rotation.

193
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:12,670
So if we go ahead and went get owner, let's make sure this is available to us.

194
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:19,910
We'll get owner Brackett's arrow operator as Triceps Act rotation.

195
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,620
Here we go.

196
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,190
Awesome.

197
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,200
Now, what is that expecting?

198
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,810
So what is set at active rotation?

199
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,130
Expecting to be put into it.

200
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,040
Let's go have a look at the docs for set to rotation.

201
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:31,690
OK.

202
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,630
So over in the dots, we can see here, there are two types of construction.

203
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:42,470
It will be an F rotator or a quick Ternium on, which is another type of rotations, which I'm sure

204
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,120
will cover later on in the course.

205
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:47,130
So it's expecting F rotator to be put in there.

206
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:47,780
Okay.

207
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:52,670
So, for instance, here, we've already got an F rotator we can put in so we can put in our current

208
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,330
rotation.

209
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,390
Now, obviously, that's going to set it to what it currently is.

210
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:00,840
And your challenge will be to open it by 90 degrees.

211
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,460
OK, so your challenge is to get the door to open using code.

212
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:12,240
So create an F rotator with a your value of either 90 or minus 90 degrees.

213
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:20,340
And then once you've created that F rotator parser into the sect actor rotation in order to rotate our

214
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:27,300
door or anything, in fact, that we put those components on by even 90 or minus 90 degrees, possibly

215
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:27,630
an hour.

216
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:28,680
And give that a go.

217
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,520
Okay, everybody, welcome back.

218
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,870
Let's go ahead now and create our F rotator that will open up our door.

219
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,090
Okay, everybody, welcome back.

220
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,060
So there are a couple of ways in which we could do this.

221
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:47,030
We could go ahead and modify the value of the current rotation.

222
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:53,920
So if we come into here and get the current rotation dots your.

223
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,880
Let's spell that correctly, otherwise it won't work.

224
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,690
And we could change it to ninety point F.

225
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:09,140
And then we can pass the current rotation back in another way that you could potentially do this is

226
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:17,090
you could declare a new F rotator and initialize it at the same time so we could have an F rotator open

227
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:21,050
door, for instance, and then we could give it some value straight away.

228
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:24,980
Now, I have put an equal sign here, but it isn't actually necessary.

229
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,500
So I would open up our curly braces.

230
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:34,040
Now, if you have admitted that the equals sign here, you could just as easily use parentheses instead

231
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,210
of curly braces.

232
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,330
And we could go zero point F comma.

233
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,530
And here we go is is helping us here.

234
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:48,280
This is where we need our ninety point F comma and then zero point F again, because we don't need it

235
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,540
rotating elsewhere.

236
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,720
Okay, so we've constructed it.

237
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:52,320
Awesome.

238
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,660
Now let's see if the current rotation works.

239
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,790
And then we can swap out open door.

240
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:01,670
Now, we're not using this at the moment, so I will comment out that line and we're not using my floats

241
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,010
at all.

242
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,590
That was just an example.

243
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,930
Let's save our code, compile and see what happens.

244
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,520
OK, so I'll compile is complete.

245
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,720
Let's go ahead and press play.

246
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,820
And the door is open and noticed this door hasn't moved at all.

247
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,020
And the reason for that?

248
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:23,080
Well, with setting an absolute value of snapping the door instantly to a particular value.

249
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,770
Okay, so let's go back into our code and see if the other way of working it would be.

250
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,140
So efforts to open door.

251
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,820
And this is being explicit, but it is hard coding a value in.

252
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,690
So we might wants to be able to later on edit that.

253
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:42,610
That's something to bear in mind here, that these are hard coded values that the user can't change

254
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,690
very easily.

255
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,250
But we can change that later on.

256
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,730
So let's remove the current rotation from there.

257
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,290
Is this doing anything?

258
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,000
No, it's not doing anything.

259
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:55,950
In this instance and here we can pop in open door instead.

260
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,390
Let's go and save our work.

261
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,870
Back over into unreal hit compile.

262
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,830
With the compiler complete, let's hit play.

263
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,340
Now, I can already see that the doors open because of the shadow.

264
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:08,990
Excellent.

265
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,560
So there you go.

266
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:12,990
There are two different ways that you could accomplish this particular challenge.

267
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,900
One final thing I'm going to do here.

268
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:21,560
I'm going to have a look at my place starts and I keep wanting to look at that door, don't sigh.

269
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,390
So let's go ahead and move it.

270
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,770
Let's rotate it round so faces the door.

271
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,780
That looks good to me.

272
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:34,040
And we might want to just shift it back ever so slightly as well.

273
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,810
Hey, when we press play.

274
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,130
Yes.

275
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:36,650
Brilliant.

276
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,360
That's exactly what I wants to see.

277
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,900
And we've got some lighting to bridge be rebuilt here.

278
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,520
Now, I'm over the top at the moment.

279
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:49,640
I would say with my building of lighting by wants to do that's currently just to make sure that everything

280
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,530
is right in my scene.

281
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:57,260
Now, on a larger level, this can take tens of minutes to do so.

282
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:02,600
You don't necessarily want to overzealously click the build button all the time with a small level like

283
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,030
this when we're learning what our changes are doing.

284
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:11,240
It's a good idea, just like it's a good idea to compile our code on very small steps is a good idea

285
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:16,280
to do our lighting as well to make sure that what we're working on is what we expect it to look like

286
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:16,730
as well.

287
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,470
So that's it for this lecture.

288
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:23,180
We've got our doors snapping open to 90 degrees.

289
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:28,730
We've got an issue that it is just opening to 90 degrees, which means if we put any other doors in

290
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:34,820
our world at anything other than 90 zero degrees starting, they're not going to behave how we'd expect

291
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,300
them to.

292
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:41,810
And, of course, we'll sort that out in the lectures to come, and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
