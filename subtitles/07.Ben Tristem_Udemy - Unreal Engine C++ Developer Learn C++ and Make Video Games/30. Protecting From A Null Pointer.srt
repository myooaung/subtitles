00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:05,660
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:11,440
In this lecture we're going to protect ourselves you may have already experienced a crash.

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:12,800
Let's give you an example.

4
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:18,320
In a previous iteration of this when I was playing around getting all the lectures sorted I had quite

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:24,710
a dense environment in front of me as I was trying things out and I had inadvertently I will try and

6
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:32,270
replicate it here a forced replication when I drag this door kind of into a position it was roughly

7
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,150
in when I was playing with it.

8
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,690
So about there also.

9
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:42,080
So I thought I was selecting the door when I was adding the open door components.

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,240
Let's make this area here because so we can say it's.

11
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:51,080
I didn't overtly select something like this sphere behind and added the component didn't notice that

12
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:56,590
I had added this particular component to something else and our seen that wasn't a door.

13
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,330
And equally it being a sphere would never rotate visually anyway so that we could see what was changed.

14
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:07,760
So I thought I just missed or forgotten that it happened.

15
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:14,120
Now if you have done this because I've been quite clear about this setting the pressure plate is essential

16
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,690
if you don't then you will find the unreal will crash.

17
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,270
Let's see that happen now.

18
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,750
So completely out of the blue you go.

19
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:26,660
Okay let's test our scene play and you'll get this crash report coming up and I'm just going to make

20
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:31,380
it a bit bigger here so we can see all of this text in front of us.

21
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:36,050
Quite frankly I know what the issue is it's because that's not been set.

22
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,780
We've got ourselves what's called a null pointer.

23
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:44,990
So we get undefined behavior and unreal just crashes it doesn't like it still.

24
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:51,200
Unfortunately it doesn't say here you have a null pointer go sort that's out to actually took me ages

25
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:56,770
because I thought that that wasn't the case so I'll just send a restart.

26
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,620
I hadn't realized that other attached to this component so something else.

27
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:08,570
So what we need to do is go into our code and set it up so that either error doesn't happen.

28
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:14,530
But even better we get a a message in the logs saying what is causing that problem.

29
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:22,550
So in this particular issue it's the fact that the pressure plate was not assigned on a certain actor.

30
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:26,380
So that's the important thing that's what we can output to a log.

31
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,320
And that's incredibly useful because then we can go to our logs and go Well why did it crash.

32
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,520
Let's go to our code and fix this issue.

33
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:35,950
OK.

34
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:41,420
So over MVS code the first thing I'd like to look at is what's called lazy evaluation.

35
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:46,070
This is not the way I really want to go with it because whilst it does protect us it doesn't give us

36
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,660
any useful feedback.

37
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:52,980
We're just protecting ourselves which in some cases is might might be what you want.

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,440
So if statements if they've got a series of checks they they lazily evaluate if the first condition

39
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:07,970
is false then it won't actually execute any code further down quite a good optimization.

40
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:12,530
If all of these things have to be true and if the first one isn't then there's no point in carrying

41
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,420
on.

42
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:18,740
So the way that we can do this is go if pressure plates and then we're gonna have to put up a bit of

43
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:26,390
a space there so I can actually type in pressure plate and then to Ampersand to say and and what this

44
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:32,220
will do if we go ahead and save it and go back over it into unreal.

45
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:39,500
Now if we go ahead and compile our code and if we go ahead and attach it once again this time not by

46
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:46,970
accident but on purpose the open door component to this sphere but do not set any pressure plates on

47
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:51,560
it we will find that it won't crash but it also won't give us any useful feedback either.

48
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:58,610
So let's go ahead add component our open door component we go and yes that's all there.

49
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,080
But we haven't set the pressure plate.

50
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,440
And before that would have crashed.

51
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,200
Unreal.

52
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:09,380
But if we go ahead and press play it will now work as we would expect it to which is really awesome.

53
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,930
Now that is the temporary fix for this.

54
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:18,920
If you've been having crashes we still need to make our carrot to be able to open this and we'll sort

55
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:24,380
out how to have the carrot to activate the pressure plate in a bit but before we go on and do that.

56
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:29,450
Let's first of all have something useful coming in the output log here.

57
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:36,800
Something that says Warning or even error in this case that's the sphere or whatever it's called has

58
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:41,470
a open door component attached to it but no pressure plate set.

59
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:42,330
OK.

60
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:47,930
So we can leave what we've already put in there as a layer of protection which is a good start.

61
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,880
However we can if we go ahead and press play we want it to check right at the very beginning we don't

62
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,950
want it to check every frame otherwise we'll get the error report at whatever the frame rate for game

63
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,230
is which is just silly we just need it once.

64
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:03,680
So at this particular point we need to log something.

65
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:04,440
OK.

66
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,640
So what happens when there's no pressure plate set.

67
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,350
Well this is going to be your challenge.

68
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:16,210
So what I'd like you to do is say that the actor name or words to this effect.

69
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:23,120
So you're gonna have to go and get the actor's name the actor name has the open door component on it

70
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,380
but no pressure plate sets.

71
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:27,730
Okay.

72
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,020
I should be pretty straightforward to do.

73
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,940
Possibly now and give that a go

74
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,850
Okay so that was a really quick challenge there.

75
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,660
Now of course protecting yourself against null pointers is incredibly important and will cover this

76
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,970
several times as we continue as well.

77
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:52,630
But making sure that if you're using pointers and that if there's not one sets you going to have issues.

78
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:55,300
So let's try and protect ourselves where possible.

79
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,210
So this is going to be a Yui log.

80
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,490
Again it's going to go in the log temp.

81
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:05,780
This time I'm not going to use just a log or a warning.

82
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,970
It's gonna be a proper error because this is quite quite serious because it crashes.

83
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:11,730
Unreal.

84
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,860
If we're not careful let's go in and create.

85
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:16,660
Here we go.

86
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,060
So has the open door on it.

87
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,510
But no pressure plate sets.

88
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,630
That's fine we can use that in there.

89
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,250
But we need another string in here to say the actor's name.

90
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,010
How do we go ahead and do that.

91
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:31,870
Well with that format specified there hopefully whatever we find will return a String.

92
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:39,250
Now we're going to need to d reference because of the F string that's required and then we can get Owen

93
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:39,650
up.

94
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,020
Excellent.

95
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:46,870
Now in get toner if we have a look with the arrow operator Let's type in name and just see if we've

96
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:53,380
got something that we can do a pen name that's got to be a gets name along here.

97
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,400
In fact there it is.

98
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,530
Get name.

99
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,600
Perfect.

100
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,420
Of course that's a function call.

101
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:06,320
So that's why hover over it XOM is returning an F string so that's going to feed directly into here.

102
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:10,340
That's a name that's now self-explanatory so we don't need the comments anymore.

103
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,260
So let's get rid of that so that is nice and clean.

104
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,430
It's checking beforehand.

105
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:20,500
Now when we go ahead over and turn real and compile Okay so let's press play.

106
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:21,490
And here we go.

107
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:26,260
We've got the same warnings that we've had sets up for ages but also this additional error that sphere

108
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:31,090
five this one here has the open door component on it but no pressure plate sets.

109
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:35,200
I think that requires a bit of punctuation on the end as well an exclamation mark.

110
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,030
How serious is brilliant.

111
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,790
That's exactly what we want.

112
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,240
So I am going to go back over here.

113
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:48,430
Put the exclamation mark on the end and save my code and stop my game from running.

114
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:48,910
There we go.

115
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:53,550
We have protected ourselves from unreal just randomly crashing.

116
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:59,500
And because this doesn't require any any open door component on it I've been warned about it so I can

117
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:05,080
come in here I can hover over by the way over in the world outline there we have spear fire if that's

118
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,320
what it was referring to.

119
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:12,940
So I can just delete the open door component from the actor.

120
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:13,430
And there we go.

121
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:18,250
But you know the pointers are something that will catch you out time and time again.

122
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,590
I hope they don't.

123
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,140
Protecting yourself as you go along as a sure way to help mitigate those problems.

124
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:28,690
And of course every time you're putting in that the level of protection it means that you're aware that

125
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:32,620
it might happen which means it's less likely to happen in the first place.

126
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:33,300
Okay.

127
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,980
That's it for this lecture and I'll see you guys in the next one.
