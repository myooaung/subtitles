00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:05,200
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:11,650
This lecture we're introducing to new types of asset, the behavior tree and the black border, which

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:17,770
are two assets that allow us to do a very interesting thing, has with A.I. allow us to make a much

4
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,930
more complicated A.I. very easily.

5
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,420
Let's dive in and see how we use them and set them up.

6
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:25,320
OK.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,860
So we want to create some sophisticated A.I. behavior.

8
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:34,000
Now, the way we typically do this in Unreal is using a system called behavior trees.

9
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:34,930
Now, what are these?

10
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,830
Well, the best way for us to find out is to create one.

11
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,960
So let's go ahead and write, click and go.

12
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:45,010
We're looking here under the artificial intelligence.

13
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:46,430
And there's two options here.

14
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,250
Behavior tree and blackboard.

15
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,800
We are going to want both of these.

16
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,430
So let's go and start with the behavior tree.

17
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,530
The prefix for this is Beatty, and we're going to call this the enemy.

18
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,170
So behavior tree enemy A.I., just finish off with that Nago.

19
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:09,190
And we also need to create the other thing in there, which was a blackboard.

20
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,340
Now, what on earth is a blackboard to get to that in just a second.

21
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:18,550
But we're just going to call it the B B underscore enemy A.I. So Beebee for Blackboard Beatty for Behavior

22
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:18,970
Tree.

23
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:23,890
And while we're at it, we've got a few things relating to a I have got to create a new folder called

24
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:29,440
A.I. and we are going to move the blackboard, the behavior tree.

25
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:36,040
And somewhere here we have got our shooter, A.I. controller, all of that goes into A.I. move here

26
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,000
and then we can go into that A.I..

27
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,360
Deal with everything A.I. related.

28
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:45,250
Let's open up our behavior tree, first of all, and dock it to the main window.

29
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,560
So what on earth is this?

30
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:52,900
So this allows us to create trees of behaviors where you might say we've got part of the behavior here

31
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:53,840
is for chasing.

32
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,120
Part of it is for trolling.

33
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,210
Part of it is for something else.

34
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,010
Opening doors, all these kinds of things.

35
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:06,370
They typically structure behaviors as lots and lots of trees of behaviors and sub trees and so on.

36
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:09,190
We will see that all going on in detail.

37
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:15,610
But suffice to say, it is a great way of putting together natural behaviors in your games.

38
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,620
Now, it's not the be all and end all.

39
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,420
There's lots of A.I. techniques.

40
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:23,830
This might not be the one that you want to go with for your game, but it's a great start and you can

41
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,840
achieve quite a lot with it.

42
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,090
Now, the next thing we can see over in the top, right, these two assets are linked to the behavior

43
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,820
tree and the blackboard.

44
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,810
What on earth is a blackboard?

45
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,050
Well, the blackboard is kind of like the memory of your A.I..

46
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:42,250
It's essentially where you store a bunch of variables.

47
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:46,330
You input them from the game, play very much like we were doing with the animation system where you

48
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:50,910
had these these different properties that are being set by the gameplay.

49
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:57,220
We do the same thing with the A.I. We set lots of properties that give it information about its game

50
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:03,310
world and then the behavior tree draws on those properties and uses them to decide what it's going to

51
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:03,580
do.

52
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,930
It can set those properties.

53
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,700
It can use them as a memory.

54
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:10,450
It can read from those properties and all that lovely stuff.

55
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:17,020
So with that in mind, how can we set up our behavior tree and blackboard so that they are linked to

56
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:17,620
one another?

57
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,470
Well, we're going to expand out in our details pain.

58
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:26,020
You can see here that there is this blackboard asset and automatically it seems to have filled it out

59
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:32,620
for us such that the blackboard asset is linked to this be Beebee Enemy, A.I. Blackbaud Asset.

60
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:38,710
Now, we are going to be departing from C++ for a little bit to use these assets because obviously behavior,

61
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:42,420
trees and blackboards are entirely within the editor.

62
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,450
They're not blueprints as such.

63
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,510
They are their own ED tools.

64
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,330
And we can interface with them in C++.

65
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,500
But it does mean we're gonna be using the editor for the next couple of lectures as well as C++.

66
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,700
Not so much blueprint.

67
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,890
So it's great that we've got ourselves this behavior tree and this blackboard.

68
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,230
But how on earth do we actually use it?

69
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:05,530
Well, for that, we go back to our A.I. controller.

70
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:12,190
I if you remember, I controller is entirely responsible for running our behaviors.

71
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,400
And that is no exception here.

72
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,940
The behavior tree is just another thing that the A.I. controller can use or run.

73
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,050
So the way we're gonna do this is we're gonna go over to our air control dot h.

74
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:29,860
And we need to have a way of referencing in the blueprint what behavior tree we want it to run.

75
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,900
So the first thing I'm going to do is I'm actually going to go with the air controller TPP and comments

76
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:40,990
out the stuff in tech because we're going to be replacing this functionality with behavior, terie functionality

77
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:41,470
instead.

78
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:46,240
And then that means that I can remove this acceptance radius here because we no longer need it.

79
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:50,000
And instead, we're going to be using a pointer to the U.

80
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:50,950
Behavior.

81
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:56,140
And I have to spell this the American way tree and pointer.

82
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,010
That's the behavior tree you want there.

83
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:02,340
And I need to forward declare this with a class in front of it.

84
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:07,580
And then basically here, what I want to say is that this is the A.I. behavior.

85
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:08,710
And.

86
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:15,130
I'm going to keep the American spelling here just for consistency, so this is the A.I. behavior that

87
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:18,970
we want here that's actually run the behavior, it couldn't be simpler again.

88
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,710
The A.I. controls on each has a built in function for this.

89
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,510
We've got this run behavior.

90
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,410
Tree function turns a boolean.

91
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:30,460
Whether you are able to successfully execute it or not, start executing it, that is.

92
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:35,770
And it takes in the B.T. asset, which is appointed to the you behavior tree.

93
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:40,000
So that's what we're going to want to use and we can do this over in begin play.

94
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:44,650
So what we're gonna do is, first of all, we're gonna check that we indeed have a behavior tree here.

95
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,020
So we're going to say A.I. behavior.

96
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:53,650
Is not equal to null pointer because we do not want to be using it otherwise.

97
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,970
And then what we can do is we can run the behavior tree called our A.I. behavior.

98
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:06,230
It really is that simple to get an A.I. behavior running and we can go ahead and compile.

99
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:12,600
And one more thing we can do with the heavy trees is we can kind of see them running at runtime.

100
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,000
But to do that, you need to have some sort of node in here.

101
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,930
So we're just going to add in a node without fully understanding what it does.

102
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:23,970
I'm going to add a sequence node and I'm going to hook it up by dragging down from the root node, the

103
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:28,800
bit underneath the root node, the highlights when I mouseover it down to the bit above the sequence

104
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,100
node.

105
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,690
And I'm going to save that.

106
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:37,410
I'm going to go over and hit play and go into my behavior tree asset.

107
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:43,440
And you should be able to see a drop down here, but with not because it's not currently running.

108
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,340
So let's stop playing.

109
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,650
And why is it not running?

110
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:49,320
Because we haven't hooked it up in our shooter A.I. controller.

111
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:53,640
So let's do that many challenge for you to hook that up operation.

112
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,450
Be too hard.

113
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:55,280
Okay.

114
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,100
Welcome back.

115
00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:01,110
So if we go and have a look in here, we're looking for at A.I. behavior.

116
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:04,290
Some reason it required a recomposed for me to show up for me.

117
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:04,890
But here it is.

118
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,510
A.I. behavior is what we want.

119
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,910
We click the dropdown has only one option at the moment.

120
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,620
We've only got one behavior tree.

121
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:14,190
So select that one and compile and save.

122
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,220
And if we now go ahead and play the game.

123
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:23,940
And go and have a look at Beatty enemy A.I., you can see that it's highlighting the note that's currently

124
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,360
running.

125
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:30,960
And you've got this little drop down next to the pause stop buttons, which tells you which A.I. controller

126
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,080
you're currently observing, the behavior trial.

127
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:37,530
So this is a great functionality for you to be able to jump in and go, okay.

128
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,100
Why is that?

129
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,780
I just standing still.

130
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,190
Why is he not chasing the player?

131
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:45,500
You can see which part of the behavior he's currently running and go, ah, that seat.

132
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,920
You know, that thing's gone wrong.

133
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,900
It's really helpful for debugging.

134
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:53,670
You can go and have a look at what all your A.I. and the world are up to by using this dropdown.

135
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:54,570
Great stuff.

136
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:55,560
That's all for this lecture.

137
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:01,770
In the next lecture, we're gonna be looking at how we can set information in the blackboard memory

138
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,590
of our A.I. from C++.

139
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,340
I'll see you there.
