00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:07,730
Hello everybody and welcome back in this lecture we're going to talk about actors.

2
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:08,780
What is an actor.

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:13,550
Well any object that can be placed into your level is called an actor whether that's a light whether

4
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:17,440
that's a character whether that's a starting point for your pleasure.

5
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,830
These are all actors.

6
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:25,790
They all have a transform which means we can scale rotate and translates them.

7
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:31,130
And as alluded to by the fact they can be any object that's placed into your level there are several

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,000
different types of actor.

9
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,870
Let's dive into unreal and find out more okay.

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,430
So first of all let's have a look around our world.

11
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:45,040
I'm going to just move these handles slightly because I want to focus on the main window here but I

12
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,830
need these other areas especially the details area over to the right.

13
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,450
So let's have a look and say well let's go out and we've got lots of different things in this well there

14
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,650
are a lot of mesh type actors in here.

15
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,480
We go ahead and click on let's say a ha cow with the left mouse button.

16
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,630
We can see that it's a static mesh act.

17
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm going to have to make this area bigger to see all of that information.

18
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:08,490
There we go.

19
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,120
Static mesh actor.

20
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,240
When we click on the player starts it's a player starts.

21
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,300
That's the type of actor it is.

22
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:19,280
As you can see you can have lots and lots of different types of actors.

23
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:23,290
And the thing that I want to draw your attention to in this particular lecture is the fact that you

24
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,720
can manipulate these in multiple ways.

25
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,460
The first thing we can do for instance is select one of these cows and we notice that we've already

26
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,620
got this gimbal over the top of it.

27
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:33,490
That's really useful.

28
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:39,430
This is the translate or move Gimbel and we can simply click and make our cow levitate or place them

29
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,740
on the ground etc..

30
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:46,030
And if you do want an object to snap to the ground it will snap based upon this origin point where that

31
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:53,830
white dot is and that can be activated up at the top here under the editor snapping options if we do

32
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:59,050
surface snapping we will find that now when we move our cow around it will stick to the surface and

33
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,330
even go up a hill.

34
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:07,150
Pretty cool being able to do that and it enables you to build up a level really really quickly.

35
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:13,360
You can also press the end key on your keyboard and suddenly your actor will snap to the ground which

36
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,410
is really useful but you do have to make sure there's nothing around your actor that it's going to get

37
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:21,030
stuck on as it goes down towards the ground.

38
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:26,730
Now there are other types of tools we can use so we've got our three axes that we can move our cow on

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,110
but how about rotate.

40
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:34,710
So we've got controls at the very top here right next to the snapping we can turn on rotation or scaling

41
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:44,220
and you'll notice that as you go across them we've got W E and R so you can use W E and R to change

42
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,490
the type of transform you're going to do.

43
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:53,550
So in this case with scaling we can make it tall on just the z axis there if we wanted to if we didn't

44
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:59,730
want that we could go control in Z and undo if we wanted to be able to scale the entire thing equally.

45
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:05,370
Then we go to the center point and then drag their click and drag and then we can have maybe a mummy

46
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,780
and a baby cow next to each other.

47
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:14,470
I'll leave that up to you to decide how you want to play with your level and quickly the rotation tool

48
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:20,410
as you can see here it gives us the axes in which we can move our model around and we've got some fine

49
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:25,690
snapping as it goes round there to 10 degree increments if we want to turn that off we can go at the

50
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:30,850
top here we've got a couple of options when it comes to snapping we've already played with the placement

51
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:37,090
snapping where it will snap to the ground with that toggle on which is this one here surface snapping

52
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:41,860
we've also got enables or disables snapping to a grid when dragging options around.

53
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:47,410
Now that's really really useful if you've built a set of assets that you want to slot together being

54
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:50,860
able to snap to a grid will allow that to happen really easily.

55
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:56,290
Providing of course the assets fit into that grid well and you can see here there are three toggles

56
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:02,560
depending on whether you want the snap rotation scaling or translation If we go back to rotation and

57
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:10,210
turn this toggle off we see that we can now have a much finer control if we go ahead and turn that back

58
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:15,630
on what you will notice is that it resets at zero from there onwards.

59
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:21,370
So that can be a little bit confusing if you happen to have rotated something by an amount and then

60
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,470
you can't get back again.

61
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:27,220
Remember you can undo and the final thing to talk about with that surface snapping there is we have

62
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,880
another option here to rotate to the surface normal.

63
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:34,870
Now that is generally something you'll probably want on but sometimes it might not be something.

64
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:40,690
So what that means is at the moment the cow if we go ahead and move the cow all the way over to the

65
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:47,020
Hill notice that it leans forwards as it goes up the slope and then straightens out or as it moves around

66
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:53,640
here it will lean depending on what is on now the tree for instance that might look a bit odd.

67
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,130
Now this is made up of two mesh objects.

68
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,800
So when we go ahead and move that see that it's now leaning to one side.

69
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,430
That may be the desired result.

70
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,900
Here we go on the cows head.

71
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,660
It's much better.

72
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:09,640
But here we go as we go up we may not want a tree to actually lean.

73
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:15,480
If that is the case then what we will do is go in here and turn off the rotate to surface normal and

74
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:19,840
then it will remain upright as you move it up a slope.

75
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:22,140
So we've played lots in the viewport itself.

76
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,590
And that is likely the majority of you will use these tools.

77
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:33,800
However let's not forget that we've got some very fine controls over on the details tab that transform.

78
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,300
If it's not open you can click on the little triangle to the left of the word transform and then we've

79
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,000
got options for the location rotation and scale.

80
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,130
We've also got a lock option here as well which is really useful so if we turn on the lock there and

81
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:54,270
then set the scaling of this tree to 10 it will scale it on all of these by 10 rather than having to

82
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,530
type them all in manually.

83
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:01,020
It also gives us an option to finally control where things are placed in the world.

84
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:06,960
Now you probably with this more organic scene not going to use that but with a more rigid scene perhaps

85
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:11,300
one that was based upon geometric shapes this would be incredibly useful.

86
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,340
And the numbers that you're seeing here are based upon the world origin.

87
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:21,120
So we set everything here at 0 0 0 0 and 0.

88
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,720
We'll get an idea of where the world origin is.

89
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:26,290
It's right bang here.

90
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:32,970
So the whole level as you can see here as we zoom out is based around the single world origin and that's

91
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:39,770
where all of the coordinates are based on that global or world coordinates hello it's Michael from the

92
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:44,660
future a couple of tips here which I think would be really useful for the challenges coming up.

93
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:49,070
First of all if you want to select more than one object like this tree here you will see it's made up

94
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,150
of two objects.

95
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:55,340
You can hold down shift as you do that when you do that make sure you are selecting the appropriate

96
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:55,980
things.

97
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:56,900
Here we go.

98
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:02,000
You'll also notice that then you're able to move things around together really useful.

99
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,100
And so we've got multiple trees in the background here.

100
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:08,630
Once again we can then move them all at once.

101
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:14,630
Really useful when you've got to bulk move things around and the other thing that you can do as we've

102
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:20,240
just alluded to this area over here where we've got the transform information is if you do need to copy

103
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:27,560
information of a particular transform notice you can go ahead and right click where we have location

104
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,450
rotation and scale.

105
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:38,090
So for instance I can copy the location of our tree so we can copy that there and then we can go ahead

106
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:45,380
and grab the cow and paste its location in and it will move across or alternatively let's say something

107
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:51,950
like the tree get separated as you'll see later on and I totally forgot that this exists because the

108
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:58,400
origin point of both the top of the tree itself and the stump are supposed to be at the same location.

109
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,610
What we can do is copy the location of the trunk itself.

110
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,260
So here we go.

111
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,050
Copy.

112
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,030
Grab the top of the tree and then paste it in.

113
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:12,890
And that rejoins the tree as it's supposed to be later on you'll see me trying to line it up manually

114
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,080
totally forgetting that that was even an option.

115
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,600
So feel free to laugh at me then anyway.

116
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,510
And now it's time for your challenge okay.

117
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,160
See your challenge is to simply edit some actors.

118
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,740
Try changing the transforms of your actors.

119
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,420
Use the viewport controls.

120
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:35,000
Get comfortable with those and also try to transform setting with in the details window as well so you're

121
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,670
familiar with the multiple ways that you could change an actor's transforms possibly an hour and give

122
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,060
vertigo Okay everybody Welcome back.

123
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:49,920
Let's go ahead hop back on over into unreal and edit some actors OK.

124
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:54,560
So I think the first thing I'm going to do here is make this tree a little bit smaller again.

125
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,660
I've already got it locked.

126
00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:01,280
I can't remember what it was inside I'm going to look at the others to point to five okay.

127
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:07,010
So that's another thing that you can do is look at the details to see what the shape and size of other

128
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:15,900
objects are as well and then that just needs to be roughly the is the danger of doing things from a

129
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,770
distance.

130
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:17,990
It looks like this.

131
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:23,010
If this wasn't on the ground so I'll turn on the ground snapping again which is.

132
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:23,550
So there we go.

133
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,710
That's definitely on the ground.

134
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,200
And it just needs lifting up a little.

135
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:28,860
That's interesting.

136
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,730
I wonder if I move this top one by accident as well at some point.

137
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,020
Perhaps I did but there we go.

138
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,270
That's everything all fixed there.

139
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:44,540
I'm going to go ahead now grab my cow and downscale it again to match this one four point four to five

140
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,130
four point two five.

141
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:47,590
There we go.

142
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:54,310
And I'm going to move them back right to the beginning again will make sure I grab the right area.

143
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:54,910
There we go.

144
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,160
So I'm happy with my arrangement here I know I've not added much to the scene.

145
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:03,990
Please share any of the work that you've done over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next

146
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,440
lecture.
