1
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,690
Hello, everybody, and welcome back.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,370
In this lecture, we're going to be able to play our game and it will give us some instructions on the

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:10,690
screen.

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,220
So we're gonna be able to write to our in-game terminal.

5
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:19,370
And not only that, if I click to use it press tab to enter the terminal, I just press enter to continue.

6
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,020
It clears the screen as well.

7
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:25,130
So we're starting to build the foundations of our in-game terminal.

8
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:30,620
Okay, so let's go ahead and just dissect what we have in front of us before we start adding our code.

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,810
At the very top, you'll see that we include the bull cow cartridge header file.

10
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,590
Now you can keep open the book cartridge pedophile if you want to.

11
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:40,760
I'm going to leave it there.

12
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:47,120
So when I switch between the two, I can just control and tab backwards and forwards between these two

13
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:47,690
files.

14
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,290
And that's gonna be more prominent later on when we start hopping between them.

15
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:57,380
Now, you may notice compared to our triple X game, we don't have a main function here.

16
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,420
And that's because Unreal handles that for us.

17
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:03,200
So in front of us here, we have two functions.

18
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,900
We have one called Biggin Play, and that will run when the game starts.

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,980
So this is where we could introduce the player to the game that we're playing.

20
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,400
We've then got another call here.

21
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:16,820
We want to leave this here.

22
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:20,180
Otherwise, our game will not work when we starts playing it.

23
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:25,460
So this is something we're going to leave here for everything else benefits and then our second function.

24
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,450
This is going to happen when the player hit sensors so they can type anything into the console.

25
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:37,820
But when they press enter, then whatever code we put within this function will execute.

26
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,600
So let us now type off first bits of code.

27
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,750
So on a new line underneath begin play.

28
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:48,860
Now, it really is important that your code goes underneath begin play.

29
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,040
If you don't put it under begin play, you will get weird errors.

30
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,280
What we want to do is print a line.

31
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,990
We're going to print a line to our terminal.

32
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,450
So if we start typing, you'll notice.

33
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:00,470
There we go.

34
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,910
It started auto filling.

35
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:08,150
The great thing about this is you can hit tab straightaway and it finishes off what we were typing.

36
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,160
Cause you have to be careful about this.

37
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,010
But this is a very quick way of auto completing your code.

38
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,830
But beware, when you're doing this, you may run into an issue where you end up auto completing something

39
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:19,580
you didn't want.

40
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:26,270
The next thing we need is a double brackets and then a semicolon to finish off at the end.

41
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,410
Now, print line currently has a red squiggle under it, if that's the case.

42
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:34,880
That's because at the moment we've not passed in a string.

43
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,170
Now this string happens to be empty, but it is accepted.

44
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,240
And we no longer have our red squiggles.

45
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,630
And what we can put here is Hiver, for instance.

46
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,700
Let's put an exclamation mark on the end.

47
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,540
Save our code.

48
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,910
Go over to the Unreal editor.

49
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:53,630
And before we do anything else, you're going to have to press.

50
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,210
Compile says, go ahead, hit, compile.

51
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:02,400
And that would take a few moments to do some here with a quick note from the future again.

52
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:10,100
I just want to say that in Visual Studio Code, sometimes you get false errors and they can look a little

53
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,000
bit like this.

54
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,860
However, if you go over into one reel and hit compile and there are no errors, that's absolutely fine.

55
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,880
That's just visual studio codes.

56
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:24,140
Intellisense and I put this in air quotes that is misfiring and telling you about errors that don't

57
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:24,800
really exist.

58
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:30,560
So always make sure you try, first of all, to hit the compile button before you investigate an error.

59
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,590
Once completes, we can play our game.

60
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,020
Now, I have seen a couple of bugs.

61
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,960
When we go ahead and play and now we go, it's worked.

62
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:39,870
I can see that straightaway.

63
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,660
It says hi there.

64
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:46,880
So the moment we've started playing our game and if we refer back to our code, begin play when the

65
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,050
game starts.

66
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:51,230
So the moment we press play, it's printing out.

67
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,550
So the user can see.

68
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,480
Hi there.

69
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:58,900
Occasionally I've had to press compile twice before it works.

70
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,390
That's just occasionally, but it is something to check.

71
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:07,060
Now, if we have a look at the next function on impact, we don't have any code there at the moment.

72
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:15,040
So if we go down to unreal and just click so well within the game, then press tab to access our in-game

73
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,310
terminal and then type something in and press enter.

74
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,930
Nothing happens.

75
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,790
That's what our code says.

76
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,830
And that was what we were expecting.

77
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,870
And that leads us nicely onto our challenge.

78
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:32,160
I'd like you to clear the terminal and do a few other things to welcome our player.

79
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:38,340
So, first of all, change our current high there to a Bull Cowl's welcome message, welcoming the player,

80
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:44,160
then print another line, asking the players, input something and press enter.

81
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,350
You can do that in one of two ways.

82
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,810
I'll leave you to figure out which way you're going to do it.

83
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,540
But again, there's no right or wrong when it comes to this.

84
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,300
And then finally in the on input function, cool, clear screen.

85
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,450
And what you will find is that then clears the terminal down.

86
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,770
Remember to save.

87
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,890
Remember to compile and then play your game.

88
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,140
Pause video now and give that a go.

89
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,840
Okay, everybody, welcome back.

90
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:18,020
Let's go ahead now and welcome the player to the game and then clear the screen after they've type something.

91
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:22,660
Kate, before I do anything else in here, I'm just going to stop the game from running.

92
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:23,590
There we go.

93
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,460
Let's go back over to our code.

94
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:30,790
So instead of saying hi there, we can say welcome to bull cows.

95
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,000
Now, we have a couple of options here.

96
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,360
We've got welcome to bull cows.

97
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:39,460
We could repeat this line like so and paste them in and then.

98
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:46,600
We can just change that to something else like press and to continue.

99
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:53,360
And then on the on input's function, we can clear screen so we can select it from there.

100
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,710
Remember, use semicolon at the end, otherwise our code won't run.

101
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:00,400
Notice that without it, by the way, we get a red squiggle.

102
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:05,140
And if we hover over it, it does tell us it expected a semicolon.

103
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,710
Now, as often is the case, it's not referring to line 14.

104
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,630
It's referring to line 13.

105
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,580
So we put a semicolon man on the end.

106
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:13,990
Absolutely fine.

107
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,130
Cause we're missing.

108
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,200
It's a function.

109
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,490
We also need our parentheses in there as well.

110
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:21,580
Let's go ahead, save that file and make sure it's working.

111
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:26,170
Over in into unreal click compile with our compile complete.

112
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:27,510
I'm gonna go Alton Pizza.

113
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,060
Play the game.

114
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,820
Welcome to Bull Cows.

115
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,760
Brilliant press.

116
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:31,790
Enter to continue.

117
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,100
That looks like it's working fine.

118
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,810
It's tapped to use the console and then we can type in anything.

119
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,430
Type in hello for instance.

120
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:44,110
And you'll notice that special characters like Exclamation Mark don't work on impulse.

121
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,450
But that's to say hello and brilliant.

122
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,500
It clears the screen.

123
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,450
In fact, that should work with anything.

124
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,330
So let's just go and play our game.

125
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:56,200
Click for mouse control press tab and then just press enter.

126
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:56,820
There we go.

127
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,610
It's clear the screen.

128
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,210
Perfect.

129
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:03,010
Now, before we go on, I just wanted to show you the other way that you could have done the code and

130
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,090
some of you might have done.

131
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,990
So we've got here press enter to continue.

132
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,590
Dot, dot, dot.

133
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,220
We could have popped it in like that.

134
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,740
And then this next one would print a new line.

135
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,490
Anyway, I'm just going to leave it there for the moment.

136
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,610
I'm going to save that.

137
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,760
Come back in and recompile when I go ahead and press play.

138
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,050
We get the same thing again.

139
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:23,530
Ah.

140
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:27,760
You see, it's got a gotcha in it straight away because there's a space between them.

141
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:33,820
If we have a look here in the code, there's a space just here that's included because it's literally

142
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:37,180
a space that's one of the characters within.

143
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,550
So you'd have to remove that to fix it.

144
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:46,540
Now, I don't like this type of code because much like your functions that you end up writing should

145
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,890
really only do one thing.

146
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:52,360
This print line function is doing two things.

147
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:56,650
It's both welcoming the player and giving them an instruction.

148
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,570
So my mind, it's much better to have these as separate functions.

149
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:07,240
This one's saying Welcome to Bull Cows is welcoming the player to the game.

150
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,630
This one is giving the player an instruction.

151
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,980
They're doing two separate things.

152
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,310
So they should be separate items are going to receive that's.

153
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,750
Go over into unreal.

154
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,200
Just stop the game, Mac, recompile it.

155
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,020
Make sure it works after changing things around.

156
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:31,900
And in general, I would very much recommend that when you made one change, especially early on, do

157
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,330
check that it's working as you'd expect it to.

158
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:37,960
After that one change, rather than trying to do a lot at once.

159
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,190
And there we go.

160
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,570
That's working exactly how I'd expect it to.

161
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,240
How are you guys getting on?

162
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:47,110
Did your code execute first time, just as you expected it to?

163
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,180
Or did you come across any Niko's.

164
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:54,760
Please share your discoveries over on the forum and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
