00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,840
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:12,960
I'd like to take a little bit of step back from coding for a few moments to discuss our game loop.

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,180
First of all what is a game loop.

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:21,930
Well it's the process that a player is going to go through and there will be multiple of these per game

5
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,550
that you end up creating in the future.

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,740
There are games relatively basic.

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,520
So there is just gonna be one core loop that the players can go through.

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:36,650
And I don't want to confuse a game loop with loops with in your code that's different.

9
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:43,080
And what's the player experiences from the moment they interact with our terminal within the book how

10
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:50,220
game is what our core game loop is going to be so why write it down in the first place why can't we

11
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,080
just get down to coding.

12
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,790
Well a lot of you will find that visualizing the process before you start your coding will help you

13
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,230
check your logic.

14
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,800
You may even change how you thought the game might run.

15
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:08,130
When do you take lives away when do you process the guests that they've put in knowing these things

16
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:15,570
and enables you to describe your intended behavior and also check that your code matches that intended

17
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:16,590
behavior.

18
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:23,280
It's very easy to write down a one flow and end up with something slightly different once you start

19
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,010
coding.

20
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:29,250
Now there's no right or wrong when it comes to this if the intended behavior works that's great but

21
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:35,610
you may end up having to go back to your flow chart that you end up creating or indeed modifying your

22
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,430
code again to reflect what you actually intended from the very beginning.

23
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,970
And it also helps define the scope of your game.

24
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,180
And by that I mean when your coding away and you think of a new idea.

25
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,110
Well it's not going to be on that flowchart so it's really going to have to make you think about whether

26
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:57,630
or not you want to include that in the game at which point you can go back to your flowchart and see

27
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:03,940
how putting that new behavior in is going to affect your code.

28
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,370
And with that I'd like to dive straight into your challenge.

29
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:09,390
I'd like you to write your basic loop.

30
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,130
Now there is going to be no right or wrong with this.

31
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:16,550
However I'm going to give you some things to consider see you line up pretty much with what I'm doing.

32
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,610
And so you can follow along of course.

33
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,020
So I'd like you to go ahead and sketch the most basic game loop you can come up with.

34
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:29,080
And by that I mean literally grab a pen and paper or use a flowchart tool if that's something you're

35
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,760
used to.

36
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,700
It doesn't matter how you do it.

37
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,120
It's that you get the idea behind the loop.

38
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,520
The first time I did this I scribbled it down in a notebook.

39
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:43,130
I then formalized it later on and here are a couple of things to think about to get you going.

40
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,990
We're going to have to start the game.

41
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,520
We're going to have to set the hidden word.

42
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,370
We're going to have the prompt for a guess.

43
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,730
We're going to have to receive the gas we're going to have to wait for user inputs of course and then

44
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,770
is the guest correct.

45
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,940
And have they won or lost.

46
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,560
So you can see this is a very simple loop that we're trying to construct here.

47
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,190
We're not worrying about lives.

48
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:09,020
We're not worried about multiple different hidden words or anything along those lines.

49
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:11,140
So go ahead pause video now and give that a go

50
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:14,690
OK.

51
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,900
Everybody welcome back.

52
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,510
Let's go ahead now and look at my basic game loop.

53
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:23,690
You can compare it to yours as well see how similarly you managed to create its sir.

54
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:24,470
Here we go.

55
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:28,610
The first thing we're going to do is print the welcome message.

56
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,220
This is going to introduce the player to the game is going to give them instructions on how to play

57
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,880
etc. etc..

58
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,710
The next thing we need to do is set the hidden word.

59
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,510
Now at the moment and in the next couple of lectures we'll make it hard coded and in the future we will

60
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:48,670
pick that word randomly from a list of ISO Grams remember.

61
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:54,680
This isn't Isaac Graham guessing game and then we're going to prompt the user to guess the word.

62
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,960
So this is going to be quite difficult because it could be any one of thousands of words but then we've

63
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:05,840
got this hourglass symbol that simply means we're waiting for the user input.

64
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,410
And once they have given us the inputs we can assess it.

65
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,580
So is it correct.

66
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,950
That's all we care about at the moment.

67
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,050
Yes or no.

68
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:17,000
If the answer is yes they win the game.

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,250
If the answer is no they lose the game.

70
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:25,430
So this is pretty much as simple as this structure can get is a very basic game and there's only one

71
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:25,890
life.

72
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,790
So you better get it right or you lose.

73
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:33,760
And with our basic loops we're going to be able to start coding now for this very simple game.

74
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,020
Then later on we can expand on it.

75
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:40,940
So remember to show your basic loops over in the forum and I'll see you in the next lecture.
