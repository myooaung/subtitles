I'm welcome to this section where we'll be creating an arcade style tank game.

2
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:11,440
This just means that we won't be focusing on accurate physics based movements.

3
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:16,870
Rather, we'll be focusing on quick, snappy movements and providing the most player feedback.

4
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:22,660
You could think of this game as an entry that you might make for a game jam with some simple but refined

5
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:23,380
mechanics.

6
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:27,790
Game rules and a four game loop with win and lose conditions in the game.

7
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:32,920
You control a small toome tank and you're tasked with taking out all of the enemy turrets around the

8
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,250
level.

9
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:38,530
And this small game has been created with the focus of helping you get a much better understanding of

10
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:44,110
class inheritance, sharing logic between both player controlled and A.I. controlled pawns.

11
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:48,970
My favorite parts implementing components and effects to really bring the game to life.
