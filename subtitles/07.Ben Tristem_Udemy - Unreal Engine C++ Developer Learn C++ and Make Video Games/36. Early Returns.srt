00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,550
Hello everybody and welcome back in this lecture we're going to talk about early returns.

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:13,590
Now the great thing about early returns is it's going to be able to give us some simpler if statements

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,460
at the moment.

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:20,640
We've got this nesting going on and it can very quickly end up very complicated to read even though

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,260
the code itself isn't that complex.

6
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,990
So when running through a series of checks you can do something that's called an early return so you

7
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:34,500
can return from the function call back to the rest of your code early you don't have to run through

8
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,600
the rest of your code and this will help prevent dense nested if else statements.

9
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,080
As I said before it will make our code simpler and easier to read.

10
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:53,140
So let's go have a look at that and then a little challenge to make your code read much better OK.

11
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:58,600
So wherever in our implementation I'm just going to hide my file explorer on the side there and let's

12
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,340
have a look at what we're talking about.

13
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:04,080
So we're really talking about the implementation of our process.

14
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:10,210
Guess so we're coming in here and we're saying the first thing we say the first check that we run is

15
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,690
if the guess has been guessed correctly.

16
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,310
And what we can do after this.

17
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:20,830
So we don't have to do any other checking we don't have to run through the else is we can do a return

18
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,380
and that's it.

19
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,670
It is as simple as that.

20
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:29,880
And what we can then do is we can run through the other checks that we want to do.

21
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:39,220
So here for instance we could go if let's say this then do something else and then return and then we

22
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:43,500
can continue in this fashion on and on so we can then go.

23
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,210
Let's say that and return.

24
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:52,950
And then finally that say we've got one final check something else.

25
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,290
And then finally of course we return afterwards.

26
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:59,650
So this is a very quick way of checking through code.

27
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:02,890
You can see here you're going to check for this.

28
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,180
Then we're going to do this.

29
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:07,120
If that isn't true we just keep going down the list.

30
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:13,600
So it's a nice check that we could go through and equally in this we can decide where we decrement life

31
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,410
as well.

32
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,990
So we just put in the parts where we lose a life.

33
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,710
So let's just say if they've guessed correctly obviously they've won but if they've typed in the wrong

34
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:27,250
number of characters or perhaps they haven't typed in an icy gram we can then remove a life here

35
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:35,740
so that these will not decrement a life for everything else below it will do.

36
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:40,600
So that's one way of managing your code and what happens as you run through it.

37
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:45,810
Now one thing I will point out here is notice that this is highlighted blue.

38
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,680
Now this is a keyword that is reserved.

39
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,340
So this isn't something that you could use in your real code.

40
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:59,190
So I'm going to remove all of this now ready for our challenge and before we do our challenge Let's

41
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,030
just scroll up here where we've got our pseudocode in place.

42
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:08,820
What we're going to run through because that is what we're going to use to help guide us as we start

43
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:13,950
writing the rest of these checks so let's go to your challenge.

44
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:20,130
So the first thing I'd like to do is code in your additional checks using early returns.

45
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,950
Use code or pseudocode for the remaining checks.

46
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:27,010
We haven't gone through the process yet of checking for an ice grab.

47
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,300
So that's something you can use as pseudocode for the time being.

48
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:36,180
And we're in the process where you decremental life if you don't have to do it at the same as me at

49
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:41,490
this point this is where you can start changing your game and making your own do you want to be really

50
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:46,830
harsh and decrement in life the moment they make any mistake what do you want to give them the benefit

51
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:50,980
of the doubt with a warning that perhaps whoops you made a mistake there.

52
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:59,130
Try again and use the earliest pseudocode of flow charts for your reference and of course if you do

53
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:05,970
have any pseudocode please move it to the appropriate place in your code itself as you start optimizing

54
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:12,120
process guess pausing video now and give that a go OK.

55
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,560
Everybody welcome back.

56
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,060
Let's go ahead now and optimize process.

57
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:21,590
OK so let's start by going and grabbing our pseudocode from the top here.

58
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:24,220
Basically all of this is going to be used.

59
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:28,740
We can drag it all the way down to our process.

60
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,760
Guess what Plunkett or where shall I put it.

61
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:40,750
Let's put it just after this first if statement here and I need to make sure that return is here early

62
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,810
return.

63
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,370
There we go.

64
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,250
Perfect.

65
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:49,330
Check if I a gram that's fine that's one of the checks that we've got so I'll leave that in place prompt

66
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:54,170
guess again check the right number of characters prompts guess again that's that is fine that's the

67
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,390
check the right number of characters.

68
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,600
That is what this is here.

69
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:04,710
So let's go ahead and grab this bit of code and pop it right under there.

70
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:07,560
So we know where we are checking the right number of characters.

71
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:12,870
And then of course an early return making sure we spell it correctly.

72
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,070
Sorry guess again.

73
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:19,730
And I think here we should also say let's print out a reminder.

74
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:30,440
So the hidden word is and then format specified letters long and hopefully that won't go off the side

75
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,830
and we don't want to get robbed in that way we want a word.

76
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:38,650
So the hidden word is this long and of course we need to pass in the hidden word length.

77
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,540
So hidden word dot.

78
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,820
Okay.

79
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,630
And our semicolon at the end.

80
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,600
So I think that's fine they're sorry.

81
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:51,110
Try guessing again you have so many lives remaining the hidden word is this long.

82
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:53,780
That's fine prompt to guess again.

83
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,300
That's what we've done so we don't need anything else there.

84
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:01,840
Then we go to go ahead and remove a life and that's this part of our code.

85
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,600
Of course you can retype this if you want to.

86
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:05,990
And I'm a little concerned about this.

87
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,150
I think we're gonna end up with a random number coming down.

88
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:11,870
I think this was a debug line that originally put in so I'm going to remove that.

89
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:16,700
So we just decremental ing the lives and doing nothing else there.

90
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:17,440
That's fine.

91
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:23,240
And we're obviously saying to the user we've lost the life which is fine because the next thing is the

92
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,580
check whether the lives are greater than zero.

93
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:32,480
So let's move that up and just tidy up this bottom bit here okay.

94
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:37,710
It's the next check here is if the lives are greater than zero.

95
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,230
Well that means we're still playing.

96
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:44,920
It's one of these ones just like above that if we check if it is a nicer Gram.

97
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,860
Well if it is a nicer gram we can still be playing.

98
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:54,350
So we really need to check whether the lives are less than or equal to zero so less than or equal to

99
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,020
zero.

100
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:59,850
Then we can say you have no lives left and in the game.

101
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:06,100
Now at this point I would say that if we have no lives left that's fine.

102
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:12,260
And then we end the game something to think about not in this particular game brave end game.

103
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:17,480
This function call that we were doing would actually take the player off somewhere or display a different

104
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,590
screen.

105
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:21,690
They would never ever see this particular state as.

106
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,540
Something to bear in mind with your code flow.

107
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,690
We could quite easily move this.

108
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:34,030
You have no lives left all the way up to the end game itself.

109
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,590
That would be absolutely fine because this is really the.

110
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,990
The screen if it were as it were.

111
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,230
That shows them the end of the game.

112
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,820
In fact thinking of that.

113
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,700
Let's let's do that.

114
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:49,970
Let's assume that we're going to end the game and we will need an early return here as well.

115
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:54,030
Because otherwise any code beneath who still executes.

116
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,210
Let's bring that up into the end game.

117
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:00,300
So we're going to say you have no lives left.

118
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,690
But let's also clear the screen.

119
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:07,020
So let's go ahead and clear the screen at this particular point.

120
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,270
Tell them that they have no lives left.

121
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,170
That's fine.

122
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:14,510
And also we need to tell them what that hidden word was.

123
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:19,740
But I suppose we don't have to tell them but it would be quite boring game if you don't know how close

124
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,160
you were.

125
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:23,970
So the hidden word was.

126
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,140
And then our format specified.

127
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:32,570
And we're going to need the asterisk with the hidden word.

128
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,230
There we go.

129
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,970
So that reads much better to me.

130
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,530
Now I want a blank line in between that and the instruction.

131
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:45,240
So let's go ahead and put a new line in there.

132
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,350
We could also put the new line at the end.

133
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,180
Entirely up to you how you go ahead and do that.

134
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:55,710
But that will ensure that presence to play again comes after this group of texts and there'll be nothing

135
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,800
on the screen when we say you have no lives left the hidden word was okay.

136
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:01,990
So that is good.

137
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,390
I'm liking how that's worked out.

138
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,300
Let's just tidy up the very bottom bit here.

139
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,230
So what's happening at the very end at the very end.

140
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:16,250
We're going to show the player and we haven't actually said this when we were typing in our pseudocode

141
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:23,820
before show player the balls and the cows now because we are actually still playing.

142
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,050
This is where we can instruct the player to guess again.

143
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:32,180
You have and then our format specify our lives left.

144
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,040
Of course we need to include lives in here.

145
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,270
OK.

146
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,980
So we are checking if the lives.

147
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,030
Yep yep yep.

148
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,340
And we're not going to quit the game as such.

149
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,930
So that is fine there.

150
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:47,010
Let's have a closer look at the check.

151
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,450
If I see Graham.

152
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:53,390
So why are we going to say here we're going to say if is ice a gram.

153
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,040
I think that's a good name for it.

154
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,750
Have you come up with what you think is a better name than share it's over in the discussions.

155
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,850
So if is ice a gram.

156
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:05,420
Well the challenge here is to check whether it is an ice a gram.

157
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,990
So we're not gonna check if it is we're going to check if it's not.

158
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:12,770
So then there's gonna be some code in here we might call another function.

159
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:20,110
So here we need to say ah no repeating letters and to guess again.

160
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,730
Hopefully that will fit all on one line.

161
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:25,940
And of course we need us semicolon at the end.

162
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:35,390
Okay now I cannot test this statement at the moment this check because is ice Graham doesn't exist at

163
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:37,890
the moment so I'm going to go and comment.

164
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:41,150
That's how completely I'm going to save my work.

165
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:46,130
And before I check that it's running what I will go ahead and do is just run through my code because

166
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,870
I think I'm actually going to have a problem.

167
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:55,740
Notice and gain does not lose screen or wind screen.

168
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,860
It's actually just end game.

169
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:04,540
So if we run through the first part of where the gas is being assessed if we get it right it will end

170
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:09,190
the game and when we end the game it's going to clear the screen and say you have no lives left.

171
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,360
It's not going to say you have one.

172
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,930
We will never see that.

173
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,310
It'll be too quick.

174
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:19,390
So we need to move these things back down to where we have.

175
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:27,080
If the lives are less than or equal to zero let's go ahead and grab those couple of lines 44 and 45.

176
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:34,600
And in fact 43 as well so 43 44 and 45 if we grab those I'm going to cut them out.

177
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:40,000
Apologies for moving up and down the code but it's something that happens when you read three code you

178
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,460
have an idea you start implementing it and then you realize if we had run that that would have been

179
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,540
a bit silly.

180
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,810
So we can clear the screen which makes sense.

181
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:56,840
You have no lives left the hidden word was this and we're going to do the end game the end game will

182
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,230
simply then say press Enter to play again.

183
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,520
That looks like a much better flow.

184
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,900
Let's tidy up this here and save.

185
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:12,450
Let's go ahead over into unreal compile.

186
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:15,470
So now if we win the game we've lost life.

187
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:21,710
Well let's lose a life first and see what happens when that when that does occur.

188
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:24,140
So we're not checking for ice grams at the moment.

189
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,650
No lives left to hit and word was case presents to black.

190
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:27,230
Okay.

191
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:30,600
That is the behavior that I wanted to have.

192
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:34,130
Now if you decided to code ahead a wind screen little blue screen.

193
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:34,720
Good on you.

194
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,750
That's great.

195
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,770
I'm not going to go for that.

196
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:39,570
I think just those stepping screens would good.

197
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,090
And then we've got cakes.

198
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:41,990
That's the other thing.

199
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:47,690
We've won presents to play again it resets everything now I could set that to also clear the screen

200
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:51,740
to say you have one bit of a difference there when you lose and win.

201
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,110
I'm happy with that.

202
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:57,860
And then the last thing to check is just the right number of letters.

203
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:02,110
There's nothing else that we can do whether we type 5 or 6.

204
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:07,340
Try guessing again you have fireflies remain hidden hidden word is five letters long so I'm gonna flip

205
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:07,760
around.

206
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,160
You have five lives too many.

207
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,930
And the hidden word is five letters long.

208
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,190
That is important.

209
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:16,100
Otherwise it's kind of the wrong way round.

210
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:16,930
So the hit.

211
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,060
So let's tell them.

212
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,480
Oh hold on a minute.

213
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,190
The hidden word is five letters long.

214
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:22,700
There we go.

215
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,230
Or number of letters long.

216
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,940
You have this many lives remaining.

217
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:26,990
Okay.

218
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,690
Yes there is one final thing here.

219
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,980
I've missed an S off the end of letters.

220
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:36,350
Apologies for everybody who spotted that beforehand because they probably screaming at the screen.

221
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:41,780
Anyway I would like to leave you with a little bit of a thought experiment a micro challenge as it were

222
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:46,510
to think about the ordering which these checks happen.

223
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:53,640
If you look at their varying complexity we have three different checks happening before we get criminal

224
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,670
a life.

225
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:59,330
Now what I'd like you to do is think about the order and see whether there is a better order we can

226
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:00,130
put them in.

227
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:07,430
As to what they would be at the moment and also more importantly why might you change the order of checks

228
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:14,200
in your code pop your answers in the discussions I'll be interested to know make sure you share your

229
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:19,900
work as you go looking forward to seeing how your projects are coming along and I'll see you all in

230
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,680
the next lecture.
