00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:05,910
Hello and welcome in this lecture.

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:11,550
We're going to be refactoring our pull trigger so that it's ready for us to add more code into at the

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,670
moment it was getting really out of hands who are going to refactored it to a small function like this.

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,720
That's really much more straightforward to read.

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,090
Let's dive in and see how to do this refactor.

6
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:22,400
OK.

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,120
So we want to put some sound into our game and the place we're gonna be doing this is in the gun when

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:28,660
we're shooting.

9
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,130
That's the first port of call.

10
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,370
I think an ice kind of shot sound and impact sound would be great.

11
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:39,280
The only problem is when I came back to our pull trigger function, I noticed that it has got outlandishly

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:39,640
large.

13
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,170
It doesn't fit on one of my screens.

14
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:45,400
It's also a little bit hard to read and understand where we'd be putting this functionality.

15
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:50,890
So while we take the effort to actually understand what the functionality is here, maybe it's worth

16
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:56,830
doing a quick refactored or pulling out some of this stuff into other methods so that it's not so hard

17
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:57,310
to read.

18
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:03,190
Now, if you go and have a look at this code and try and figure out what the basic things that it's

19
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:08,590
doing, then you'll see that a large chunk of this is actually just set up for our line.

20
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:12,070
Trace this whole chunk from line 28 down to 43.

21
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,930
And what are we doing?

22
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,640
Well, we're getting the owner pawn.

23
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:16,510
Then we're checking it.

24
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,430
They're getting the owner's controller.

25
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,770
Then we're getting the viewport from that.

26
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,740
Then we're getting the end location based on the max range.

27
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,590
And then we're passing in some hit parameters to ignore stuff.

28
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,040
All of this is just set up for our line trace.

29
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:36,220
So why don't we extract that out into its own function here, going to create a new private function

30
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,600
down right at the bottom.

31
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:45,730
After our variables, it is going to be bool return because we wants to essentially replace this call

32
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:52,270
here that returns success with one that just gives us the hit result out as well.

33
00:01:52,870 --> 00:02:00,250
So we're going to do this as something like to call a gun trace function and it's going to have some

34
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,510
out parameters here.

35
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,810
Namely, one of them is going to be the hit result.

36
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:07,420
So hit result ampersand to make hits a reference.

37
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,120
And because it's not a constant reference, we know it's an out parameter.

38
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,200
We call this the hit.

39
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:14,340
And actually, there may be another one that we need here.

40
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:20,650
Namely, I can see that we've got the rotation is coming out of this chunk of code.

41
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,320
And in actual fact, we're negating that rotation.

42
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,620
So what we're really interested in is the shot direction.

43
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,540
So maybe that's what we need to go for.

44
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,900
So I'm going to create an F vector out parameter.

45
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,480
So effecta ampersand and it's going to be the shot direction.

46
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:41,830
These are the two outputs that are going to come from at gun trace.

47
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,370
Now, let's go ahead and create the implementation here.

48
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:53,290
And what we want to do is essentially just copy all of this code into their.

49
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:55,540
See how it goes.

50
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:00,790
And we also want to be checking this shot direction.

51
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:08,550
Take that out there and stick it in just before the end, or maybe just here after we've got our player

52
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,160
viewport.

53
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:13,180
We can set that the shot direction needs to be equal to the negative, the rotation.

54
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:19,210
But it's important to note here that actually we want to be setting not a local variable.

55
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:22,330
So if you put the type here, it's going to be setting a local shot direction.

56
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,760
We want to delete that so that it is setting the shot direction in the out parameters, which actually

57
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,200
means that it's setting the shot direction that we're going to be passing in in the function that calls

58
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:32,410
it.

59
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,690
Same goes for the hits.

60
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:42,160
We need to remove this local hit so that the hits being passed into line trace single by channel is

61
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,110
the hit that was passed into gun trace.

62
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:49,540
And then finally, is there anything else this is to do line which is now not needed?

63
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,280
And also this be success?

64
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,190
Well, we just need to be returning.

65
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:56,210
Be the result of the line tracing by channel.

66
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,680
That is going to be whether or not I can trace has succeeded.

67
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,470
So we have succeeded in making this indentation a little bit less.

68
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,470
We can fit it all on one screen now.

69
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,240
And it's a little bit easier to understand that, yes, all of this is related to getting a gun trace.

70
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:14,980
We can go up to Anggun CBP and we can now set our success up here.

71
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:17,230
So you'll be success.

72
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:23,960
We're going to need to set as the gun trace and we need to pass in some our parameters here.

73
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,800
Still need to declare those somewhere if hit result.

74
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,230
It's going to be one of them.

75
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:36,250
It's just gonna hit and the other one was gonna be an F factor called shot direction.

76
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,250
And those are gonna be passed in.

77
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,220
So we're gonna have the hit first, then the shot direction.

78
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,450
And then semicolon at the end there.

79
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,420
So that's going to make that just a little bit easier.

80
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,410
However, I'm noting we also need the owner controller.

81
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:59,720
And I don't want the gun trace to be responsible for the owner controller or forgetting the owner control.

82
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,310
That doesn't sound like it's the responsibility of a gun trace to do that.

83
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,590
It sounds okay for it to get a hit.

84
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,420
It sounds okay for it's get a shot direction.

85
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,530
But I'm going to draw the line at getting the owner controller.

86
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,480
So for that, I'm going to put it in.

87
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:18,600
Put all of this code into another function, which both of them can call.

88
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,490
So that's going to be a function there.

89
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,760
Tounes returns a controller.

90
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,580
Star.

91
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:33,440
And we're going to call it the get ONA controller, and we can make that a concert as we know, it's

92
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,770
not going meant to change any of the variables on ag gun class.

93
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,760
Let's create that implementation.

94
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,840
Just bring in the implementation from gun trace.

95
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,420
Fix up any indentation if necessary.

96
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:51,800
And we're going to go ahead and simply return the owner.

97
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,850
Control says no need to do a null check here.

98
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:57,800
That null check we do need to do in the function that is using it.

99
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:02,960
So we'll bring that up that we also don't need to set a variable in here.

100
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,730
We can just go ahead and return.

101
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,360
So it's going to be fairly straightforward, I get owner A.

102
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:10,860
But not completely.

103
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,850
And then we're going to set the variable in gun trace.

104
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:18,680
So owner control is going to be get owner controller.

105
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:19,350
Like, so.

106
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:26,970
Which we then do a no return to null early return and gun trace, which, by the way, it needs to return

107
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,240
a boolean because gun trace is returning a boolean.

108
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:36,120
So we can go ahead and return false here, because if we can't get an owner controller, we can't do

109
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,600
a gun trace.

110
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,340
Therefore, we can't possibly hit anything.

111
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:42,730
And then we also need that owner controller further up.

112
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:50,660
Where we have our hit actor, we're doing this take damage, and basically what we want to do here is

113
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,230
get the owner controller right in here inside our hate act.

114
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,570
So if we've hit an actor, we get the owner controller again.

115
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:01,280
Now, I know there's a little bit of gun traces calling get in a controller.

116
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,200
And then we're doing it again if we hit an actor.

117
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:06,260
But that's only going to happen every time we hit an actor.

118
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:12,680
So I don't mind having that recalculated twice because it's just going to make the code that little

119
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,970
bit more readable without having to store variables in state that could get out of sync.

120
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:17,870
So there you go.

121
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:24,200
We now got the owner controller that we need for take damage and our pull trigger is looking much better.

122
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,250
So that's it for this lecture.

123
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:25,800
Quick one.

124
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:30,920
Just refactoring our pull trigger so that we've got a good base to work from in the next lecture.

125
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:31,660
We'll see that.

126
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:37,070
Oh, and it looks like I made a little bit of a booboo here and they get owner controller.

127
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:42,610
If you try and compiler, it won't do anything because this return value is not actually returning a

128
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,190
pointer.

129
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:47,620
So we want to return null pointer in this case straight away.

130
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,390
Basically, we can't get a pawn, then we can't get a controller.

131
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,860
So we return null pointer.
