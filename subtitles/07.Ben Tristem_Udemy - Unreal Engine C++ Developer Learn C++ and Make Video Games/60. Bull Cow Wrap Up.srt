Hello everybody and welcome to the end of the bull cow game section.

2
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,920
We've covered so much in this section.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,200
I bet you had finished it.

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:18,460
Now did you take the last lectures advice and implement your own features.

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,760
One of the best things you can do and I know I sound like a broken record saying this but by applying

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,940
the knowledge that you've already learned you will definitely improve your skills.

7
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,220
So make sure if you've not done that I'm going to say go back and do that again.

8
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:38,580
And we've got a very exciting section coming up for you next where we escape from a building where we

9
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,100
start interacting with the world around us.

10
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,190
So there's so much to cover in that section.

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,550
I can't wait to get into it.

12
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,670
So dive over there now and I'll see you all real soon.
