00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:09,430
Hello and welcome to section 2 where we're going to start building our first game together in C++.
1

2
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:15,520
So this is going to be a simple number puzzle game that we're calling "Triple X" and it's called "Triple X"
2

3
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,520
because it's based around three unknown numbers.
3

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,880
You're going to be hacking into a computer lock of some sort.
4

5
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:26,500
And the idea of the game is to find a valid three number combination.
5

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:32,080
Now it starts pretty easy but it becomes much harder as you keep playing the game as it ramps up in
6

7
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,060
difficulty.
7

8
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,520
And you don't have to follow the exact same storyline as me here.
8

9
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:42,280
You have the opportunity to customize the story. If you want the story to reflect a fantasy setting,
9

10
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:47,840
then there's no problem create your own story as you follow along with me in this section.
10

11
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:52,370
So let's take a look at the game to get a clear idea of what we're going to be building.
11

12
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,500
So here's the game.
12

13
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,100
Here is Triple X. You're a secret agent.
13

14
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:03,400
Breaking into a level 2 server room your super hacker 2000 tells you the following information.
14

15
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:11,980
There's three numbers in the code and the codes multiply to give 18 and the codes add up to 8 as
15

16
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:17,070
the player we have to enter the three code numbers followed by an x.
16

17
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:22,180
So what three numbers multiply to give 18 and add up to 8.
17

18
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:30,580
Well I think it's "3 3 2" let's start with the addition here, 3 + 3  is 6 and 6 + 2 is 8.
18

19
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:36,580
So if we use those same numbers to multiply, 3 x 3 is 9 and 9 x 2 is 18.
19

20
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,160
So yeah the answer is 3...
20

21
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,320
3 2
21

22
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:46,570
And we need to follow the answer with an X and with the correct answer entered it tells us "congratulations
22

23
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:47,450
you're in.
23

24
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:52,840
Now hurry before anyone finds you" and we're immediately thrown into the next level we play the game
24

25
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,380
again.
25

26
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,820
But the levels change we're now in level 3 no longer level 2.
26

27
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,070
The difficulty has ramped up.
27

28
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:03,270
So this is the idea of Triple X if we were to give a wrong answer.
28

29
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:09,510
It's just going to give us a message saying "boom you've failed miserably and died horribly."
29

30
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:13,420
So why start with Triple X instead of hopping straight into Unreal.
30

31
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:18,800
Well we've chosen this game very carefully. It's going to teach you the basics of C++ syntax.
31

32
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:24,220
You're going to be learning all about variables and constants which is important foundational skills
32

33
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:30,400
and you're going to be creating your very own function for the first time that will take an argument.
33

34
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,500
You'll be using the hash include like we've already done in section one that we're going to be talking
34

35
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:40,410
about it in more detail because it's going to be heavily used inside Unreal.
35

36
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,990
And you'll also be learning about other programming structures such as the "if" and "while" statements.
36

37
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,190
So here's a quick peek at our code here.
37

38
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:53,250
Already we're seeing a lot of code that we're going to be writing in the section before jumping into
38

39
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,980
Unreal and trust me Unreal is going to be firing a lot of concepts out to you.
39

40
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:02,610
So we need to just get down and dirty with the basics before moving on to Unreal.
40

41
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,580
So why learn C++?
41

42
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,790
This project's being carefully selected to teach you all the right tools to help you get started without
42

43
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,310
being too complicated.
43

44
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,890
It's really going to set you up for the next section of this course.
44

45
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:20,440
Now the older version of this course didn't have this Triple X section and some students found the learning
45

46
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,030
journey just a bit too steep.
46

47
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:26,440
So it's really worth doing this section. Now by learning C++
47

48
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,840
you're going to be learning a superpower.
48

49
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,310
Now we would call any coding a superpower here at GameDev.tv
49

50
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:38,570
C++ is a super powerful language because it's both high level and low level.
50

51
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:43,360
It covers the very high level like object oriented programming that we'll be talking about in this course
51

52
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:49,340
but C++ also covers the very low level like getting into the details of the bits and bytes.
52

53
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,280
So it's a very broad language.
53

54
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:57,550
And by learning C++ you'll be joining a unique tribe of power users which is pretty awesome, right?
54

55
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:02,890
So finally and quite importantly one of the last reasons to learn C++ is that it's fun.
55

56
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,900
And it's also challenging.
56

57
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:10,690
Now if you think you know enough C++ and can create this game without even doing this section then go
57

58
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:15,270
right ahead and share your results in the community and move on to the next section.
58

59
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:21,070
But if you're a new user, you really don't want to hop into Unreal without doing the section.
59

60
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,660
So I'm going to leave you with this.
60

61
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,770
What's the story of your game.
61

62
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,800
Try and think of a unique story.
62

63
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,090
You don't have to follow the same idea as me.
63

64
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,070
We were breaking into a server.
64

65
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,250
And if you're stuck ask a kid.
65

66
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,420
They have quite vivid imaginations and you might be surprised.
66

67
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,360
And most of all enjoy sharing your stories in our community.
67

68
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,730
So that wraps up this video.
68

69
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:46,510
And in the next lesson Ben's going to be giving you an overview of the code in this game.
69

70
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:49,470
So once you're ready you'll be seeing Ben in the next lesson.
