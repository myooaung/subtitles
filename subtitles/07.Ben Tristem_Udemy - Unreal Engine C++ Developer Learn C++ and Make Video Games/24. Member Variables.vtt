00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:05.460
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.550
In this light show we can go over why we go ahead and declare our hidden word here in our header file

3
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.270
rather than at the top of our C++ file.

4
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.060
This is bad.

5
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.100
We do not do this by the way.

6
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.410
This would make it global.

7
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.930
And we'll find out more in this lecture okay.

8
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.450
So what we're talking about here is making sure that a variable that we're about to use has scope across

9
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.960
our class.

10
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.260
So he can use it in multiple places.

11
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.140
Now we will cover classes in much more detail later on won't we go ahead and create our own.

12
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.580
But for the moment we're just going to go over some of the surface details.

13
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.620
Now the hidden word that we're working on needs to be used across multiple functions in the bull Cal

14
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.480
cartridge class.

15
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.500
Now what is going to happen in the background is that the ball Calcutta is class creates an instance

16
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.100
of the ball Calcutta is it is instantiating it.

17
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.870
Now one of the key things here is that then the hidden word can then be used across that instance.

18
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:15.540
But not only that it enables us for every instance of the ball cow cartridge say we had multiple terminals

19
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:22.980
within our game they would all be able to have different hit and words if we just put it at the top.

20
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:23.900
That's not going to happen.

21
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.610
Not only is it bad practice but it means that the hidden word will be the same across all of those instances.

22
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.430
Let's have a closer look.

23
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.960
OK everybody welcome back.

24
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.130
As we've already identified we want to be able to use the hidden word itself outside of this function

25
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.130
and in several functions as well.

26
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.040
Now one of the things that you might instinctively do when you're new to coding is just keep elevating

27
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.160
it.

28
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:54.360
So if we instead of having the F string hidden and word declared and initialized here we could lift

29
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.470
it all the way up to the top here.

30
00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.710
Now this would actually work.

31
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.860
It's bad practice but it would work.

32
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.660
We would then be able to access hidden word in every other function that's here.

33
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:13.950
The problem is if we were to have two games two instances of the ball cow cartridge running and one

34
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.670
started after the other one the hidden word in the one that began first would change and we were intending

35
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.070
to have different hit and words and this would apply to other things like health or life in other games.

36
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.040
So it's important to recognize the fact for elevating it to this level is no good.

37
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.780
We want to make sure that we're declaring our hidden word across the class in a way that means each

38
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:49.050
instance of the class that uses hidden word has its own unique hidden word so we wouldn't do this here

39
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.070
at all.

40
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.140
What we need to do is declare it.

41
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.650
So just this part here what the type is and what the variable is we would need to do that in the header

42
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.440
file itself inside the declaration of the class because of course we can declare it globally in the

43
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:13.920
header file as well then with in here we can start assigning a value and initializing hit and word when

44
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.180
we play the game.

45
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.510
So we definitely do not want it at this level in our code.

46
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.190
Let's go ahead and declare and assign it in your challenge okay.

47
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.200
So your challenge is to declare and initialize the word.

48
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.800
So first of all declare the hidden word in the header file.

49
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.110
We've already shown you where to do that.

50
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.180
There's a comment saying your declarations go here.

51
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.850
So that's where you're going to declare it.

52
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.460
Remember to include its type as well.

53
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.590
And then what I'd like you to do is initialize the hidden word within the begin play function pause

54
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.360
with the R now and give that a go

55
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.720
Okay everybody Welcome back.

56
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.530
How did you get on.

57
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.590
Well let's go ahead now and declare and initialize our hit and word okay.

58
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.830
Everybody welcome back.

59
00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.340
Let's go ahead now and first of all declare our hit words.

60
00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.650
I'm going to cut and paste this so I get it absolutely right into the head of.

61
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.830
So where our declaration is go that's already defined.

62
00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.750
That's the wrong level of indentation so let's bring that back safe.

63
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:16.180
Okay.

64
00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.570
The header files all sorted without declaration of an F string hit and work that's fine.

65
00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.500
Let's go back to C++ file.

66
00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.640
We do not want to do anything here.

67
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.950
But what we are doing is when we begin play This is where we want our hidden word to be initialized

68
00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.460
with a value a hidden word equals text Kate.

69
00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:38.810
That's fine.

70
00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.900
Make sure you get your capitalization correct.

71
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.980
Otherwise that won't work.

72
00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.780
Now before we go over into our and check how code works we've got some red squiggles that usually means

73
00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:53.630
something's gone wrong and now I can see what it is can you guys see what's going on here.

74
00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:59.120
Well if we have a look at the error it doesn't really highlight what our issue is.

75
00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:05.070
But notice there's another red squiggle on our curly brace that's also not the error.

76
00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.280
The problem if we look down our code is that we've got a curly brace being opened here but it never

77
00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.960
being shut.

78
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:17.430
So during all the moving around that has been forgotten or deleted accidentally.

79
00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:18.570
Now that's all worked.

80
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:24.320
We can go ahead and save our file and then I'm going to go ahead and open up the ball Cal game.

81
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.850
OK.

82
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:30.600
So once that's open clicked compile otherwise it won't work.

83
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.050
The compiler has completed successfully yes go ahead and play the game.

84
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.110
So welcome please present to continue.

85
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:43.660
Now of course when we go ahead and press enter you have lost and it will continue saying that until

86
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.370
we've typed in the correct word which in this case is cake.

87
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.680
So that's fine everything is still working how we expected it.

88
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.220
So that's fine everything's working as we expected it to.

89
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.640
We haven't broken our code which is great.

90
00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:58.750
How are you guys getting on.

91
00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:04.120
Did you manage to both successfully declare and initialize the hit and word in the appropriate place

92
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:09.970
this time please share your thoughts and any issues you had whilst doing this over in the discussions

93
00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.310
and I'll see you will in the next lecture.
