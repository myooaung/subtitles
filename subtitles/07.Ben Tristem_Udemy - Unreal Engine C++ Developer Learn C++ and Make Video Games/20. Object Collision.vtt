00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:09.460
Hello everybody and welcome back in this that show we're going to have a look at collisions and colliders

2
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.900
on an object at the moment.

3
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.020
We are stuck in the room even when the door is open.

4
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:15.400
This isn't ideal.

5
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.290
Now there are four main options and we'll run through them all in this lecture.

6
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:26.110
The first one remove the collider at the moment there's absolutely no need for that doorframe to really

7
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.710
have a collider because it is pretty much flush with the rest of the wall.

8
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.660
So we could get away with just removing it altogether.

9
00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.690
So that is first option the next one is using something called complex collision.

10
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.360
And what that does is it takes the actual geometry data and makes a collider out of it.

11
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:50.740
This is incredibly expensive and is very bad practice especially as your scenes get larger and larger.

12
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.270
You can use it in a pinch as a as a stopgap perhaps.

13
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.340
But one of those things is you'll probably forget that you've done it.

14
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.630
And then later on you could end up with an issue especially if the option or the objects sorry that

15
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.930
you've applied the complex collision to is something that's repeated many times in your scene.

16
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.850
That's something you want to try and avoid.

17
00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:22.900
We could use BSP and convert it to a static mesh and then use that as a hidden item in the game nested

18
00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:24.960
towards the door frame itself.

19
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:31.930
Giving us an actual collider so we can bump into something now as well as using BSD and converting them

20
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:32.810
to a static mesh.

21
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.680
If you happen to have an object that is really simple you could simply use some of the primitives that

22
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.360
come along with unreal.

23
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.820
And then you don't have to go through the process of creating a BSP.

24
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.970
Now this is an option and it's actually quite a good option if you don't have the final one and the

25
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:58.420
final one here is get the artists to provide assets in the first place with the collision and look at

26
00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.040
that.

27
00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.990
Unreal is jumping into my presentation eager to be shown.

28
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.220
So let's hop on over into one real.

29
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.860
Hello everybody and welcome back in this lecture.

30
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.550
We're going to sort out the issue we have with our doorway here.

31
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.100
You may not realize it but when we go ahead and press play I'm sure you've tried this.

32
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.790
You can't actually get out the door at the moment and that's because of the collision not on the door

33
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.240
but on the door frame itself.

34
00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.580
Now we can go into our models folder so let's make this a little larger again and have a look at our

35
00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.870
door frame.

36
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.260
We go ahead and do that.

37
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:40.660
What we will see if I just drag this down and dockets over here and stuck it over this side we have

38
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:41.850
our door frame.

39
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:48.310
And if we go to our coalition and look at the simple collision which is what it will be using we can

40
00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.240
see here there's a green box going around our entire model.

41
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:58.450
But there's nothing on the inside that's because convex shapes that shapes that have gaps or holes in

42
00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.350
them are more difficult to calculate on a physics level.

43
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:08.110
So a simple collision will be like this which just puts a bounding box around the outside of the geometry

44
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.550
and doesn't cater for anything in the middle so we physically can't get through this.

45
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.890
It's as if it was a solid block.

46
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:22.210
Now if we use complex collision here we can see what the extra or rather not use complex collision but

47
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:28.900
actually have a look at what the collision looks like on a complex level we can see that it's much more

48
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:29.260
detail.

49
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.660
Let me turn off simple to make it easier to see but it has far far more geometry on it.

50
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.680
And that's an issue that's a big issue when it comes to performance of your game with everything you

51
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.570
just set to use complex collision which we can do as a solution.

52
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:52.930
That's not ideal because that doesn't get to the root problem of the fact that it doesn't have correct

53
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.420
collisions set up.

54
00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:00.010
Now there are a couple of ways that we can approach this the very very simple way for testing purposes

55
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:09.930
would be on the right hand side under the details to scroll down until we get to the collision and then

56
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.080
down here the collision complexity.

57
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:21.890
If we change that from Project detail to use the complex collision as simple and apply that save and

58
00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:27.530
then go back to building escape when we press play we should be able to escape.

59
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:28.420
Hurrah.

60
00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:29.120
Excellent.

61
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.830
Do we need to do anything else.

62
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.290
Well I'd argue yes.

63
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.270
I've seen many tutorial out there where that is where they end it.

64
00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.160
And that to me is no good because if he did that throughout the rest of your game as I've mentioned

65
00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.990
it would be incredibly slow.

66
00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.600
This is after all physics we're talking about.

67
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.490
And if you've got many things in a scene having to have physics calculations done on them all the time

68
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.650
that can really slow down your game.

69
00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.990
Now if this was the only item that had a physics object on it then absolutely fine it probably is not

70
00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.790
going to have a performance.

71
00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.450
But it's not ideal.

72
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.600
What's another way that we could solve this.

73
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:09.440
Well the door frame itself the way that it's nested within the wall I would argue we actually don't

74
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.950
need collision on it at all.

75
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.840
That is another thing we can do.

76
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.560
So we can go back to our doorframe.

77
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.640
But what we can do here is we can simply remove parts of our collisions so we can go to a collision

78
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.010
and just remove the collision from it.

79
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.300
So now it doesn't have any collision.

80
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:33.290
If we have a look over here there's zero elements in our array 0 array elements absolutely fine.

81
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:40.470
So we can save that once again and go back to our building escape press play and we can still escape.

82
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.730
And the reason for that is that our object doesn't really need collision on it.

83
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.990
But let's say for argument's sake say it did.

84
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:52.770
How could we get a better low polygon version of our collision.

85
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.890
Well there is a very simple straightforward way of doing this.

86
00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.880
You do it when you create the model in the first place.

87
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.380
That's the key there.

88
00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:07.650
However if you don't have a model available or you don't have access to the model at that particular

89
00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.010
level you don't have the program to open it up.

90
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.130
You can actually use BSD.

91
00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:17.820
It's relatively straightforward to do we could come in here and we could create another geometry brush

92
00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:22.650
drag a box in and then we would just have to set it up to be the right size.

93
00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:28.290
I think it's around 20 by oh how deep is it.

94
00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.480
Let's go for 40 and tall is about two.

95
00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:37.050
So then it's just a matter of matching these up in our world.

96
00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.170
And this probably goes the other side quite well.

97
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.900
Yeah OK.

98
00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:46.710
So we can probably make it a bit narrower and you can see here this is a bit old TDC in many ways but

99
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:55.410
we could very quickly go ahead and I'm holding down the wrong button and we go use out duplicate it

100
00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:00.930
pop it over the top and then finally have another one at the top here and what we can then do is join

101
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:08.510
all those together so lift this other one up move it to roughly the middle and rotate it round just

102
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:12.730
to finish this off and it's going to need to be a little bit smaller.

103
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:20.490
So I'm just going to adjust its local z value until it's roughly right and then pull it back across.

104
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:22.150
It doesn't have to be precise.

105
00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:27.020
Now I can select all of those brushes so I'm going to hold down shift as I select them.

106
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:32.390
Now I might not be able to in the viewport so I'm going to do it over here so have all three selected

107
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:40.730
I can create a static mesh and I can call this a collision so let's go to our models themselves and

108
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:50.960
in here I'm going to call this door underscore frame coalition forgot the other underscore creates a

109
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:56.860
static mesh and then when it comes to the door frame itself it's collision we leave off and our door

110
00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:02.240
frame collision if we go ahead and show simple collision we can see that it also doesn't have anything

111
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:12.650
at the moment but what we can do is scroll down and now set this as use complex as simple and you can

112
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:15.170
see this is a much much more simple match.

113
00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:21.950
And if I had bothered to line things up a bit better then it would be even lower polygon which is awesome.

114
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:28.580
So that is a way of creating a lower collision but the ideal way is to have it ready and waiting for

115
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:29.210
you.

116
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:32.630
So what we'll do now is I'm going to close that down.

117
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:37.060
That's not ideal either but it does get you out in a pinch.

118
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:38.410
This is still in our scene.

119
00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:42.020
So it's asking us Are you sure you want to do that so let's delete it.

120
00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:46.610
We'll see that in a moment a bit more detail with these two objects that we're going to replace.

121
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:47.870
Let's go ahead and delete it.

122
00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.140
There are references in the undo history.

123
00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:51.500
That's absolutely fine.

124
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:52.040
So there we go.

125
00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.360
That's gone right.

126
00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:55.820
What's the better way of doing it.

127
00:08:55.850 --> 00:09:01.220
Well you will find against this lecture I have remade the door and door frame.

128
00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.170
So let's go ahead and import those now.

129
00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:03.370
OK.

130
00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:08.680
So before we go ahead an important if you have your models named like this it's going to asked overwrite

131
00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.560
them in which case you can go Yes boom done.

132
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:17.840
However I'm going to just name mine underscore old for the moment oh let's make sure I'm naming them

133
00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:18.880
that.

134
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:19.770
OK.

135
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:25.370
Now the reason why I'm doing this is because I'd like to show you how to replace an asset rather than

136
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:28.850
just overwrite overwriting nice and simple.

137
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:30.470
So those are old ones.

138
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:33.040
It also has attacked them with the word old.

139
00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:36.990
So we know we can delete them in the moments and let's go and import.

140
00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:42.280
So I have created for you some static meshes with the right names to begin with.

141
00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:46.970
It's against this lecture to download that zip file and you can just import them straight into your

142
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:47.270
scene.

143
00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:52.190
I'm going to open these now and of course we haven't changed the name of the model itself.

144
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:54.210
So this is absolutely fine here.

145
00:09:54.240 --> 00:10:00.100
I'm going to just say e no to all because I don't want to overwrite anything and auto generate collision

146
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:04.470
you can leave off at this point and just import all here we go.

147
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.510
So I have my doorframe here.

148
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.790
That's the thing that I want to alter.

149
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:13.950
I have done one for the door as well but it's pretty much the same anyway.

150
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:19.260
So we've got our and doorframe here you can see it's named it twice which is just the way the naming

151
00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:20.530
convention works.

152
00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:22.920
I'm going to come in here and rename it.

153
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:27.010
So it doesn't have all of the extra bits and bobs on it.

154
00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:33.020
Now notice here that it also doesn't have any materials on it yet as well so I'm going to set that up

155
00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:40.990
by double clicking on it and going to the material slots and selecting door frame material so it's all

156
00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:44.570
ready to go save materials applied.

157
00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:46.310
We don't need to worry about that.

158
00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:47.470
Okay.

159
00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:51.860
So how do we go ahead and swap this out for the old one.

160
00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.980
Well we can simply click on the door frame itself.

161
00:10:54.980 --> 00:11:00.260
Go down to the details tab and we can see here it's currently got the S.M. doorframe old attached to

162
00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:00.890
it.

163
00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:07.630
And I can simply swap it out with the S.M. doorframe and we're done are we done.

164
00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:07.840
No.

165
00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:08.960
There's another one here.

166
00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:15.470
So this is one of the things where you if you must absolutely make sure that you've got all the new

167
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:19.740
ones on what you can actually do here is starts the deletion process.

168
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:25.730
So if I go to the old doorframe actually in my content browser and go to delete it you can see that

169
00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:30.530
there are references in the undo history and they're still being used as still reference the memory.

170
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:36.920
Which means they're in our scene or attached to something in the in terms of their classes and things

171
00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.200
like that.

172
00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:39.660
You can force delete.

173
00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:42.800
No I don't recommend doing that as a blanket.

174
00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:47.930
I'd recommend finding where the other instances we know it's here because we've got two of those objects

175
00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:51.860
in our scene and I can swap that static mesh out as well.

176
00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:55.220
So that's that's done is it.

177
00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:58.080
Well let's go ahead and see cannot delete it.

178
00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:02.120
So there are references in the undo history the undo history to be clear.

179
00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:06.550
That's absolutely fine and assets referencing the pendant deleted assets.

180
00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:09.160
We got a redirect to what is that.

181
00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:10.580
Well let's go ahead.

182
00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:17.330
Let's replace our references with the static meshed doorframe.

183
00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.630
Replace our references.

184
00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:20.660
Do you need anything else.

185
00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:21.350
Are you sure.

186
00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:26.490
Yes and then we can go ahead and save selected.

187
00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:31.290
Now we have these redirect as here you can actually see those.

188
00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:37.650
If we go to our filters tab and go to other filters show redirect as we can see that there are quite

189
00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:43.830
a few things in this folder and you may want to tidy these up from time to time and you'll have to go

190
00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:49.830
to the next level up so our models folder is within the contents browser and then we can right click

191
00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:57.570
and fix up redirect to zoom folder and what that will do is it will just make sure that anything that

192
00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:59.540
is being used is still there.

193
00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:03.110
And now when we have a look all of those extra ones are gone.

194
00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:08.400
So some to just bear in mind and we can come back in and turn that off at any point to make sure that

195
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:13.800
everything is nice and neat again but to redirect to is simply if you've moved something it make sure

196
00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:19.740
that if some other bits of code is referencing or another model is referencing it it knows where to

197
00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:22.190
go find where you've moved it to.

198
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:29.140
But if you let real deal with fixing up your redirects then you know that everything is okay.

199
00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:34.110
Now I'm going to do the same here for my door I'm going to import it since my scene imports all we've

200
00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:39.990
got the new door there I'm going to go into it I'm going to dock this at the top here so we can see

201
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:40.940
what's going on.

202
00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:47.490
We've got two material slots here Element Zero element one it's great that I don't know which ones which

203
00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:49.860
if I open this up.

204
00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:50.460
Yeah.

205
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:51.110
Here we go.

206
00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:51.860
Wood.

207
00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:53.490
So it's just hidden away.

208
00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:59.560
What the name was so I know that I can go here and select my door material and this is the brass material

209
00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:00.070
itself.

210
00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:01.960
So there we go that's reconstructed.

211
00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:06.910
We can save we can come back in and we can swap out the door as well.

212
00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:11.230
And what we would do in a second is just have a look at the collision shapes that have come across.

213
00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:17.950
So I just need to change out this door for that one and the same over here and I should be able to delete

214
00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:19.450
my static door old.

215
00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:23.570
I'm going to update my references to the new one click Okay.

216
00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:25.220
That's absolutely fine.

217
00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:26.780
Save selected.

218
00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:27.750
Here we go.

219
00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.370
I'm gonna change the name here to be sensible.

220
00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:36.500
And then I'm going to come out and I know I'm going to have to fix up redirect.

221
00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:37.990
So I'm going to do it straight away.

222
00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:41.840
Okay so everything there is done.

223
00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:44.060
The only thing we now need to do is make sure that it works.

224
00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:50.690
So let's have a look at our door frame and go to our simple collision and you can see how much more

225
00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:53.220
simple that collision is.

226
00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:56.900
And that has been made over in blender to fit our door.

227
00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:02.030
And you can see here is rough and ready as well it comes out the top ever so slightly so it could be

228
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:08.570
a wee bit neater but it's just the same as creating those BSD essentially and then putting them into

229
00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:09.500
our scene.

230
00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.120
So I'm going to close that down there.

231
00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:16.370
Everything should now work when we press play I should still be able to leave the room.

232
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:17.150
There we go.

233
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:17.780
Perfect.

234
00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:22.830
And that's the way that your collisions should be set up within the file itself.

235
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:27.540
So you don't need to worry about setting up default collisions in our scene.

236
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:32.700
So that's everything done that I'm just going to build my scene so that that lighting gets all sorted.

237
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:33.590
And there we go.

238
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:36.510
Everything is in its place now.

239
00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:40.680
Out of those four different ways which one would you pick for your door.

240
00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:47.110
Obviously if you've imported my asset here you have everything set up did you go and create your own

241
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:48.090
with BSD.

242
00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:55.400
It's entirely up to you how you go ahead and do that and it would depend on what your needs are.

243
00:15:55.420 --> 00:16:01.690
I would probably argue that no collision is better in this particular case because we can't squeeze

244
00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:02.380
out of the room.

245
00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:04.860
That's the only thing we worry about.

246
00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:09.880
And then having the collision on the object to begin with is just something the game has to calculate

247
00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:13.630
even though it doesn't really have an effect on the game the door itself.

248
00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:18.030
Yes that does need a collision on it so that when we open it we can walk through.

249
00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:24.040
However the door frame itself I'd question whether it needs one in the first place anyway as the end

250
00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:29.410
of this lecture look forward to seeing how your world is coming along and I'll see you all in the next

251
00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:29.800
lecture.
