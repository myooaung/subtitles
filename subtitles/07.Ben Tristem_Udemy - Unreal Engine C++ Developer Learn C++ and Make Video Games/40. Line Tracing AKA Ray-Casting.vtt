00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.760
Hello everybody and welcome to this lecture on line tracing a.k.a. recasting and it's an incredibly

2
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.080
useful tool is used for all sorts of things in game development.

3
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.870
Whenever one objects interacts with another say a bullet being fired from a gun knowing whether it's

4
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.660
hit something a laser trip wire.

5
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.810
And of course what we are using it for is figuring out when we reach out do we come into contact with

6
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.490
something that we can pick up so that one of the ways of visualizing this is imagine we're shining a

7
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.730
virtual laser into the world just like our debug line is doing.

8
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:45.360
But unlike our debug line we will have the ability to interrogate what has actually been hit.

9
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.050
We'll have a look at the different view modes within the editor to visualize what we can interact with

10
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:57.120
and what we cannot and we will be simulating physics on objects that we want to lift.

11
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.920
And by doing that it will also set the objects channel.

12
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.780
And that's what the ray caster we used to focus on the things that we want to lift and ignore everything

13
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:06.740
else.

14
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.410
So let's dive over into unreal.

15
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.780
Okay.

16
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.650
So as you can see here we've turned on physics and I think it's zero g at the moment let's just start

17
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:16.250
playing again.

18
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.330
I've had lots of fun just running into the cone and seeing what it does.

19
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.870
Occasionally it doesn't quite work yet.

20
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.030
We haven't set it up to do so but there we go we've got it going we've managed to give it enough inertia

21
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.050
to go but we haven't set everything up yet for that to fully work.

22
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.810
Now obviously that now has dynamic shadows rather than what it had before.

23
00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.040
But we've also got a couple of different view modes.

24
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.730
And by the end of this lecture we'll be able to visualize our world in different ways not just in the

25
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.130
standard that we used to so far.

26
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.820
And this is a view about collisions what the player can cannot collide with and how those collisions

27
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.700
would actually happen.

28
00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.910
OK.

29
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.210
So if we eject ourselves when we're playing we can see that we've got the green line coming out so far.

30
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.420
Now I must impress upon you at this point that that isn't recasting.

31
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.490
That's just a debug line that cannot interact with anything in our world.

32
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.890
However when we recast we will be able to do that.

33
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.960
So what we need to think about is how we're actually going to line trace in our real world.

34
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.870
Now let's have a look at some of the different views that you can have.

35
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.380
This would give us a better understanding of how things are actually set up if we go to the area at

36
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.280
the top left of your viewport where it says lit.

37
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.680
If we click on that we've got a couple of options.

38
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.160
Note here we can get back to the lit with old and the number four.

39
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.830
That's quite useful to be able to hop back to that type of view.

40
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.100
Now there are two that we're going to have a look at here player collision and visibility collision.

41
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.180
Now on my particular computer I came across this bug.

42
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.910
I don't know if you want to call it that but when you select player collision it goes completely black

43
00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.430
and the same with visibility collision which I know that reading on the forums some of you have also

44
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.920
had the same issue.

45
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.460
It's relatively straightforward to fix if it happens to be the same issue.

46
00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:15.950
If you go to the show menu just to the right of that go all the way down to developer and turn on ray

47
00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.150
tracing debug the moment we do that we get our lovely colors that we want.

48
00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:27.860
So anything in this view that has a light sign that's a static mesh.

49
00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.260
We've got our movable doors here.

50
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.040
They are also static meshes but they are in fact movable and we can collide with it.

51
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.540
We've got on collision volume over here that's a one type of green and in a moment we'll see a another

52
00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.060
type of green.

53
00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.100
Now say we were picking up this cone and placing it into our collision volume.

54
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:55.550
Well at the moment if we select it we see that it is in fact a static mesh if we go to the details it

55
00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.430
is static is set.

56
00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:05.690
So but if we select some of the other options like stationary or movable we see that it will change

57
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:11.570
its color accordingly and you'll see in a moment it will change its color to another type of green very

58
00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.480
similar to this one but slightly bluer in its hue.

59
00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.490
And one of the great things about this view is that if our doors didn't have a collider on them we'd

60
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:25.630
be able to see that because we would just be able to see straight through outside into our world.

61
00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.380
However these doors do have colliders on because we made sure that it does now.

62
00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.960
We don't have that much complex geometry in our scene but there is a difference between player collision

63
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.110
and visibility collision.

64
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.700
You can see here there's a lot more detail when it comes to the visibility collision than there is when

65
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.550
it comes to the player collision.

66
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.710
Now one of the main differences between having this visibility collision and the player collision is

67
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:58.340
much more simple version is that we can choose when recasting into our world which one of those we actually

68
00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.200
use.

69
00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:05.690
So for this particular instance say we did have something our side of the door turned up the visibility

70
00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.110
collision back on and our player was supposed to reach it.

71
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:14.510
If we hadn't set up the right casting properly we would find that you wouldn't be able to actually pass

72
00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.780
through the door and be able to reach through it at all.

73
00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:24.020
And what we will end up saying when it comes to the cone over here is that our debug line if that intersects

74
00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:30.530
with any part of this collision if they occupy the same space that would pretty much be classed as grabbing

75
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.090
it so just to summarize.

76
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:39.900
This is a great view of how the world is interacting how the line traces will her work how physics will

77
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:45.930
work within the game itself as well and we'll help you debug things as if you've forgotten to add a

78
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.540
colliders to something for instance.

79
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:55.350
So the great thing about this view is it enables us to view the world how the ray caster or how the

80
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.720
physics engine is going to see it.

81
00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:58.030
Okay.

82
00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:04.440
So if we go over into the modes and go and pick one of these other default objects that we can bring

83
00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.450
in let's just bring a cylinder in and now you'll notice as we put it in the world obviously it snapped

84
00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:10.490
in half way.

85
00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:17.310
But if we try and move it it'll whilst the game is playing it's not going to let us do that.

86
00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.080
So let's stop.

87
00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.020
All the changes that we've made.

88
00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.780
You've got to watch out for that.

89
00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.730
They've gone so let's drag that cube in.

90
00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:28.590
Lift it up ever so slightly.

91
00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:35.450
Now look at its color now we already experience with the cone a few moments ago that we could change

92
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:41.380
it to stationary or even movable and we can change its color because it now acts differently.

93
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.160
However there is another way of doing it in one click.

94
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.530
Let's say this cube here we wanted it to respond to physics.

95
00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:49.760
We scroll down.

96
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:52.700
We've got this tick box here simulate physics.

97
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:59.050
And notice that it's a very similar green but not quite as the collision volume itself.

98
00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:04.100
It's nice that there are similar colors that you know that these two things can probably interact.

99
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:08.680
I wouldn't say that's true of every color though right now at the moment.

100
00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.600
We've done that what we can do is simulate it's mass.

101
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:17.360
Now this is great because it means we can give our player a mass let's say 60 kilos and we can give

102
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.770
both of these objects.

103
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:25.220
If we wanted to move them both into this collision volume for instance that means that let's say we

104
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:32.180
set both of them at 40 which means that a single one won't open the door but two of the objects will

105
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.310
because we're heavier than those two things combined.

106
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:40.340
So we can change the mass here and let's say it's a 10 kilos for the vote.

107
00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:46.670
Now when we press play we can't quite interact with it as has well as we want to at the moment but we

108
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:48.880
can push things around.

109
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.350
If they were light enough.

110
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:55.670
That's not how we want to do it we want to be able to just pick it up and then move it across probably

111
00:07:55.670 --> 00:08:00.920
with the E key or something like that and we'll talk about key binding in an upcoming lecture.

112
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.570
Now we're just going to come out to play for a moment now.

113
00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:09.800
The moment that we set the simulate physics if we scroll back up it automatically becomes movable at

114
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:10.830
the same time.

115
00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:16.280
You can't have something being simulated in physics and not be movable it's just not possible.

116
00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:23.180
And also if we scroll down and go to the collisions section we've got a collision presets here we drop

117
00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:28.370
that area down and we can see here the object type says physics body.

118
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:33.890
Now I've seen a bug in the past where that hasn't updated so you might have to click off and back on

119
00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:35.780
again to see that changed.

120
00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:39.530
But we've got an object type here that is physics body okay.

121
00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:42.720
So there are two types of filtering that we can do.

122
00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:46.250
One is filtering by the type of line trace that we're doing.

123
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:50.070
And one is by the object type itself.

124
00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:55.740
So we can say which type of objects we can pick up because of a certain object type.

125
00:08:55.740 --> 00:09:01.470
So if we make sure that only the physics body ones are the ones we're able to pick up we can set up

126
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:05.930
our scene in such a way that the player will know what they can interact with.

127
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:10.560
So if we have a look at some of the other objects in our scene if we click on the door that's a world

128
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:11.150
dynamic.

129
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:16.480
If we click on this floating sphere oh we need to scroll up or down to see where that is.

130
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.180
That doesn't have anything on the collision.

131
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:23.970
It's also we're not going to interact with that we select the cone just behind again that is a world

132
00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:24.720
dynamic.

133
00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:30.360
And the cube these physics bodies are the ones that we'll be able to filter with and say those are the

134
00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:39.450
object types we can pick up so if we're going to use this cube and the cone behind we can see here visually

135
00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:41.550
that the cone isn't set up right.

136
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:42.700
We click on it.

137
00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:45.660
We can scroll up slightly to hell.

138
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:50.220
I thought we were going to scroll down and simulate physics and obviously give it a mass.

139
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:55.980
And again I don't really care what the masses at the moment but we can set it to something like 10 or

140
00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:57.340
even just 1.

141
00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:02.700
Now earlier on when you saw it flying around the level that was just me having a bit of fun I turned

142
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:07.680
off enable gravity and then of course you can run into things.

143
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:12.470
And if it responds to us which sometimes it doesn't.

144
00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:16.780
But never mind it will end up floating slowly around the room.

145
00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.000
Did I actually set it right.

146
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:18.300
Yes.

147
00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:23.240
Well it looks like it should start flying around the room and it is also set to movable.

148
00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:29.460
And don't forget that we've added something into our scene and we've changed the mobility of our cone

149
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.820
so our lighting will have to be rebuilt as well.

150
00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.470
So I'm going to go ahead and do that now.

151
00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:36.020
There we go.

152
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:36.920
That's all done.

153
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:43.250
And I'm just going to try once more to interact with Okay so we can interact with the cube.

154
00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:44.610
That seems to work well.

155
00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:47.190
Can we interact with this and get it flying around the room.

156
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:48.480
Yes we can.

157
00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:48.740
OK.

158
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:51.730
So I had lots of fun with that earlier.

159
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.820
If you could make it zero g couldn't you.

160
00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:56.730
I'll be very interesting.

161
00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:01.380
Of course one of the things we haven't discussed yet is you can also put limits to the player how heavy

162
00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:02.780
a thing you can pick up.

163
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:04.660
So this box is quite large.

164
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:12.030
Perhaps if we set a limit to the player here they can only pick up something that's 20 or 30 kilos and

165
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:18.450
this one's 50 even though it's a physics object in the world that may be able to be knocked over or

166
00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:24.840
blown around by some other forces the player won't be able to interact because they might have a maximum

167
00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:26.850
amount they can pick up.

168
00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:33.480
Now if we go back to the collision area here now the physics body is just one of many object types.

169
00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:40.520
If we go to our project settings and go to collision if we go to the dropdown here we get a list.

170
00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:42.350
It's not exhaustive.

171
00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:48.270
Not all of them are available within this list but this gives you a little bit of an idea of the type

172
00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:53.910
of collisions that we can have in fact we've got physics body just there for instance.

173
00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:59.100
So this is really useful information but also on more complex games which are certainly isn't.

174
00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:05.160
But you can add new object channels so if you wanted certain things interacting with other things then

175
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:10.230
you could do that by adding specialized object channels but that's a bit too advanced for what we're

176
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.550
doing in high level.

177
00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:12.650
OK.

178
00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:15.030
So that's about as wrapped up.

179
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:21.180
But there's one thing I want to do and that's go back to my cone and turn gravity back on and let's

180
00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.640
set that back at 10 kilos for the moment.

181
00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:30.180
If I didn't do that I'd forget and I'd be wondering later on why a cone floating around my seat.

182
00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:30.930
Okay.

183
00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:33.810
That's it for this lecture and I'll see you all in the next one.
