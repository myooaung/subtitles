00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:11,580
Hello and welcome in this lecture, we are going to be spawning our rifle at runtime from our character

2
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,110
class in C++.

3
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,090
Let's dive in and see how it's done.

4
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:23,480
OK, so we want to get our gun spawning as a child of the shooter character, the first point of call

5
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,200
is to be able to spawn that actor from within another actor.

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,220
We're gonna do this at runtime.

7
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,620
We're gonna do a begin play because that's the way you Carneys do when you spawning actors need to do

8
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:34,280
it at runtime.

9
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:38,420
And the way we're gonna do this is we're gonna get hold of the world first.

10
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:43,040
So get world and then we're going to call a function on get world.

11
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,840
By the way, world and level are synonyms.

12
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,770
So what we're actually doing here is we're going up to the level and saying, hey, level, can you

13
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:54,050
create as an actor because lact is essentially belong or live in a level.

14
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:58,280
So we're then we're saying, you know, spawn ACTA for me, please.

15
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:04,850
And this is a Sporn actor that takes a template.

16
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:10,280
You can say, I want this actor that I'm going sporn to be of type a gun.

17
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:19,490
And for that to work, we're going to need to have an include up here hash include for the gun to H.

18
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:29,760
And then we're going to take in an argument and the argument to spawn is actually can be a class type.

19
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:33,770
So by default it will go ahead and spawn the C++.

20
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,180
But here we want to spawn the blueprint child of this gun.

21
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,850
So we need to figure out what that's going to be.

22
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,630
That needs to be hooked up in blueprint.

23
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:47,060
Can't be hooked up here in C++ is not easily the best place to do it.

24
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:48,230
Is it blueprint?

25
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:53,930
So we're gonna do an O to go to the head of file for our shooter character and we're going to add in

26
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,430
a new property here.

27
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:04,300
To allow us to configure the class that we should be pointing to in order to spawn an act, which blueprint

28
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,820
class should we be spawning from this shooter character?

29
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:12,520
We're going to have it as an edit defaults only.

30
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,050
Why edit defaults?

31
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,380
Only because we don't want to be able to edit this at runtime, because it would give a false impression

32
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:25,870
that you can change what type of gun we're using at runtime, whereas Biggin plays already been called,

33
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,460
that gun's already been spawned.

34
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,730
And so it wouldn't actually update anything.

35
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,930
So we don't want to make it editable to give not give people a false impression of what can be done.

36
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:41,500
And then here we're going to use a macro called T sub class, of which you may or may not have come

37
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,400
across before.

38
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,220
And T subclass of is a template.

39
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:49,030
So we use these angle brackets again.

40
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,350
And we wanted to say a subclass of gun.

41
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:59,650
And basically what this means is that it allows blueprint's to restrict the classes that we can select

42
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:05,470
from to only the classes that are subclasses of the gun and C++ class.

43
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,840
Now, this isn't going to be a pointer because we're not pointing to an actual instance of the gun.

44
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,460
What we're getting here in this variable is a class itself.

45
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,370
In this case, it's a blueprint class, but it's still a class.

46
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:25,990
So what we're going to want to call this is the gun class just to make it super clear that this is not

47
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,730
actually the gun itself.

48
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:32,110
We do want another you property here to store the gun.

49
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,810
And that is going to be not an edit default.

50
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:42,400
So basically, we don't want to make this a visible property at all, but it's going to be an a gun

51
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,070
pointer.

52
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,870
See the difference?

53
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,660
One of them is t subclass of gun.

54
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,040
The old one is a gun pointer.

55
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,770
And this one is the actual gun.

56
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,230
That's once we've created an instance of the class.

57
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,520
That's where we're going to store it.

58
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:03,880
So let's go on over in to our shooter, see P and finish off this begin play where we are spawning things.

59
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,870
So we're gonna have gun equal to get World Spawn Act a gun.

60
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:14,690
And the argument are gonna pass in here is the gun class, which we're gonna be setting over a blueprint.

61
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,830
So let's go and try and compile this.

62
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:18,910
It may give us some arrows.

63
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:19,420
Let's see.

64
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:23,500
I have the message log open with the compile log.

65
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:28,240
And sure enough, we're getting some errors over here in the head file thing, undeclared identifier,

66
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,120
because we need to forward declare the gun.

67
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:35,460
So I'm just gonna do this at the top because in two places I'm going to say class.

68
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,220
A gun like so.

69
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:45,520
And just a reminder for declaring like this means that we can keep at compile times down by not including

70
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,410
too much in a heavy header files.

71
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,010
Let's try recompiling.

72
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:49,390
See.

73
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,240
Looks like that was the only error.

74
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,720
It's now compiled successfully.

75
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,900
Let's go ahead and hit play and see what happens.

76
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:56,470
Exit.

77
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,850
Have a look at our.

78
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,640
We basically want to have a look at the message lol, which I don't have open.

79
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:07,630
So let's go to window and developer tools and have a look at the output log and see if we have any errors

80
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:07,780
here.

81
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:08,140
Yes.

82
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,840
Spawn Act failed because no class was specified.

83
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:11,230
Sure.

84
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,570
No classes specified because we didn't configure it yet.

85
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,800
In Blueprint.

86
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:18,280
So this I'm gonna give as challenge to you to hook up the gun.

87
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,760
Find the property in our character blueprints.

88
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,660
Set it to the correct gun and test that it spawns.

89
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,650
Pulls a video and have a go.

90
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:27,550
Hey, welcome back.

91
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:36,220
So let's go over to our shooter character, BP, and find the property which should be on at the roots

92
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:40,780
or the class defaults, go into details and under shoot a character.

93
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:47,410
You can see we've got a rotation right here, which we have configured and we have got our gun class,

94
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:52,120
which is a dropdown which allows me to choose between the gun being the C++ gun.

95
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,280
And here's where a naming convention comes in handy.

96
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,700
The things prefixed with BP underscore are the blueprints.

97
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:00,340
So we want AB BP underscore a rifle.

98
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,510
Go ahead and select that.

99
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,510
Compile save.

100
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,650
Go over in to the scene and hit play.

101
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:11,770
Now, hopefully we have not got any errors about about spawning a gun.

102
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,420
The gun should have spawned.

103
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,180
Okay.

104
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:20,170
And to find out if it has we can f eight and have a look in the world.

105
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:20,680
Outliner.

106
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:26,200
If I make the world outline a little bit bigger, I can search for the BP underscore rifle.

107
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:26,920
Hurray!

108
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,330
We've got a BP and a school rifle.

109
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:33,490
The moment it's in the middle of nowhere and it's not correctly child it that's gonna be the subject

110
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,780
of the next lecture.

111
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,560
So I will see you there.
