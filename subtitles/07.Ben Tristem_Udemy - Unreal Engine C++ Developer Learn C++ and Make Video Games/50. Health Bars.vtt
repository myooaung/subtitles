00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:05.720
Hello and welcome this lecture.

2
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.290
We're adding a health bar, as you can see in the bottom left here.

3
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.620
We're also making our player a lot tougher than the enemy so that we can go round and actually shoot

4
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.400
up lots of enemies and kill them off before our health depletes.

5
00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.050
Let's dive in and see how to make that health bar.

6
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.900
So the moment we've got no way of knowing whether we have enough health left as a player, how long

7
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.040
have we got left to play based on our current amount of health?

8
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.120
Now, let's do this.

9
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.730
I would like to introduce a health bar to our Hudd.

10
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.420
So we're gonna do this by going over to Hudd widget.

11
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:43.540
If it's not already open on your editor, we're going to look for in the Pallett the progress bar and

12
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:44.740
bring in this progress bot.

13
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.060
And why a progress bar?

14
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.490
Because actually it has all the attributes of a health bar as well, namely that if we scroll down in

15
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:58.020
the details, pain to the percentage, then you can see that by changing that percentage, which is

16
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.950
actually a number between zero and one so slightly confusingly named, you can see that we get our bar

17
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.150
fill up and drain away.

18
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:12.070
So what we're really gonna want to do is start at a percentage of one and then drain it down until we

19
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.830
reach percentage of zero, which point our player is going to die.

20
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.960
So that's the aim.

21
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.480
What I want to do here is also go ahead and change the Phil style.

22
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.550
So, again, to fill it up a little bit and then look at the fill image and change that.

23
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.100
See if we can change that tint.

24
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.310
To something like a bit of green, typical health color there.

25
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.300
And then just make it super obvious that we've got here is indeed health.

26
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.820
I'm going to add a tax block, label it health, and I'm going to go and stick that next to our health

27
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:46.150
ball.

28
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:47.200
Like so.

29
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.700
And then selecting both of these components, I want to anchor them to the bottom left.

30
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.330
So they move with the bottom left edge of our screen.

31
00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:57.410
So that's what I'm going to do.

32
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.660
It's gone and changed.

33
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.130
The anchor defaults and I match again to move them both a little bit closer to that bomb left edge.

34
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.250
And I'm going to compile this and let's go and have a play with full screen.

35
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.850
You can see the HealthPartners right there at the bottom left.

36
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.540
So obviously, it isn't currently representing our health at all.

37
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:23.570
So to do that, what we're going to do is expose a function from Ashu to character CVP to Blueprint

38
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.840
so that we can get this in the Yeonji widget.

39
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.730
So I'm basically going to copy the blueprint pure that we have for is dead.

40
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.860
But instead of returning a boolean we're going to return a float, which is going to be this percentage

41
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.510
between zero and one.

42
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.880
Not technically a percentage more for fraction but hey and we're going to call it the get health percent.

43
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.790
And we all are going to want it to be both blueprint pure and const, because it shouldn't.

44
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.130
When we call it change this class in any way.

45
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:53.570
Then we're going to go ahead.

46
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.150
Control shift p create the implementation.

47
00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.380
And what we want to return is the health as a percentage here.

48
00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.840
So think about it.

49
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:02.870
Little may change for you.

50
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.050
How would you do calculating health here as a percentage of the total health care?

51
00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.690
Welcome back.

52
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.670
So let's see if you had a go.

53
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.730
It'd be health divided by Max Health.

54
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:14.940
As simple as that.

55
00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.060
Because when we have our max health, it's gonna be one.

56
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.740
When we've got zero health.

57
00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:19.760
It's going to be zero.

58
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.380
And everywhere in between.

59
00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.200
So let's go back over to the editor and compile.

60
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.300
Then we're gonna go over into our HUD UI and somehow we need to get hold of that character.

61
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.470
So what we're gonna do is go to our progress bar and then scroll down to where we had that percentage

62
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:37.100
property.

63
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.650
And next to it, because here's a button called Bind.

64
00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.990
If you drop down that and create binding.

65
00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.510
And this again, create a function whose job it is to get that percentage value.

66
00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.380
And every time this returns a different value, it's going to update the UI.

67
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.290
So that's fairly straightforward.

68
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.290
It's called get percent.

69
00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:00.440
Let's give it a better name when I click on it, go to the details and rename it to get health like

70
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.730
so.

71
00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.660
And then what we need to do is somehow get hold of our character.

72
00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.640
Now, the way we can do this is first of all, this UI is attached to the player controller.

73
00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.090
So already we can get hold of a play controller.

74
00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.870
And then from the play controller, we can get it's controlling porn.

75
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:22.460
And in fact, if you just search for porn, you can see that there's a get owning player porn, which

76
00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.650
directly does this.

77
00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.610
It goes ahead and gets the owning player.

78
00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.650
Then it gets the porn that is controlling.

79
00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.830
And then from there, what we need to do is a cast to the shooter character in order to have access

80
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.420
to the function we just created.

81
00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.890
And then from there, we can get the health percent.

82
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.910
And we can just go and funnel that in to our return node and make sure we passi in our execution pin

83
00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.130
from the cast shooter character.

84
00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.520
They're going to go ahead and compile and save that and hit play.

85
00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.680
And what we should say is a healthy 100 percent.

86
00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.020
And then going down as we get shot, I was a little bit slow to see that I'm going to go and do that

87
00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.660
from the main level viewport hit play Health Bizer one.

88
00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:05.660
Then it goes to half.

89
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:06.620
Then you die.

90
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.980
So that's all happening a little bit too quickly.

91
00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.540
So I'd like to challenge you to increase only the player's health, not the allies health.

92
00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:20.360
I want to have the feel of the level B that you two shot kind of kill the enemy, but then your player

93
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:26.450
has a lot more health and it takes a lot more shots off the A.I. to actually get you to come down because

94
00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:27.830
you're a big, strong hero.

95
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.600
So the idea here is to create a child for the player.

96
00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.700
So this is going to be a child of the character class, but not just of the character class, probably

97
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.010
already of that blueprint class.

98
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.030
You're going to have to override a few different variables, namely the max health.

99
00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:45.800
It's gonna be higher for the player.

100
00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:51.440
And maybe you want a different mesh to differentiate you from all those enemies around you.

101
00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.980
There was a video and see if you can have a go at this challenge.

102
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:57.290
Okay, welcome back.

103
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:03.170
So we're going to go to the content folder and we're going to find ourselves the character who got BP

104
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.810
shoes character.

105
00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:09.530
I'm going to right click on that and I'm going to create a child blueprint class here, which is going

106
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:15.320
to be a BP underscore player, Chuter character like so.

107
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.180
And now opening up this blueprint is going to have all of the same properties of its parent blueprint

108
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.800
because those were already set in the parent.

109
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.290
But now we can choose to override a few things.

110
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.470
The first thing I'm going to overwrite is the mesh.

111
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:28.400
So we're starting off.

112
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.470
This is a red mesh thing that's good for the enemies.

113
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.000
But what I would like is the green mesh for my hero.

114
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.610
So it's going to be super obvious that he's a different guy.

115
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:44.990
Then we're going to go over to the roots or to the class defaults and change up the max health.

116
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:50.270
So I want him to have roughly 10 times as much health as the enemies in this level.

117
00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.400
So I'm going to go ahead, compile and save that.

118
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:56.800
And then one more thing we've got to do is go and change our blueprint.

119
00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:04.850
So we're going to go and find the BP KMEL game mode and we're going to change the default porn class

120
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:11.810
from the BP shoe to character to the BP player shoots character because we've already got Chuter A.I.

121
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:12.860
placed in the world.

122
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.780
And then we're gonna go ahead and hit play.

123
00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.750
And you can see we've got ourselves a different character.

124
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:19.100
He's got a different look.

125
00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:23.410
And when he's getting shot at, we're getting the health ball coming down slowly.

126
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:28.880
And I can two shot kill off the enemy, but it still can be quite challenging.

127
00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:31.250
If you place enough enemies in your scene.

128
00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:32.300
So that's it for this lecture.

129
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:39.040
We've seen how we can add a health component with binding and with a progress bar.

130
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:44.390
Components in the next lecture were going to be looking a little bit again at animation in order to

131
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:48.320
get our player able to aim up and down with the mesh.

132
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.130
I'll see that.
