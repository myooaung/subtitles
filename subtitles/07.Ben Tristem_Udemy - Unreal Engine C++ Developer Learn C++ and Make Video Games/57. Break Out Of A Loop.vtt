Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.270
In this very quick lecture I want to talk to more detail about getting out of loops.

3
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:16.300
We've already come across continue which will just start the next iteration of the particular loop that

4
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.920
you've continued from.

5
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:18.630
But let's have a look.

6
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.740
How we can break out of a loop as well and why we might want to do so.

7
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.300
So we have a great example here of why we might want to do that.

8
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.630
So why aren't we getting our bulls and cows.

9
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.620
And first of all we continue if we happen to have a bull cow count and then the for loop goes onto its

10
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.090
next iteration.

11
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.920
However here what we can do is break.

12
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.380
And then it means we're not wasting any of our iterations.

13
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.960
Once we've already found a cow.

14
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.370
Now I know some of you will be scratching your head at this point saying well don't we need to check

15
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.020
all of the letters.

16
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.520
Well let's go and have a look at that.

17
00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:01.030
And a case by case basis OK everybody so let's go ahead and have a look at a little example here.

18
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.730
So let's say that the hidden word is set to sink and the player guess is iced.

19
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.320
Now what a code is currently doing is it's looking at the first index.

20
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.800
So in this case the eye in ice and comparing it to the s.

21
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.040
Now in this particular case I is not equal to S.

22
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.980
So it's not a bowl at all.

23
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:29.160
And it goes on to the next for loop in our code then the next letter we compare.

24
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.620
I once again against the I N Sync.

25
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:38.410
Now this will increment the number of cows and ideally it should stop there but nothing in our code

26
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:39.560
says to stop.

27
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:46.120
So we end up with it checking against the N and the K which is completely wasted efforts.

28
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.100
So how do we go ahead and solve that.

29
00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.110
Well we put in the break.

30
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:56.260
Now let's go and have a look at our code and what will happen with a continue and what will happen with

31
00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.210
a break visually.

32
00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.560
OK.

33
00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:59.560
So we've come across.

34
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.380
Continue and this is what continue does it goes to the bottom of the for loop that it's part of.

35
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.930
And then our code here it just reiterates until the guests index is less than the guess at length.

36
00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.100
And if we use continue in the second for loop you will see that it still does the problem that we've

37
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.760
currently got.

38
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.930
It will just keep going through even though we may have found a cow.

39
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:29.080
However if we go ahead and use a break it will come out of that for loop and onto the next section of

40
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.640
code.

41
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.990
In this case there is no next section of code.

42
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.660
So it goes straight back to the initial for loop and then we continue iterating around.

43
00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.260
So all we need to do to prevent that from happening is put in the brake.

44
00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:43.590
And there we go.

45
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:44.410
As simple as that.

46
00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.120
So nice short lecture for you and I'll see you all in the next one.
