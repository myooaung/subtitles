Hello welcome to the video.
1

2
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:12.020
So for users of Linux you're going to have to build Unreal Engine from scratch in order to use it on
2

3
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.910
your platform because there is no Epic Games Launcher at the time of recording and you cannot use that
3

4
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.680
to download a pre-built version of the engine.
4

5
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.490
If you're on Mac or PC you may want to skip this video altogether or go through it at fast pace just
5

6
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:26.870
to see what you can pick up.
6

7
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.760
The only reason you'd want to build the engine from source on Mac or PC is if you have a specific
7

8
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.400
reason. For instance you're making a modification to the engine and you want to rebuild it from source.
8

9
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.320
So if you have an interest.
9

10
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.980
Watch it.
10

11
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.650
Otherwise if you're not on Linux just skip on to the next video.
11

12
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.960
So Linux users how do we do this.
12

13
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.850
Well I've linked you in the resources to the article about building Unreal Engine from source.
13

14
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.010
I'm going to take you through most of it step by step.
14

15
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.420
But the first thing it says is you need to download the Unreal Engine source code.
15

16
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.960
So let's click through to that.
16

17
00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.670
The way that we're going to do that is as follows:
You have to be an Unreal Engine subscriber so make
17

18
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.900
sure you've got an Epic Games account just like the Mac and PC people we need an Epic Games or Unreal
18

19
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.150
Engine account. Number two, make sure that you have a GitHub account and then you're gonna need to link
19

20
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.450
those two together.
20

21
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.790
All right.
21

22
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.640
Now the way you link them together when we go to https://github.com/EpicGames what you will
22

23
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.700
find is if you're not a member of the Epic Games repository anybody can become a member and you'll see
23

24
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.120
how in a minute if you're not a member you're going to see there's something like sign up and third
24

25
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.010
party there may be other things when you get to it.
25

26
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.530
But the point is unless you see Unreal Engine in one of the repositories in this list you're not signed
26

27
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.850
up for Epic Games yet.
27

28
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.720
So what you need to do is follow the instructions under sign up.
28

29
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.200
If you click it to sign up here's the URL: github.com/EpicGames/Signup
29

30
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.640
.
30

31
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.910
Now I'll tell you what to do or at least I'll give you yet another link to the final instructions you
31

32
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.070
need over on the Unreal Engine website.
32

33
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.530
I'll give you these links in the resources to make your life easier.
33

34
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:56.660
It tells you what you need to do.
34

35
00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.880
You need to go to GitHub, make sure you've got an account.
35

36
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.440
You need to go to Unreal Engine.com and then within Unreal Engine it'll tell you how to get to the
36

37
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.700
bits you need to link those two accounts together.
37

38
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.710
All right so I'm going to leave that to you because the instructions will change a bit over time and
38

39
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.060
it's really not difficult it's just a question of linking those two accounts from within your Unreal
39

40
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.980
Engine account.
40

41
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.270
Once you have done that the proof of the pudding will be when you sign in to GitHub then things will
41

42
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.780
look different.
42

43
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.290
I'm gonna go ahead and sign in and be back with you in a second.
43

44
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.070
You may of course need to enter a two factor authentication code when you're logging in to get up.
44

45
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.480
Probably worth turning that on on you'll get an account.
45

46
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.800
Anyway the point is that once you are a member of the Epic Games repository and signed in to your
46

47
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.510
GitHub account, you're welcome to follow me on GitHub by the way github.com/BenTristem
47

48
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.180
then you will see this UnrealEngine.
48

49
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.530
So this is the repository we are going to need if we click into that.
49

50
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:49.230
Here it is.
50

51
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.550
This is the Unreal Engine.
51

52
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.540
Now we're actually going to be taking a specific version of Unreal for this course which is 4.22
52

53
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.860
.
53

54
00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.270
But I'll show you in a moment on the terminal how we get to that and how we do it.
54

55
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.760
All right.
55

56
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.450
So let's go and look at the steps involved.
56

57
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.610
We want you to build Unreal Engine from source.
57

58
00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.920
The first thing before we go any further is you need to do this.
58

59
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:14.760
You need to install "g++" which is the compiler that we're going to need on Linux, "gi"t which is
59

60
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.880
for access to git and GitHub and "make" which is going to be the thing that you're going to use to
60

61
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.560
actually build the Unreal Engine.
61

62
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.640
And we're going to put in "-y" on the end to say "say yes when we're prompted."
62

63
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.390
So this command "sudo apt install g++ make -y" is going to install everything and
63

64
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.380
then we're going to run a command like this who's just gonna say that we're going to clone a single branch
64

65
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.710
which is talking about the fact we're taking the 4.22 engine.
65

66
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:45.530
So this is weird syntax but "--single-branch --branch" etc..
66

67
00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.860
All right.
67

68
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.220
And I'll put this exact syntax in the lecture description that you can copy if you wish.
68

69
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:58.230
And then we're going to provide it with either an HTTPS version of the repository I'll show you that
69

70
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.470
in a minute back at GitHub or we're going to use something called SSH.
70

71
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.050
I'm going to show you HTTPS because it's a bit simpler.
71

72
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:10.170
Then you're gonna go to GitHub and create a personal access token. Then you're going to go into your 
72

73
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.390
Unreal Engine directory once this is pulled all this stuff down into into your onto your machine.
73

74
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.070
Then you going to run a few other scripts etc..
74

75
00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.510
Okay so there's a whole bunch of steps.
75

76
00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.610
Let's take them one step at a time let's get this one done
"sudo apt install g++ git make -y" I'll
76

77
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.570
do that with you now because it's going to take a few moments then we can press on with all
77

78
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.140
this GitHub stuff and then I'll leave you to complete the challenge all right.
78

79
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.180
So what we need to do is open up a terminal.
79

80
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.190
You may already have some of these things installed but we're gonna assume that you haven't.
80

81
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.890
Okay.
81

82
00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.180
So we're gonna "sudo" which means "super user do".
82

83
00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.930
I'm just gonna widen the terminal a little bit for you so you can see things.
83

84
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.190
Super User do apt which is a package manager install which is going to install things it's gonna install
84

85
00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.880
a list of things.
85

86
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.710
g++ the compiler git which is as I said where you're going.
86

87
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.190
The way that you're going to get the code from Unreal Engine and make which is going to you to build
87

88
00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.670
the Unreal Engine when it's down and we're just gonna say yes to the prompt that comes up.
88

89
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.870
OK.
89

90
00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.340
If you don't want to say yes if that doesn't feel safe to you just leave it off.
90

91
00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.360
Doesn't matter.
91

92
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.710
You put in your password for your machine and then at some point if you don't have that "-y" you
92

93
00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.100
may just be prompted to hit yes or return.
93

94
00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.610
Right.
94

95
00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.920
Happens to have worked without the "-y" so that's great.
95

96
00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.640
So all those prerequisites are now installed we now have the things that we need.
96

97
00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.980
So the next line we're gonna need to do is we need to do a git clone which is going to take what's on
97

98
00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.890
that GitHub website and put it down to our computer.
98

99
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.120
We're going to say single-branch you've got to type it exactly as I am otherwise it won't work.
99

100
00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.010
"git clone --single-branch".
100

101
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.830
Okay.
101

102
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:42.150
And then another space --branch where you specify the branch which is 4.22.
102

103
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.520
Now we're gonna need to go and copy the link.
103

104
00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.320
So when you're at "github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine"
104

105
00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.260
It doesn't matter what you've got selected here on the branch on the left because we're overriding that
105

106
00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.950
in the terminal.
106

107
00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.560
It doesn't change the URL in any way.
107

108
00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.410
We want to take either the URL at the top or from clone or download.
108

109
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.730
We have a choice between HTTPS which is the same as the URL at the top basically.
109

110
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.720
Or SSH, SSH if you know about that,
110

111
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:12.920
go ahead and set it up. We actually have a separate course on GitHub and git altogether it's called 
111

112
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:13.280
"Git smart."
112

113
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.510
You can check that out from us for us and that takes you a lot more room into a lot more detail about git
113

114
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.770
.
114

115
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:22.760
But for this course we're just trying to download the engine in the simplest ways, so use HTTPS.
115

116
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:24.110
In this particular case.
116

117
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.680
All right.
117

118
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.280
So you copy either the URL or this link here under the HTTPS.
118

119
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:32.000
Either way they're roughly the same.
119

120
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.320
And then when we go back to our terminal that's what we want to paste in here.
120

121
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:41.540
So we've got "git clone --single-branch --branch 4.22 https://github.com/EpicGames/Unreal...
121

122
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.560
Engine" and maybe ".git" on the end; doesn't actually matter whether you put the ".git" on the end or
122

123
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:45.740
not.
123

124
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:46.770
Okay.
124

125
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:53.990
When we try and do that the first time round it's gonna ask for our username and our password for 
125

126
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.170
GitHub
126

127
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:59.290
Now you can specify your username and password but if you've got two factor authentication turned on
127

128
00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:02.180
on GitHub you're not gonna be to do that from the terminal.
128

129
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:08.480
So I'm gonna show you one more step would you step three of your challenge and then I'll leave you to
129

130
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.200
see if you can do the rest on your own and show you my solution after the challenge.
130

131
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:19.580
So step three says that we need to create a personal access token with repo access and this personal
131

132
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:24.740
access token is going to replace our password  with a one time password and also mean that
132

133
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.560
if we do have two factor authentication on that we can bypass it on the terminal.
133

134
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.530
All right.
134

135
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:35.900
So what you want to do on GitHub is go to settings and then developer settings which is on the
135

136
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.290
bottom left hand side and then personal access tokens.
136

137
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:45.890
And what we gonna do is generate a new token I'm gonna call it something like Linux Unreal and what
137

138
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:47.120
we need is repo access.
138

139
00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.290
So just click repo and all the sub things will come up.
139

140
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:49.520
All right.
140

141
00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.750
So something like that once you've generated that token it's only going to give it to you once
141

142
00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:58.610
so do make sure you copy it to the clipboard and then this token is what we're gonna use as a one time one
142

143
00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:02.620
off password just for this particular access.
143

144
00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:02.930
All right.
144

145
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:09.830
So I put in my GitHub username  and then I'm gonna put in the personal access token I'm gonna
145

146
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:13.420
paste that in and what that will do hopefully.
146

147
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:14.150
Have you got it all.
147

148
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:14.780
All right.
148

149
00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:20.690
Is this will start happening you will start receiving objects from Epic Games' GitHub. it will take
149

150
00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:25.250
a little while to do this depending on the speed of your broadband. There's three ways you can make this work
150

151
00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:28.940
number one is to use SSH access but you're gonna have to figure it out for yourself.
151

152
00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:33.380
Another is that you just put your GitHub username and password in we're asked here but you only two
152

153
00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:34.990
factor authentication turned off
153

154
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.220
on GitHub. if you want to keep your two factor authentication on and not mess around with SSH then you're
154

155
00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.880
going to need to use this personal access tokens method.
155

156
00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:43.150
All right.
156

157
00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:49.780
So I'm going to let this download and I'll be back with you when that has finished OK.
157

158
00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:50.260
Welcome back.
158

159
00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.470
So so far hopefully you've done the following steps.
159

160
00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:58.330
We've installed on prerequisites we've cloned the Unreal Engine and we used a personal access token
160

161
00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.140
to allow that to get access.
161

162
00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:05.230
So just clear the screen do a "ls" and you'll see that one of the new things we have here is UnrealEngine
162

163
00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:05.550
.
163

164
00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:10.210
Basically that was the entire point of that stuff was to get that directory let's change into it
164

165
00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.310
"cd UnrealEngine" I'm using tab to complete that.
165

166
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:13.720
All right.
166

167
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:18.820
So that is that stage now what we need to do next from within the Unreal Engine is run "./Setup.sh"
167

168
00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:19.950
"./Setup.sh"
168

169
00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:22.000
All of this is in Epic Games is documentation.
169

170
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.980
I'm just taking you through it for simplicity.
170

171
00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:29.650
So the next step is to run "./Setup.sh" once this starts happening it starts updating dependencies
171

172
00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:31.830
etc then you're good to go on this stage.
172

173
00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:38.280
So you will have then "cd"d into "UnrealEngine" and run "./Setup.sh".
173

174
00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:43.060
Now if it asks you to register Unreal file types during this process then just go ahead and do that.
174

175
00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:44.070
That will be fine.
175

176
00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:47.500
All right so I'm going to let Setup.sh run and I'll be back with you when that's finished.
176

177
00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.550
It takes several minutes. All right welcome back.
177

178
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:53.730
So when that process is finished you should end up with something like this "SUCCESS".
178

179
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:56.730
Hopefully you do if you don't go to the community and ask for some help.
179

180
00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.310
And then we'd need to run another command.
180

181
00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:03.150
Make sure that you're in the Unreal Engine directory and then we gonna run another command that's very
181

182
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:06.470
similar and much quicker which is "./GenerateProjectFiles.sh"
182

183
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:12.340
another shell scripts. So two that you need to run "Setup" and then "GenerateProjectFiles".
183

184
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:17.100
If you have any issues hop into the community, I'll put you a link to a dedicated forum thread where
184

185
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:21.870
you can help each other with any issues with Linux let's go back to the challenge slide so we can see
185

186
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:26.730
the overview we're down here now generate project files much faster than the previous step.
186

187
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:30.250
As I look ahead while we wait for that to finish we're gonna be running "make" next.
187

188
00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:34.710
And this is one of the dependencies we installed at the top here and this is actually going to compile
188

189
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:36.030
and build the Unreal Engine.
189

190
00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:40.380
It's going to take a long time as I said earlier you're going to probably want to have about 100 gigabytes
190

191
00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.030
of free disk space for this job.
191

192
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:44.160
Mine took over 70.
192

193
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:51.730
You can add space -j space and then a number which sets how many jobs or threads or cores 
193

194
00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:57.060
strictly I think it's jobs that this uses which may or may not speed it up but by default I believe
194

195
00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.370
at the time of recording make will use as many cores as it can.
195

196
00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:03.240
So unless you have a reason I wouldn't bother just type wouldn't make.
196

197
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.210
All right so let's go back into Linux see how it's doing it's doing great.
197

198
00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:06.440
Right.
198

199
00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:07.310
So it's finished.
199

200
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:10.000
This is what you want to see at the end of the Generate project files.
200

201
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:11.880
Then you want to type "make".
201

202
00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.530
Now once you've typed make something like this will start happening.
202

203
00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:20.060
And once you get to a list of you know "9/30" type of thing then you're on your way.
203

204
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:21.540
This is going to take hours.
204

205
00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:26.070
I suggest you write down the time of day right now if you've started your make so that you can work
205

206
00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:30.020
out how long this thing's actually taking to compile so you can compare notes in the community.
206

207
00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:31.450
That'll be the last step of the challenge if you like.
207

208
00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:35.940
By the way don't be lulled into a false sense of security just when you think it's nearly finished
208

209
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.260
like it's 12/30  the 30 or changed at 50 and then to 600 or whatever.
209

210
00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.490
So just bear with it.
210

211
00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:44.700
Should get there in the end as long as you've got enough disk space and plenty of RAM.
211

212
00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:49.890
I would have at least 8GB, preferably 16 of RAM then this will eventually complete and I'll be interested
212

213
00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:51.060
to hear how long it takes for you.
213

214
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.240
So I'll come back to you when this make is finished on my machine.
214

215
00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.170
Hi welcome back.
215

216
00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.920
So I have unfortunately cleared my terminal but you'll know that the make has finished because it will say
216

217
00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:04.130
it's completed successfully and it will have taken several hours and you'll have a new directory.
217

218
00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.080
So let's change into this new director.
218

219
00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:10.050
We can change the engine by the way when you're at the end of light engine you can push tab a second
219

220
00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:11.790
time to preview what else you've got.
220

221
00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:18.090
So I've typed "cd Engine" and then TAB TAB so see the engine and then working for binaries and
221

222
00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:19.140
then what is it under there.
222

223
00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:23.520
On TAB TAB to see that it's Linux and that's where we want to be we want to be in "Unreal Engine...
223

224
00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:28.040
"UnrealEngine/Engine/Binaries/Linux" and then to open the editor at last.
224

225
00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:35.800
We're pretty much there it's "./UE4Editor" let's go for that and see what happens does
225

226
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:41.050
a bunch of stuff and that is the editor opening now on my machine.
226

227
00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:44.770
It's not going to open because this is a virtual machine and I don't have a sufficiently high version
227

228
00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:50.050
of OpenGL but it will work on other machines other people have verified that. There is a point about
228

229
00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:52.720
this with regards to compatibility which I'll just show you on a slide here.
229

230
00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:58.480
So we've done "make" we've changed into the "Binaries/Linux" at a place we might want make yourself a shortcut
230

231
00:12:58.510 --> 00:12:59.570
on your desktop however.
231

232
00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:05.020
Linux people do that hopefully you and celebrate if the editor opened if you get a Vulcan warning then
232

233
00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:10.090
please update your graphics drivers first before trying anything else make sure you're fully up to date
233

234
00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:16.510
and if it still doesn't work try doing "./UE4Editor -opengl" to switch Unreal
234

235
00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:19.900
into OpenGL there's a useful tip for you.
235

236
00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:20.210
All right.
236

237
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:24.280
And as I said earlier write down the start time and share the build time and your machine specs in the
237

238
00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.560
community forum post I've linked against this lecture.
238

239
00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:31.030
That'd be great fun to compare and show off and say hey my machine only took eight seconds to compile
239

240
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:35.350
it and somebody else said well known to you in six days so it just be quite fun to see how the specs
240

241
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:39.400
vary and determine the build time big and take a breath.
241

242
00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.720
That was a lot of work but it's not so bad once you've done it.
242

243
00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:46.540
It's done for life if you like and are pretty useful and you can feel that sense of Linux Master Race
243

244
00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:50.800
flow flowing through your veins knowing that you've built this engine from source yourself in the in
244

245
00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.040
the right way if you like.
245

246
00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:52.720
Awesome.
246

247
00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.360
So thanks for watching and I will see you shortly.
