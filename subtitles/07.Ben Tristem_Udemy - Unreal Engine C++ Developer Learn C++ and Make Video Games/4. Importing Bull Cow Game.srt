00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:08,330
Hello, everybody, and welcome in this lecture, we're going to be downloading the bull cow assets

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,690
so that we've got everything running and working to start the project.

3
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,310
Now, first of all, we'll be checking.

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:18,890
You have unreal engine four point two, two or greater installed with download the assets from the Udemy

5
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:19,520
resources.

6
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,400
Now, the Udemy resources themselves, you might not be familiar with them.

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,630
So make sure you are.

8
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,120
And they will make sure the project works as well.

9
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:27,800
So let's go ahead and dive in.

10
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,870
I'm going to go ahead now and launch the epic games launcher.

11
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:36,650
And if you don't already have it selected, you can go to the left hand side and click on Unreal Engine

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,230
once.

13
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:43,040
For that, we've got Unreal Engine and I can see I've got unreal engine four point two two point two.

14
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:48,020
If you have multiple engines installed, you will have to go to the library and have a look under there.

15
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,180
I can see that I have an update there.

16
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,530
I'm not going to run that at the moment.

17
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:55,850
That can take a while to do on screen, but I'll probably run that in a bit in the background.

18
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,870
So once we've got everything all sorted there, this may take an hour or so to download.

19
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:02,450
I know unreal engines quite big.

20
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,970
But you will need to make sure you got version 4.0, too.

21
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,300
And then go ahead, click launch and make sure that the engine itself launches.

22
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:15,100
When you first launch it, it will come up with Unreal Ed Unreal, its four point two two point two.

23
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:18,200
This is not how we're going to be loading up.

24
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,730
Our game will actually be double clicking on the ball calvey game itself in order to launch it.

25
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:26,360
And the first time you launch Unreal Engine, it might take a while to open.

26
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,070
But if you get to this stage here, seem the Unreal Project browser, you can have a look at the various

27
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,660
projects that are already in there.

28
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,720
Obviously I've got a few in here already.

29
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:39,380
Yours may look different, including the bull cow game because I've been showing you stuff.

30
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:40,490
So let's go ahead.

31
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,170
Let's close that down.

32
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,390
So that's all done.

33
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,880
The next thing we need to do is download the assets from the Udemy resources.

34
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:47,960
Okay.

35
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:53,600
So when you're watching the video over on Udemy, you may not have the sidebar open if we wiggle our

36
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,260
mouse around.

37
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,650
We've got a coarse content arrow at the top.

38
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,010
Right.

39
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,520
We go ahead and click on that.

40
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:04,130
It's currently lecture 38, but that may change as I'm adding bits in and moving things around.

41
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:09,170
And we have importing bull cow game under the resources will be able to get to.

42
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:13,800
In this case, the bottom one here, the bull cow gained starter kit dot zip.

43
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,920
You'll need to download that to your computer.

44
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,240
It's around twenty megabyte file, so it should not take too long to download.

45
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,480
Once you've done that, we can open up the file.

46
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,660
Now you're going to have to extract this from the CIP file.

47
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,530
In this case, I'm going to extract here to a folder on your computer that you're working on now.

48
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,650
I've got a very specific folder because I've got all of my projects under source control.

49
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:42,340
So I'm gonna go into my repos, into my own real folder and into my bowl cal games.

50
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:48,350
I'm going to click okay there and okay to extract it doesn't really matter where you're putting on your

51
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:48,740
computer.

52
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,170
But this is going to be the folder in which you're working.

53
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,240
And we go and check out that folder now.

54
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,130
Okay.

55
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,680
So I know I just said it doesn't matter where you extract it onto your computer.

56
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:02,750
I'd made the assumption there that no one would try to extract it into their program files directory.

57
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:03,920
Don't do that.

58
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,670
We're not extracting this into unreal.

59
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:10,640
We are just extracting it to a standard working folder on your computer.

60
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:15,260
So whether that's your documents or folder on your computer that you've set up specifically to do this

61
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,480
type of work, that's absolutely fine.

62
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:23,870
And of course, you may have already created a blank repository if you're working with any sort of version

63
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,800
control as well.

64
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,750
That's the sort of thing that we're going for.

65
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,100
And let's get back to it.

66
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:32,840
We can see here that the folder is there and ready to go if we go into that folder.

67
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,540
We can see we've got everything else here as well.

68
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:40,430
Now, all I'm going to do at the moment is make sure that the bowl cal game is working in order to do

69
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:40,600
that.

70
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,050
And this is what I will be doing.

71
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:48,440
From now on, in order to launch my project is double click on the ball cal game, unreal project file.

72
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:55,370
When we do that, it may give you this warning is very likely to the following modules are missing or

73
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:57,650
built with a different engine version.

74
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,060
Would you like to rebuild.

75
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,580
And the answer is going to be yes here.

76
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,110
This will take a few minutes to do.

77
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,780
Depending on the speed of your system.

78
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:06,890
Hey there, Sam.

79
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,670
From the future.

80
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,230
Here's give you a quick message.

81
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:15,200
If you get any build errors while you are trying to open this, then have a look and a lecture that

82
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,570
is coming up in just a bit called Help US to Help You, which will give you instructions on getting

83
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,840
hold of logs in unreeled so that you can ask proper questions.

84
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:28,130
And also, you might find some information in there that helps you solve it for yourself.

85
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,360
Now back to Mike.

86
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:30,470
And here we go.

87
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,130
Once that started going through the game itself, we start loading up.

88
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,180
Won't take too long at all.

89
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,320
Okay, brilliant.

90
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,930
We've got everything all loaded up and we're in our game.

91
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,160
Couple of things that we're going to just do real quick at the moment.

92
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,420
I haven't got it because I've already launched this and unrolls aware of it.

93
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,950
But you may have down in the bottom, right?

94
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,860
It's saying that it's doing something with shaders.

95
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,420
It will take a few minutes to sort that out.

96
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:59,030
On my laptop, it took maybe five to 10 minutes to actually sort out the shaders.

97
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:02,870
So your world might not look quite like this with a lot of colors in.

98
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,370
Instead, it sorts that out.

99
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,710
The other thing that we can do here, just to check everything really is working properly, is we can

100
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:14,090
click on the build button, they'll get rid of these reflexion captures need to be rebuilt.

101
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,070
It's not the end of the world at the moment.

102
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,210
We can do that at any time.

103
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:20,060
But more importantly, I'm going to click this compile button.

104
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,840
This one's going to come back to haunt you if you don't realize it's there.

105
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,260
But if we go ahead and click compile, you should have down at the bottom.

106
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,960
It's saying compiling C++ code.

107
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:37,000
After that's finished, you should see it's a compile complete and that's how we know that everything's

108
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,100
working and structured properly.

109
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:44,260
If that doesn't happen, for whatever reason, give his shout in the queue and ICE will help you out

110
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:44,460
there.

111
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,080
So if you've been following along, brilliant.

112
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,970
We've got to the end of this lecture.

113
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,600
If you haven't and you've just been watching, I've got a challenge for you.

114
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,150
Okay, so your challenge is to go ahead and open the bull cow game.

115
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,320
So make sure you are using unreal engine four point two.

116
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:05,160
So I understand that it may be still be downloading, even though you've got to this point in the video.

117
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:09,930
If it is still downloading, then whilst that is downloading, go and grab the book.

118
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,040
How Game Starts.

119
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:16,230
A kit from the Artemis Resources, extract the files, ready to go and then check.

120
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,430
You can launch the game.

121
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:21,510
Obviously you're going to have to wait for unreeled update, but once that's all done, check.

122
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,880
You can launch the game and then we're good to go.

123
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:24,720
So go ahead.

124
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,560
Pause video now and give Vassago.

125
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,370
Okay, everybody, welcome back.

126
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:36,370
Congratulations on getting the bull cow game installed.

127
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:41,650
Just to reiterate that, when you go ahead and open up your file directory for me, which is all the

128
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:44,720
way down here, I've still got it launched at the moment, has closed it down.

129
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:49,780
If I double click on the Bull Cow Game Unreal Project, it will take a few moments to launch.

130
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,490
Now, if that error comes up again, I'll show you how to dismiss that as well.

131
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,760
It's not an important issue.

132
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,030
Yes.

133
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,160
As so we just go down to the bottom.

134
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,830
Right, click on clear the messages in this log.

135
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:04,780
I'm going to close down that window and simply even go control.

136
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,830
In essence, save or just save current.

137
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:14,050
Once you've done that, you will find that the next time you open it up, you won't get the error message,

138
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,640
which is really nice to have.

139
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:20,980
Now, that's not to say that we should avoid having error messages and just hide the mouse the way that

140
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,430
one is not important.

141
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:28,000
In this case, some here with a quick answer to an frequently asked questions that we get about this

142
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,480
project.

143
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:33,340
Now, some people ask, why are we being given a project, has a bunch of code in it?

144
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,920
Why aren't we building all of this code from scratch?

145
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,780
Now, don't worry, this isn't a precedent.

146
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:43,480
The following sections are all going to get you working from scratch, creating the products entirely

147
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:44,620
on your own.

148
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,330
But in this project, we just wanted to give you a leg up, seeing as it's the first time we're introducing

149
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,710
Unreal for a lot of you.

150
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,960
And Unreeled got a lot of things to introduce.

151
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:59,470
Who wanted to make sure that you had a clear and easy starting point to get started with when making

152
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,030
the jump from pure C++ to unreal C++?

153
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,670
So that's why we've done it.

154
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:09,040
In future sections, you are going to encounter the raw might of Unreal all on its own.

155
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,590
So don't worry, we will get there eventually.

156
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,120
So there we go.

157
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,370
We've got everything sorted and ready to go.

158
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,510
And now we've done that.

159
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:21,480
We can start having a look at the interface as a whole and how to interact with the unreal editor.

160
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,890
And we'll do that in the next lecture.
