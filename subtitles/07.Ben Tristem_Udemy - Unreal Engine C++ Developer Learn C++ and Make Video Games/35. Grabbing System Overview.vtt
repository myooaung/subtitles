Hello everybody and welcome to the grabbing System Overview.

2
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:13.580
In this lecture we're going to outline the end results having an idea of what we're heading for over

3
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.340
the next couple of lectures.

4
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:21.350
Think of the grabber system as being a mini series that we've broken down cut and it's going to be maybe

5
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.280
three or four lectures long in order to complete it.

6
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.400
Now what we're going to do is I'm going to challenge you to think about how it may be done.

7
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.930
I know you don't have all the resources that unreal can offer but maybe just stepping outside yourself

8
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.270
and thinking even if you don't know the right name.

9
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.520
How would I possibly implement this and thinking critically about it.

10
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.340
And now I'll outline afterwards how we'll be doing it in this particular section.

11
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.610
Okay so over and unreal what we want to be able to do is eventually we'll be walking into this.

12
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.780
It will open and what we try and get to the door the door's gonna shut on us.

13
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.370
We know what kind of dynamic we're going for but we need to be able to pick up another object in the

14
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:10.940
scene and place it there an appropriate object which will hold the door open instead so we can then

15
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:11.930
walk out.

16
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.420
Obviously that will also leave the door open pretty useful.

17
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.340
So the first thing I'm going to do just so we've got something in our scene is I'll add let's say this

18
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.400
cone it's going to be a magical cone on the floor that we have to interact with.

19
00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.400
You don't have to pick it up somehow and then transfer it to over here.

20
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.320
And then that will then interact with the collision volume when that interacts with the collision volume

21
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.590
and perhaps if we have a couple of objects.

22
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.510
So if this is a pressure pad we're probably going for white which means that perhaps you have to move

23
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.940
a couple of things over there to equal the body weight of your character and then the door will open

24
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.710
and we will be able to leave.

25
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.430
Okay.

26
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.220
So I'd like you to write down your ideas how you might go about this even if you don't know the exact

27
00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.320
terminology that you would use in unreal.

28
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.200
Just write down how you'd go about thinking critically about how the player can interact with the world

29
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.080
how the object that you're picking up how the player can interact with that how that object can interact

30
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.640
with the collision volume and ultimately how it's going to trigger the door's open.

31
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.200
We're going to have a threshold there obviously of white.

32
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.100
Now use the knowledge you have already.

33
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:26.210
It doesn't matter if you have a deep knowledge or a shallow knowledge you'll be able to add value here.

34
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:31.520
The important thing is that you're thinking about it critically rather than just plowing forward with

35
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.570
one idea.

36
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.400
Always brainstorm different ways of doing something because then you end up with multiple solutions

37
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.750
perhaps for further puzzles in the game as well.

38
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.240
Now think about whether you would use a component or inheritance two different ways of doing it.

39
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.910
Here's a hint either could work.

40
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:55.150
Just think about the benefits of one over the other and see what you come up with.

41
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.400
How may you know what to grab.

42
00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.270
So obviously if we've got a load of objects in a scene our scene currently is really sparse but how

43
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.370
are we going to make sure that the player grabs the right things.

44
00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.960
Perhaps you can have everything grab a ball in your game perhaps only certain things would be.

45
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.120
Obviously one would make the play through a lot easier and a lot more clearer as to what you're supposed

46
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.620
to be doing.

47
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:25.130
More importantly than anything I want you to be open and just think about what's going on it's interesting

48
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.420
to see your thought processes when you go ahead and share this in the discussions.

49
00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.120
Think about what game objects.

50
00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.630
Would you be working with.

51
00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.330
Is it a has a or is a relationship to the player.

52
00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.740
Now share your ideas for discussion is always great seeing the sea of ideas in facts.

53
00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.500
In fact what you can do as part of your research is go and have a look what other people have suggested

54
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.450
already over on the forum.

55
00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.610
So that's one way of approaching this.

56
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:59.050
So go ahead pulls a video now and give that a go Okay everybody Welcome back.

57
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:04.060
Let's go ahead and start going through how we're going to implement this.

58
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.190
Okay so we want to be able to lift the cone or indeed you may have put another object in your scene

59
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.900
that's absolutely fine.

60
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:16.450
Eventually at the very end I'm going to be lifting up a gargoyle and there will be a another gargoyle

61
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.160
that we can replace it with.

62
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.480
So we're just going to interact with one single object in the world.

63
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.600
We will add a grabber component to the player.

64
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.020
Now the issue of course is the player as a temporary actor that appears on play.

65
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:36.820
So be interesting on how we approach this and how we're able to go ahead and attach a component to something

66
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.130
that doesn't exist before you press play.

67
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.720
Now the game mode itself which can be found in the project's settings.

68
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.990
That's what goes ahead and sets which default porn to use and currently we'll go have a look at it in

69
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.750
a moment before we move on.

70
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.030
You cannot change what's there.

71
00:04:54.070 --> 00:05:01.750
However what we can do is create a default porn and game mode blueprints and then we will be able to

72
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.790
change that to a specific porn that we've created which gives us control.

73
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:12.370
And of course we'll be able to specify our modified default porn with the grab a component attached

74
00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.790
to it.

75
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:19.450
So let's just have a look at the game mode and the default porn that is currently set over in um real

76
00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.580
Okay so over in Unreal if we go to our project settings now I already have the tab at the top there

77
00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.480
I've left it there for quite some time.

78
00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.640
If yours isn't there you can get there through edit project settings.

79
00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:38.450
Okay so in the project settings if we go to maps and modes we've been here before we have set a default

80
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:44.990
game map before in fact both of these can actually be the entry level because we only have one level

81
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:51.100
in our game anyway it makes sense to have the editor start up in that as well.

82
00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:56.270
And then if we look further up see here we've got the default game mode currently it sets a game mode

83
00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:03.230
base and what we'll be able to do is and our own blueprints in here that we can go ahead and use that

84
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:09.290
will then make this able to be changed to under the selected game mode we've currently got the default

85
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:15.850
porn class as the default porn and we cannot change that at the moment but once we've made a blueprint

86
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:23.190
version of the game mode we'll be able to change that to our specific porn and we'll dive over into

87
00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:25.620
the beginnings of that in the next lecture.

88
00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.260
But before we do I'd like to go over a little more about what game mode actually is.

89
00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:37.920
So it can be anything from what inventory items a player starts with how many lives are available any

90
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:43.410
time limits that the player has score needed to end the game etc. These all belong to game mode.

91
00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:47.610
So these are all parameters and rules for the game as a whole.

92
00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:53.700
Now this is not where you would store the players current lives but perhaps your max lives available

93
00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.900
or your starting lives as an example.

94
00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:01.350
Especially the win condition that's always a good one isn't that you want to be able to win your game

95
00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:02.320
now.

96
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.500
Unreal goes into this in a lot more detail so there's the link down there and over in the resources

97
00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:08.230
as well.

98
00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:13.050
This is something that you can read and absorb on your own time it's kind of a challenge to go along

99
00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:18.810
with this lecture is to just go through game mode and make sure you've got a good broad understanding

100
00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:23.470
not a deep understanding but at the moment a broad understanding about what the game mode does.

101
00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.820
That's it for this lecture and I'll see you all in the next one.
