Hello everybody and congratulations for completing this section we've covered a lot in this section

2
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.350
and we've created a tech demo and I hope you've gone for the end of section challenge and created your

3
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.110
own mini game.

4
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.890
I'm really looking forward to seeing those so please do share them over in the discussions.

5
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.480
One of the most challenging things in this section was the references and pointers and the hope you're

6
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.890
now in a position where you can not only identify them but use them as well.

7
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.750
And when it comes to things like pointers remember to protect yourself as you go otherwise you can end

8
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.160
up with nasty crashes.

9
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.410
And I know that as I've been experimenting and even when I was trying to show you in one of the videos

10
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:48.860
you never saw because when unreal did crash it took out the rest of my system at the same time so they

11
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.190
can really end up being quite nasty.

12
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.150
Now please do let us know what you enjoyed about the section what you thought we could have done better.

13
00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.040
And of course if you want to see something specific perhaps we can get it in later on.

14
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.460
So that's it for me.

15
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.700
Thank you so much for joining me through the section.

16
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.340
And I'll see you all very soon.
