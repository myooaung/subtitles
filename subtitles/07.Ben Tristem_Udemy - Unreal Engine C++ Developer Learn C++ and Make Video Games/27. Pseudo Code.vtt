00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.710
Hello everybody and welcome back in this lecture I'm going to talk about pseudo coding specifically

2
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.320
what it is and how we can use it to make sure that when we start writing our code we're not doing it

3
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.250
in a blind manner.

4
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:23.090
We've already got our flow charts and using pseudocode is going to allow us to lay out our coding structure

5
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.030
so it complements the flow chart approach really well we can cross-reference it but it's going to contain

6
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.820
more detail more detail than we put in the flowchart itself.

7
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.770
And it allows you to put down ideas and keep track of progress.

8
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.350
That's one of the key things that I use it for.

9
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.570
It's just a list of things on the screen written down in a detailed way so you know not only what you've

10
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:52.650
got to do but also how you're going to go about doing it is easy to catch those logical errors as you

11
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.700
start running through your code you may go.

12
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.660
It doesn't make sense if we do it that way.

13
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.190
But if we flip it round it will make sense.

14
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.180
And finally it is detailed.

15
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.520
It's an easy to read template for the rest of our code.

16
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.790
That's the important thing here.

17
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.170
We've got the detail and it being easy to read it's not being coded yet.

18
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:17.730
It's not been encoded in C++ so let's dive in straightaway and start the Super coding process so one

19
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:23.130
of the things to bear in mind is when we are pseudocode we're essentially making comments that are a

20
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.870
little more detailed.

21
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.640
So first of all here we've got a few comments that might be missing.

22
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:36.030
Now ideally you shouldn't have to comment your code because your code would be super clear.

23
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:44.280
However at the same time it'd be worthwhile just saying here this is where we set the hidden word and

24
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.970
it's fine when you're typing to use the same sorts of language you would do in your code.

25
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.830
The important thing is that when you are typing you do typing as a comment.

26
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.740
So it doesn't try and run it as real code.

27
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.320
So what are the next things we need to do here is set perhaps some lives.

28
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.550
So we need to set lives.

29
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.280
That's one of the things we need to do.

30
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.130
And then perhaps down here where we've got the on input for the moment and we'll flesh this out as we

31
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.480
go through perhaps here we might remove the life.

32
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.020
So let's have a look we've set our lives now and we thought about deprecating that life.

33
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.960
That's fine.

34
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.710
Let's go down.

35
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.870
So we're waiting for the user input when we take the user input we're talking about whether it is valid

36
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.440
or correct.

37
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.690
So let's have a look in more detail at that before we subtract the life.

38
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.720
Have a look here we're actually checking for its validity before we subtract the life that's key there.

39
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.480
So we probably don't want to be deprecated in the life at the same time as checking its validity.

40
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.810
It would just be a consequence of it not being valid.

41
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:53.940
So let's come down here.

42
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.150
So we're going to remove a life at some point that's fine.

43
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.620
I'm going to put it outside of this lots down here.

44
00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.350
So going to remove a life but what else do we need to check.

45
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.440
We need to check if it's an eyesore gram.

46
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.780
We could do that.

47
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:17.460
We could check if it's the right number of characters and then we're subtracting the life.

48
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.130
So we've gone through all of those and then are the lives greater than zero.

49
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.330
So you can see we're just going along the flow charts at this point and thinking out our code speaking

50
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.740
it out loud as well that really helps to try and work through our flow charts.

51
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.380
So are the lives greater than 0.

52
00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.210
And with that comes your challenge.

53
00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:45.140
So what I'd like you to finish off doing is pseudo coding the game so include details almost like a

54
00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:51.050
checklist in many places and this will ensure that as you're going through you'll remember things and

55
00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.850
don't worry that you may add to this as you move forward.

56
00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:01.670
Remember to also add questions if you're unsure about something as absolutely fine at this stage to

57
00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.480
comments does uppercase or lowercase matter.

58
00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:13.100
These are questions that you can ask right now or indeed as you start coding you can comment to n discover

59
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.570
it's answer the question.

60
00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.880
It's a good way of taking notes within the code itself and it's great when you look back at your code

61
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:27.030
to explain your thought process as well going through especially as a beginner and then after you've

62
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.540
done that run through your code does it make sense.

63
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:36.000
Have you managed to capture everything you need so in order to run your game balls of the air now and

64
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.940
give that a go.

65
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.200
Hello everybody and welcome back.

66
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.350
Let's dive over into a visual studio code and pseudocode.

67
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:52.380
The rest of our game so at some point we've got to check if lives are greater than zero.

68
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.460
That's important.

69
00:04:53.820 --> 00:05:03.170
And if not we can play again if yes or if true we can play again.

70
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:10.190
And if it's not rights and if no we live well let's check our flow charts.

71
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.830
We print the fail message and then we promise to play again.

72
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:22.600
So if no show game over I suppose you could call that and then we promise to play again.

73
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.920
OK.

74
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.280
So I think I've done the bottom bit here but have I really done the top.

75
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.340
So let's have a look here.

76
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:36.060
So we're welcoming the player and setting the hidden word and setting up the lives is really setting

77
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.910
up or initializing the game.

78
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.920
So finally let's run through our code to make sure that we've got everything in place.

79
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:49.500
Of course some new things are unlikely to appear as we start coding through.

80
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:55.120
So we're welcoming the player welcomes spoke house guest the four letter word presence to continue.

81
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.030
That's fine.

82
00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.670
Then we set up the game.

83
00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:01.510
We've got the hidden word being set which is useful.

84
00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:03.700
And then we've got the lives being set.

85
00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.020
That's what we've got here as well.

86
00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:10.090
Then we promise the player for a guess which we're not doing here.

87
00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.850
So we need to prompt plan for guests.

88
00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.060
This is why it's important to run through your code

89
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.770
so this is all about checking the player I guess.

90
00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:30.050
And we've already got some proper code here so if the input is the hidden word you've won.

91
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.890
Otherwise you've lost that's fine.

92
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.390
But we'll also need to say if it's a nicer Graham.

93
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:40.920
If the number of characters is correct as a way of validating that guess.

94
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.860
Let's just check against hair.

95
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:44.470
Is it valid.

96
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:45.470
Yes you win.

97
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:45.920
No.

98
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:46.230
OK.

99
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.920
What do we then go to do we subtract a life.

100
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:49.700
Brilliant.

101
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.800
Are the lives greater than zero.

102
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.240
Chekov lives greater than zero.

103
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.230
Yes.

104
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:55.110
Play again.

105
00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.390
So we go back around to ask for guests.

106
00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:58.640
Now I've said play again.

107
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:00.500
I don't think that's a good name for it.

108
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.420
So do think about your naming even at this stage.

109
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.180
I've said play again.

110
00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.420
That to me really sounds like start a new game.

111
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:11.690
So let's say Guess again instead.

112
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:16.520
Rather than play again because later on we're asking whether or not we play again.

113
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.160
So we print the fail message.

114
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:22.700
If no show game over and maybe and hit a word.

115
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:24.200
That's an idea isn't it.

116
00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:30.590
So as we as we lose the game do you show the player the word that they could have guessed.

117
00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:32.240
So I think that'll be a great idea.

118
00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:33.950
Ah yes.

119
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:34.840
And there's another thing here.

120
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:36.030
Checkered lives if.

121
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:36.840
Yes.

122
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:45.320
Guess again show new lives or rather more explicitly show lives left.

123
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.400
Now that is important.

124
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.820
Otherwise the player won't know how many lives they have left.

125
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:51.220
So print the fail message.

126
00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.400
Yes show game over and hit and work.

127
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:55.810
I think that's a good idea.

128
00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:59.690
And then prompts to play again wait for user input.

129
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:04.600
So this is a B check user inputs.

130
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:09.320
Or we could even make this more simple instead of prompts to play again.

131
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:15.550
Could we have press Enter to play again so there were a couple of options there.

132
00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:16.590
That's the important thing.

133
00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:22.660
Being opens options and thinking about the other possibilities when it comes to the game itself.

134
00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:29.190
So we check the user inputs and then so then we have play again or quits.

135
00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:31.510
I think that's about wraps up.

136
00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:33.480
So let's run through it once more.

137
00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:34.860
You set up the game.

138
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:35.570
Oh sorry.

139
00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.020
We welcome the player.

140
00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:40.210
We set up the game and then we go ahead.

141
00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:43.260
Check for guests checking the user's inputs.

142
00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:48.420
We've got some other validation checks here we're checking if it's an eyesore gram checking if it has

143
00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:51.810
the right number of characters if it doesn't.

144
00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:55.850
Which by this by this stage of course we can then remove a life.

145
00:08:55.860 --> 00:09:02.120
Now I have decided that if they don't type in an ice a gram or the right number of characters I'm not

146
00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.700
gonna punish them for that.

147
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.920
I'm going to make sure that they keep the number of lives.

148
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:09.480
That's why we're checking this and checking this.

149
00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:17.340
So actually at this stage once again check your phone I say gram and I'm prompt to guess again and the

150
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:18.500
same is true.

151
00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:25.500
Just under here if it if it meets these conditions here if it isn't ice a gram then fine but if it's

152
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:31.590
not we prompts a guess again check the right number of characters if it's not we prompt to guess again

153
00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:35.460
and then of course we've got removing the life that's fine.

154
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:39.060
Check if your lives are greater than zero if it is we can guess again.

155
00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:44.580
If it's not and we show the lives left sorry if it's not then we show the game over and perhaps the

156
00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:45.380
hidden word.

157
00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:50.180
And then finally we prompt to play again or maybe even just present it to play again.

158
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.000
And there we go.

159
00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:51.780
Brilliant.

160
00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:53.340
How did you guys get on.

161
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:56.130
I'll be interested to see what else you've added.

162
00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:58.740
Perhaps your list was a lot shorter than mine.

163
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:03.490
Remember this is something that we can adjust and play with as we develop our code.

164
00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:10.200
It gives a scope for our code as well to make sure that we're not coding ourselves into a corner.

165
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:11.210
