00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.230
Hello and welcome this lecture, we're gonna be looking at how we can use the anim graph of an animation

2
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:17.160
blueprint, this whole new concept hold to new concepts to blend animations together using a series

3
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.850
of variables.

4
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.290
As you can see, I'm changing the variables.

5
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.570
It's changing the blend of animation.

6
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.030
Let's dive in and see how this works.

7
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.990
So he got some semblance of animation here, but obviously it's not dynamic.

8
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.940
It's not particularly interesting.

9
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.150
We need to be able to do animations that are far more complicated than this.

10
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.980
And Unreal has many great built in systems to do this.

11
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.760
The main one being the animation blueprints, which is a blueprint, obviously.

12
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.250
So we're not gonna be doing this in C++ because animations just make sense to be done in blueprints.

13
00:00:51.920 --> 00:01:00.500
And the main point of the animation blueprints is to bring together all the animation logic and allow

14
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:08.570
us to kind of blend and merge and switch between animations such that our game logic can then drive

15
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.280
that animation blueprint.

16
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.140
So without further ado, let's try and create an animation blueprint.

17
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.210
So in the content browser, you add new.

18
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.930
All right, click.

19
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.010
And we're going to go to animation and select animation blueprints here.

20
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.800
And you'll see right off the bat is asking us to maybe have a parent class.

21
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.850
We don't need a parent class.

22
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.930
We can just use the default.

23
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:38.630
But it does need a skeleton because like the animations, like these skeletal meshes, they both rely

24
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.590
on the skeleton.

25
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.890
So does the animation blueprint, which means that then it can use all the animations of that skeleton

26
00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.230
and it can be used on any of the measures that relate to that skeleton.

27
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.070
Now, obviously, we want the Wraith skeleton here.

28
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.220
So let's go ahead and select that and click.

29
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.750
Okay.

30
00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.670
And that's gonna go ahead and create an animation blueprint based off of the Wraith skeleton.

31
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:08.240
And then for naming convention, we start with a BP underscore, and I'm going to call this the just

32
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.080
shoot her character, basically, because we've got that different prefix.

33
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.070
I think it's clear enough.

34
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.100
It's the animation blueprint for the shoot character.

35
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:23.660
So if we go ahead and open up that animation blueprints and dock it to our main window, then we're

36
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.870
gonna see an animation blueprint, Ed, which in many ways looks similar to your usual blueprint, Ed..

37
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.480
It's got this main graph area in the middle.

38
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.270
But in some ways, it's different.

39
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.580
So we've got the graph area that's similar.

40
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.920
This is a slightly different graph to what we're used to.

41
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.000
It's called the Annam graph.

42
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.600
You can see there's also an event graph, just like your regular blueprint.

43
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.420
They have an event graph, but there's also something called an anime graph.

44
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.530
We'll get to that in a second.

45
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.660
There's a detailed pane which gives you details about the animation blueprint.

46
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.670
So the class itself, you got the details on that note.

47
00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.480
Notice we don't have any components against an animation blueprint.

48
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.700
That's one difference to notes already.

49
00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.660
We've got this anime preview editor which allows us to do some stuff with this preview window over here,

50
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.550
why they're not closer to each other by default.

51
00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:11.150
I don't know.

52
00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.890
Asset browser.

53
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.310
Just like on the animations allows us to look through animations easily, bring them in to our editor.

54
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.890
And here at the top, right again.

55
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.520
Same as animations and meshes.

56
00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:31.550
We have this view that allows us to quickly switch between the skeleton, the mesh and the animations

57
00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.630
and the blueprints that all rely upon that same skeleton.

58
00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:42.530
Then over in the bottom left, you got that my blueprint pane, which is very much the same as my blueprints

59
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.660
on your standard blueprint.

60
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.080
You got your functions, your variables, macros, that sort of stuff is the same.

61
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.220
What's different?

62
00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.480
Oh yeah.

63
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:50.480
We've got the graphs as well.

64
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.260
That's also the same.

65
00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.790
But what's different is this animation graphs and animation layers.

66
00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.760
Now, we're not really gonna touch upon animation, allows us a bit more of an advance feature that

67
00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:59.210
we don't need.

68
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:05.900
But the graph, that is what is very important indeed, because the graph is kind of like blueprints,

69
00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.540
except we have no execution note.

70
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.480
All we've got is the data that flows through the graph.

71
00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.550
And what does flow through the graph?

72
00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:19.160
Well, basically, we're trying to get to this output pose this output animation pose that we should

73
00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.870
model our character into.

74
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:27.920
And we do that by connecting up lots of different nodes to this result node and flowing through that

75
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.930
we end up getting the data.

76
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.160
That is our output.

77
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:38.220
One simple output that we can go with is, for example, just dragging in an animation into this Annam

78
00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.540
graph.

79
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:44.360
And you can see that it creates a node and it has an output pin, which is an animation pose.

80
00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.500
And if we drag that pose onto the output pose and hit compile.

81
00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.140
You can see that is just going to show in our preview what this animation blueprint does.

82
00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.190
It essentially just plays this ability animation.

83
00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.610
And that's pretty much what we're doing at the moment.

84
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.650
Except now he put an extra layer in between.

85
00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.710
You know, we're putting a blueprint in instead of just playing the animation directly.

86
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.010
That's not particularly useful in and of itself.

87
00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.530
But the different kinds of operations we can do on these poses.

88
00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:15.950
Now, that is useful.

89
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.340
If we.

90
00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.550
Right.

91
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.400
Click in the Annam graph, you can see there's a lot of stuff going on here.

92
00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.760
I want to search for something called a blend.

93
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:24.980
And there's a few different.

94
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.430
Things in here.

95
00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:30.320
Let's see if I can find the most useful one we want at the top.

96
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.490
There is a few here, I think blend blend boned by channel blend.

97
00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:36.320
Multi.

98
00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.480
We want just the standard blend.

99
00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.590
Let's bring that in.

100
00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.320
And you can see here we've got a value.

101
00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.590
We've got to input poses and one output pose.

102
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.250
So what we can do is we can drag in two different animations.

103
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.950
And we can stick this one's an additive animation, I don't want to bring that in, that's going to

104
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:55.760
confuse us.

105
00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.520
Let's use some animation that we might actually use.

106
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.270
So we were looking at the forward movement we've got.

107
00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:03.340
Jog a hard jog.

108
00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.810
Might be more what we want rather than walking.

109
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.140
So let's have a little look at add jog forward.

110
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.180
That might be one thing that we can blend.

111
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.710
And then the other thing we could blend is a jog back.

112
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.330
So let's just look for jog.

113
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:23.480
And we've got jog, jog, B, W, D, which I think is stands for backwards, forward, backwards.

114
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.490
Let's bring those into our blende node and then output them and see what the results are going to be

115
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:29.360
when I hit compile.

116
00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.220
See, I'm jogging forward.

117
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:38.450
If I stick my alpha over to one and then recompile, you can see that now I'm jogging backwards and

118
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:45.620
you can see also as the preview runs, you can see which nodes which where the data is flowing basically

119
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.660
from the jog backwards through the blende node.

120
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:53.270
And there's nothing coming through that's pin a because Alpha Alpha blends between the two.

121
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.220
Now I can do a point five on the Alpha or anywhere in between.

122
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:03.470
And that's going to try and play both of the animations and layer them on top of each other, half of

123
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:03.860
both them.

124
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:09.350
And obviously when you're dealing with jogging forward and backwards at the same time, that starts

125
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:10.730
to look a little bit funny, doesn't it?

126
00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:16.970
So what I'm going to do here is I get to remove the jog backwards and put in an idle animation instead.

127
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.310
So where do we have idle?

128
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.660
I'm going to select this idol noncombat and bring that in here.

129
00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.660
So now what should happen is if we're at 50 percent.

130
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:31.200
It's kind of doing this idle noncombat.

131
00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:38.650
Half of that OHA and then half of the joke, whereas if I put it at one, it's going to do 100 percent.

132
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.710
Idle zero.

133
00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:43.250
It's going to do 100 percent.

134
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.270
Now, this is not ideal.

135
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.940
The fact that I keep changing this alpha having to hit recompile.

136
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:53.500
So what we can do is we can add in a variable to our blueprint.

137
00:07:53.510 --> 00:08:00.560
It needs to be a float so we can go ahead and change the variable type in the details pane to float.

138
00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:05.510
And I'm going to change this to blend amount.

139
00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:14.990
So and then we can drag that in so we can drag in any variables from our blueprint in to the Annam graph

140
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:19.340
and hook it up to some of the pins hit, compile and Africa.

141
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:20.970
Back to our Annam preview.

142
00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:26.180
Ed, you can see that it's showing up these variables like that we've created up here the blend amount.

143
00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:34.970
And that means that now if I can just shift that at runtime, I can see and preview what would be happening.

144
00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:40.490
And then basically what's going to happen is our game is going to drive these variables in the animation

145
00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:46.820
blueprint to get the right sort of animation at any particular point during play.

146
00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.420
That's what we're going to deal with a little bit later on in this section.

147
00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:56.720
But for now, we're to try and get this animation looking right when we have the right sort of variables

148
00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:57.280
in here.

149
00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:05.020
So it's time for a bit of a challenge, see if you can get set up with an animation blueprint and play

150
00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.580
around with the Annam graph.

151
00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:09.070
So I'd like you to add another blend.

152
00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.020
We're going to add them up in sequence.

153
00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:12.820
So first you can do one blend.

154
00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.340
Its output is going to go into the input of the next blend.

155
00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:18.010
Then select an animation that makes sense.

156
00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:25.570
Such maybe as moving right or left and add some variables that also make sense so that you can tweak

157
00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:31.420
them and look at the preview and you can blend between all of the animations, the idol, the moving

158
00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:36.670
forward and your animation choice, whether it's moving left or right, something like that pulls a

159
00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:37.950
video and have a go.

160
00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.220
Just play with these blends.

161
00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.560
See if you can make sense of the Annam graph.

162
00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:43.850
Hey, welcome back.

163
00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:46.170
So hopefully you've had a little go.

164
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:51.950
We're going to go and add in another blende node, so search for Blende and then scroll up for some

165
00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:52.370
reason.

166
00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:54.230
This might be to do with my screen scaling.

167
00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:58.250
Let's go to the BLENDE and bring across that.

168
00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:00.270
See these idle animations.

169
00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:00.950
What do I want to do?

170
00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:05.240
I think I wants to have it move left.

171
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:14.000
So I'm going to look in my asset browser for jogging and we're going to look for a jogging left animation.

172
00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:18.200
Now, by the way, I do know that blends are not the ideal way to do this.

173
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:23.720
In the next lecture, we're going to look at a better way of doing this, which is going to be to use

174
00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:28.700
something called a blend space, which automatically allows us to blend movement animations.

175
00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:29.720
That very nice way.

176
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:34.280
But we're doing this just to get the idea of the Annam graph before we dive into more complicated things.

177
00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:41.090
So we're going to blend between, let's see, left and forward, I think.

178
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:46.060
So left here and we're going to copy.

179
00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:46.800
Cut.

180
00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:50.080
Or move forward over to be here.

181
00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:58.270
And then we're going to patch that in the output of the blend in to the input to the next blend.

182
00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:01.300
The one that does idle or not does is actually make sense.

183
00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:02.580
Let's think about the variables.

184
00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:04.030
What should the variables be called?

185
00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:09.340
I'm going to have one which is called forewords.

186
00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:11.370
Just forward.

187
00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:12.240
That's quite simple.

188
00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:18.720
And one which is called right or left, because we're choosing a left animation.

189
00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:20.010
So it's going to be a float.

190
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:26.400
So one of the blends needs to choose between forward and not moving.

191
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:31.890
So that's going to be let's try and make that our first blend.

192
00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:42.560
We'll hook in the Idol noncombat to a so that Zero Alpha is going to be not moving at one way forward

193
00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:43.070
is one.

194
00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.470
Let's hook up that forward variable to Alpha.

195
00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.030
At one, it's going to move forward.

196
00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:52.430
Then we're going to bring that into zero of moving left.

197
00:11:54.150 --> 00:12:01.640
That left variable up zero moving left and at one of moving left, we're going to hook up a B..

198
00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:03.540
Basically, we're gonna hook up the jug left.

199
00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.140
So if we compile that as a little bit scatterbrained.

200
00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.550
But hopefully you get the idea.

201
00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:08.770
Go.

202
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:11.040
That's the anim preview, Ed.

203
00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:12.870
And we move forward.

204
00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.490
You can see that we start jogging.

205
00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:15.620
Reset that.

206
00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.620
And if we move left, you can see that we start moving left.

207
00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:21.900
And crucially, if we do both.

208
00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:23.370
Move left.

209
00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:24.990
And start jogging.

210
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:28.780
We should see a blend a little bit of both.

211
00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:30.810
Hey, we got that food being blended.

212
00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:33.640
If I need to have a little bit less of the left.

213
00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:36.310
50 percent of the left, you can see how kind of moving.

214
00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:39.070
It's a weird looking animation is not blending it particularly well.

215
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:45.520
But you can see that it's playing both the jog left and the jog forward.

216
00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:50.620
Now, as I said, we're gonna leave these variables more or less intact, but we're going to change

217
00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:56.620
the mechanism by which we actually do the blending to make more sense and use more of those animations

218
00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:01.650
that we're seeing in the asset browser for jocking forward jogging backwards, jogging left, et cetera.

219
00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:03.640
But that's all the subject to the next lecture.

220
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:09.760
This one we have covered more or less the animation blueprints and how the Annam graph works and why

221
00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.260
we have it there in the first place.

222
00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:12.820
So we'll see in the next lecture.

223
00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:14.350
Four more animations.
