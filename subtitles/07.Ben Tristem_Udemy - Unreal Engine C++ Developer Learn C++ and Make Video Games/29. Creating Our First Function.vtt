00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.050
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.730
In this lecture we're going to create our first function within unreal.

3
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.900
Now the key thing here is.

4
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.690
And as you can see on the screen that your function ideally should do only one thing.

5
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.870
Now what do I mean by that.

6
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.040
Well functions work best when they are doing something specific.

7
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.450
It makes it much easier to read your code.

8
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.720
It makes it much easier to debug it makes it much easier to name your file as well.

9
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.320
So the name of the function tells us what it does.

10
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.210
And often it's the case if you're having trouble naming your functions it might be doing too much to

11
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.710
try to make sure your functions only do one thing.

12
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.280
The great thing as well is if the only does one thing is you're likely to be able to reuse it later

13
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.310
in your code as well if that happens to come up now let's go ahead now and dissect a function before

14
00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.130
we go in and write the code.

15
00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:05.500
First of all this is how we're going to be writing our functions within our game itself.

16
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.650
First of all if we have a look at the left void as you can remember from the previous section is returning

17
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:12.440
nothing.

18
00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.030
So this function itself is not going to return anything that we're going to use later.

19
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.440
It's just going to perform what it's been told to do.

20
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.480
Then we've got this new Bull Cal cartridge.

21
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.480
This is the class the init game is part of.

22
00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.590
Now you can see there we've got the scope resolution operator.

23
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.980
Those two colons next to one another and one of the reasons for this is if we had multiple classes that

24
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:41.770
we were working with we would end up with a clash at some point with functions being named the same.

25
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.620
So this is a way of making sure that we are calling the right function the one that we intend to.

26
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.180
And without it we would be defining a nonmember function.

27
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.560
OK.

28
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:58.750
So that's enough of a very dive over into V.S. code now and start building up our function okay.

29
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:05.000
So there are three things while at least three things that we need to do we need to declare we need

30
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.930
to make a function declaration over in the header file then in the CBP file in the book how countries

31
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.160
C++ file what we will do is we will have a call.

32
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.670
We will call in it game to initialize the game.

33
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.600
But we'd also have to define what that actually means.

34
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.940
And that will be beneath these two functions we already have big in play and on input.

35
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.900
So down here line 52 onwards we will do a definition.

36
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.110
What does initialize game or init game actually do.

37
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.140
So let's start in the head of file itself.

38
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.170
We need to say void we're not returning anything.

39
00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:54.340
And then I've chosen in it to game as an initialize game function that we need are parentheses followed

40
00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.190
by a semicolon.

41
00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.760
That's that bit done.

42
00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.770
There we go.

43
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.080
It's just gone through the code all the red squiggles done saved my head.

44
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.960
Now bear in mind because we've edited the header file.

45
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.740
It will now take slightly longer in real when we hit compile.

46
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.620
Let's go over to the C++ file so we can do a couple of things here.

47
00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.360
I'm going to go up and have a look at the code that is initialized in the game so that's this area here

48
00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.060
setting up the game.

49
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.940
So let's type in a call of it game.

50
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.480
So we're going to call the function in it.

51
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.700
Game and then we go.

52
00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.760
That's the call.

53
00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.230
All done.

54
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.040
And this is the code that we need.

55
00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.800
We're going to set the hidden word and set the lines as well.

56
00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.930
And there is another thing that will added that in a future lecture.

57
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.940
But for now we'll leave those two things.

58
00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:47.750
So I am going to cut that out of the way so we can paste it in to the function once we've started defining

59
00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:54.450
it so the way that we're going to define the functions here is just the same as the other ones that

60
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.500
are already in here.

61
00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:04.730
So we've got void you bowl cow cartridge colon colon in it game.

62
00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:05.180
There we go.

63
00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.400
It's come up and I've press tab to also complete our parentheses.

64
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:17.180
There won't be a semicolon on the end of this one but what we will do is have our curly braces ready

65
00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.350
to put our code in.

66
00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.110
So we've defining what this init game actually does.

67
00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:29.220
The first thing it's going to do is set the header word and then we need to set our lives so let's overview

68
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.020
what we've done so far.

69
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:37.660
We have done a function declaration over on the header file.

70
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:45.370
We have defined what that function is doing beneath the other functions and then we're calling it's

71
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.130
here when we called in it game.

72
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.300
Now those are at least the three things we need to do.

73
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:56.710
Remember now that we've declared it and defined it we can use in it game anywhere in our code here which

74
00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:02.020
is really useful because I think we will be using it once again when we start setting up our main game

75
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.270
loop which now we're only a few lines of code until we reach that point.

76
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.900
So with that knowledge it's time for your challenge.

77
00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:17.890
OK so your challenge I'd like you to go ahead and declare and initialize lives declare the member variable

78
00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:26.250
lives initialized lives in the init game function now lives will be an integer then if you cast your

79
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:33.450
mind back a few lectures we're all new to this of course we've got unreal specific types for integers.

80
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:41.670
In this case we're going to use an int 32 rather than just int in order to set the integers type and

81
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:47.530
then of course we need to make sure we test our game and make sure it's still working as it was previously.

82
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:55.390
Polls of the year now and give that a go Okay everybody Welcome back let's go hop on over into v as

83
00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:01.400
code declare and initialize lives and test our game okay.

84
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.470
So once again we're going to declare lives.

85
00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:09.540
So down here with our declarations it is going to be a member variable and you see why.

86
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:17.330
As we develop the code so it's a type int 32 and then we get a call it lives okay.

87
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:24.860
So that's it declared let's go ahead save our pedophile go into the main C++ file and then we need to

88
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.890
define it down here where we've got setting lives.

89
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:34.970
Now I realize here that I didn't she tell you what to set it to what to assign the value lives on my

90
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:36.600
set it to four.

91
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:46.120
Now you may argue at this point in time whether or not set lives and set the hidden word are great comments

92
00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:51.340
is obvious what they're doing at the moment the hidden word is being assigned in this case cake they'll

93
00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.960
be swapped out later and lives is being assigned the value for them.

94
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:57.760
I think we can nuke these comments.

95
00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:03.120
I don't think they add anything yes that looks much cleaner now.

96
00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:06.240
So let's go ahead and say if that's okay.

97
00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:11.980
And just before I go and open up the book our project itself and I'm real I would like to just talk

98
00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:16.230
about the positioning of this and why it works down here.

99
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.030
Some of you may be thinking at the moment.

100
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:25.450
Well doesn't this just read from the top down and therefore how are we able to use this function that

101
00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:28.780
we've created when it's all the way down here.

102
00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:35.740
Well it's already been declared so we can use it if we have a look at the header file itself we'll see

103
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:41.200
that we have declared it here remember that's what we've done and that the header file itself is simply

104
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.060
cut and paste into the top of the C++ file.

105
00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:51.930
That's what this include bulk how cartridge header file is doing and basically what that means that

106
00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:55.840
we can do is define any of our functions.

107
00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:59.580
After that scroll back up here the include.

108
00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:05.550
Now the reason why I've popped it at the bottom is what I'd like to do and what I'd like to encourage

109
00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:12.390
you guys to do as well is when you're creating these top level parts of your code it would be great

110
00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.550
if when you look at them you know how the game works.

111
00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:21.630
So if this is absolutely clear that it's initializing the game or setting up the game then that means

112
00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:27.600
that you don't have to necessarily go down to find out how it is implemented.

113
00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:31.870
So it's much better higher up your code if you can read what's happening.

114
00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:37.470
And then if you need to know how it is happening then of course you can go down to the relative area

115
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.340
case of the book how game has loaded up.

116
00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:43.310
Let's have a look okay.

117
00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:48.940
So now that's opened up hit compile this will take a little longer to compile than normal.

118
00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:56.350
And when it's done we can play our game and make sure it works okay with a compile complete let's press

119
00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:57.370
play.

120
00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:58.900
Welcome to ball cows.

121
00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.440
Let's go ahead now and typing cake.

122
00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:05.120
Yes it works and it says we've lost.

123
00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:05.920
Perfect.

124
00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.460
So that's behaving exactly the same as it did before.

125
00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:17.910
If we go over and have a look at our code we've simply moved these lines of code out of the begin play.

126
00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:22.200
Is now much easier to read setting up the game in the game.

127
00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:24.730
How did your first function go.

128
00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:27.100
Please show your work over in the discussions.

129
00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.510
And I've had a thought here perhaps in it game is not clear enough.

130
00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:37.570
Looking at the fact that we've had two comments set with setting up game perhaps sets up game would

131
00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:44.140
have been better but hang on we've used in it game in multiple places in multiple files surely must

132
00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:47.100
be a quick way to be able to change them across.

133
00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:51.100
Everywhere it's used and we find out that in the next lecture.
