Hello and a warm welcome to the course.
1

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:12,260
My name is Ben, Ben Tristem. GameDev.tv founder and CEO. I originally designed and created this course
2

3
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:17,210
back in 2015 and it is being remastered during 2019.
3

4
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:23,510
We're going through the entire course rerecording it using Unreal Engine 4.22 or later and all the
4

5
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,640
latest design philosophies we have.
5

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,290
Furthermore we're going to be making the games more fun more visually appealing etc. So it's gonna be
6

7
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:31,720
a huge great remaster.
7

8
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:37,160
I'm asking for some help with that one person who helped us was Gavin also known on YouTube as
8

9
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,360
Tesla Dev Milroy.
9

10
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,570
He was a partner instructor with us in 2019.
10

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,880
He has created a great version of the Triple X game which is a new game for this remaster.
11

12
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:52,340
You'll see that in the course early on and then after that you'll be seeing Michael Bridges our senior
12

13
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:57,170
founding instructor, one of the... in fact the first instructor to work with me in GameDev.tv and he's also known
13

14
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:58,420
for his blender courses.
14

15
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:01,340
So they're the three phases you'll specifically see in this course.
15

16
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,750
There's a whole bunch of other faces behind the scenes but I won't confuse you with those people right
16

17
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,220
now.
17

18
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,140
So I want to share with you have to get the most from this course.
18

19
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:13,540
Firstly do all the challenges when you see them that's really important you'll see a challenge.
19

20
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:19,100
A little bit later in this video they are our way of making sure that you get actual practice because
20

21
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,460
you only really build a skill when you do something so please take the time to do the challenges.
21

22
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:29,150
Visit the Google slides their lives slide that gdev.tv/uc2slides that stands
22

23
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:34,310
for unreal course two slides then you can comment on the slides if you see any issues whatever so go
23

24
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:40,100
ahead and do that if you want it in general become an active community member also become a problem
24

25
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:45,110
solver try and get even better at solving problems during this course and stay positive and work hard
25

26
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:49,910
some bits of this will be difficult but things that are worth doing tend to be difficult so stick with
26

27
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,190
it it's gonna be cool.
27

28
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:54,980
All right so the first thing to say before we dive into any of the technical stuff is to make sure that
28

29
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,330
you understand you're not alone.
29

30
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,820
Don't struggle in silence.
30

31
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,740
Ask for help.
31

32
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,480
We have a world class community forum for a start.
32

33
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,660
Let's take a look at it.
33

34
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:06,890
This is our community forum it's at community.gamedev.tv you can access everything on this
34

35
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,000
without signing up.
35

36
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,260
Obviously if you want to post to the forum you're going to need to sign up but you can read
36

37
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,350
everything else everybody else has done without signing up.
37

38
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,540
And specifically the Unreal Courses section has three subsections you can talk issues where you share
38

39
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,360
and discuss and generally hang out.
39

40
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:26,990
You can ask if you've got a question that needs an answer then this is a good place to ask.
40

41
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,970
Because all the questions are tracked and we have Dan
41

42
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:33,460
Our student instructor in there looking for answers for you.
42

43
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:38,380
We also dive in occasionally as needed and then you have somewhere you can show off share screenshots
43

44
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:42,580
share code etc. So that's all structured like that inside the forum.
44

45
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:47,090
And when you post here once you've signed up or signed in you'll get the choice of whether you post
45

46
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,050
into talk ask or share.
46

47
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:49,270
All right.
47

48
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,230
So that's our community forum.
48

49
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:56,930
As I say you can talk ask or show when you do paste please use code formatting over in the forum.
49

50
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:03,500
So for example if you're asking a question and it is a technical question then either use a screenshot
50

51
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:08,420
like this which is a great example of a screenshot and if you're sharing code look for the code formatting
51

52
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,320
options in the forum.
52

53
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,120
Basically be a good community member.
53

54
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,460
Use code formatting make code readable include screenshots etc. but for instant help, if you need help
54

55
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:21,500
straight away there is our Discord server. If it's a simple problem that needs instant help come here.
55

56
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,130
I've given you an invite all these links are in the resources against this lecture.
56

57
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:29,860
We have several thousand people at just the right number or broken out nicely into different channels.
57

58
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,720
Give yourself a nice username I'm BenTristem.
58

59
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,920
I don't frequent it too often I go in once a week or so because there's so many, so many demands on my
59

60
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,580
time I can't be there any more often than that but if you go in there and mentioned me I'll eventually get
60

61
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,300
back to you.
61

62
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:45,060
And that's a good way of getting immediate answers to quick questions.
62

63
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:49,670
If you have a more nuanced question I suggest you post it onto the forum like this and then go and grab
63

64
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:53,990
the link for it and take it to our Discord live chat service so that you've done other people the service
64

65
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,960
of laying out your problem and thinking about it first.
65

66
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:01,790
The next place to show you is our GameDev.tv Unreal Course community on Facebook if you like Facebook.
66

67
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:02,330
This is great.
67

68
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,500
It's thriving.
68

69
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,190
Lots of people there willing to help you.
69

70
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:08,240
Friendly bunch of faces as you can see from the top here.
70

71
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,370
Then we have twitch.
71

72
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:14,030
We stream on Twitch occasionally and when we do it's good fun so you can follow us on Twitch.
72

73
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:18,980
We also have a YouTube channel which we use for various updates etc. So give us a subscribe over there
73

74
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:23,330
and then on a daily basis we use our Twitter channel at GameDev.tv on Twitter.
74

75
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:28,460
All right so they are most of our community places that you can go so why don't you go ahead and pause
75

76
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:28,760
the video.
76

77
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,450
This is the first challenge slide you can see on the screen now with the pause logo on it.
77

78
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:36,320
Join at least one community, it can be the community forum site that I showed you, the Discord live chat
78

79
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:43,460
server, The Unreal Facebook group, our Twitch channel, our YouTube channel, or GameDev.tv on Twitter and
79

80
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:48,380
all the links to these are in the lecture resources so go ahead pause the video join at least one community
80

81
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,490
now whatever you feel most comfortable with and I'll see you in a moment.
81

82
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:55,650
Awesome job.
82

83
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:56,280
Welcome back.
83

84
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,360
So please do do these challenges if you don't take action.
84

85
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,950
You're going to struggle later on in the course but I won't keep nagging you about that.
85

86
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:03,360
All right.
86

87
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,670
So how to ask good questions.
87

88
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,290
Very important when you do go over to a community site.
88

89
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,770
First off before you even ask anybody else please ask Google.
89

90
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:13,010
Just paste the exact error text into Google try and solve the problem yourself.
90

91
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:18,240
If you still need help then include the error that you're getting when you share the problem with any
91

92
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,790
code snippets or any error codes that you've got okay? Make it easy for other people to reproduce
92

93
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,290
the problem and understand the problem.
93

94
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,520
That's the key.
94

95
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:32,130
Make your description of the problem as short as possible but as long as necessary and also you know
95

96
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:37,050
what goes around comes around so please to answer other people's questions that will really help you
96

97
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,970
to understand how to ask a good question.
97

98
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:43,050
If you get into the habit of answering other people's questions as well you can really put yourself
98

99
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,000
in the question.
99

100
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,140
Answer is shoes.
100

101
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:46,990
So that's it.
101

102
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:52,450
A reminder that all these slides with this link below which is gdev.tv/uc2slides
102

103
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:53,970
And thank you for watching this video.
103

104
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:56,610
Next up we'll dive in and start getting everything installed and set up.
