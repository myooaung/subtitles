Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:12.610
In this lecture we're going to talk about the text macro and why we need to use it on real documentation

3
00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:13.960
is right in front of us here.

4
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.630
I'll make sure that the link to this particular Web page that we're on is also in your lecture resources.

5
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.530
So in general you should be using the text macro when setting string variables.

6
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:30.490
This essentially means that unreal can encode the text from multiple platforms the Unreal Engine supports

7
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:37.450
many many many platforms and they don't always play nicely but making sure we encapsulate our strings

8
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:43.790
within the text macro will ensure that they are correctly displayed on multiple platforms.

9
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.890
And as it says here is also more efficient to use the text macro.

10
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.960
So let's go over to VNS code and see it in action okay.

11
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.210
So let's focus on the F string that we worked on in the last lecture.

12
00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.920
So we have a string here cake.

13
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.730
And what we need to do is simply make sure that in all capitals that is important a macro is going to

14
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.350
be in all capitals.

15
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.580
And then of course our string itself needs to be within the parentheses.

16
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.660
And as you can see as I completed that are red squiggles disappeared which is always good to see.

17
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.120
And then of course we can save our work.

18
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.650
And that's basically it.

19
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:30.140
Any time that we have a string we're going to have to wrap it within the text macro itself so that unreal

20
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:37.020
can encode it correctly so armed with that knowledge it's now time for a very quick challenge.

21
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.530
Okay so here's your challenge.

22
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.880
I'd like you to go ahead and make sure that the strings that you are using are all using the text macro.

23
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.360
So that's whether they're an F string or a string within our print line function.

24
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.520
This will also be an ongoing challenge throughout the entire section and course whenever you are using

25
00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.910
strings and to just give you an example of how that is going to look we've got our print line and we've

26
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.290
wrapped our string within the text macro.

27
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.430
Now that does look slightly different from the example given before with our f string when we've got

28
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.040
the hidden word here and then we've got the string that we had before then wrapped within the text macro

29
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.340
as you can see here the main thing is that any string gets wrapped with inside that text macro itself

30
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.190
supports a video now and give us a go.

31
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.600
Okay everybody Welcome back.

32
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.130
Let's go ahead and wrap our other strings within the text macro.

33
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.990
Okay so now that we're back over in Visual Studio the first one we're going to deal with is the print

34
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.310
line at the top here.

35
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.490
So we're going to make sure that our string is wrapped within our text and make sure you've got the

36
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.650
right number of parentheses in there.

37
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.990
Occasionally it won't type them in straight away.

38
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.520
There we go.

39
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.430
And then finally this one here and there we go.

40
00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.640
We've got all of our strings correctly formatted so the unreal can make best use of them to make sure

41
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.930
I save my file.

42
00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.470
Boom done.

43
00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.100
How did you guys get on preshow your work over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
