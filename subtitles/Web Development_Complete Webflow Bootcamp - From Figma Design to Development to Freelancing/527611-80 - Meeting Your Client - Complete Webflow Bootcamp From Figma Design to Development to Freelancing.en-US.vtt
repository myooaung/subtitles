00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.320
Many inexperienced designers and

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.645
developers think
that we meet with

00:00:09.645 --> 00:00:11.730
clients because
they want to ask us

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.475
some questions about
us and how we work.

00:00:14.475 --> 00:00:16.050
But this is not all.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.310
The reason we meet with

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.010
clients is to
exchange information.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.755
They ask questions
and we ask questions.

00:00:22.755 --> 00:00:25.410
We want to truly understand
how their business

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.350
works to be able to
solve the problem.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.960
So always prepared
some questions

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.520
Before going to meeting.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.230
These questions may vary

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.970
depending on the
type of project,

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.740
but the main point is just took

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.625
familiarize yourself
with their business.

00:00:40.625 --> 00:00:42.530
Some clients may ask you about

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.750
your process and
it's totally fine.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.310
You can explain to them what

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.065
the whole process looks like.

00:00:48.065 --> 00:00:51.650
Some of them may want you to
develop a WordPress website,

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.230
maybe because they heard
it's good or they are

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.915
just familiar with the
WordPress interface.

00:00:56.915 --> 00:00:58.625
Two scenarios could happen.

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:00.830
First, you may think
that according

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.305
to their budget and
also their needs,

00:01:03.305 --> 00:01:06.500
it would be better for them
to have a WordPress website.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.470
And it's your responsibility
to guide them and say,

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:10.685
you need to look for

00:01:10.685 --> 00:01:13.835
a WordPress developer to
help you build this project.

00:01:13.835 --> 00:01:15.950
You can also introduce
them to someone

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.050
if you know a good
WordPress developer,

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.305
because we don't want to
get a client at any cost.

00:01:21.305 --> 00:01:24.905
We want them to be happy once
the project is completed.

00:01:24.905 --> 00:01:26.720
The second scenario is that you

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.520
think that you're wrong and it

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.290
would be much better
for them to have

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.194
a custom workflow website.

00:01:32.194 --> 00:01:34.715
In this case, you
need to convince them

00:01:34.715 --> 00:01:37.985
why Webflow is more
suitable for their needs.

00:01:37.985 --> 00:01:39.695
You can mention
the features that

00:01:39.695 --> 00:01:41.930
workflow has and
how convenient it

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.830
is to work with the Webflow
editor and many other things.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.810
So you should actually educate

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.760
your clients because
they may have

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.635
never heard a Webflow before

00:01:51.635 --> 00:01:53.690
and they just heard
about WordPress.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.100
In the upcoming video,

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.965
we will talk about selling
Webflow to your clients.

00:01:57.965 --> 00:01:59.910
So see you then.
