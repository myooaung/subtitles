00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.680
Hey, now it's time
to go ahead and work

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.635
on the mobile landscape
breakpoint. Are you ready?

00:00:10.635 --> 00:00:11.775
So let's begin.

00:00:11.775 --> 00:00:14.595
I'm going to go to the
mobile landscape here,

00:00:14.595 --> 00:00:17.295
and let's see if we need
to make some changes here.

00:00:17.295 --> 00:00:19.800
So this heading
looks a little bit

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.454
large or the mobile
landscape dimension.

00:00:22.454 --> 00:00:24.420
Therefore, I'm
going to select it

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.520
and I'm going to
decrease its font size

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.480
from 60 pixels to 40
pixels are right.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.215
I'm gonna do the same thing
to this here, a description.

00:00:34.215 --> 00:00:35.980
So I'm going to select it.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.220
And as you can see,

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.395
it's size is set to 20 pixels.

00:00:39.395 --> 00:00:42.305
I'm going to set
it to 17 pixels.

00:00:42.305 --> 00:00:44.525
We don't need to
modify our buttons.

00:00:44.525 --> 00:00:46.805
This section looks fine as well.

00:00:46.805 --> 00:00:50.450
However, for the mobile landscape
and more wide portrait,

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.570
I think it makes much
more sense to hide

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.880
these two small cards because on

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.045
mobile screens we don't
have so much space.

00:00:59.045 --> 00:01:02.120
Therefore, we don't need
to make our design noisy.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.225
So I'm going to select
this hero acquired one.

00:01:05.225 --> 00:01:08.060
I'm going to go ahead
and set its display

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.985
setting to none here as well.

00:01:10.985 --> 00:01:13.685
For this hero car
too. There we go.

00:01:13.685 --> 00:01:14.840
And do your hidden on

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.675
mobile landscape and
on mobile portrait.

00:01:17.675 --> 00:01:19.219
Because as you remember,

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:22.640
changes we make to our
breakpoints will cascade down.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.115
Alright, let's move on
to the next section.

00:01:25.115 --> 00:01:26.990
Our hero section looks fine.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.550
I'm going to scroll down.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.440
What about the client's section?

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.835
It looks fine as well.

00:01:31.835 --> 00:01:34.430
However, here we
have so much space,

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.105
so I'm going to select
this client section here,

00:01:38.105 --> 00:01:41.330
and then I'm going to
set its top margin to

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.620
zero instead of 130
pixels, just like that.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.615
Now, it looks much better

00:01:47.615 --> 00:01:49.685
because when it comes
to mobile interaction,

00:01:49.685 --> 00:01:52.040
we don't want the
user to scroll so

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.009
much in order to be able
to consume the content.

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:56.525
Therefore, if we can,

00:01:56.525 --> 00:02:00.050
we should decrease the
margins between our sections.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.135
What about recent
projects section?

00:02:02.135 --> 00:02:03.425
Here we have a problem.

00:02:03.425 --> 00:02:05.225
As you can see, these cards are

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:07.715
outside our screen. There we go.

00:02:07.715 --> 00:02:09.080
So how can we fix that?

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.910
Well, the best solution is to

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.310
just select this
collection list.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.575
If you remember, we
use the grid format.

00:02:15.575 --> 00:02:17.015
I'm going to modify this grid.

00:02:17.015 --> 00:02:19.820
Here we have one row
and three columns.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.190
I'm going to click
on this pink button,

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.754
and I'm going to
remove two columns

00:02:24.754 --> 00:02:27.755
and add two rows to
stack them vertically.

00:02:27.755 --> 00:02:31.025
So let me go ahead and
remove two columns here,

00:02:31.025 --> 00:02:33.305
and add two rows.

00:02:33.305 --> 00:02:34.145
There we go.

00:02:34.145 --> 00:02:35.630
But here we have a problem.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.655
As you can see, this card

00:02:37.655 --> 00:02:40.415
doesn't take up the whole
width of its parent.

00:02:40.415 --> 00:02:42.185
So how can we fix that?

00:02:42.185 --> 00:02:44.645
If I go ahead and select
my div block here,

00:02:44.645 --> 00:02:46.310
this project card div block,

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.370
you can see we set a
maximum width for that.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.060
Okay?

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.120
So I'm gonna change
this maximum width from

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.765
340 pixels to 100 per cent

00:02:56.765 --> 00:02:59.750
to take up the whole width
of its parent element.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:00.530
There we go.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.580
Now it takes up the whole
width of its cell in our grid,

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.590
and the problem is solved.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.015
Now, let me check it out.

00:03:08.015 --> 00:03:08.825
There we go.

00:03:08.825 --> 00:03:10.580
Everything looks fluid.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:11.615
It looks amazing.

00:03:11.615 --> 00:03:13.115
What about the next section?

00:03:13.115 --> 00:03:16.490
Wow, here everything
is disorganized.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.995
So let's go ahead and fix that.

00:03:18.995 --> 00:03:20.240
First, I'm going to select

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.010
this heading and I'm
going to decrease

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.030
its font size from 40
pixels to 30 pixels.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.450
And also I'm going to increase
its maximum width from

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.605
400 pixels to 500
pixels, just like that.

00:03:33.605 --> 00:03:35.990
Then I'm going to select
our container here.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:37.370
And if I scroll up,

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.485
you can see that
the justification

00:03:39.485 --> 00:03:42.035
is set to space around.

00:03:42.035 --> 00:03:43.850
I'm going to change
it to center.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.895
Let me select this
testimonial texts and

00:03:46.895 --> 00:03:50.465
decrease its font
size to 17 pixels.

00:03:50.465 --> 00:03:53.525
It's too large for
our mobile screen,

00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:55.834
and I'm going to give
it some bottom margins.

00:03:55.834 --> 00:03:59.180
Let's add 30 pixels of
bottom margin here.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.175
I'm going to select
my heading here,

00:04:01.175 --> 00:04:03.650
and I'm going to increase
its bottom margin to

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.240
30 pixels to have

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.415
a consistent spacing
for all our elements.

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:10.220
Now everything looks good,

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.575
as you can see in
terms of fluidity.

00:04:12.575 --> 00:04:13.730
It looks fine.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.215
So we're good to go.

00:04:15.215 --> 00:04:16.955
Let's move on to
the next section.

00:04:16.955 --> 00:04:19.280
Here we have the
same problem that we

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.935
had for this recent
project section.

00:04:21.935 --> 00:04:23.705
So the solution is the same.

00:04:23.705 --> 00:04:26.585
I'm going to go ahead and
select this services grid,

00:04:26.585 --> 00:04:29.720
and then I'm going to
change it this grid.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.714
I'm going to remove two columns.

00:04:31.714 --> 00:04:33.830
And then I'm going to
add two rows here.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.515
Then I'm going to select
this service card and change

00:04:36.515 --> 00:04:41.405
its maximum width from 340
pixels to 100 per cent,

00:04:41.405 --> 00:04:44.690
that it takes up the whole
width of its parent element.

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.719
Everything looks fine
except this icon.

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:49.010
So let's select it.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.125
As you can see, this
is a flex child,

00:04:51.125 --> 00:04:54.575
and if we head over to the
sizing here on the right side,

00:04:54.575 --> 00:04:57.470
you can see it's set
to shrink if needed.

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:58.880
We have two other options.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.484
We have grow if possible,

00:05:00.484 --> 00:05:02.720
and we have don't
shrink or grow.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.375
I'm going to set it to
don't shrink or grow.

00:05:05.375 --> 00:05:08.075
And there we go, it
looks fine now, however,

00:05:08.075 --> 00:05:10.205
since it has a combo class,

00:05:10.205 --> 00:05:13.340
the change only apply to
this particular div block.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.155
So I'm going to
reset this property,

00:05:15.155 --> 00:05:17.060
hold down the Option
key or Alt key

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.175
on your keyboard
and click on it.

00:05:19.175 --> 00:05:21.560
Then I'm going to remove
this combo class,

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.780
this one combo class, okay?

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.310
Now I'm going to change

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.220
the sizing to don't
shrink or grow.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.675
And finally, I'm going to

00:05:29.675 --> 00:05:31.970
add the first combo class to it.

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.890
Now everything looks fine.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.330
Let me check it out.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.625
But here we have
another problem.

00:05:37.625 --> 00:05:39.770
As you can see, this
project description

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.320
doesn't have enough
bottom margin.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.635
So while we are in the mobile
landscape break point,

00:05:45.635 --> 00:05:46.910
I'm going to select this

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.890
project description
and I'm going to

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.415
increase it from ten
pixels to 40 pixels.

00:05:52.415 --> 00:05:53.900
Now it looks much better.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.280
Can you see how easy it is to

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.020
make your website responsive?

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.250
You just need to modify

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.355
the stylings on different
breakpoints are right.

00:06:01.355 --> 00:06:04.085
This section looks fine as well.

00:06:04.085 --> 00:06:06.200
What about the CTA section?

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.840
This section requires
some modifications,

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.105
so let's go ahead and
make some changes.

00:06:11.105 --> 00:06:12.620
First of all, I'm
going to select

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.270
this heading and I'm going to

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.274
decrease its font size from
40 pixels to 30 pixels.

00:06:18.274 --> 00:06:20.135
This subtitle looks fine,

00:06:20.135 --> 00:06:23.540
and here our form has a
horizontal direction.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.910
I'm going to change
it to vertical,

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.380
but this button doesn't take up

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.285
the whole width of its parent.

00:06:29.285 --> 00:06:31.940
Well, let me select this
Subscribe button here,

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.450
and I'm going to set
its width to 100%.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.060
And I'm going to remove
this left margin

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.670
here from 20 pixels to zero.

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:41.435
Nice.

00:06:41.435 --> 00:06:44.000
And also I'm going to set
a specific height to that.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.805
So let me write 80 pixels.

00:06:46.805 --> 00:06:50.525
The only thing left is to
add some top margins here.

00:06:50.525 --> 00:06:51.785
So I'm gonna give it

00:06:51.785 --> 00:06:55.400
a 20 pixels top margin,
just like that.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.905
Now let me go back
to my instance.

00:06:57.905 --> 00:06:58.715
Here it is.

00:06:58.715 --> 00:07:00.815
It looks amazing, doesn't it?

00:07:00.815 --> 00:07:02.150
Alright, the last
thing we need to

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:03.920
change here is our footer.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.310
As you can see, this kind of
layout doesn't look good for

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.940
our mobile landscape and
mobile portrayed Definitely.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.710
So what should we do here?

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.974
We have a horizontal direction.

00:07:14.974 --> 00:07:16.640
So I'm going to double-click on

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.145
this footer and I'm going
to select my container.

00:07:19.145 --> 00:07:20.420
And then I'm going to modify

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.225
the direction from
horizontal to vertical.

00:07:23.225 --> 00:07:26.135
And also I'm going to change
the alignment to center.

00:07:26.135 --> 00:07:29.390
Then I'm going to select this
footer content if block,

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.370
align everything to the center.

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:33.950
And also I'm going to
select this address and

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:36.995
change its topography
alignment to the center.

00:07:36.995 --> 00:07:38.540
Finally, I'm going to select

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.460
this filter content if block,

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.325
and I'm going to add some
bottom margins here.

00:07:43.325 --> 00:07:46.040
Let's add a 30
pixel bottom margin

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.310
here are right, it
looks fantastic.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:51.305
Our homepage looks fine.

00:07:51.305 --> 00:07:54.080
Now let's go ahead and
modify other pages.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.585
I'm going to go to
my contact us page.

00:07:56.585 --> 00:07:58.400
Let's see how it looks here

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.040
or right here we have a problem.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.515
First, I'm going to
select this heading

00:08:03.515 --> 00:08:07.805
and I'm going to decrease
its font size 60-40.

00:08:07.805 --> 00:08:11.540
And then we need to modify
the layout of our four.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:15.050
I'm going to select this
Contact Form Wrapper degree

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:16.385
that we created.

00:08:16.385 --> 00:08:18.935
And if I click on
this pink button,

00:08:18.935 --> 00:08:21.905
you can see that we have
six columns and six rows.

00:08:21.905 --> 00:08:24.485
And in my opinion, it's
not a good grade for

00:08:24.485 --> 00:08:27.455
this mobile landscape and
even for mobile portrait,

00:08:27.455 --> 00:08:30.065
instead of having
these two text fields,

00:08:30.065 --> 00:08:32.390
the e-mail and the
phone text fields

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:33.905
sitting next to each other.

00:08:33.905 --> 00:08:36.170
I'm going to make all
these text fields

00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:37.640
stack on top of each other.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.895
So let me go ahead and remove
three columns from here.

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:42.125
Just like that.

00:08:42.125 --> 00:08:44.660
And I'm going to remove
one row as well.

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:45.995
Nothing changed.

00:08:45.995 --> 00:08:48.260
That's right, because
we need to go ahead and

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.590
manually select our
diblock, the first one.

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:55.054
And as you can see, this div
block takes up six columns.

00:08:55.054 --> 00:08:56.300
That's not what we want.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:59.510
I'm going to click on this
little circle and drag

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:02.915
it to the left side until
it takes up three cells.

00:09:02.915 --> 00:09:05.240
Cool, I'm gonna do
the same thing for

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.640
this message block as well.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.260
This is our last block.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:13.040
Let's go ahead and make it
take up only three cells.

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.480
Okay, it looks nice,

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.980
but what about this pattern?

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:17.330
I'm going to select it

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.775
and I'm going to do
the same thing here.

00:09:19.775 --> 00:09:20.660
There it is.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:23.180
Now our layout
looks much better.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.635
Let's preview it.

00:09:24.635 --> 00:09:25.895
Here is our form.

00:09:25.895 --> 00:09:30.110
It looks great in terms of
fluidity and responsiveness.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:32.330
And have you noticed
that our footer has

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.610
been changed on
this page as well,

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:36.455
since we are using symbols.

00:09:36.455 --> 00:09:39.455
When we make our symbols
responsive on one page,

00:09:39.455 --> 00:09:41.780
it will change on
other pages as well.

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.000
Now let's move on to
the project page.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.490
I'm gonna go ahead
and let me select

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:49.280
this projects template
are right, Cool.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.500
Let's see what we have here.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.305
As I can see, the
heading looks fine.

00:09:54.305 --> 00:09:56.525
The project page
type looks fine.

00:09:56.525 --> 00:09:57.574
Our right.

00:09:57.574 --> 00:09:58.655
So first of all,

00:09:58.655 --> 00:10:01.160
I'm going to select this
project type wrapper

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.605
and I'm going to change
its direction to vertical.

00:10:03.605 --> 00:10:04.250
Nice.

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:05.390
And then let me select

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:07.790
this project page
type text block

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:10.055
and let's add some
bottom margins to it.

00:10:10.055 --> 00:10:12.380
I'm going to add
ten pixels here.

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:13.445
It looks nice.

00:10:13.445 --> 00:10:15.020
What else do we need to do here?

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.325
As you can see here,

00:10:16.325 --> 00:10:19.160
the top margin of this
image is too much.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.530
If I select this
project type wrapper,

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:25.070
we can see that it has an
80 pixel bottom margin.

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:28.145
So I'm gonna go ahead and
decrease it to 40 pixels.

00:10:28.145 --> 00:10:29.765
Now it looks much better.

00:10:29.765 --> 00:10:31.385
I'm going to scroll down.

00:10:31.385 --> 00:10:32.750
And here as you can see,

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:34.655
we have too much space as well.

00:10:34.655 --> 00:10:37.850
So let's select this
rich texts here.

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:40.220
And then I'm going to
decrease its top margin

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:43.310
from 70 pig cells to 20 pixels.

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:45.905
And also, I'm gonna
go ahead and decrease

00:10:45.905 --> 00:10:50.390
its font size from 20
pixels to 17 pixels,

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:52.850
because right now we
are on mobile screens.

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:54.380
I'm going to scroll down.

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.915
I'm going to select these
other projects heading,

00:10:56.915 --> 00:11:01.235
and I'm going to decrease
its font size to 30 pixels.

00:11:01.235 --> 00:11:02.930
And here, as you can see,

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:04.490
we have too much space.

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:07.535
So let me select my
collection, this wrapper.

00:11:07.535 --> 00:11:10.129
And I am going to
decrease its top margin

00:11:10.129 --> 00:11:13.115
from 70 pixels to a 30 pixels.

00:11:13.115 --> 00:11:14.854
I'm going to scroll down.

00:11:14.854 --> 00:11:16.430
Everything looks fine.

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:19.010
Here, everything
looks fine as well.

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:22.265
Now let me check the
fluidity of my elements.

00:11:22.265 --> 00:11:23.345
Nice.

00:11:23.345 --> 00:11:25.325
Everything is responsive.

00:11:25.325 --> 00:11:27.395
But about here, great.

00:11:27.395 --> 00:11:28.430
I think if I select

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:31.970
this project page type and
I add more button margins,

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:33.380
it would be much better.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:37.880
I'm going to set the bottom
margin to 20 pixels.

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.755
It looks much better now,

00:11:39.755 --> 00:11:42.470
here we don't have
consistent spacing.

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:45.020
So I'm going to select
this project type wrapper.

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:48.215
I added, afford the pixel
bottom margin here.

00:11:48.215 --> 00:11:50.240
And for this rich text,

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.685
I added a 20 pixels top margin.

00:11:52.685 --> 00:11:54.860
I'm going to increase
this top margin to

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:57.844
40 pixels to have a
consistent spacing.

00:11:57.844 --> 00:11:59.165
Now it looks great.

00:11:59.165 --> 00:12:01.550
All right guys, that's
all for this video,

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:04.264
we successfully modify
the CSS properties

00:12:04.264 --> 00:12:05.780
of our elements on

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:08.150
the mobile landscape
breakpoint and we check

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:10.535
the fluidity of
all our elements.

00:12:10.535 --> 00:12:12.095
I hope you enjoyed this video

00:12:12.095 --> 00:12:14.760
and I'll see you
in the next one.
