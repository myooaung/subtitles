00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.870
Hey, in this video
we're going to talk

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.105
about Webflow hosting plans.

00:00:09.105 --> 00:00:12.000
I often get asked why
Webflow hosting is so

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.350
expensive compared to

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.200
other hosting options
like Bluehost,

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.120
Host, Gator, et cetera.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.565
When you build your
website using Webflow,

00:00:20.565 --> 00:00:23.250
you're not obliged to
use their hosting.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.825
If you have a paid account,

00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:26.190
you can simply export

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.755
your project and
hosted somewhere else,

00:00:28.755 --> 00:00:31.350
either for free or
for a low price.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.140
So why would you ever
use Webflow hosting

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.390
when you export the project
and hosted somewhere else,

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.265
you can no longer
use the CMS feature.

00:00:40.265 --> 00:00:43.400
It means your dynamic
pages won't work.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.840
Let's say the project doesn't

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.550
have any dynamic pages and it

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.910
only has some informational
static pages.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.410
You host your project somewhere

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.480
else and everything works fine.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.850
After a while, the
client wants to

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.715
add something or modify
something on the website,

00:00:58.715 --> 00:01:00.770
then they should
hire a developer to

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.065
go and change their
websites code,

00:01:03.065 --> 00:01:06.275
which is so time consuming
and frustrating.

00:01:06.275 --> 00:01:09.170
And they should repeat this
process again and again.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.660
Each time the developer
may charge him something

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.250
between $100 and $300
to make those changes.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.480
So if they want to change

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.345
their website's content
at least once a month,

00:01:20.345 --> 00:01:21.950
they should pay anything between

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.180
$1,200.30, $600 per year.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.790
Now let's compare it
to Webflow hosting.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.630
For most clients, the CMS
plan works best and it

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.515
cost $16 a month,
charged annually.

00:01:36.515 --> 00:01:39.680
That's $192 per year for

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.890
a hosting plan that comes
with lots of features.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.480
First, they can edit

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.895
their website using
workflows editor,

00:01:46.895 --> 00:01:49.820
and they don't have to
rely on anyone else.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.550
Second, they can use
all the features or

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.194
Webflow like CMS,
editor, designer, etc.

00:01:56.194 --> 00:01:59.975
Third, workflow automatically
creates backups for them.

00:01:59.975 --> 00:02:03.185
Additionally, Webflow
hosting offers CDN,

00:02:03.185 --> 00:02:06.830
which stands for content
delivery network that ensures

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.050
faster page loads by delivering

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.125
content from the servers
closest to the user.

00:02:12.125 --> 00:02:13.370
It also comes with

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.550
a free SSL which makes
their website secure,

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.645
gains Google's trust and
eventually improves their SEO.

00:02:20.645 --> 00:02:21.770
So in my opinion,

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.720
workflow hosting
is totally worth

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.330
it based on the
value it provides.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.495
Are right guys, that's all
about Webflow hosting.

00:02:29.495 --> 00:02:31.295
I hope you liked this video

00:02:31.295 --> 00:02:33.960
and I'll see you
in the next one.
