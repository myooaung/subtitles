00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.080
Hey, in this video
we're going to

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.825
start building our
navigation bar.

00:00:09.825 --> 00:00:13.080
So first let me head over
to my Figma project here.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.060
And as you can see
right at the top,

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.680
we have a navigation bar that

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.425
includes one logo on the left,

00:00:19.425 --> 00:00:22.260
then three different menus,
right in the middle.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.440
And finally, a Contact Us
button on the right side.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.885
So it should be placed
right at the top.

00:00:27.885 --> 00:00:29.970
As you can see,
this homepage has

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.145
a background color
which is not White.

00:00:32.145 --> 00:00:33.735
So for this background,

00:00:33.735 --> 00:00:36.755
I used a color called
neutral light.

00:00:36.755 --> 00:00:39.200
If I go to my color
styles, as you can see,

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.745
I have this neutral color

00:00:40.745 --> 00:00:42.485
and I used it for my background.

00:00:42.485 --> 00:00:44.510
And this is the
same color that we

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.520
used for all different pages.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.085
Therefore, all of our pages in

00:00:49.085 --> 00:00:52.445
our project should have the
same background scholar.

00:00:52.445 --> 00:00:54.845
And in order to make
our lives much easier,

00:00:54.845 --> 00:00:57.860
we're going to create
some global swatches for

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.270
our colors in order to

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.490
reuse them again and
again and later.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.350
If you decide to
make some changes,

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.720
you don't need to go
ahead and manually change

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.375
the color of all your
elements one by one.

00:01:08.375 --> 00:01:10.100
You can just make the change.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.945
And the change
will be applied to

00:01:11.945 --> 00:01:15.305
all the elements using that
particular global swatch.

00:01:15.305 --> 00:01:17.645
We already talked
about global swatches,

00:01:17.645 --> 00:01:20.990
but we're going to now
create some for our project.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.835
Alright, so let's begin first,

00:01:22.835 --> 00:01:25.430
I'm going to head over to
my design system here.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.630
And I'm not going to create

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.760
global swatches for
all these colors

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.470
because some of these colors

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.615
are not used in this project.

00:01:32.615 --> 00:01:35.405
I just created them to
have a good color scheme.

00:01:35.405 --> 00:01:38.705
And later if you need to add
some colors to your project,

00:01:38.705 --> 00:01:41.525
or you may need to
change some colors.

00:01:41.525 --> 00:01:44.855
You could just have some
predefined colors here,

00:01:44.855 --> 00:01:46.790
but we're not going
to use all of them.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.409
So if I go to Webflow,

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.465
and here I'm going
to select body,

00:01:50.465 --> 00:01:52.655
and then I'm gonna
go to the selector.

00:01:52.655 --> 00:01:55.370
And here, if I just click once,

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:56.780
you can see that we will get

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.195
this HTML tag, which is pink.

00:01:59.195 --> 00:02:01.340
It says body all pages.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.640
These HTML tags are so
useful because we can

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.825
define some default stylings
or different tags, e.g.

00:02:08.825 --> 00:02:12.365
body on pages or all ones,

00:02:12.365 --> 00:02:16.775
or all H 3s for our headings
or four paragraphs,

00:02:16.775 --> 00:02:19.010
we will talk about them
later, but for now,

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.380
I'm going to select
body all pages.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.335
So once I select
this body all pages,

00:02:24.335 --> 00:02:28.550
I can define some default
styling for the body tag.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.450
So here I'm gonna go ahead
and change the color,

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.535
and I'm going to
need a color code

00:02:34.535 --> 00:02:37.175
if I go to my Figma
project here,

00:02:37.175 --> 00:02:40.295
as you can see, I wrote
the color code here.

00:02:40.295 --> 00:02:41.795
You can just double-click on it

00:02:41.795 --> 00:02:43.835
and then you can
copy and paste it,

00:02:43.835 --> 00:02:45.590
command C or control C.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.065
Then you can head over
to your Web Flow.

00:02:48.065 --> 00:02:52.505
And here you can just paste
it command V or Control V.

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:54.860
And if I hit Enter, there we go.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.585
The color has been changed.

00:02:56.585 --> 00:02:57.845
But as I mentioned before,

00:02:57.845 --> 00:02:59.630
I'm going to create
different swatches,

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.090
different global swatches
for this project.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.010
So I'm going to hit
this Plus button,

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.610
and here I'm going to
write neutral light,

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.855
neutral forward slash light.

00:03:11.855 --> 00:03:13.730
Then I'm going to create it.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:14.885
Alright, cool.

00:03:14.885 --> 00:03:16.850
Now I'm going to
need more colors.

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.490
So let's go ahead and
create all the swatches

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.310
here that we're going to
need for this project.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.220
So I'm gonna go ahead and
copy this color code,

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.295
the one right next to
this neutral light.

00:03:28.295 --> 00:03:30.140
I'm going to copy
it and I'm going

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.940
to create a new swatch.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.270
Let me change the color
code to the new one.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.515
And I'm going to call it
neutral medium, just like that.

00:03:39.515 --> 00:03:41.525
And I'm going to create
the next swatch.

00:03:41.525 --> 00:03:43.640
So let's go to Figma
and I'm going to

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.130
copy this dark color code.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.110
And let me create a swatch.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.140
And I'm going to change the
color code and let's call

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.125
it neutral dark are right,

00:03:54.125 --> 00:03:56.105
we need three more colors.

00:03:56.105 --> 00:03:57.860
We need our primary color,

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.180
which is this blue.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.220
I'm going to copy
the color code.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.514
And I'm going to
create a new swatch,

00:04:03.514 --> 00:04:06.140
paste it here and here.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.540
I'm going to call it
primary slash default.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.625
Are right, Create.

00:04:13.625 --> 00:04:16.355
Now I'm going to
go ahead and copy

00:04:16.355 --> 00:04:19.250
this color code for
this orange color.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.220
I'm going to copy it and
let's create a new swatch.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.080
Paste the color code here,

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.860
and let's name it
secondary. Hit Create.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.925
And finally, I'm gonna go ahead
and copy this color code,

00:04:31.925 --> 00:04:33.755
this light blue color,

00:04:33.755 --> 00:04:35.855
and let me create a swatch.

00:04:35.855 --> 00:04:37.655
I'm going to paste it here,

00:04:37.655 --> 00:04:41.750
and let's call it neutral
light blue are right,

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.420
grades are global,
swatches are ready,

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:45.440
but make sure to use

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.020
your neutral light
color for your body.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.420
All pages stack
right now we created

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.850
these swatches inside
the typography section.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.235
That's why our background
didn't change.

00:04:55.235 --> 00:04:57.710
So that's totally fine
because we can use

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:58.910
these swatches in

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:00.740
the background Scholars
section as well.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.005
So if I head over to
the background scholar,

00:05:03.005 --> 00:05:05.225
I can select this color and

00:05:05.225 --> 00:05:07.685
I can change it
to neutral light.

00:05:07.685 --> 00:05:10.610
Now, my background's color
has been changed and I

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.610
can reset this typography
color as well.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.070
I can hold down my
Option key or Alt key on

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.620
my keyboard and I can
click on it. There we go.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.300
The topography is
columnar has been

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.235
reset and we're good to go.

00:05:22.235 --> 00:05:23.660
So now that our background is

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.850
ready and our
colors are radians,

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.045
well, we can start creating
our navigation bar.

00:05:29.045 --> 00:05:31.610
So let's see what we have here.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.470
As you can see, I created

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.740
different sections
inside this project.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.050
Let me show you how
it's structured.

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.165
So right at the top
we have navbar.

00:05:41.165 --> 00:05:42.305
This is a section.

00:05:42.305 --> 00:05:44.705
And if I open it up inside,

00:05:44.705 --> 00:05:46.025
we have a container.

00:05:46.025 --> 00:05:47.915
And if I open it up inside,

00:05:47.915 --> 00:05:48.980
we have different elements.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.180
We have the menus,

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.484
we have the button,

00:05:51.484 --> 00:05:52.745
and we have the logo.

00:05:52.745 --> 00:05:54.140
That's so simple.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.850
We have the hero section,

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.475
the client section, and so on.

00:05:58.475 --> 00:06:01.190
All these sections
have a container,

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.270
as you can see here,

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.440
we have a container and

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.360
inside we have
different elements.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.925
Inside this section we have

00:06:07.925 --> 00:06:10.985
a container and inside we
have different elements.

00:06:10.985 --> 00:06:12.785
And we're going to structure

00:06:12.785 --> 00:06:15.605
our project inside
Webflow in the same way.

00:06:15.605 --> 00:06:17.150
Alright, so now we're going to

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.355
start creating our
navigation bar.

00:06:19.355 --> 00:06:21.380
In order to create
a navigation bar,

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.169
we need to head over to
the add elements section.

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:25.730
And I'm going to scroll down to

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.605
find the navbar components.

00:06:27.605 --> 00:06:29.645
I'm going to drag
and drop it here.

00:06:29.645 --> 00:06:30.485
There we go.

00:06:30.485 --> 00:06:32.120
We have most of the elements

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.800
we are going to need
for this project,

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.765
but we need some
changes to make.

00:06:35.765 --> 00:06:37.880
So here inside this nav bar,

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.525
as you can see, we have a
container like in our design.

00:06:41.525 --> 00:06:43.910
Here inside this nav bar,

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:45.139
we have a container.

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:47.360
But this container by default

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.760
has a specific maximum width,

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.890
and this is not the
maximum width we

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:54.065
are going to use
in this project.

00:06:54.065 --> 00:06:56.060
By default, the maximum width of

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.510
this container is
set to 940 pixels.

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.040
But for this project,

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.155
the maximum width
of our container

00:07:03.155 --> 00:07:05.570
is going to be 1,100 pixels.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.430
Why? Because if I head over to

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.040
my design here, and if I e.g.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.010
select this recent
projects inside,

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:14.600
if I select the container

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.310
on the right side
in the Inspector,

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:20.060
you can see that the
width as 1,100 pixels.

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.269
That's why we need to
create our own container.

00:07:23.269 --> 00:07:24.530
And it's very easy.

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:26.525
We just need a deep black with

00:07:26.525 --> 00:07:28.775
some specific size properties.

00:07:28.775 --> 00:07:32.405
Alright, so first, let's
create our own container.

00:07:32.405 --> 00:07:34.340
I'm gonna go to the Add section.

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.200
I'm going to drag
and drop a div block

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.480
here inside this nav bar.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.415
And let's give it a class.

00:07:40.415 --> 00:07:43.040
I'm going to call it container.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.365
We're going to use
this class for

00:07:45.365 --> 00:07:47.315
other containers as well.

00:07:47.315 --> 00:07:50.150
So here for the maximum width,

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:54.245
I'm going to set it
to 1,100 pixels.

00:07:54.245 --> 00:07:56.989
And then we need to
center this container.

00:07:56.989 --> 00:07:58.745
Do you remember how
we could do that?

00:07:58.745 --> 00:07:59.780
Yes, you are right.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:02.420
We can just click
on this little icon

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:03.785
here, and there we go.

00:08:03.785 --> 00:08:04.819
It's centered.

00:08:04.819 --> 00:08:07.940
So now we just created
a container that has

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:11.225
a maximum width of 1,100 pixels.

00:08:11.225 --> 00:08:14.690
And it's centered because
we clicked on this button

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:18.455
and it's left and right
margins are set to auto.

00:08:18.455 --> 00:08:20.030
That's why it's centered.

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:21.620
We already discussed that.

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.480
Alright, What else do
we need to do now?

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.545
Because it's right now.

00:08:24.545 --> 00:08:26.795
Here we have two containers.

00:08:26.795 --> 00:08:29.045
If I open up this
main container,

00:08:29.045 --> 00:08:32.765
I can just drag all the
elements and drop them inside

00:08:32.765 --> 00:08:35.060
our new container because

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:37.025
we don't need this
container anymore.

00:08:37.025 --> 00:08:40.370
Let me start with this
logo link, brand link.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.500
I'm going to drag it
and make sure that you

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:45.080
drop it inside your
new container.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.195
It should be nested inside.

00:08:47.195 --> 00:08:49.610
Then I'm going to
select the nav menu.

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:51.200
I'm going to do the same thing.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.435
And finally this Menu button,

00:08:53.435 --> 00:08:54.740
and let's put it here.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:55.670
Alright, cool.

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:58.280
Now we can select
this container,

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.545
the main container,
and remove that.

00:09:00.545 --> 00:09:02.645
Alright, our container is ready.

00:09:02.645 --> 00:09:04.220
And since this container is

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.290
going to be used
for this navbar,

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:08.225
I'm going to give
it a combo class.

00:09:08.225 --> 00:09:08.780
Why?

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:10.550
Because later we're going to use

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:14.555
this container class name for
other containers as well.

00:09:14.555 --> 00:09:17.885
So here I'm going to
create a new combo class,

00:09:17.885 --> 00:09:20.120
and I'm going to call it navbar.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.700
Now, let's set the
display setting to

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:27.035
flexbox instead of
block, just like that.

00:09:27.035 --> 00:09:29.329
And here, as you can see inside,

00:09:29.329 --> 00:09:30.785
we have different elements.

00:09:30.785 --> 00:09:32.630
We have the brand link block,

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:35.030
we have this Nav Menu diblock.

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:37.445
And finally we have
this Menu button,

00:09:37.445 --> 00:09:39.920
which is not visible
because this Menu button

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.650
appears when we go to tablet,

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:44.840
as you can see here, or mobile.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.880
We already talked about that.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.620
So what do we need to do now?

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:50.870
First, I'm going to
select this container and

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:53.300
I'm going to change some
of its properties here.

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:55.055
I'm going to start with a line.

00:09:55.055 --> 00:09:57.140
I'm going to align
it to the center.

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:58.610
And also I'm going to change

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:02.195
the justification to
space between why?

00:10:02.195 --> 00:10:05.270
Because if you go to our
design project here,

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:07.865
you can see that our
logo and our button,

00:10:07.865 --> 00:10:10.220
or touching the edges
of this container.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.904
Okay, so that's why
I need to change

00:10:12.904 --> 00:10:15.305
the justification
of this container

00:10:15.305 --> 00:10:17.390
to space between,
if you remember,

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:19.280
when we set it to space between

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.065
our first element touches

00:10:21.065 --> 00:10:22.969
the left side of this container,

00:10:22.969 --> 00:10:24.350
and our last element

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:26.810
touches the right side
of this container.

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:28.655
That's exactly what we want,

00:10:28.655 --> 00:10:31.370
but here we need something else.

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:33.020
We need a button as well.

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:34.505
So let's create one.

00:10:34.505 --> 00:10:37.160
I'm gonna go ahead and
drag and drop it button.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.975
Inside this container.

00:10:38.975 --> 00:10:39.950
There we go.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:43.460
We've got our button and
their placement looks great

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:45.440
because our button touches

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.420
the right side of our container.

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:48.770
Alright, now let's go ahead and

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:50.690
select this brand link black.

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:53.045
And I'm going to give
it a class name.

00:10:53.045 --> 00:10:57.290
So here I'm going to
call it nav bar logo.

00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:01.415
That's right, navbar
underscore, underscore.

00:11:01.415 --> 00:11:04.745
I'm going to use two
underscores and logo.

00:11:04.745 --> 00:11:05.255
There we go.

00:11:05.255 --> 00:11:07.160
You can name it
however you want.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.829
This is the way that I
structure my classes.

00:11:09.829 --> 00:11:12.230
I will talk about
class names later,

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:14.780
what system you can
use for your projects.

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:17.930
But it doesn't matter as
long as you know what

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:21.335
you're doing and as long
as your names make sense,

00:11:21.335 --> 00:11:24.590
you can decide how you want
to name your elements.

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:27.320
So here we have navbar logo,

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:30.320
and then I'm going to head
over to the backgrounds here,

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.880
and I'm going to
add an image here.

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:35.705
Okay, Let's choose image
and from my assets,

00:11:35.705 --> 00:11:38.540
I'm going to look
for Seroquel SVG.

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.325
This is the logo. Great.

00:11:40.325 --> 00:11:41.660
I'm going to select that.

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.040
What else do I need to do?

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:43.685
First?

00:11:43.685 --> 00:11:45.620
I'm going to set it to contain,

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:48.800
then I'm going to change
its position to center.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.125
And finally, I'm going
to change the tile

00:11:51.125 --> 00:11:53.855
to don't tile just like that.

00:11:53.855 --> 00:11:56.210
But it looks too big, isn't it?

00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:59.420
So I'm gonna go ahead and
change its size property.

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:01.655
Let's set the width to

00:12:01.655 --> 00:12:06.185
60 pixels and the
height to pixels.

00:12:06.185 --> 00:12:08.240
You can adjust them
however you want.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.135
But based on my
design file here,

00:12:11.135 --> 00:12:12.905
if I select this logo,

00:12:12.905 --> 00:12:14.495
you can see that its width is

00:12:14.495 --> 00:12:18.905
roughly 60 pixels and its
height is set to 18 pixels.

00:12:18.905 --> 00:12:19.790
Alright, cool.

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:21.590
Our logo looks great.

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:24.200
Now we need to create
our nav menus.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.960
So here in our
design file we have

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.990
home, projects and services.

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:31.340
And the home, which is

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:33.860
the selected page
or selected menu,

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:36.140
should have the
primary color and

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:39.500
the others should have
the neutral medium color,

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:40.565
as you can see here.

00:12:40.565 --> 00:12:42.515
So let's go ahead and
create our menus.

00:12:42.515 --> 00:12:45.080
We have the home, we have
about I'm going to change

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:50.450
the about two projects and
the contact to services.

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:52.310
Okay, cool.

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:53.675
What else do we need to do?

00:12:53.675 --> 00:12:55.460
As you can see, we are using

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:59.315
a medium font here and
median wait for these menus,

00:12:59.315 --> 00:13:02.060
but here, this little light.

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.115
So I'm going to
select one of them.

00:13:04.115 --> 00:13:07.070
It doesn't matter which one
I'm going to start put home.

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:09.185
And I'm gonna give it a class.

00:13:09.185 --> 00:13:09.845
Why?

00:13:09.845 --> 00:13:11.180
Because we are going to reuse

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:12.800
the styles that
we're going to set

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.815
for this particular nav
link again and again.

00:13:15.815 --> 00:13:18.500
So it makes sense to
give it a class here.

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:21.410
And I'm going to
write nav underscore,

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:24.965
underscore link, just like that.

00:13:24.965 --> 00:13:26.270
Now I'm going to head over to

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:27.740
the typography section here,

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:30.560
and I'm going to change
the font to Roboto,

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.840
the one that we added before,

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:36.619
and the weight is set
to 400 or normal.

00:13:36.619 --> 00:13:40.130
I'm going to set it
to 500 or medium.

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:43.655
And the font size is
going to be 17 pixels.

00:13:43.655 --> 00:13:46.130
As you can see here,
we have 17 points.

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:48.815
Alright, let's set it to 17.

00:13:48.815 --> 00:13:50.345
Alright, what about the color?

00:13:50.345 --> 00:13:54.005
Let's set the color
to neutral medium.

00:13:54.005 --> 00:13:56.270
Nice, and we're almost done.

00:13:56.270 --> 00:14:00.485
Now that we apply these stylings
to this first nav link,

00:14:00.485 --> 00:14:02.465
we can select our second link.

00:14:02.465 --> 00:14:04.235
And here we're going to use

00:14:04.235 --> 00:14:06.560
the nav link class just

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.080
like that for the
third one as well.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.415
All right, cool.

00:14:10.415 --> 00:14:12.875
But what about the
color of the first one?

00:14:12.875 --> 00:14:15.170
Should entity use
the primary color?

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:17.600
Yes, it should. So
how can we do that?

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.740
It's so simple.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:20.720
We need to create a combo class.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.134
So while this first
link is selected,

00:14:23.134 --> 00:14:25.400
I'm going to create
a new canvas class.

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.425
And let's call it current.

00:14:27.425 --> 00:14:29.975
It means the current
page is selected.

00:14:29.975 --> 00:14:33.335
Then I'm going to change
its color to primary.

00:14:33.335 --> 00:14:36.335
Our menus are ready as well.

00:14:36.335 --> 00:14:38.675
Cool, but what
about this button?

00:14:38.675 --> 00:14:40.865
Well, we need to
modify this pattern.

00:14:40.865 --> 00:14:42.725
So I'm going to
select this pattern.

00:14:42.725 --> 00:14:44.600
I'm going to give it a class.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.940
I'm going to name
it primary button.

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:50.675
Great, then I'm going to start
changing its properties.

00:14:50.675 --> 00:14:53.210
First, I'm going to change
the typography here,

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:54.785
the font to Roboto,

00:14:54.785 --> 00:14:58.130
and the weight is going to
be 400 normal, that's fine.

00:14:58.130 --> 00:14:59.375
What about the size?

00:14:59.375 --> 00:15:01.414
It's going to be 17 pixels.

00:15:01.414 --> 00:15:04.535
If you go to the
design file here,

00:15:04.535 --> 00:15:05.885
if you select this font,

00:15:05.885 --> 00:15:08.600
you can see that it says 17.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:12.635
And I can change the fonts
way to medium as well.

00:15:12.635 --> 00:15:14.180
But let's see how it goes.

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:15.305
Then I'm going to change

00:15:15.305 --> 00:15:18.710
its background color
to our primary color.

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:21.995
And finally, let me modify
the text to contact us.

00:15:21.995 --> 00:15:22.970
Alright, cool.

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:24.425
But what about the padding?

00:15:24.425 --> 00:15:25.940
Because here as you can see,

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:28.805
we have more padding
around this text.

00:15:28.805 --> 00:15:31.805
I'm going to select this
Contact Us text here.

00:15:31.805 --> 00:15:33.470
I'm going to hold
down the Option key

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:35.164
or Alt key on my keyboard,

00:15:35.164 --> 00:15:36.845
and then I can see the padding.

00:15:36.845 --> 00:15:40.730
Alright, our top and bottom
padding are 15 pixels,

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:45.995
and our left and right
padding are set to 33 pixels.

00:15:45.995 --> 00:15:48.800
So let's go ahead and
select this button.

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:51.980
And then here in this
pacing sanction,

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:54.545
we're going to change the
padding, not the margin.

00:15:54.545 --> 00:15:57.050
Remember padding is
the space inside

00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:58.640
our elements and margin is

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:00.545
the space outside our elements.

00:16:00.545 --> 00:16:03.260
So here I'm going to
modify the top and

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.350
bottom padding to 15 pixels.

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:08.360
I'm going to hold
down the Option key

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.220
or Alt key on my keyboard and

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:15.125
modifying the right and left
padding to around 30 pixels.

00:16:15.125 --> 00:16:16.895
It looks fine, right?

00:16:16.895 --> 00:16:18.005
It looks great.

00:16:18.005 --> 00:16:20.360
But what about this
background's color?

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:21.680
If I select this nav bar,

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:22.910
you can see that we have this

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:24.710
light gray background color,

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:26.225
which is not what we want.

00:16:26.225 --> 00:16:29.555
Because here we have a
transparent background.

00:16:29.555 --> 00:16:31.984
So wine, this
navbar is selected.

00:16:31.984 --> 00:16:34.355
I'm gonna give you the class
and I'm going to write

00:16:34.355 --> 00:16:37.040
navbar just like that.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.920
And finally, if I head over
to the background's color,

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:43.940
here, I'm going to
write transparent.

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.865
There we go, the
background is gone.

00:16:46.865 --> 00:16:49.865
Alright, but what
about the top margin?

00:16:49.865 --> 00:16:51.110
Here? As you can see,

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:53.075
we have some top margin.

00:16:53.075 --> 00:16:55.370
If I select my
container and I hold

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:57.830
down the Option key or
Alt key on my keyboard.

00:16:57.830 --> 00:16:59.525
I can see the top margin here.

00:16:59.525 --> 00:17:01.520
It says 70 pixels.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.624
So let's go ahead and
add some margins.

00:17:04.624 --> 00:17:07.850
To do that, I'm going to
select my container because

00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:12.335
our container here has
a 70 pixel top margin.

00:17:12.335 --> 00:17:16.040
And then if I head over
to the spacing section,

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:20.224
I can just add some
top margin like this.

00:17:20.224 --> 00:17:24.365
I can set it to 70
pixels, just like that.

00:17:24.365 --> 00:17:28.100
And that's all our
navigation bar is ready.

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:30.635
We are not going to talk
about responsiveness now.

00:17:30.635 --> 00:17:32.195
We will talk about it later,

00:17:32.195 --> 00:17:34.730
are right guys, that's
all for this video.

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:36.440
I hope you enjoyed it and I

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.270
will see you in the next video.
