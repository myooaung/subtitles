00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.570
Hey, welcome back.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.350
So far you learned what
SEO is and how we can

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.780
optimize your web
pages in order to

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.300
rank higher on different
search engines.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.485
But in this lesson,

00:00:16.485 --> 00:00:17.580
we're going to talk about

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.865
site verification and
Google Analytics.

00:00:20.865 --> 00:00:23.070
When a new website is published,

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.475
Google usually tries to
index it automatically,

00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:28.530
but sometimes it
takes so long for

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.315
Google to go ahead and
check out our website,

00:00:31.315 --> 00:00:34.205
check different pages,
and rank our website.

00:00:34.205 --> 00:00:36.140
Therefore, we can go
ahead and introduce

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.104
our website to Google manually.

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:39.485
So how can we do that?

00:00:39.485 --> 00:00:42.785
To do so, we need to work
with two different platforms.

00:00:42.785 --> 00:00:45.905
If you go ahead and look
for Google Search Console,

00:00:45.905 --> 00:00:48.575
and here you can find
Google Search Console.

00:00:48.575 --> 00:00:49.715
I'm going to open it up.

00:00:49.715 --> 00:00:51.095
Here is the platform.

00:00:51.095 --> 00:00:53.120
It says Search Console tools and

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.295
reports help you
measure your site,

00:00:55.295 --> 00:00:57.290
search traffic and performance

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.580
fixed issues and make

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.815
your site shine in
Google search results.

00:01:00.815 --> 00:01:02.435
That's exactly what we need.

00:01:02.435 --> 00:01:04.160
The other platform
we are going to work

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.275
with is called Google Analytics.

00:01:06.275 --> 00:01:08.494
But first we're gonna
go ahead and verify

00:01:08.494 --> 00:01:11.540
our website using
Google Search Console.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.800
How can we do that?

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.940
Well, it's so simple.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.290
First of all, make sure to go

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.180
ahead and create a free account.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.675
And then if I go to
the project settings,

00:01:20.675 --> 00:01:22.970
and if I go to the SEO tab here,

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.619
I can scroll down.

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.665
Here it says Google
site verification,

00:01:27.665 --> 00:01:29.090
and here there is a link.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.405
You can also click on this
link to go to this website.

00:01:32.405 --> 00:01:33.665
That's totally up to you.

00:01:33.665 --> 00:01:35.405
Since I'm already logged in,

00:01:35.405 --> 00:01:36.740
I'm going to click on it.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:37.415
There we go.

00:01:37.415 --> 00:01:40.055
If you already verified
some website before,

00:01:40.055 --> 00:01:41.420
you might see this page,

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.015
but if you haven't verified
any website before,

00:01:44.015 --> 00:01:45.455
you might see a dialogue.

00:01:45.455 --> 00:01:48.410
Okay, so if you're seeing
a diet unlike don't worry,

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.255
I'm gonna go ahead and
show you what to do.

00:01:50.255 --> 00:01:53.435
But in case you have already
verified some websites,

00:01:53.435 --> 00:01:54.980
you need to head
over and click on

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.890
this link and you need
to add a property here.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.645
Just add property.

00:01:59.645 --> 00:02:01.430
Then here we have two options.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.740
We have domain, we
have URL prefix.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.065
I'm going to select
the right option here.

00:02:06.065 --> 00:02:09.845
And here is where you need
to pace your website's URL.

00:02:09.845 --> 00:02:11.930
So if I go to my website,

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.120
I can go ahead and
publish my website.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.535
I'm going to publish to
the selected domains,

00:02:16.535 --> 00:02:18.545
and here is our domain, okay?

00:02:18.545 --> 00:02:20.765
In your case, it's
definitely different

00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:23.600
because this URL is
unique to each project.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.115
So you need to open it up.

00:02:25.115 --> 00:02:27.275
Here. You need to copy this URL.

00:02:27.275 --> 00:02:29.600
Remember, copy this
URL completely

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.510
including HTTP or HTTPS.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.355
So I'm going to copy it.

00:02:34.355 --> 00:02:36.290
I'm going to go ahead and go

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.359
to the Google Search Console.

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:39.560
Let me go ahead and create

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.635
a property and let me
paste it right here.

00:02:42.635 --> 00:02:43.730
Hit Continue.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.490
There we go. And here there
are many different ways

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.265
to verify the ownership
of this website.

00:02:49.265 --> 00:02:51.050
But let me show you
the simplest one.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.630
I'm gonna go to HTML tag here.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.145
And here as you can see,

00:02:55.145 --> 00:02:56.690
we have this tag click on

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.705
this Copy button and paste
it on a text editor.

00:02:59.705 --> 00:03:00.425
There we go.

00:03:00.425 --> 00:03:03.290
Let me increase the
font size are right.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.045
Once you paste that here,

00:03:05.045 --> 00:03:08.375
you need to grab this content
code, just like that.

00:03:08.375 --> 00:03:09.590
Make sure to grab

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.950
only the text between
these quotation marks.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.075
I'm going to copy it.

00:03:14.075 --> 00:03:16.925
And then if I go to
my project settings,

00:03:16.925 --> 00:03:18.500
I can paste it here.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.245
This is our Google
site verification ID.

00:03:21.245 --> 00:03:23.225
Then hit Save Changes.

00:03:23.225 --> 00:03:25.820
Nice, but here is
the important part.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.800
Once you save the changes,

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.725
you need to go ahead and publish
your website once again,

00:03:30.725 --> 00:03:32.285
otherwise, it won't work.

00:03:32.285 --> 00:03:33.695
Don't forget this step.

00:03:33.695 --> 00:03:36.770
Okay, I'm gonna publish
to select the domains.

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.174
Nice. Now let's go to
the Google Console,

00:03:40.174 --> 00:03:43.580
and here I'm going to
hit this Verify button.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:44.885
There we go.

00:03:44.885 --> 00:03:46.490
Ownership verified.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.040
Now I can hit done, nice,

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.870
but since I have
different projects,

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.110
I need to go ahead and choose
this particular URL here.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.670
If you have only this project,

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.080
you don't need to
worry about it.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.655
And here on this search bar,

00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:00.410
I'm going to go ahead and paste

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.605
the URL of our website,
which is this one.

00:04:03.605 --> 00:04:04.910
I'm going to copy it,

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.880
paste it here, enter right here.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.010
It says URL is not on Google,

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.420
but that's totally fine.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.105
It says this page is
not in the index,

00:04:14.105 --> 00:04:15.530
but not because of an error.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.320
That's fine because it
takes some time to work.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.180
However, we can go ahead and

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.175
click on this request indexing.

00:04:22.175 --> 00:04:25.130
It says testing if live
URL can be indexed,

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.520
it takes a minute or two
submitting your request.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.590
And there we go,
indexing requests

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:31.790
that I'm going to click on.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:32.375
Got it.

00:04:32.375 --> 00:04:35.180
But how can we make sure
that everything went well?

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.535
Well, we can go ahead
and click on this Test.

00:04:37.535 --> 00:04:39.500
Live URL are right,

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.575
as you can see, it says URL
is available to Google.

00:04:42.575 --> 00:04:44.360
Url can be indexed.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.425
And also we can click on
this View test that page.

00:04:48.425 --> 00:04:51.335
And on the right side we
can see our website's code.

00:04:51.335 --> 00:04:53.225
We can go to screenshot.

00:04:53.225 --> 00:04:56.449
As you can see, there is a
screenshot of our website.

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:58.505
More Info. Okay, Perfect.

00:04:58.505 --> 00:05:00.650
Now our website is verified.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.685
The next step is creating an
account on Google Analytics.

00:05:04.685 --> 00:05:06.380
So if you just go ahead and

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.645
search google
Analytics and Google,

00:05:08.645 --> 00:05:10.445
you can create an account,

00:05:10.445 --> 00:05:13.325
it's totally free using
your Gmail account.

00:05:13.325 --> 00:05:15.125
And then once you are logged in,

00:05:15.125 --> 00:05:17.105
you will see
something like this.

00:05:17.105 --> 00:05:18.635
So what should you do here?

00:05:18.635 --> 00:05:20.450
You need to go to the admin

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.595
here at the bottom of this page.

00:05:22.595 --> 00:05:25.565
And here we have different
options, account and property.

00:05:25.565 --> 00:05:27.710
You need to create
a new property

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.660
are right here it says create

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.090
a Google Analytics for
property to measure

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.555
your web or app
data property name.

00:05:35.555 --> 00:05:40.355
I'm going to write
Seroquel design agency.

00:05:40.355 --> 00:05:42.200
And here reporting time zone,

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.340
it doesn't matter for now,

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.660
the currency doesn't matter.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.865
You can go ahead and
modify them if you wish.

00:05:46.865 --> 00:05:49.700
Hit Next. Here you need
to choose an industry.

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.230
I'm going to choose computer

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.675
and electronics, business size,

00:05:53.675 --> 00:05:56.510
small, and you can
just check some of

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.735
these checkboxes for our
example, they don't matter.

00:05:59.735 --> 00:06:01.730
I'm going to click on
the Create button.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:02.510
Perfect.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.220
Now we need to
choose a platform,

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.485
web, Android app and iOS app.

00:06:06.485 --> 00:06:09.695
I'm gonna go with web
because this is our website.

00:06:09.695 --> 00:06:12.335
And here we need to
pace our website's URL.

00:06:12.335 --> 00:06:14.435
We have the HTTPS here.

00:06:14.435 --> 00:06:16.085
So I'm gonna go ahead and copy

00:06:16.085 --> 00:06:19.415
only this part of the
URL and paste it here.

00:06:19.415 --> 00:06:21.290
And the stream name is gonna be

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:24.110
just write something
like circle,

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.755
agency and create
stream are right,

00:06:27.755 --> 00:06:29.045
it has been created.

00:06:29.045 --> 00:06:31.955
What do we need here is
this measurements ID.

00:06:31.955 --> 00:06:35.105
If you click on this Copy
button, you can copy it.

00:06:35.105 --> 00:06:37.579
And if you head over to
the project settings,

00:06:37.579 --> 00:06:39.920
you can go to the
integration step.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.390
Our right hand here we have

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:44.450
Google Universal
Analytics tracking ID.

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:47.015
You need to paste the
measurement ID that you

00:06:47.015 --> 00:06:49.910
copied here are right, Nice.

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.505
Make sure that this
switch is enabled.

00:06:52.505 --> 00:06:56.765
Use global site tag and
hit Save Changes. Nice.

00:06:56.765 --> 00:06:59.150
And then remember to
publish your website

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.030
once again, published
successfully.

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:03.710
And now we can actually measure

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:05.645
the performance of our website.

00:07:05.645 --> 00:07:07.400
Google Analytics helps you to

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.725
understand a user's behavior,

00:07:09.725 --> 00:07:12.125
what they like, where they are,

00:07:12.125 --> 00:07:15.350
how they interact with your
website, and so much more.

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:16.685
So it's essential for

00:07:16.685 --> 00:07:19.940
any website to integrate
with Google Analytics.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.875
So if I go to the reports here,

00:07:21.875 --> 00:07:23.960
I can see some statistics here.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.630
I can go to the
real-time. There we go.

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:28.580
I can go to different sections,

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.965
such as demographics, e.g.

00:07:30.965 --> 00:07:32.540
demographics overview.

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.955
For now, since we don't
have any viewers,

00:07:34.955 --> 00:07:36.650
we won't get any data.

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:38.090
But once we publish

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:40.625
our website and we
drive traffic to it,

00:07:40.625 --> 00:07:43.100
you can head over to the
report section and you will

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.740
see all kinds of
statistics and data.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.300
Right now I'm going to mention

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.830
something important when you

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:50.330
connect a custom domain to

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.670
your website and you publish it,

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:55.520
you need to head over to
the SEO section here,

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.469
and you need to make
sure to disable

00:07:57.469 --> 00:07:59.465
Webflow SOP domain indexing.

00:07:59.465 --> 00:08:02.195
It's very important if
you don't disable it,

00:08:02.195 --> 00:08:03.950
Google and other search engines

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:06.230
might rank your website
lower because there

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:07.820
is a duplicated version of

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.325
your website published
on a sub-domain.

00:08:10.325 --> 00:08:12.409
So always make sure to disable

00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:15.440
Webflow sub-domain
indexing just like that,

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.155
and save changes and
publish your website.

00:08:18.155 --> 00:08:19.939
It's very, very important.

00:08:19.939 --> 00:08:22.385
All right guys, that's
all for this video.

00:08:22.385 --> 00:08:26.580
I hope you enjoyed it and I'll
see you in the next video.
