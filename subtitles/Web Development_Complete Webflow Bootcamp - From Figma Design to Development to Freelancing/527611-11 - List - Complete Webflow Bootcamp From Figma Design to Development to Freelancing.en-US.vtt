00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.120
There are times that we want

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.880
at least some elements
in our project.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.115
No matter if we have a list of

00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:13.515
images or at least of items,

00:00:13.515 --> 00:00:16.380
that list element
could be so helpful.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.220
So if you go to the Add section
under the basic category,

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.975
you can find a list.

00:00:21.975 --> 00:00:24.945
If I drag and drop the
list into my container,

00:00:24.945 --> 00:00:29.309
you can see that by default
it has a three list items.

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:32.700
And as you can see, this list
settings window pops up.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.575
We have two types of lists.

00:00:34.575 --> 00:00:37.985
We have the unordered list
and the ordered list.

00:00:37.985 --> 00:00:39.545
The difference is this.

00:00:39.545 --> 00:00:42.965
When you use an unordered
list, there is no number.

00:00:42.965 --> 00:00:45.200
If you set it to ordered,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.970
you can see we have numbers.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.040
Let me select this list and

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.940
modify the color of this text.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.980
White that you could
see better, perfect.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.495
If I set it to an order,

00:00:56.495 --> 00:00:57.890
you can see that we have on

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.365
the bullet points in
terms of styling,

00:01:00.365 --> 00:01:03.785
we have no bullets
at all and bullets.

00:01:03.785 --> 00:01:05.480
So let me double-click on

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.305
the first list item
here to add something.

00:01:09.305 --> 00:01:10.865
Let's write elements.

00:01:10.865 --> 00:01:12.350
For the second one,

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.420
I'm going to write
something else.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.420
Let's write web design.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.565
For the last one, I'm going
to write web development.

00:01:22.565 --> 00:01:24.020
Alright, great.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.095
So now we have three
different list items.

00:01:27.095 --> 00:01:29.750
And if I want to add
more lists items,

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.930
I can simply copy
and paste it using

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.500
Command C and Command V
or Control C and Control

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.255
will be alternatively,

00:01:38.255 --> 00:01:40.160
you can go to the Add section.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.160
And under the basic category
you can see that we

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.625
have a separate element
for the list item.

00:01:46.625 --> 00:01:48.005
You can drag and drop

00:01:48.005 --> 00:01:52.355
a list item only inside
a list, just like that.

00:01:52.355 --> 00:01:54.620
But can we actually
lists some images?

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.520
Of course we can.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.510
Let me show you.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.030
I can go to the Assets
and I can drag and

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.550
drop an image here. There we go.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.700
I'm going to decrease
its width to,

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.845
let's say, 300 pixels.

00:02:06.845 --> 00:02:09.380
So no matter what kind
of elements you have,

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.525
you can always list them.

00:02:11.525 --> 00:02:14.030
If you want to open up
the least settings,

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.370
you can select
your list elements

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.960
in the navigator and you can

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.160
click on the Settings icon
right next to the list name.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.925
There we go.

00:02:22.925 --> 00:02:24.470
Alternatively, you can select

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.080
your list elements and
you can head over to

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.300
the elements settings right next

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.850
to the style panel right here.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.770
And we have the least settings.
