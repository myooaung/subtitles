00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.725
Now that you've learned
about flexbox and grid,

00:00:07.725 --> 00:00:09.705
it's time to compare them

00:00:09.705 --> 00:00:12.180
side-by-side to see which one

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.205
you should use for
which purpose.

00:00:14.205 --> 00:00:16.560
Well, let me mention
that sometimes there

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.020
is no right or wrong way when it

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.430
comes to web development

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.110
because you can achieve
something using

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.145
grid and you may achieve the
same thing using a flexbox.

00:00:26.145 --> 00:00:28.740
So sometimes it all comes to

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.045
our preferences and how we
want to structure our website.

00:00:33.045 --> 00:00:35.205
Therefore, I'm going to
show you some examples

00:00:35.205 --> 00:00:37.560
to understand the
difference better.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.770
First of all, you need
to know that when

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.185
we have one-dimensional layouts,

00:00:42.185 --> 00:00:44.990
it's probably best
to use a Flexbox,

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.450
but sometimes if you
want to make our design

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.465
responsive and make
our life much easier,

00:00:50.465 --> 00:00:53.645
we can do the same
thing using a grid.

00:00:53.645 --> 00:00:56.450
So here I have a card
inside this section.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.255
I'm gonna go ahead and
add a container here.

00:00:59.255 --> 00:01:01.475
I'm going to drag and
drop a container.

00:01:01.475 --> 00:01:05.000
And then let me add the
class container to that.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.190
And finally, I'm
going to drag and

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.439
drop this card
into my container.

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:14.420
Nice. Now I'm going to copy
it and paste it three times.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.020
Okay?

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.270
Alright, let me
select my section

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.880
since I turned it
to a flexbox and

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.640
now I'm going to select
my container and I'm

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.460
going to change the display
setting to flex max.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.415
And here we have a
horizontal Flexbox.

00:01:28.415 --> 00:01:30.980
And as you can see,
everything looks great.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.070
I can change the
justification to

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.865
space between two
space around left,

00:01:37.865 --> 00:01:40.010
middle, whatever I want.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.385
But now I'm using a
one-dimensional layout.

00:01:43.385 --> 00:01:46.250
If I have two
containers like this,

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.175
now we have a
two-dimensional layout.

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:52.790
It probably makes more
sense to use a grid.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.030
Now let's check this layout
on different breakpoints.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.340
I'm gonna go to tablets
and as you can see,

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.160
it shrinks. Okay, nice.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.210
However, if you want to make
our design more responsive,

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.405
it would make sense to
use a grid as well,

00:02:08.405 --> 00:02:11.000
even for one-dimensional layout,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.755
It's totally up to you.

00:02:12.755 --> 00:02:14.315
As I mentioned before,

00:02:14.315 --> 00:02:16.790
there is no right or wrong way.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.490
Sometimes we just
need to focus on

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.800
our preferences and
focus on the fact

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.470
that which way suits
our needs better.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.400
Now let me go ahead and
drag and drop a grid here.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.280
I'm going to put it
inside my section and let

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.250
me drag these cards
inside this grid.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.430
Of course I could turn
this container to a grid,

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.415
but I'm going to do this
manually, just like this.

00:02:40.415 --> 00:02:42.410
I'm going to remove
the container.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.835
And now we have this grid
which is inside our section.

00:02:46.835 --> 00:02:50.180
Oops, I'm going to copy
and paste this card.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.190
Once again, let me select

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.875
this grid and I'm going
to add a class to it.

00:02:54.875 --> 00:02:56.735
I'm going to call it grid.

00:02:56.735 --> 00:02:59.480
Then let me add some margin from

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.925
both sides are right, Cool.

00:03:01.925 --> 00:03:03.365
Just like a flexbox,

00:03:03.365 --> 00:03:06.785
we can control the child
of a grid as well.

00:03:06.785 --> 00:03:09.800
So here, if I select this child,

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.305
this card, I can
modify the alignment.

00:03:12.305 --> 00:03:14.660
I can change the justify here,

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.420
I can change the
order, and so on.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.180
So it comes to you to
decide whether you

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.300
need to use a grid or Flexbox.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.480
Make sure to work with both
of them and check which

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.495
one makes more sense
to use for your needs.

00:03:29.495 --> 00:03:31.940
Are right guys, that's
all for this video.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.530
I'll see you in the next one.
