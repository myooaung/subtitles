00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.795
Hey, in this video,

00:00:06.795 --> 00:00:10.080
we're gonna talk about
states and transitions.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.585
Well, let's start with states.

00:00:12.585 --> 00:00:16.710
Every element we work with
has some default state,

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.794
like none, hardware
pressed, forecast, etc.

00:00:21.794 --> 00:00:24.630
depending on the type
of elements are,

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.895
states might change as well.

00:00:26.895 --> 00:00:29.115
So let me show you an example.

00:00:29.115 --> 00:00:30.925
If I select this button,

00:00:30.925 --> 00:00:34.460
button element and I head over
to the selectors section,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.460
you can see that there
is this down arrow icon.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.265
If I click on that, we will
get access to our states.

00:00:40.265 --> 00:00:45.380
We have non hover pressed
forecast visited.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.480
So if I select hover,

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.490
I can go ahead and adjust

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.785
the properties of
the hover state.

00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:55.040
So when the user hovers
over this element,

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.175
the new properties will be
applied to this element.

00:00:58.175 --> 00:01:01.670
So let me go ahead and modify
the background's color.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.640
I'm going to change it
to something lighter are

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.045
right now in order to see
whether it works or not,

00:01:08.045 --> 00:01:10.970
first, I need to go
back to the non-state.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.965
I'm going to go to non-state.

00:01:12.965 --> 00:01:15.155
And if I hover
over, there we go.

00:01:15.155 --> 00:01:17.540
As you can see, as
soon as I hover over

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.450
this button, it's color changes.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.020
When I change the properties
of any of these states,

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.770
this blue indicator appears
indicating that there are

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.300
some properties that we

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.925
modified for these
particular state.

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:33.350
But what about pressed?

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.395
Well, since I changed the
properties of harbor,

00:01:36.395 --> 00:01:38.240
depressed state will inherit

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.935
from the properties of harbor.

00:01:39.935 --> 00:01:41.105
Let me prove that to you.

00:01:41.105 --> 00:01:42.950
If I select that, There we go.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.050
We've got our light blue now,

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.840
however, we can
also modify that.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.340
I'm gonna go ahead and change

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.275
this color to something darker.

00:01:51.275 --> 00:01:53.600
And now if I go to none,

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.040
if I preview that,

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.960
and now when I hover over,

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.985
I will get the light blue.

00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:00.200
And if I press,

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.945
you can see that we
will get the dark blue.

00:02:02.945 --> 00:02:05.900
So this is basically
all about states.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.315
But now I'm going to show
you another example.

00:02:08.315 --> 00:02:10.310
If I scroll down here,

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.635
I have a TextField here.

00:02:12.635 --> 00:02:16.010
For TextField, we have
an additional state.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.580
If I select it, if I go
to open up my state,

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.280
you can see we have this
placeholder as well.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.170
And if I go to place holder,

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.540
I can customize
the appearance and

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.420
styling this placeholder text.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.175
Enter your email, okay,

00:02:31.175 --> 00:02:35.225
because right now I can't
modify that in the non-state,

00:02:35.225 --> 00:02:36.875
but if I go to place holder,

00:02:36.875 --> 00:02:40.250
I can simply modify
its color, e.g.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.350
to read or to anything else.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.960
So let me reset that for
now and I'm going to

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.870
show you another state
of this TextField.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.675
The text field also
has the focus state,

00:02:50.675 --> 00:02:54.155
and this state is very
useful for text inputs.

00:02:54.155 --> 00:02:55.880
Let me show you
how it works if I

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.249
select it and if I go to,

00:02:58.249 --> 00:03:00.395
let's say box shadows,

00:03:00.395 --> 00:03:03.905
I'm going to add some
shadows to this state.

00:03:03.905 --> 00:03:08.780
Let me change the angle and
also the distance, the blur.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.775
I'm going to increase the blur.

00:03:10.775 --> 00:03:15.605
And I'm going to also increase
the size and finally,

00:03:15.605 --> 00:03:18.320
decrease the opacity are right.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.240
Now let's see what happens.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.760
I'm going to preview
it. Nothing happens.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.830
But as soon as I click here,

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.710
you can see that the
focus state appears.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.290
We can use States
for almost anything,

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.140
even for images, for div blocks,

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.160
as you can see here,

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.975
we have different states.

00:03:35.975 --> 00:03:39.860
They are so useful for
these subtle interactions.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.780
But if I hover over this button,

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.320
you can see that we don't have
a smooth transition here.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.985
So how can we fix that?

00:03:46.985 --> 00:03:51.065
Well, we need to use the
transition section here,

00:03:51.065 --> 00:03:54.470
the one that we didn't talk
about in the previous lesson.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.890
But now I'm going to show you
how it works when we modify

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.975
the properties of
different states

00:03:59.975 --> 00:04:02.555
or we add some effects
to our elements,

00:04:02.555 --> 00:04:05.855
we can animate those
changes using transitions.

00:04:05.855 --> 00:04:07.460
So right now we have

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.665
three different states
for this button.

00:04:09.665 --> 00:04:11.660
None hover and press.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.225
And whenever we want
to add the transition,

00:04:14.225 --> 00:04:16.520
we need to go to the non-state.

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.685
It's very important, otherwise
it's not going to work.

00:04:19.685 --> 00:04:22.100
So while we are in the
non-state, as you can see,

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.140
nothing appears here indicating

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.850
that we are in the non-state.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.470
I'm going to add a transition.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.085
And here I need to specify
the type of transition.

00:04:31.085 --> 00:04:33.185
So I changed the
background scholar.

00:04:33.185 --> 00:04:36.200
I'm gonna go ahead and
look for background color.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.530
As you can see, we can
animate all the properties,

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.284
even margin and padding,

00:04:41.284 --> 00:04:44.765
flakes, topography,
borders, anything.

00:04:44.765 --> 00:04:46.835
I'm going to select
Background Color,

00:04:46.835 --> 00:04:48.635
and then we have the duration.

00:04:48.635 --> 00:04:51.395
By default it's set
to 200 milliseconds.

00:04:51.395 --> 00:04:53.810
And the easing method,
just like that,

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.390
we will talk about the
easing editor and using

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.480
methods later because it's
kinda advance for now.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.045
Later on, we will
dive into it for now.

00:05:02.045 --> 00:05:03.650
We're not going to
touch upon that.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.105
Let's see how it works.

00:05:05.105 --> 00:05:07.190
I'm going to preview
it, and there we go.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.205
Now we have this
smooth transition.

00:05:10.205 --> 00:05:13.340
And the transition
applies to all states.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.850
If I press, we have a
smooth transition as well.

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.170
So let's go ahead and do

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.720
the same thing for
our text input.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.390
I'm going to select
this text field and I'm

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.165
going to make sure that
I'm in the non-state.

00:05:26.165 --> 00:05:29.495
And then let's go ahead
and add the transitions.

00:05:29.495 --> 00:05:31.985
From here. I'm going
to change the type

00:05:31.985 --> 00:05:34.700
from opacity to box-shadow.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:35.510
There we go.

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.700
And I'm going to change
the duration this time

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.070
to get a more
dramatic transition.

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.900
Let's say I'm going
to increase it to

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.780
500 milliseconds
or half a second.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.250
Let's preview that.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.485
If I click here, there we go.

00:05:48.485 --> 00:05:49.760
Now it's forecast.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:50.900
And you need to understand that

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.120
transitions work both ways.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.935
If I click somewhere else

00:05:54.935 --> 00:05:56.855
in order to go to the non-state,

00:05:56.855 --> 00:06:00.410
you can see that it will be
animated as well. Let's see.

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:01.445
Did you see that?

00:06:01.445 --> 00:06:05.030
So this is basically how
transitions and states work.

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:06.710
If you want to add some simple

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.599
interactions to our elements,

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:10.460
like what I just showed you,

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.250
we can always use
transitions and

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.995
also we can use 2D
and 3D transforms.

00:06:15.995 --> 00:06:18.650
But for more advanced
interactions,

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:19.880
we are going to use

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.405
the interactions panel and
we will talk about it later.

00:06:23.405 --> 00:06:25.550
But before we wrap
up this video,

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.635
I'm going to show
you another example.

00:06:27.635 --> 00:06:29.270
I'm going to select this image,

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.170
this image diblock, and let
me go to another state.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.805
I'm gonna go to hover.

00:06:34.805 --> 00:06:37.625
I'm going to add a
2D and 3D transform

00:06:37.625 --> 00:06:39.005
and let me scale it.

00:06:39.005 --> 00:06:41.180
I'm going to slightly scale it,

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.640
and then I'm gonna
go back to none.

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.220
And finally, let me
add a transition to

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.130
it and I'm going to
animate transform.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.005
Let's preview that.

00:06:51.005 --> 00:06:52.160
There we go.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.450
Did you see that?

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:54.770
But as you can see,

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.095
it doesn't work
for other images.

00:06:57.095 --> 00:06:59.210
That's because for
these elements,

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.040
I added a combo class.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.815
Okay, So this transition and

00:07:03.815 --> 00:07:06.260
all these interactions only work

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.840
for these particular div block.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.690
If I want to apply to
all these div blocks,

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:14.915
what I'm gonna do is
remove this combo class.

00:07:14.915 --> 00:07:17.075
So now if I go to hover,

00:07:17.075 --> 00:07:19.565
I add the scale transition.

00:07:19.565 --> 00:07:23.165
Since we already added
it, it's still there.

00:07:23.165 --> 00:07:26.195
So I'm going to go
ahead and modify that.

00:07:26.195 --> 00:07:28.910
Are right. Let me go to none.

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:34.085
And I'm going to add the
transitions here to transform.

00:07:34.085 --> 00:07:38.150
And finally, let me add
my combo class again.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.385
Let's see if it works or not.

00:07:40.385 --> 00:07:42.290
I'm going to hover
over this element.

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:43.985
It works, this element,

00:07:43.985 --> 00:07:46.040
it works, and this elements.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.360
So that's how states and
transitions work are right,

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.625
everybody, I hope you
enjoyed this video.

00:07:52.625 --> 00:07:55.230
I'll see you in the next one.
