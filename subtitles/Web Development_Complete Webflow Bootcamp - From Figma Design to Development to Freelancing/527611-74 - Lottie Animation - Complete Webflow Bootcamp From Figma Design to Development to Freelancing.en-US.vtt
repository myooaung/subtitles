00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.135
Hey, in this video,

00:00:06.135 --> 00:00:07.740
I'm going to show
you how you can use

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.335
Lottie animations
in your projects.

00:00:10.335 --> 00:00:12.360
If you open up our
Seroquel project

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.025
that we created together,

00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:18.285
you can head over to the
Contact Us page here.

00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:22.485
As you remember, our form
had three different states.

00:00:22.485 --> 00:00:26.835
It had the normal state,
success and error.

00:00:26.835 --> 00:00:29.310
So if I just select
this contact form in

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.130
the navigator and I go to
the success state here.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.820
You can see that we have

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.685
this simple message
with a gray background.

00:00:37.685 --> 00:00:40.280
It's fine, but we can
make it look even better

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.400
by adding a Latina
animation here, e.g.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.770
we can add a conformation
animation here.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.020
How can we do that?
First, I'm going to

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.150
select this success
message div blank here.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.410
Then I'm going to head over
to the bank runs image.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.750
And I'm going to make it
transparent because we

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.285
don't need to get any
background color.

00:00:59.285 --> 00:01:00.035
Just like that.

00:01:00.035 --> 00:01:02.960
I'm going to decrease
the opacity to 0%.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:03.800
Alright, cool.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.759
Now I'm going to add a Lottie
element to this diblock.

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:10.160
So while this div
black is selected,

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.410
I'm going to head
over to the panel.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.780
And from here, I'm
going to drag and drop

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.760
this lovely animation and put it

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.430
right above my text
block. There we go.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.370
Here is our Latino
animation element,

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.040
but we don't have any
loyalty animation file.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.375
Where can we get one?

00:01:26.375 --> 00:01:29.120
Well, you can go to a
website called Lottie

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.465
files.com and it's the
official website of Lottie.

00:01:32.465 --> 00:01:35.075
There are great resources
you can find here,

00:01:35.075 --> 00:01:38.750
but what we need is just go
ahead to the Discover menu.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.750
And from here, I'm gonna
go to free animations.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.310
And here you can explore

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.170
many different free animations

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.020
created by different
contributors here.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.820
As you can see if I scroll down,

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.145
there are many cool
animations here,

00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:54.695
and you can simply
use them for free.

00:01:54.695 --> 00:01:57.425
You can go to other
pages as well.

00:01:57.425 --> 00:01:58.955
And depending on your needs,

00:01:58.955 --> 00:02:00.440
you can choose between them.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.105
So what do we need actually?

00:02:02.105 --> 00:02:04.910
Well, we're looking for a
confirmation animation.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.370
So using this search
bar at the top,

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.890
I'm going to look
for confirmation.

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.035
Are right, hit Enter,

00:02:12.035 --> 00:02:14.060
and let's see what we get.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.500
And as you can see here, we have

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.375
tons of different options.

00:02:17.375 --> 00:02:18.455
Let me see.

00:02:18.455 --> 00:02:19.985
I'm going to choose this one,

00:02:19.985 --> 00:02:22.700
the third one, you can
choose whatever you want.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.125
I'm gonna go with this one.

00:02:24.125 --> 00:02:27.425
And now I can simply click
on this Download button.

00:02:27.425 --> 00:02:30.800
And I need to download
the latae JSON file.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.560
To download the file, you need
to create a free account.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.120
So make sure to go ahead,

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.010
sign up first, are right

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.140
now I'm going to hit
over to Webflow.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.089
And I'm gonna go to Assets,

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:42.650
and I'm going to
drag and drop my

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.005
lithified into my assets. Okay?

00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:46.685
Okay, there it is.

00:02:46.685 --> 00:02:48.320
And then I'm going to select

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.075
this lovely animation elements.

00:02:50.075 --> 00:02:51.470
If I double-click on it,

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.050
I can replace this
lovely sequence.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.150
I'm going to choose
this JSON file

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.775
and I can preview
this animation.

00:02:58.775 --> 00:03:00.185
Alright, cool.

00:03:00.185 --> 00:03:01.865
However, it's too big.

00:03:01.865 --> 00:03:03.440
So while it's selected,

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.390
I'm gonna go ahead
and give it a class.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.260
Let me write latae animation.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.305
Then I'm going to give you
the specific maximum width.

00:03:12.305 --> 00:03:14.750
Let's write 100 pixels.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.540
That's fine, but
it's not centered.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.450
So I'm going to click on
this little button in

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.130
the spacing section to set

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.530
the left and right
margin to auto.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.980
And then I'm going to give
it some bottom margin.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.655
Let's add a 20 pixel
bottom margin here.

00:03:31.655 --> 00:03:34.130
I think it would
be enough. Nice.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.690
Let me preview it.

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.445
Are right, it looks good.

00:03:37.445 --> 00:03:40.160
However, we need to go ahead
and publish our website

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.980
and actually test it on
our published websites.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.255
So I'm going to publish it.

00:03:44.255 --> 00:03:46.115
And if I opened it up here,

00:03:46.115 --> 00:03:47.780
I'm going to fill this form.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.835
Let's write RH.

00:03:49.835 --> 00:03:54.110
And here I'm
goingtowritetest@gmail.com.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.020
And then let's write a message,

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.185
hello and submit our right,

00:04:00.185 --> 00:04:03.380
we will see this image but
the animation doesn't play.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.015
So what's wrong?

00:04:05.015 --> 00:04:06.485
How can we fix that?

00:04:06.485 --> 00:04:08.270
Well, to fix this issue,

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.300
we need to use the Webflow
Interactions section.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.120
Why? Because we need to
create an element trigger,

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.755
to trigger this animation.

00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:17.945
Let me head over to the
interactions panel.

00:04:17.945 --> 00:04:21.005
And from here I'm going to
create an element trigger.

00:04:21.005 --> 00:04:22.475
And our element is gonna be

00:04:22.475 --> 00:04:24.920
our submit button,
this primary button.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.710
So please select it
from the navigator

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.370
and create an element
trigger, mouse-click, tap.

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.535
Then I'm going to create
a new action here.

00:04:34.535 --> 00:04:36.695
It's going to be a
custom animation.

00:04:36.695 --> 00:04:39.590
Here I'm going to create
a new animation and

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.535
let's write latae animation.

00:04:43.535 --> 00:04:45.320
Okay, nice.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.925
So what should we do here?

00:04:46.925 --> 00:04:50.030
Now we need to select our
lighting animation element,

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.145
and then we need to
create an action.

00:04:52.145 --> 00:04:54.905
Here, as you can see under
the integration style,

00:04:54.905 --> 00:04:57.155
we have Lottie, I'm
going to choose loyalty.

00:04:57.155 --> 00:04:58.760
There we go. If I scroll down

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.380
here under the latae section,

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.440
you can see that they
can control the frames.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.180
I'm going to set it to zero per

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.490
cent because this
is our start point.

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.625
I'm going to create
a new action latae,

00:05:10.625 --> 00:05:13.880
and then let's turn
it to 100 per cent.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.485
If I preview it,

00:05:15.485 --> 00:05:17.870
it looks fine, but
it plays so fast,

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.970
so I'm going to change
its duration to

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.610
2 s. Let me preview it.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.515
It's much nicer, Isn't it?

00:05:24.515 --> 00:05:26.810
So let me save and we're done.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.560
So now I'm going to
publish my website here.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.450
And then I'm gonna go ahead and

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.835
refresh this Contact Us page.

00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:37.655
Let me fill this form again.

00:05:37.655 --> 00:05:39.455
I'm going to write our ash.

00:05:39.455 --> 00:05:42.500
And here let's
trytest@gmail.com.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.470
And for the message,
Let's write hello.

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.705
I'm going to hit
the Submit button.

00:05:47.705 --> 00:05:49.280
There we go.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.265
Our Latino animation
plays perfectly.

00:05:52.265 --> 00:05:54.095
So this is basically how you can

00:05:54.095 --> 00:05:56.615
add custom animation
to your website.

00:05:56.615 --> 00:05:59.165
And if you want to create
your own animation,

00:05:59.165 --> 00:06:00.380
and if you're familiar with

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.630
the software, Adobe
After Effects,

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:03.800
you can easily download

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.360
the naughty plugins and

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.175
then you can create
your animation in

00:06:07.175 --> 00:06:09.260
Adobe After Effects and export

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.605
your latae JSON file and
import it in Webflow.

00:06:12.605 --> 00:06:13.985
It's very simple.

00:06:13.985 --> 00:06:15.230
And this way you can create

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.705
some custom animations
for your project.

00:06:17.705 --> 00:06:19.280
You can also ask and motion

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.320
graphic designer to
do that for you.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.990
Alright guys, that's
all for this video.

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.170
I hope you enjoyed it and
I'll see you in the next one.
