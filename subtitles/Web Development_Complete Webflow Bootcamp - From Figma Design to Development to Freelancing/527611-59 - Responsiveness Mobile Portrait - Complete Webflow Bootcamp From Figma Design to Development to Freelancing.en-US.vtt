00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.180
Hey, welcome back.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.270
In this video, we're
gonna go ahead and make

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.400
our website responsive on

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.320
the more wild
portrait breakpoint.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.945
So if you're ready,
let's get started.

00:00:15.945 --> 00:00:18.795
I'm gonna go to the more
wine portrayed breakpoint.

00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:21.115
And let's see what we have here.

00:00:21.115 --> 00:00:23.390
I'm going to check the fluidity.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.810
Most are elements look fine
because we already made

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.185
some changes on the mobile
landscape breakpoint.

00:00:30.185 --> 00:00:33.035
So we don't need to make
so many changes here.

00:00:33.035 --> 00:00:34.940
The first thing I notice here is

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.450
the font size of this heading
for mobile portrayed.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.310
It looks too big.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.200
I'm going to select
it and I'm going to

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.915
decrease the font
size to a 30 pixels.

00:00:44.915 --> 00:00:47.945
The font size of this hero
description looks fine.

00:00:47.945 --> 00:00:49.520
I'm not going to change and add.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.140
What about these buttons?

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.345
They look fine, but let's see,

00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:56.750
if I make this screen
smaller, how they look.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.250
As you can see, they will be

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.740
shrinked and that's
not what I want.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.340
So I'm going to select
this block arrow buttons.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.230
And let me scroll up

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.230
the direction of this
Flexbox is horizontal.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.910
I'm going to change
it to vertical.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:11.990
And then I'm going to select

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.030
this getting touch
button and let me

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.190
remove its right margin.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.380
I'm going to set
it to zero, nice.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.050
And finally, I'm going to add
some bottom margins to it.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.505
So let's set its bottom
margin to 20 pixels.

00:01:25.505 --> 00:01:28.100
Now if I check the
fluidity of my elements,

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.515
you can see that they are
not shrinked anymore.

00:01:30.515 --> 00:01:32.690
Nice, the image looks fine.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.655
We already removed those cards.

00:01:34.655 --> 00:01:36.620
Logos look fine as well.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.845
However, since here we have
less space to work with.

00:01:39.845 --> 00:01:42.050
I think we can go
ahead and modify

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.915
the left and right
padding of our sections.

00:01:44.915 --> 00:01:45.890
What do you think?

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.300
I think it's a good idea?

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.025
I'm going to select
this section.

00:01:49.025 --> 00:01:50.600
And as you can see, the left and

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.955
right padding are set to 30.

00:01:52.955 --> 00:01:55.220
I'm gonna decrease
it to 20 pixels.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.080
But since I'm going
to apply this change

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.135
to all sections, first,

00:01:59.135 --> 00:02:00.770
I'm going to remove the hero

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.780
combo class because I need to

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.905
make this change to my base
class, this section class.

00:02:06.905 --> 00:02:09.260
I'm going to remove
this hero combo class.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.640
And then I'm going to hold

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.350
down the Option
key or Alt key on

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.995
my keyboard and decrease
the padding to 20 pixels.

00:02:15.995 --> 00:02:18.785
And again, I'm going to add
the hero combo class to it.

00:02:18.785 --> 00:02:19.760
Nice.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.740
Now, as you can see,

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.360
the left and right padding of

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.850
all sections have been modified.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.665
If I select these
clients section,

00:02:27.665 --> 00:02:29.525
there we go, the padding
has been changed.

00:02:29.525 --> 00:02:32.210
If I select this recent
projects section,

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.835
there it is, and now
they look much better.

00:02:34.835 --> 00:02:36.995
The recent projects
section look fine.

00:02:36.995 --> 00:02:39.440
I'm going to scroll down here.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.390
I think we need
to remove some of

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.330
these emojis because this
section is too noisy.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.415
So how can I remove
these emojis?

00:02:46.415 --> 00:02:49.265
I can just simply hit
Backspace or Delete

00:02:49.265 --> 00:02:50.660
because in that case it will be

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.640
removed from all breakpoints.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.030
Therefore, I'm going to set
its display setting to none.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.485
I'm going to select this one

00:02:57.485 --> 00:02:59.150
and I'm going to
do the same thing.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.620
And then I'm going to select

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.150
these tomb emojis and let's
change their position here.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.460
Let's set it to top-left.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.385
And for this one I'm going
to set it to top right.

00:03:10.385 --> 00:03:12.710
And let's move them
down a little bit.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.105
So maybe I could change.

00:03:14.105 --> 00:03:16.370
It's a tough position
a little bit.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.150
I'm going to set it to five
per cent for both of them.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.395
Are right.

00:03:21.395 --> 00:03:22.505
It looks nice.

00:03:22.505 --> 00:03:24.410
What about the font size here?

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.885
The font size looks
fine. In my opinion.

00:03:26.885 --> 00:03:28.445
We don't need to modify that,

00:03:28.445 --> 00:03:30.230
but here we have too much space.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.760
So maybe I can select

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.895
this section and I can
decrease its height from

00:03:34.895 --> 00:03:40.370
622 pixels to maybe 550 P cells.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:41.810
Now it looks much better,

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.565
in my opinion, are right,

00:03:43.565 --> 00:03:45.050
the last thing I'm gonna do

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.300
is change the size
of these memo.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.475
Geez, I'm going to
select this memo G,

00:03:49.475 --> 00:03:51.200
and I am going to
decrease its width and

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.734
height to 100 pixels.

00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:55.595
I'm going to do the
same thing here.

00:03:55.595 --> 00:03:58.624
Since they have
some combo classes,

00:03:58.624 --> 00:04:00.290
they look much better now.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.450
Now that I made them smaller,

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.595
I'm going to change
their position again.

00:04:04.595 --> 00:04:08.000
Let me move it to the left
side by five per cent.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.770
I'm going to move
this memo due to

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.140
the right side by five per cent.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.950
Amazing.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.460
Let me check the fluidity
of my elements. Nice.

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:20.135
Everything looks responsive
and looks great.

00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:22.250
Alright, let's move on
to the next section,

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.945
which is our services.

00:04:23.945 --> 00:04:25.805
These cards look great.

00:04:25.805 --> 00:04:27.785
We don't need to
make any changes.

00:04:27.785 --> 00:04:29.450
I'm going to go to
the next section,

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.280
which is the CTA section.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.230
So first I'm going
to select these

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.270
CTA heading and I'm going to

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.440
align it to the center in
the typography section,

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.825
probably I can increase
the line height

00:04:41.825 --> 00:04:44.690
as well to 150 per cent.

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.055
What about this for?

00:04:46.055 --> 00:04:48.200
Well, I can select
this form block

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.810
and its width is set to auto.

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.240
I can set it to 90 per cent.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.340
And I'm going to
select this text field

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.070
inside this CTA
TextField rapper.

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.655
And I'm going to change
its width to 100 per cent.

00:05:01.655 --> 00:05:04.160
So now it takes a
100 per cent of

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.105
its parent with nothing more
and nothing else is needed.

00:05:08.105 --> 00:05:10.235
Actually, it looks quite good.

00:05:10.235 --> 00:05:12.230
And a footer looks fine as well.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:13.940
So our homepage is ready.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.740
Let's check it out once again.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.475
If I try to make this
dimension even smaller,

00:05:19.475 --> 00:05:21.755
they will be outside
our viewport.

00:05:21.755 --> 00:05:23.435
Well, we can fix that.

00:05:23.435 --> 00:05:24.710
We can just select

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.740
this grid logos and
then modify the grid.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.050
We could simply
add two more rows

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.900
and just remove one
of these columns.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.160
Just like that.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.935
Now we want face
this issue anymore.

00:05:36.935 --> 00:05:39.950
Our right, our homepage
looks amazing.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.425
Now let's go ahead and
check out other pages.

00:05:42.425 --> 00:05:45.200
I'm going to go to the
Contact Us page here.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.565
Everything looks fine.

00:05:46.565 --> 00:05:49.070
I'm just going to preview
it and let me see

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.860
if it works well in
terms of fluidity,

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:52.970
it looks very good.

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.270
That's because we
used grid or button.

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:57.350
Looks fine as well.

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.150
What about our project page?

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.670
Let me go to the
project page here

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.265
and let me check if it
works perfectly as well.

00:06:04.265 --> 00:06:06.830
Are right, everything
looks fine.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.570
As you can see, I
need to increase

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.480
the line height of this
project page type.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.180
So I'm going to select
it and I'm going to

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.480
increase the line
height to 150 per cent.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.160
Now it looks much better.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.160
And let's check other
elements are right.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.020
The font size looks fine.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.855
The other project section
looks fine as well.

00:06:26.855 --> 00:06:28.354
I'm going to scroll down

00:06:28.354 --> 00:06:31.535
the CTA section looks
fine since it's a symbol.

00:06:31.535 --> 00:06:33.275
But here in the CTA section,

00:06:33.275 --> 00:06:36.005
we have one issue and
that is the padding.

00:06:36.005 --> 00:06:38.180
The padding here
is not consistent.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.950
So for other sections we

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.470
used a 20 pixel left
and right padding.

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:43.985
But for these CTA,

00:06:43.985 --> 00:06:45.755
I'm going to select
this section.

00:06:45.755 --> 00:06:47.060
As you can see, we have

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.295
the 20 pixel left
and right padding.

00:06:49.295 --> 00:06:51.020
So let's see how
we can fix that.

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.835
If I select this form block,

00:06:52.835 --> 00:06:55.985
we already set the width to 90%.

00:06:55.985 --> 00:06:58.039
I think we can set it to 100

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:00.259
per cent to fix this problem.

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:01.820
Let's see if we will face

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.595
any issues in terms of fluidity.

00:07:04.595 --> 00:07:07.159
So I'm gonna go back
to my instance,

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:09.665
and here I'm going
to preview it.

00:07:09.665 --> 00:07:11.000
Right.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:11.645
Now.

00:07:11.645 --> 00:07:13.685
It looks fine, just like that.

00:07:13.685 --> 00:07:15.005
It looks much better now,

00:07:15.005 --> 00:07:18.860
are right guys now we have
a fully responsive website.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.080
Did you see how easy
it is to work with

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.330
breakpoints and CSS properties?

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.110
If you stick to the rules and
basics, everything is easy.

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:29.210
So I'm gonna go ahead
and check all pages.

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.835
Now. I'm gonna go
to the homepage.

00:07:31.835 --> 00:07:33.365
I'm going to preview it.

00:07:33.365 --> 00:07:34.970
The desktop looks fine.

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:38.450
Everything looks great
here on all devices.

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.030
Let me move on to
other sections here.

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:43.234
Logos. Nice.

00:07:43.234 --> 00:07:45.470
What about recent projects?

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:48.905
It looks great on
all breakpoints.

00:07:48.905 --> 00:07:50.840
What about testimonial?

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.329
Great. And our services,

00:07:53.329 --> 00:07:54.500
let me check it out.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.290
Oops, here we have a
problem with the icons.

00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:59.225
So let me go ahead and fix that.

00:07:59.225 --> 00:08:01.145
I'm going to select
this service icon

00:08:01.145 --> 00:08:02.225
and I'm going to change

00:08:02.225 --> 00:08:05.390
their sizing to don't
shrink or grow.

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:07.865
I'm gonna do the same
thing for all of them.

00:08:07.865 --> 00:08:11.735
Nice, and let's check it
out once again. Cool.

00:08:11.735 --> 00:08:13.880
What about the CTA section?

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.540
It looks amazing and the
footer looks great as well.

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:18.830
Now let's go to

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:21.740
the Contact Us page and
I'm going to preview it.

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.585
The desktop version looks fine.

00:08:23.585 --> 00:08:25.850
The tablet looks fine as well.

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:30.035
My way landscape looks
amazing and mobile portraits.

00:08:30.035 --> 00:08:32.945
But if we go to
the project page,

00:08:32.945 --> 00:08:34.205
Let's check it out.

00:08:34.205 --> 00:08:35.480
I'm going to preview it.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.715
It looks fine here
on the desktop.

00:08:37.715 --> 00:08:40.190
I'm gonna go to
tablets. There we go.

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:41.555
I'm going to scroll down.

00:08:41.555 --> 00:08:42.170
Everything.

00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:42.995
Looks fine.

00:08:42.995 --> 00:08:45.110
Let me go to mobile landscape.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:48.965
All sections look great
and more buy-in portraits.

00:08:48.965 --> 00:08:49.580
Nice.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.880
One thing I noticed
here is when we are on

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.710
the desktop breakpoint and

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:56.735
when I make the screen smaller,

00:08:56.735 --> 00:08:59.855
just like that, you
can see at some point

00:08:59.855 --> 00:09:03.725
this Contact Us button touches
the edges of our viewport.

00:09:03.725 --> 00:09:05.090
It's not what we want,

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:06.500
so we need to fix that.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:07.910
How can we fix that?

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:11.105
Well, let me go ahead
and go to my navbar.

00:09:11.105 --> 00:09:14.135
And if I select this
navbar in the navigator,

00:09:14.135 --> 00:09:16.264
you can see that
there is no padding.

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:18.950
So while I'm on the
desktop breakpoint,

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:22.460
I'm going to add a 30 pixel
left and right padding here.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:23.480
So let me hold down

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.805
the Option key or Alt
key on my keyboard

00:09:25.805 --> 00:09:29.630
and add some left and right
padding to my navbar.

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:31.550
But here we have
another problem,

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:34.640
this container, some
padding as well.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.920
So I'm gonna go ahead
and remove the padding

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.890
here from 30 pixels to zero.

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:43.235
And also the right padding
is going to be zero as well.

00:09:43.235 --> 00:09:45.095
Now let's see if it works.

00:09:45.095 --> 00:09:46.655
I'm going to make it smaller.

00:09:46.655 --> 00:09:47.915
And there we go.

00:09:47.915 --> 00:09:50.960
On desktop, it looks
great now because we have

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.275
this additional padding on
the right and left side.

00:09:54.275 --> 00:09:56.210
But what if I go to tablet?

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:57.950
Let's see what happens here.

00:09:57.950 --> 00:09:59.825
We have this additional padding

00:09:59.825 --> 00:10:02.120
and we need to go
ahead and modify that.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.075
So while I'm on the
tablet break point,

00:10:05.075 --> 00:10:06.785
I'm going to select the nav bar,

00:10:06.785 --> 00:10:07.850
and I'm going to reset

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:10.580
this 30 pixel left
and right padding.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:12.080
I'm going to set it to zero.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:15.170
And here I'm going to
set it to zero as well.

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:17.915
Nice, and let's see
what happens now.

00:10:17.915 --> 00:10:18.470
There we go.

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:20.645
It looks fine. If
I go to tablet,

00:10:20.645 --> 00:10:23.420
it looks fine if I go
to mobile landscape,

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:27.530
everything is fine and mobile
porch rate are right guys,

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:30.140
our website is now
fully responsive.

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:34.590
I hope you enjoyed it and I'll
see you in the next video.
