00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.100
What happens when you
open up a webpage?

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.960
When you visit a webpage,

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.660
the browser actually
renders the code

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.930
written by the programmer
and shows you the result.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.790
So for instance, if you go to

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.015
your favorite website and
inspect the code yourself,

00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:23.905
you can see how that
website is built.

00:00:23.905 --> 00:00:25.310
You can also modify

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.845
that website's content
to have some fun.

00:00:27.845 --> 00:00:30.785
But locally, because once
you refresh the page,

00:00:30.785 --> 00:00:32.930
all your hard work is gone.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.020
So you may ask, why are
we talking about this?

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.335
Aren't we supposed to build
websites without coding?

00:00:39.335 --> 00:00:41.000
Yes, as I promised,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.985
we're not going to write
even a single line of code.

00:00:43.985 --> 00:00:46.565
But as a web designer
and web developer,

00:00:46.565 --> 00:00:49.085
it's crucial for you
to understand how

00:00:49.085 --> 00:00:51.845
a webpage is built
in a structured.

00:00:51.845 --> 00:00:53.840
When it comes to
web development,

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.955
there are two main
components that

00:00:55.955 --> 00:01:00.200
each webpage comes
with, HTML and CSS.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.635
Html stands for Hypertext
Markup Language.

00:01:03.635 --> 00:01:05.285
And it's all about the contents

00:01:05.285 --> 00:01:06.950
of a webpage that basically

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.519
tells the browser what
to show on the page,

00:01:10.519 --> 00:01:15.530
headings, images,
videos, buttons, etc.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.055
This is a simple HTML
code and as you can see,

00:01:19.055 --> 00:01:22.609
it includes some
elements like tidal,

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:28.370
body, H1, and p. These
are called HTML tags.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.975
This is how a browser

00:01:29.975 --> 00:01:32.870
understands what it should
display to the user,

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.535
but this page is boring.

00:01:34.535 --> 00:01:37.610
Don't you think so?
Well, we can style each

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.000
of these tags to make the
contents look more interesting.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.520
Back in the day, whenever
we wanted to style

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.240
our webpage is we needed to
style each tag one by one.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.765
And whenever we wanted to
modify our styles, guess what?

00:01:50.765 --> 00:01:54.140
We had to change each
inline style one by one.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.550
It's not very efficient.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.100
That's why we use CSS.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.385
Css stands for
Cascading Style Sheets.

00:02:01.385 --> 00:02:03.095
It allows us to create

00:02:03.095 --> 00:02:06.200
our styles once in
a separate file and

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.180
reuse them again and again
and again in our HTML file.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.010
It takes all the information

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.069
about color, positioning, size,

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.220
alignment, topography,
and so much more,

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.235
and it puts them into a
separate style sheet.

00:02:22.235 --> 00:02:24.620
Now whenever we want
to make changes,

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.365
we do it once and the
change is applied to

00:02:27.365 --> 00:02:30.350
all those HTML tags
simultaneously.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.135
But how does Webflow work?

00:02:32.135 --> 00:02:34.580
Do you remember when I
said we are going to code,

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.070
but visually, I
truly meant that.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.750
Let me show you how it works.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.770
Here is the designer and there
is nothing under Canvas.

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.840
If you go to the Add section,

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.700
we can find some elements.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.325
These are the exact
HTML elements,

00:02:49.325 --> 00:02:52.385
or let's say HTML tags
that we talked about.

00:02:52.385 --> 00:02:55.310
We have Section D, block,

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.925
heading, paragraph,
and so much more.

00:02:58.925 --> 00:03:00.530
Here in the navigator,

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.210
we have the body element.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.135
Do you remember the body
tag in the HTML file?

00:03:05.135 --> 00:03:08.555
This defines the main
content of the HTML file.

00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:11.285
Any HTML file has a body tag,

00:03:11.285 --> 00:03:14.045
and that's why when you
create a page on Webflow,

00:03:14.045 --> 00:03:16.790
you will always see the
body element there.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.635
By default, we can add

00:03:18.635 --> 00:03:22.655
other HTML tags inside
the body tag, e.g.

00:03:22.655 --> 00:03:24.680
if I go to the Add section,

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.035
I can drag and drop
a heading element

00:03:27.035 --> 00:03:29.750
into my Canvas and
look what happens.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.270
The heading is inside
the body element.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.670
So instead of writing
a bunch of codes,

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.620
we just drag and drop production

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.690
ready code that we
can interact with.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.175
What about styling?

00:03:40.175 --> 00:03:42.530
Well, if I select
this heading and head

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.095
over to the style panel
on the right side,

00:03:45.095 --> 00:03:46.460
I can easily modify

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.530
the CSS properties of

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.320
these particular
element just like that.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.910
And to prove that
you're actually

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.814
coding the page from scratch,

00:03:54.814 --> 00:03:58.160
I can click on this
CSS Preview button at

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.180
the bottom left to
preview my CSS code live.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.550
If I change the color
of this heading,

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.315
you can see that a new
property has been added here.

00:04:08.315 --> 00:04:09.590
So now I hope you have

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.005
a better understanding
of how a webpage

00:04:12.005 --> 00:04:16.890
works and most importantly,
how Webflow works.
