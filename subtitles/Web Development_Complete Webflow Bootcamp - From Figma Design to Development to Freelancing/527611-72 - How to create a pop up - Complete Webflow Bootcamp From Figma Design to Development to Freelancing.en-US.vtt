00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:08.070
Nowadays more and more
websites are using

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.240
pop-ups to ask the users
to do something, e.g.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.820
registering for the
newsletter or entering

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.820
their email addresses
or submitting a form.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.200
So in this video, I'm going to

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.520
show you how you can create

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.460
a pop-up easily
and conveniently.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.950
Are you ready?
Let's get started.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.160
In order to create
a pop-up, first,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.650
you need to understand the
structure of a pop up.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.570
A pop-up actually interrupts

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.284
the user's interaction
with your website.

00:00:35.284 --> 00:00:37.925
So it actually blocks
the website usage

00:00:37.925 --> 00:00:41.180
until the user take
some actions, e.g.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.325
filling a form or
submitting a form.

00:00:43.325 --> 00:00:45.785
How can we create
such an interaction?

00:00:45.785 --> 00:00:48.500
Welfare's, we need a diblock.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.885
So let me hit Command
key or Control key.

00:00:50.885 --> 00:00:52.625
I'm going to write the block.

00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:53.510
There we go.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.155
I'm going to put this the
black right below my body.

00:00:57.155 --> 00:00:58.775
It doesn't matter where it is.

00:00:58.775 --> 00:01:01.730
But in order to organize
everything properly,

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.535
I'm going to put it at
the top of my Navigator.

00:01:04.535 --> 00:01:06.125
Now let me give it a class.

00:01:06.125 --> 00:01:10.310
I'm going to write
pop-up wrapper.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.100
This pop-up rappers
should be fixed no

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.920
matter if the user
scrolls through the page.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.710
So let's go ahead and
change its position from

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.155
static to position
fixed, just like that.

00:01:22.155 --> 00:01:25.070
Then I'm going to set
its position to fool,

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.180
as you can see, takes up

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.700
the whole width and
height of our viewport.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.845
Here it says relative to body.

00:01:30.845 --> 00:01:32.630
Then I'm going to scroll down

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.655
and let me give it
a background color.

00:01:34.655 --> 00:01:37.070
I'm going to give it a
black background Scholar,

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.210
and I'm going to decrease

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.480
its opacity to create
this overlay effect.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.750
Alright, I'm gonna decrease
it to 70 per cent.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:45.500
Nice.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.765
As you can see, this
pop-up wrapper now

00:01:47.765 --> 00:01:50.060
is a bomb for some
of our elements,

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.160
but still there
are some elements

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.425
that are above these
pop-up wrapper,

00:01:54.425 --> 00:01:56.180
although it's placed on top of

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.920
our navigator, if you remember,

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.570
I told you that
it doesn't matter

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.775
where our element is
in the Navigator,

00:02:01.775 --> 00:02:04.940
we can always put our
elements on top of that.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.910
If we modify the Z index here,

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.060
I'm going to set
the Z index 29999.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.830
And this way I can make sure

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.960
that this pop-up wrapper will

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.965
always be on top of all
elements, just like that.

00:02:18.965 --> 00:02:20.165
Now as you can see,

00:02:20.165 --> 00:02:23.210
all the other elements are
behind this pop-up wrapper.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.095
Alright, cool.

00:02:24.095 --> 00:02:25.385
And if I scroll down,

00:02:25.385 --> 00:02:27.604
you can see that it's fixed.

00:02:27.604 --> 00:02:29.375
The first part is done.

00:02:29.375 --> 00:02:31.205
Now inside this wrapper,

00:02:31.205 --> 00:02:33.725
I'm going to create
a new div block.

00:02:33.725 --> 00:02:36.035
And that block can
contain anything.

00:02:36.035 --> 00:02:40.865
It can contain a form block
or a text, anything you want.

00:02:40.865 --> 00:02:42.095
But in this example,

00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:43.835
I'm going to create a form blank

00:02:43.835 --> 00:02:45.845
why this wrapper is selected.

00:02:45.845 --> 00:02:48.305
I'm gonna hit Command
key or Control K.

00:02:48.305 --> 00:02:50.150
Let's look for a diblock.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.285
There we go. And here I'm
going to give it a class.

00:02:53.285 --> 00:02:55.025
This time, I'm going to write

00:02:55.025 --> 00:02:59.390
pop-up underscore,
underscore model.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.870
And here I'm going to specify
the width and height.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.669
It's going to be 500
pixels by 300 pixels.

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:09.350
And let me go ahead and give

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.225
it a white background Scholar.

00:03:11.225 --> 00:03:14.885
Alright, now it's positioned
on the top left corner,

00:03:14.885 --> 00:03:16.460
but we want to center it.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.585
How can we do that?

00:03:17.585 --> 00:03:18.530
It's so simple.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.035
First we need to select
our pop-up wrapper.

00:03:21.035 --> 00:03:23.000
Then we need to just change

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.025
the display setting to Flexbox.

00:03:25.025 --> 00:03:28.100
As you know, we need to
modify the alignment to

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.205
center and the justification
to center as well.

00:03:31.205 --> 00:03:32.540
So in this pop-up modal,

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.220
we're going to
have a form block.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.839
So while it's selected,

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:38.435
I'm gonna hit Command
key or Control K.

00:03:38.435 --> 00:03:41.300
And let's look for a
form block. There we go.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.920
The form block has been added.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.640
And here I'm going to give
this form block a class.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.980
Let's write pop-up
underscore, underscore form.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.060
Okay, Let's set
the width to 100%,

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.145
and I'm going to set
the maximum width

00:03:58.145 --> 00:04:00.905
of 400 pixels for that,

00:04:00.905 --> 00:04:02.120
but it's not centered.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.700
So I'm going to select this
pop-up modal and I'm going

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.460
to change its display
setting to Flexbox.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.020
And let me change
the alignment to

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.015
center, just like that.

00:04:11.015 --> 00:04:13.085
Alright, here is
our simple form.

00:04:13.085 --> 00:04:15.290
We're not going to change
the styling because I just

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.810
want to show you how you
can create a pop-up.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.075
Alright, once the
pop-up shows up,

00:04:20.075 --> 00:04:22.730
they users should be able
to close it as well.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.530
So we're going to
need a close button.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.735
I'm gonna go ahead
and add a text link

00:04:26.735 --> 00:04:29.315
here inside our pop-up wrapper.

00:04:29.315 --> 00:04:30.740
Make sure that it's nested

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.350
inside our pop-up
wrapper. There it is.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:34.940
I'm gonna give you the class.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.325
Let's write pop-up.

00:04:37.325 --> 00:04:40.714
Underscore, underscore, close.

00:04:40.714 --> 00:04:44.090
I'm going to change its color
to white that we could see

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.690
that let me modify the
decoration to none.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.225
And here I'm going
to write close,

00:04:50.225 --> 00:04:52.190
but its position is wrong.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.130
Go, I'm going to place it
on the top right corner.

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.020
So while it's selected,

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.795
I'm going to change its
position to absolute.

00:04:59.795 --> 00:05:03.664
Nice. And then let me
position the two top right.

00:05:03.664 --> 00:05:04.550
There it is.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.140
Using these amounts here,

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.520
I'm going to set its right
position to maybe 8%.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.775
It's tough position to
eight per cent as well.

00:05:13.775 --> 00:05:15.770
Our right, our pop-up is ready,

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.545
but how can we actually
use it right now,

00:05:18.545 --> 00:05:19.970
if I preview it?

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.120
You can see that I cannot
interact with the website.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.935
And if I click on
the Close button,

00:05:24.935 --> 00:05:26.630
nothing happens because we

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.640
didn't create any interactions.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.240
So now it's time to go ahead
and create our interaction.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.555
But first, I'm going to
select this pop-up wrapper,

00:05:35.555 --> 00:05:38.120
and then I'm going to
change its display

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.010
setting from flake spikes

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.140
to none because I'm going
to hide it for now.

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.760
Okay, now we're
going to need to go

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.485
ahead and create interaction.

00:05:45.485 --> 00:05:47.360
But what kind of
three years should be

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.430
created if I go to
the interaction,

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:50.900
as you remember, we can create

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.675
the elementary gear
or the page trigger.

00:05:53.675 --> 00:05:55.025
It's totally up to you.

00:05:55.025 --> 00:05:57.394
You can create an
elementary year, e.g.

00:05:57.394 --> 00:05:59.165
if the user clicks on a button,

00:05:59.165 --> 00:06:01.085
that pop-up should show up or

00:06:01.085 --> 00:06:03.545
even you can create
a page trigger.

00:06:03.545 --> 00:06:08.570
So e.g. when everything is
loaded after three or 4 s,

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.339
the pop-up should be displayed.

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:13.565
First, I'm gonna go ahead
and create a page trigger.

00:06:13.565 --> 00:06:15.875
We already created the page load

00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:18.410
and we use this hero animation.

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.995
We can use this one or you can
use another page to rigor.

00:06:21.995 --> 00:06:24.575
I'm going to use
page load again.

00:06:24.575 --> 00:06:27.815
And here when page
starts loading, great,

00:06:27.815 --> 00:06:29.900
start an animation and

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.864
I'm going to create
a new animation.

00:06:31.864 --> 00:06:35.585
So let's call it pop up or pen.

00:06:35.585 --> 00:06:36.425
Nice.

00:06:36.425 --> 00:06:38.945
And here we need to
create some actions.

00:06:38.945 --> 00:06:41.945
First, wine, this pop-up
wrapper is selected.

00:06:41.945 --> 00:06:43.685
Go ahead and create an action.

00:06:43.685 --> 00:06:45.965
The first action is
gonna be opacity.

00:06:45.965 --> 00:06:49.580
By default, it's opacity should
be set to zero per cent.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:50.840
And we are going to enable

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.255
the initial state
just like that.

00:06:53.255 --> 00:06:54.410
Then I'm going to create

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:57.200
a new keyframe and I'm
going to choose Opacity.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.290
Let's turn its opacity
back to 100 per cent.

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:03.305
And in-between, I'm going
to create another action,

00:07:03.305 --> 00:07:05.990
but this time I'm going
to choose Hide Show.

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.590
If you remember, we said it's
displayed setting to none.

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:13.670
Now we need to change it back
to Flexbox just like that.

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:15.530
Let me break it down for you.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:18.020
First, we set its opacity to

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.305
zero per cent by default
because when the page loads,

00:07:21.305 --> 00:07:23.540
we shouldn't see
it and it's also

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:26.255
hidden so we can
interact with the page.

00:07:26.255 --> 00:07:29.315
We will change its display
setting to flex max.

00:07:29.315 --> 00:07:32.135
So now it blocks our
websites use edge,

00:07:32.135 --> 00:07:35.825
and then we will increase
its opacity to 100 per cent.

00:07:35.825 --> 00:07:37.850
However, there is one problem if

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:40.025
I save it and if I preview it,

00:07:40.025 --> 00:07:41.780
you can see that when the page

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.465
loads that pop-up
shows up as well,

00:07:44.465 --> 00:07:45.800
That's not what I want.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.620
I want all of these
elements load first.

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.584
And after 3 s,

00:07:50.584 --> 00:07:52.535
this pop-up should sharp.

00:07:52.535 --> 00:07:55.100
So let me go ahead and
modify the delay here.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.725
I'm going to select pop-up
wrapper hide, show,

00:07:57.725 --> 00:07:59.810
and I'm going to increase
the delay two or

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:01.925
3 s, just like that.

00:08:01.925 --> 00:08:03.035
Let me save it.

00:08:03.035 --> 00:08:03.425
Now.

00:08:03.425 --> 00:08:04.970
Let me preview it again.

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:08.480
Are right, everything
loads. There we go.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.220
So first everything loaded

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.080
and then this pop-up showed up.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.135
That's exactly what we want it.

00:08:14.135 --> 00:08:16.625
Alright, but how can
we close this popup?

00:08:16.625 --> 00:08:18.170
It's so simple. We need to go

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:20.540
ahead and create a new trigger.

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:23.315
So if I just close
this page load here,

00:08:23.315 --> 00:08:25.325
we can go ahead and select

00:08:25.325 --> 00:08:28.415
our pop-up close link
that we created.

00:08:28.415 --> 00:08:30.800
And then we can create
an element triggered.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.600
This time, I'm going
to choose a mouse

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.895
click or tap on first click,

00:08:34.895 --> 00:08:37.115
I'm going to create
a custom animation.

00:08:37.115 --> 00:08:39.245
We're going to create
a new animation,

00:08:39.245 --> 00:08:42.665
and I'm going to call
it pop up close.

00:08:42.665 --> 00:08:45.440
What should we do here?
We need to do two things.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.750
First, we need to
decrease the opacity of

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:50.300
our pop-up wrapper
to zero per cent,

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.780
and then we need to set its
display setting to none.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:55.085
Why should we do that?

00:08:55.085 --> 00:08:57.365
Because if we just
decrease the opacity

00:08:57.365 --> 00:08:59.735
from 100 per cent
to zero per cent,

00:08:59.735 --> 00:09:01.025
we will hide it,

00:09:01.025 --> 00:09:02.555
but it's still there.

00:09:02.555 --> 00:09:05.464
It's still blocking
our websites usage.

00:09:05.464 --> 00:09:07.670
We need to set its
display setting to

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:11.315
none that the user could
interact with our website.

00:09:11.315 --> 00:09:12.695
It's very important.

00:09:12.695 --> 00:09:14.360
Make sure not to forget

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.565
that I'm going to
select pop-up wrapper.

00:09:16.565 --> 00:09:19.250
I'm going to create a
new action opacity,

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:22.850
and let's change its
opacity to zero per cent.

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:26.105
Let's create a new
keyframe, hide, show,

00:09:26.105 --> 00:09:28.340
and I'm going to set its display

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.920
setting to none and save.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.830
Let me go ahead
and preview that.

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:36.605
There we go. Everything loads.

00:09:36.605 --> 00:09:37.310
Nice.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:38.585
This is our pop-up.

00:09:38.585 --> 00:09:40.115
I can scroll down.

00:09:40.115 --> 00:09:41.390
It's still there.

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:43.895
And if I click on
close, There we go.

00:09:43.895 --> 00:09:44.825
It's closed.

00:09:44.825 --> 00:09:48.935
And I can again interact with
my elements are right guys.

00:09:48.935 --> 00:09:52.190
That's how you can create
a pop-up inside Webflow.

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:56.430
I hope you enjoyed it and
I'll see you in the next one.
