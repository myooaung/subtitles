00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.900
All right, In this video,

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.850
we're going to start creating

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.175
this testimonial
section together.

00:00:11.175 --> 00:00:12.915
So let's see what we have here.

00:00:12.915 --> 00:00:14.880
As you can see, this
section should have

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.849
a smaller width compared
to other sections.

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:22.495
Here, our recent projects
section had 100% width.

00:00:22.495 --> 00:00:27.755
But here this section should
have a 1,320 pixel width.

00:00:27.755 --> 00:00:29.540
So we need to keep that in mind.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.310
Let's see what we have here.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.735
This section should have

00:00:32.735 --> 00:00:35.105
a neutral dark
backgrounds color.

00:00:35.105 --> 00:00:36.890
And also, as you can see,

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.570
we have some orbits.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.760
So how am I going
to structure that?

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.130
First, I'm going to
create a section with

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.445
a maximum width
of 13, 20 pixels.

00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:48.920
Then I'm gonna give it
a background scholar,

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.915
this neutral dark color.

00:00:50.915 --> 00:00:52.985
And finally, I'm going to add

00:00:52.985 --> 00:00:56.705
a background image
to add these orbits.

00:00:56.705 --> 00:00:58.775
Once our section is ready,

00:00:58.775 --> 00:01:02.885
we will add a container inside
and inside that container,

00:01:02.885 --> 00:01:05.885
we will add these texts layers.

00:01:05.885 --> 00:01:10.535
This title, this subtitle
or let's say description,

00:01:10.535 --> 00:01:12.935
and finally the client's
information here.

00:01:12.935 --> 00:01:15.710
Alright, so basically
these containers should

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.010
be a flexbox with a
vertical direction.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.735
And for this section first,

00:01:20.735 --> 00:01:22.535
we're going to create a diblock

00:01:22.535 --> 00:01:24.770
with the Flexbox
display setting.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.280
And then inside we are going
to have two more blocks,

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.770
one for these profile image and

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.230
one for these two texts layers.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.425
The right, the black is
going to be a Flexbox.

00:01:36.425 --> 00:01:37.865
We'd vertical direction.

00:01:37.865 --> 00:01:39.395
And last but not least,

00:01:39.395 --> 00:01:42.260
we're going to place
these emojis right around

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.225
this container and
we're going to

00:01:44.225 --> 00:01:46.895
set their position to absolute.

00:01:46.895 --> 00:01:49.100
Finally, we need to change

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.725
the position of this
section to relative.

00:01:51.725 --> 00:01:53.525
Alright, It sounds simple.

00:01:53.525 --> 00:01:54.905
Let's get started.

00:01:54.905 --> 00:01:56.600
I'm gonna go to Webflow,

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.060
and here I'm going
to select my body.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.600
I'm gonna hit Command key or
Control key on my keyboard.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.150
And let's look for section.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.215
Right.

00:02:06.215 --> 00:02:07.910
The section has been added.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.240
I'm going to give it the
section class as usual.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.480
And also I'm gonna
give it a combo class.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.190
Let's call it testimonial.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.045
There we go.

00:02:17.045 --> 00:02:18.305
As I mentioned before,

00:02:18.305 --> 00:02:21.725
this section should have
a specific maximum width,

00:02:21.725 --> 00:02:24.350
okay, and also a
specific height.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.745
So let's take a look at it.

00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:29.224
It's maximum width
should be 13, 20 pixels,

00:02:29.224 --> 00:02:32.825
and its height should
be 622 pixels.

00:02:32.825 --> 00:02:36.515
So let's go ahead and
specify those values.

00:02:36.515 --> 00:02:39.785
I'm going to set its
maximum width to 13,

00:02:39.785 --> 00:02:44.360
20, and it's high to 622 pixels.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.155
There we go.

00:02:45.155 --> 00:02:46.490
Our section is ready,

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.855
but it's not centered.

00:02:47.855 --> 00:02:50.480
So how can we address
this issue? You're right.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.820
I can head over to
the spacing section

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.235
and I can click on this
little button here.

00:02:55.235 --> 00:02:58.220
Now the left and right
margins are set to auto,

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.135
and it means our section
is centered, perfect.

00:03:02.135 --> 00:03:04.505
The last thing I'm
gonna do is at

00:03:04.505 --> 00:03:06.905
some top margins
to this section.

00:03:06.905 --> 00:03:09.410
So let's check our
design for a second.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:10.985
As I can see here,

00:03:10.985 --> 00:03:13.790
the top margin should
be 200 pixels.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.195
So I'm going to give it
a 200 pixel top margin.

00:03:17.195 --> 00:03:18.035
There we go.

00:03:18.035 --> 00:03:20.390
Alright, now it's
time to give this

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.880
section a specific
backgrounds color.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.070
So I'm gonna go to the
background section.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.170
And using this color picker,

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.704
I'm going to choose
neutral dark.

00:03:29.704 --> 00:03:31.265
And finally, I'm going to add

00:03:31.265 --> 00:03:33.380
an image to this background like

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.315
this and choose the orbit from
my assets just like that,

00:03:38.315 --> 00:03:39.815
but it doesn't do good.

00:03:39.815 --> 00:03:42.559
That's because the size
is set to costume.

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:44.390
I'm going to change
it to contain,

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.400
and that's what
we're looking for.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.415
We don't need to modify
anything else. Okay?

00:03:49.415 --> 00:03:50.915
Our background is ready.

00:03:50.915 --> 00:03:53.720
Now inside, we're going
to create a container.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.060
So wildly section is selected.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.445
I'm gonna hit Command
key or Control K,

00:03:58.445 --> 00:04:01.535
and I'm going to look for
a diblock just like that.

00:04:01.535 --> 00:04:03.650
This diblock is now inside

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.180
this section and I'm going to

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.980
give it the container class.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.350
There we go. Nowadays,
container has

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.885
a maximum width of 1,100 pixels,

00:04:11.885 --> 00:04:15.515
like all other containers
that we created before.

00:04:15.515 --> 00:04:16.355
Okay, Cool.

00:04:16.355 --> 00:04:19.220
So what do we need for
this container first,

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.720
this container should take up

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.510
the whole height
of this section.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.820
Therefore, I'm going to
give it a combo class.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.220
Let me write testimonial,

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.105
and I'm going to set
its height to 100%.

00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:33.095
There we go.

00:04:33.095 --> 00:04:35.525
And inside I'm going
to add a heading.

00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:38.075
So while this
container is selected,

00:04:38.075 --> 00:04:40.535
I'm gonna hit Command
key or Control K.

00:04:40.535 --> 00:04:42.170
And let's look for heading.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.800
There we go.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.270
The heading has been added,

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.785
and for this section,

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:47.870
I'm going to choose h three.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.185
Alright, now let's give this
heading a specific class.

00:04:51.185 --> 00:04:53.900
I'm going to write
testimonial underscore,

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.940
underscore heading.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.620
And then I'm going to modify
its topography properties.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.605
So first, let me go ahead
and modify its color.

00:05:03.605 --> 00:05:06.305
We're going to use
neutral light, this one.

00:05:06.305 --> 00:05:09.660
And also, I'm going to
modify its font size.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.134
240 pixels.

00:05:11.134 --> 00:05:13.925
If I head over to my
design file here,

00:05:13.925 --> 00:05:15.320
if I select this,

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.245
you can see that I'm
using H three and

00:05:18.245 --> 00:05:21.230
H NH3 is 40 points. Okay?

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.810
So here we are going
to specify 40 pixels.

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.865
I'm not going to touch
the line height.

00:05:25.865 --> 00:05:28.640
And then let me go
ahead and copy and

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.925
paste this particular
texts from my design file.

00:05:31.925 --> 00:05:33.155
I'm going to copy it,

00:05:33.155 --> 00:05:36.125
Command C or Control
C and paste it here.

00:05:36.125 --> 00:05:37.205
Okay, great.

00:05:37.205 --> 00:05:38.870
Now I'm going to
need a textblock.

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.690
So once again, select
the container,

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:46.085
hit Command key or Control
K and look for textblock.

00:05:46.085 --> 00:05:48.155
Okay, there we go.

00:05:48.155 --> 00:05:50.885
And again, I'm gonna
give it a class.

00:05:50.885 --> 00:05:51.845
That's right.

00:05:51.845 --> 00:05:55.715
Testimonial, underscore,
underscore text.

00:05:55.715 --> 00:05:57.305
And finally, I'm going to change

00:05:57.305 --> 00:06:00.140
its color to this secondary.

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.810
And also I'm going to
modify its size to

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:09.500
24 pixels and it's
line-height to 160%.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.945
I can also modify its weight.

00:06:11.945 --> 00:06:13.985
Let's take a look
at the weight here.

00:06:13.985 --> 00:06:15.920
Yes, it's going to be medium.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.690
So I'm gonna change
it to medium,

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.305
and then I'm going to copy
and paste that text here.

00:06:21.305 --> 00:06:25.100
So let's copy it and
paste it right here.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.215
Our texts is ready as well.

00:06:27.215 --> 00:06:29.150
However, we have a problem here,

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.685
as you can see, this
text is too long,

00:06:31.685 --> 00:06:34.385
but when I take a look
at my design file,

00:06:34.385 --> 00:06:37.310
you can see that I've got
two lines of text and

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:41.255
the width is set to 596 pixels.

00:06:41.255 --> 00:06:42.980
So you know what we need to do,

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.350
we need to change
its size property.

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:48.485
If I set the maximum width
for these texts layer,

00:06:48.485 --> 00:06:49.790
the issue will be solved.

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:53.284
I'm going to write 596 pixels.

00:06:53.284 --> 00:06:53.990
There we go.

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.180
We've got two lines of text,

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.615
and I'm going to align
it to the center.

00:06:59.615 --> 00:07:03.635
Nice, before we start creating
the last section here,

00:07:03.635 --> 00:07:05.540
the client section, I'm going to

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.820
go ahead and select
this container.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.860
I'm going to change its display

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.650
setting from black
to flex marks.

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:13.955
As you can see by default,

00:07:13.955 --> 00:07:16.730
it's the erection is
set to horizontal.

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:18.425
I'm going to change
it to vertical.

00:07:18.425 --> 00:07:20.750
And also I'm going to
align it to the center.

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.705
And we will lay their modifying
the justified, but not.

00:07:23.705 --> 00:07:25.475
Now, what else do we need here?

00:07:25.475 --> 00:07:28.415
As I mentioned before
for that client section,

00:07:28.415 --> 00:07:29.975
we need a diblock.

00:07:29.975 --> 00:07:32.150
Wireless container is selected.

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:34.700
I'm gonna hit Command
key or Control K.

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.740
And let's look for the block.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:37.835
There we go.

00:07:37.835 --> 00:07:39.920
I'm going to give it a class.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.575
Let's write client, okay?

00:07:42.575 --> 00:07:46.850
This client diblock should
have two more div blocks.

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:49.250
Okay, So while it's selected,

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:53.810
let's look for a block now
and other diblock is inside.

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:55.730
And I'm going to repeat
the same process

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:57.170
to add another div block.

00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:59.600
Okay, we have two duplex now,

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.460
but they are stacked
on top of each

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:03.305
other and it's not what we want.

00:08:03.305 --> 00:08:03.965
Why?

00:08:03.965 --> 00:08:07.565
Because here they should be
placed next to each other.

00:08:07.565 --> 00:08:10.220
Therefore, I'm going
to select the parent,

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.185
which is this client if block.

00:08:12.185 --> 00:08:14.180
And I'm going to
change its display

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.730
setting from block to Flexbox.

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:18.845
The direction is
set to horizontal.

00:08:18.845 --> 00:08:21.905
That's exactly what
we need, are right?

00:08:21.905 --> 00:08:24.200
I'm going to select
the left Div block.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.195
I'm gonna give it a class.

00:08:26.195 --> 00:08:30.650
Let's write client underscore,
underscore profile.

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:32.315
For the right one.

00:08:32.315 --> 00:08:35.090
The next block, I'm going
to give it a class.

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:37.850
And I'm going to write
client underscore,

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.950
underscore info.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:42.065
Our div blocks are ready.

00:08:42.065 --> 00:08:44.075
Now we need to add content here.

00:08:44.075 --> 00:08:45.440
First, I'm going to select

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.405
the client profile leave block,

00:08:47.405 --> 00:08:50.240
and I'm going to head over
to the background image.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.220
And let's add an image here.

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:54.185
I'm going to choose
an image from

00:08:54.185 --> 00:08:56.255
the assets, the profile image.

00:08:56.255 --> 00:08:59.660
There we go, but we need
to modify its preferences.

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:03.020
First, I'm going to change
its size to cover, Nice.

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:05.645
I'm going to reposition
it to center.

00:09:05.645 --> 00:09:08.495
And also I am going to set
the title to Don tile.

00:09:08.495 --> 00:09:10.894
And finally, I need
to make it circular.

00:09:10.894 --> 00:09:12.350
So how can we do that?

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:14.375
Well, it's so simple.

00:09:14.375 --> 00:09:17.210
I already showed you
before how we can create

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:20.360
a circle and we're gonna
do the same thing here.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:23.930
First, we need to set a
specific width and height.

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:25.670
The width and height
should be the

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:28.160
same when we want
to create a circle.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.220
Therefore, I'm going to check
this width and height here.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:33.620
It's a 50 by 50 pixel image.

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:37.295
I'm going to give it a 50
by 50 pixel dimensions.

00:09:37.295 --> 00:09:38.720
Now, the only thing we need to

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.255
do is head over to the borders.

00:09:41.255 --> 00:09:45.485
I'm going to change the
radius to 50 per cent.

00:09:45.485 --> 00:09:48.305
And there it is,
we've got our circle.

00:09:48.305 --> 00:09:50.075
Okay, what else should we do?

00:09:50.075 --> 00:09:53.435
Now it's time to add the
client info content here.

00:09:53.435 --> 00:09:54.890
So for this div,

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:57.365
we're going to need
to take slingers.

00:09:57.365 --> 00:09:59.300
As you can see, we
have a name and

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.600
then the name of company
or the name of website.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:06.605
Here, wireless clients in
for the block is selected.

00:10:06.605 --> 00:10:09.230
I'm gonna hit Command
key or Control K,

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:11.540
and I'm gonna look
for textblock.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:12.365
There we go.

00:10:12.365 --> 00:10:13.940
This is our first text block.

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:15.290
I'm going to give it a class.

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:17.930
Let me write client underscore,

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:20.420
underscore info, underscore,

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:23.255
underscore name, just like that.

00:10:23.255 --> 00:10:26.720
And then we're going to modify
some of its properties.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.645
So let's head over to
the typography section.

00:10:29.645 --> 00:10:34.190
And from here, I'm going to
modify its size to 17 pixels.

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:36.590
If I take a look
at my design here,

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:38.960
It's sizes 17 points,

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:42.305
and then we need to modify
its color to primary hover.

00:10:42.305 --> 00:10:44.510
We didn't create a
global swatch for

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:48.245
these primary harbor
color, but that's fine.

00:10:48.245 --> 00:10:50.045
I'm gonna do it right now.

00:10:50.045 --> 00:10:53.855
So let me go ahead and get
the color code from here.

00:10:53.855 --> 00:10:58.310
As you can see, the
color code is a 2D6, F9.

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:00.110
I'm going to copy it and then

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:01.865
I'm going to head
over to Webflow.

00:11:01.865 --> 00:11:04.175
And from the
typography color here,

00:11:04.175 --> 00:11:06.230
I'm going to create
a new swatch,

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:08.735
and let's paste the
color code here.

00:11:08.735 --> 00:11:13.325
I'm going to name it primary,
forward slash hover.

00:11:13.325 --> 00:11:15.065
Okay, Nice.

00:11:15.065 --> 00:11:17.360
We've got a new global swatch.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:21.605
Now, let's copy and paste
the client's name here.

00:11:21.605 --> 00:11:25.415
I'm going to copy it and let's
paste it right over here.

00:11:25.415 --> 00:11:26.600
It looks fine.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.730
And finally we need
another text layer.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.820
So I'm going to select the
client info div block.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:33.800
And using the QuickFind,

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:37.925
I'm going to look for another
text block just like that.

00:11:37.925 --> 00:11:39.200
Let's give it a class.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.779
I'm going to write
client underscore,

00:11:41.779 --> 00:11:46.445
underscore info, underscore,
underscore company.

00:11:46.445 --> 00:11:51.035
Okay. Then I'm going to modify
its topography properties.

00:11:51.035 --> 00:11:53.405
So first, let's start
with the font size.

00:11:53.405 --> 00:11:55.970
Its font size should
be 13 points.

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:57.350
If I'm not mistaken.

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:58.835
Let me check it out.

00:11:58.835 --> 00:12:02.060
We are using the
caption to textile.

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:06.410
So here, caption to as a
13 points, that's fine.

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:09.140
So I'm going to give
it 13 pixels here.

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:12.455
And for its color, we are
going to use neutral light.

00:12:12.455 --> 00:12:15.290
Nice. So let me go ahead
and copy and paste

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:18.710
the company's website,
which is booking.com.

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:21.170
Okay. I'm going
to paste it right

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:23.765
here and we're almost done.

00:12:23.765 --> 00:12:27.470
Now the only thing we need
to do is align our elements.

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:29.600
So let's start with
the client info.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.225
If I select this
client info diblock

00:12:32.225 --> 00:12:34.355
and I head over to
the layout section,

00:12:34.355 --> 00:12:37.730
you can see that the display
setting is set to block and

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:39.590
it's not what I
want because I want

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:41.600
to change the alignment
a little bit.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.300
Therefore, I'm going to
change it to Flexbox and

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:46.925
I'm going to change the
direction to vertical.

00:12:46.925 --> 00:12:49.160
And the last thing
I'm gonna do here is

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.055
change the justification
to space around.

00:12:52.055 --> 00:12:52.730
There we go.

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:54.590
So the last thing
we need to do is

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:56.915
add some left margins here.

00:12:56.915 --> 00:12:58.685
Let me check my design file.

00:12:58.685 --> 00:13:01.040
If I select this
group and I hold

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.395
down the Alt key or Option
key on my keyboard,

00:13:03.395 --> 00:13:07.609
you can see that the left
margin is set to ten pixels.

00:13:07.609 --> 00:13:11.510
Therefore, wine, these client
info block is selected.

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:14.885
I'm going to give it a ten
pixel left margin are right.

00:13:14.885 --> 00:13:17.360
Now I'm going to select the
container and I'm going to

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:20.240
change the justification
to space around.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.580
Now we've got what we have here.

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:23.630
Let's take a look.

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:26.720
We've got exactly what we
have in our design file.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.295
So what about them, emojis,

00:13:28.295 --> 00:13:30.995
as I told you before
inside this section,

00:13:30.995 --> 00:13:33.800
we're going to have four
different emojis as well.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:37.760
So I'm going to select this
section, not the container.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.425
I'm going to select
this section.

00:13:39.425 --> 00:13:41.885
And then I'm going to
look for a def block.

00:13:41.885 --> 00:13:44.645
And this block is now
inside this section.

00:13:44.645 --> 00:13:46.445
And let's give it a class.

00:13:46.445 --> 00:13:48.380
I'm going to write memos.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:50.270
And this memos you should have

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:52.100
a specific width and height.

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:55.145
So let's take a look at our
design file for a second.

00:13:55.145 --> 00:13:57.230
If I select this emoji,

00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:59.825
you can see that its
width and height

00:13:59.825 --> 00:14:03.230
are set to 150 pixels.

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:06.650
So I'm going to set
its width and 2,100.50

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:09.920
and it's height to
150 pixels as well.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.300
But what about the image?

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.865
Are we going to add an
image element here?

00:14:13.865 --> 00:14:16.565
No, we're going to use
the background image,

00:14:16.565 --> 00:14:18.860
but before adding the
background image,

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:20.735
I'm going to give
it a combo class.

00:14:20.735 --> 00:14:21.500
Why?

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.650
Because we're going to have
four different emojis.

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:26.030
And since we are going to change

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:27.410
the background image here,

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:31.340
it's important to give this
emoji diblock a combo class.

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:32.975
So for the first memo G,

00:14:32.975 --> 00:14:36.695
I'm gonna give it the one
combo class just like that.

00:14:36.695 --> 00:14:39.305
And then let's give it an image.

00:14:39.305 --> 00:14:42.455
I'm going to choose an image
from my assets, this one,

00:14:42.455 --> 00:14:44.750
and I'm going to change
its size to contain

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:47.405
and let me reposition
that to center.

00:14:47.405 --> 00:14:49.865
And I'm going to set the
time to do not tire.

00:14:49.865 --> 00:14:50.855
It's right here.

00:14:50.855 --> 00:14:53.510
But how can we place
it right over there,

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:55.205
as you can see in
our design, fine.

00:14:55.205 --> 00:14:57.590
They are placed right
next to the corners.

00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:58.970
So as I mentioned before,

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:01.700
I'm going to select this
section and I'm going to

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:04.730
change its position from
static to relative.

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:05.405
Why?

00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:07.520
Because later I'm
going to change

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.850
the position of deism
emojis to absolute,

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:14.330
and that way I can reposition
them however I want.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.520
So if I select this emoji and if

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.159
I change its position to,

00:15:19.159 --> 00:15:20.990
let's say absolute hear,

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:23.240
nothing happened yet because I'm

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.535
going to change its
position to top-left.

00:15:25.535 --> 00:15:26.570
Now, as you can see,

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:28.430
since the position
of this memorial

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:30.335
is relative to its section,

00:15:30.335 --> 00:15:31.655
as you can see here.

00:15:31.655 --> 00:15:34.535
I can simply modify
its position.

00:15:34.535 --> 00:15:37.190
So let me modify the
left and top position.

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:40.640
I'm going to change
it to, let's say, 5%.

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.790
And for the top, I'm
going to set it to 10%.

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:47.255
Okay, now I'm going to need
to create the next memo g.

00:15:47.255 --> 00:15:49.010
So you can either copy and paste

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:50.990
this memo G or you
can duplicate it.

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:52.970
I'm going to right-click
on this memo,

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:55.355
which is name, and I'm going
to click on Duplicate.

00:15:55.355 --> 00:15:56.990
It's been duplicated, but they

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:58.850
are now on top of each other.

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:01.250
So if I select the
duplicated layer,

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:02.690
I can just reposition it.

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:04.115
But before doing that,

00:16:04.115 --> 00:16:06.559
I'm gonna go ahead and duplicate

00:16:06.559 --> 00:16:09.425
this combo class just like that.

00:16:09.425 --> 00:16:11.555
And I'm going to give
it a new comp class.

00:16:11.555 --> 00:16:14.480
I'm going to write two because
this is our second memo,

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:18.560
G. Now I'm going to reposition
it to bottom-left and I

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:24.110
can modify its left and
bottom position here to 5%.

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:25.760
And here I'm going to set it

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.430
to ten per cent are right, cool.

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:30.410
Now it's time to go
to the bank runs

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:33.530
section and modify
the image itself.

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:35.840
So I'm going to select
these mammography,

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:38.450
and now we just need to
repeat the same process.

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:41.765
So I'm going to duplicate
this memo GI, just like that.

00:16:41.765 --> 00:16:44.135
I'm going to select the
duplicated div block

00:16:44.135 --> 00:16:45.215
in the navigator,

00:16:45.215 --> 00:16:47.720
and I'm going to duplicate
its combo class.

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:50.645
And let's change it
to three and let

00:16:50.645 --> 00:16:53.555
me reposition it to
top right corner.

00:16:53.555 --> 00:16:55.175
And also I'm going to change

00:16:55.175 --> 00:16:58.985
its emoji from the background
section to this one.

00:16:58.985 --> 00:17:02.675
And finally, I'm going to
change its position the right,

00:17:02.675 --> 00:17:05.630
I'm going to set it to
five per cent and the top,

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:07.570
I'm going to set it
to ten per cent.

00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:08.960
Last but not least,

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.235
I'm going to duplicate it.

00:17:10.235 --> 00:17:11.435
Once again.

00:17:11.435 --> 00:17:14.870
Let's select the duplicated
layer in the navigator and

00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:17.345
also duplicate It's combo class

00:17:17.345 --> 00:17:18.890
and I'm going to name it for,

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:22.520
then I'm going to reposition
it to bottom right corner.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:25.265
And also I'm going
to change its image

00:17:25.265 --> 00:17:28.310
from the assets to this emoji.

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:30.065
And finally, let me modify

00:17:30.065 --> 00:17:33.020
its right and
bottom positions to

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:36.590
5% and ten per
cent respectively.

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:39.260
Just like that, are right guys,

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:42.515
our testimonial section
is ready as well.

00:17:42.515 --> 00:17:44.480
Can you see how easy
it is to convert

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.360
your Figma design to
functional websites.

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:50.270
The only thing that matters
is that you understand

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:53.345
the structures and
the CSS properties

00:17:53.345 --> 00:17:56.510
as long as you follow
the rules and you have

00:17:56.510 --> 00:18:00.290
a clear structure in your
mind, everything is easy.

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:01.535
So let's recap.

00:18:01.535 --> 00:18:02.750
For this section.

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:04.715
We created a section.

00:18:04.715 --> 00:18:07.610
We gave it a testimonial
combo class,

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:10.565
and also we gave it a
200 pixel top margin

00:18:10.565 --> 00:18:12.485
according to our design file.

00:18:12.485 --> 00:18:15.455
Then we specify a maximum width

00:18:15.455 --> 00:18:18.155
and also a specific
height for that.

00:18:18.155 --> 00:18:21.800
And we gave it a background
color and a background image.

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:24.740
Right after that, we
created a container and we

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:27.935
gave it the container
and testimonial classes.

00:18:27.935 --> 00:18:31.145
And inside we've added
a heading, a textblock,

00:18:31.145 --> 00:18:35.780
and another div block that
includes two other blocks.

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:38.645
And all these div legs
are flexed boxes.

00:18:38.645 --> 00:18:40.700
We change their
display setting to

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:44.090
Flexbox in order to
control their direction.

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:46.700
They are alignments and
their justification.

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.500
Once the container section,

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:51.665
once complete, we started
adding them emojis here.

00:18:51.665 --> 00:18:53.795
And in order to position
them correctly,

00:18:53.795 --> 00:18:56.180
we set the sections position to

00:18:56.180 --> 00:19:00.050
relative and we set them
emojis position to absolute.

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:02.615
Alright guys, that's
all for this video.

00:19:02.615 --> 00:19:06.720
I hope you enjoyed it and
I'll see you in the next one.
