00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.510
Hey, welcome back.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.610
In this video we're
going to talk about

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.740
image optimization
when you want to

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.259
start building your
project and Webflow,

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.760
the first thing
you need to do is

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.830
prepare your assets, right?

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.895
You need to export your assets
from your design software.

00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:22.170
No matter if it's Figma,

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.740
Adobe XD sketch or
whatever software you use,

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.740
and then you need to import
your assets to Webflow.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.360
In this video, I'm
gonna show you

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.700
what's the proper
way of exporting

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.400
your assets and how you
need to optimize them

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.265
in order to improve the
usability of your website,

00:00:38.265 --> 00:00:40.290
and also in order to improve

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.385
the ranking of your
website search engines.

00:00:43.385 --> 00:00:45.605
So if you're ready, let's begin.

00:00:45.605 --> 00:00:47.675
I'm going to go to
my design file.

00:00:47.675 --> 00:00:48.890
Here it's Figma.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.270
And here as you can see, we have

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.060
different images that
we used in our project.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.755
Are you already exported them,

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:56.150
but I'm going to
show you how you

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.650
need to do them properly.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.385
So let's suppose I want
to export this card.

00:01:01.385 --> 00:01:03.110
First, I'm going to select it.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.970
And then if I head over to

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.800
the inspector on the right side,

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.300
I can just go to

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.260
the export section and I can
click on this plus button.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.245
Here, I can specify
some preferences.

00:01:15.245 --> 00:01:18.575
First, I'm going to specify
the format by default,

00:01:18.575 --> 00:01:19.985
it's set to PNG.

00:01:19.985 --> 00:01:22.160
You can choose JPG, SVG,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.250
and PDF depending on the
software you're using,

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.275
these formats may change,

00:01:27.275 --> 00:01:32.165
but most design software
support PNG, JPEG, and SVG.

00:01:32.165 --> 00:01:34.550
So what's the difference
between these formats?

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.325
Well, let's start
with JPEG or JPEG.

00:01:37.325 --> 00:01:39.980
Jpeg is one of the
most popular formats

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.720
that you can use
for your images.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.030
It has a very good
level of compression.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.190
Therefore, your image sizes will

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.575
be smaller if you use JPEG,

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:50.720
however, the trade-off
is you don't

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.420
get transparent background
when you use JPEG.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.960
So in this case, since we
have rounded corners here

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.325
and we need to get

00:01:58.325 --> 00:02:00.860
transparent backgrounds
for these cards.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.140
We can use JPEG, instead.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.685
We need to use PNG.

00:02:04.685 --> 00:02:07.580
Png is another popular
format that you can use for

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.460
your images and it lets
you export your assets.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.005
We transparent backgrounds.

00:02:12.005 --> 00:02:13.130
Therefore, we can create

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.040
some overlaying graphics
and it's so useful.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.915
But what about SVG?

00:02:17.915 --> 00:02:20.614
Svg is a vector file format.

00:02:20.614 --> 00:02:23.540
So if you create a
simple shape, e.g.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.570
if you create a circle,
let me show you.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:27.695
Just like that.

00:02:27.695 --> 00:02:30.470
You can export it
using the SVG format.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.980
So what's the difference
when you use the SVG format?

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.500
This file will be
scalable without

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.350
losing quality because
it's a vector file.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.315
But when we export an image,

00:02:41.315 --> 00:02:42.995
it will be a raster file,

00:02:42.995 --> 00:02:44.465
and when we scale it,

00:02:44.465 --> 00:02:45.965
it will lose quality.

00:02:45.965 --> 00:02:49.895
So whenever it's possible to
export your files using SVG,

00:02:49.895 --> 00:02:51.170
make sure to do that.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.305
However, it's only
possible for vector files.

00:02:54.305 --> 00:02:56.210
For instance, when you create

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.400
a logo and your logo
is a vector file,

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.755
make sure to export
it using SVG.

00:03:00.755 --> 00:03:02.105
But for these images,

00:03:02.105 --> 00:03:04.160
it's not possible to use SVG

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.320
because these are
not vector files,

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.835
these are raster files.

00:03:07.835 --> 00:03:09.425
So I'm going to
remove this circle.

00:03:09.425 --> 00:03:13.595
So SVG format provides you
with small file sizes,

00:03:13.595 --> 00:03:15.350
then J peg provides you with

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.575
the smallest file
size, and finally PNG.

00:03:18.575 --> 00:03:21.740
So when you don't need to
get transparent backgrounds,

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.110
you can simply use JPEG.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.150
But if you need
transparent backgrounds,

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.114
you need to go with PNG.

00:03:28.114 --> 00:03:29.720
But why are we talking about it?

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.255
Does it really matter
which format we use?

00:03:32.255 --> 00:03:33.500
Yes, it does.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.190
Why?

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.550
Because your file size has
a direct relationship,

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.590
your page load speed,

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.185
and when you have a
low page load speed,

00:03:42.185 --> 00:03:44.600
Google will rank
your website lower.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.785
It's not what we want.

00:03:45.785 --> 00:03:47.510
So that's why we
need to optimize

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.520
our assets in order to load

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.040
our pages faster and in order to

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.694
improve the usability
of our website.

00:03:54.694 --> 00:03:57.140
So let me show you how you
need to export your images.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.570
Let's suppose you want
to export discard first,

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:00.755
you need to select it.

00:04:00.755 --> 00:04:03.530
Then you will head over
to the export section.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.230
And here you will specify PNG

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.229
because you're going to need
transparent backgrounds.

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:11.990
Here we can specify whether
we want this element to be

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.335
exported at one x
to x, et cetera.

00:04:15.335 --> 00:04:18.035
What does it mean when
it's set to one x?

00:04:18.035 --> 00:04:20.210
It means you will get
the exact dimension

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:21.545
that you have here.

00:04:21.545 --> 00:04:23.360
As you can see, its
width is set to

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.655
190 pixels and its height
is set to 216 pixels.

00:04:28.655 --> 00:04:30.859
It's fine. However, nowadays,

00:04:30.859 --> 00:04:33.650
more and more people are
using retina displays.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.350
Those screens
display twice pixel.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.590
So instead of exporting
our assets at one x,

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.375
we can set it to two x.

00:04:41.375 --> 00:04:43.685
And now when we exported,

00:04:43.685 --> 00:04:46.055
the width of our file will be

00:04:46.055 --> 00:04:51.410
380 pixels and the height
will be 432 pixels.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.915
So if a user has a white screen,

00:04:53.915 --> 00:04:55.925
it doesn't lose quality.

00:04:55.925 --> 00:04:58.970
This is the reason that you
should export at two x.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.130
But if your image
is too big already,

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.740
you don't need to export
it at two x, e.g.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.485
if the width is set
to 2000 pixels,

00:05:06.485 --> 00:05:08.705
you don't need to
export it at two x.

00:05:08.705 --> 00:05:11.855
And remember when you use an
image element on Webflow,

00:05:11.855 --> 00:05:14.600
Webflow automatically
creates variations

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.344
of your image for
different screen sizes.

00:05:17.344 --> 00:05:20.675
So it basically automatically
optimizes your images.

00:05:20.675 --> 00:05:22.070
But what about other images?

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.240
Let's suppose you want to

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.955
export this project image, okay?

00:05:25.955 --> 00:05:27.185
First you need to select it.

00:05:27.185 --> 00:05:27.650
Again.

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.630
You can export it at two x.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.810
Or you can change the
image format to JPEG

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.155
since we don't need transparent
background and so on.

00:05:36.155 --> 00:05:38.180
So let me export it at two x.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.035
There we go.

00:05:39.035 --> 00:05:41.630
Well, most design
software don't let you

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.430
compress your images so they are

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.485
not good with image
optimization.

00:05:45.485 --> 00:05:46.955
Let me show you what I mean.

00:05:46.955 --> 00:05:48.830
I'm gonna go ahead
and open up one of

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.890
these images here in
the assets file, e.g.

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.250
the first one, if I
check its file size,

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.040
you can see that it's 600 kb.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.260
What do we can compress
it even more in

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.765
order to increase
our page load speed.

00:06:02.765 --> 00:06:05.105
But how there are
different ways you can use

00:06:05.105 --> 00:06:09.125
Adobe Photoshop and you can
use the Save for Web option.

00:06:09.125 --> 00:06:11.465
However, there is a
better alternative.

00:06:11.465 --> 00:06:14.495
There is a website
called tiny PNG.

00:06:14.495 --> 00:06:16.715
If you go to tiny png.com,

00:06:16.715 --> 00:06:19.895
you can simply drag and
drop your images with

00:06:19.895 --> 00:06:23.059
the PNG or JPEG format
and it compresses

00:06:23.059 --> 00:06:26.404
your images for you
without losing quality.

00:06:26.404 --> 00:06:27.485
That's amazing.

00:06:27.485 --> 00:06:29.225
Let me show you how it works.

00:06:29.225 --> 00:06:30.785
I'm going to go ahead and

00:06:30.785 --> 00:06:33.470
drop one of my images here, e.g.

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.045
this one, there we go.

00:06:35.045 --> 00:06:36.245
It's already finished.

00:06:36.245 --> 00:06:38.750
As you can see, the
original file size was

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:44.075
600 kb and the compressed
version is 146 kb.

00:06:44.075 --> 00:06:48.650
It's awesome. We decrease
its file size by 76%.

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.315
Alright, I'm going
to download it.

00:06:50.315 --> 00:06:52.430
There we go. This
is our new image,

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.140
although we compress it,

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.255
it still has a high-quality.

00:06:56.255 --> 00:06:58.880
So you need to always
go ahead and compress

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.269
your images before importing
them into Webflow.

00:07:02.269 --> 00:07:05.150
Alright, that's all about
image optimization.

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.265
Now I'm going to talk
about lazy load.

00:07:07.265 --> 00:07:10.115
When I was explaining
different features or Webflow,

00:07:10.115 --> 00:07:12.410
I told you that we will
talk about lazy load

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.245
later and that's exactly
what I'm gonna do now.

00:07:15.245 --> 00:07:17.930
So whenever you use
an image elements,

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:19.940
if you go to the
Add panel and if

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.875
you drag and drop
an image element,

00:07:21.875 --> 00:07:23.870
let me show you
what happens here.

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:25.070
We have different settings.

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:26.270
If you remember, we have

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:29.150
the alt texts and here
we have the load option.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:33.800
Since 2020, all images by
default are set to lazy load.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.135
But what does it mean?

00:07:35.135 --> 00:07:36.905
Let me remove this
image elements.

00:07:36.905 --> 00:07:38.765
I'm going to select
this hero image.

00:07:38.765 --> 00:07:41.210
And if I click on
the Settings icon,

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:43.445
I can see the load
option as well.

00:07:43.445 --> 00:07:44.870
If I open up this drop menu,

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:46.880
you can see we have
three different options.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.250
We have lazy, eager, and auto.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.890
What do they mean when
it said too lazy,

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:56.405
the browser will load this
image once it comes into view.

00:07:56.405 --> 00:07:58.430
So e.g. if I scroll down here,

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:00.920
we have different
images and these images

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.830
won't be loaded until
they come into view.

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:07.085
So when we scroll
down right here,

00:08:07.085 --> 00:08:09.365
the browser will
load these images.

00:08:09.365 --> 00:08:09.830
This way.

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.290
We can make sure that
our webpage loads

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:15.155
very fast and it's
very good for SEO.

00:08:15.155 --> 00:08:17.645
But we can override
this setting as well.

00:08:17.645 --> 00:08:18.995
I can select this image,

00:08:18.995 --> 00:08:21.530
I can go to the image
settings and from here

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:24.290
I can set it too eager
loads with page.

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:28.355
So if I select this option
when the page loads,

00:08:28.355 --> 00:08:30.650
this image will be
loaded as well.

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:32.839
Therefore, it's
more time consuming

00:08:32.839 --> 00:08:35.255
for the browser to
load our web page.

00:08:35.255 --> 00:08:37.055
You can also set it to auto,

00:08:37.055 --> 00:08:40.490
and it will behave based on
the browsers preferences.

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:44.270
My suggestion is that you
should always set it too lazy.

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:46.145
As I mentioned
before, by default,

00:08:46.145 --> 00:08:48.695
all your images
are set too lazy.

00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:51.020
But I'm going to
mention one more thing.

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:54.410
This option only works
for your image elements.

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:56.525
So if you just create a div

00:08:56.525 --> 00:08:58.895
black and if you use
the background image,

00:08:58.895 --> 00:09:00.305
it doesn't work for that.

00:09:00.305 --> 00:09:01.805
You need to keep that in mind.

00:09:01.805 --> 00:09:02.840
Our right guys.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.295
That's all for this video.

00:09:04.295 --> 00:09:08.250
I hope you enjoyed it and
I'll see you in the next one.
