00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.960
Hey, in this video we're going

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.090
to talk about the
web flows editor.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.975
But before that, we're gonna
go ahead and check our links

00:00:12.975 --> 00:00:14.430
because we're going to publish

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.355
our website when we were
building this project,

00:00:17.355 --> 00:00:19.095
we created some links,

00:00:19.095 --> 00:00:20.625
but they are empty links.

00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:21.945
There is no URL,

00:00:21.945 --> 00:00:25.170
so we didn't create a
destination for those links.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.670
Let's go ahead and quickly fix.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.905
Now, I'm going to start
with the navigation bar.

00:00:28.905 --> 00:00:31.155
If you click on this logo link,

00:00:31.155 --> 00:00:32.790
it doesn't take us anywhere.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.965
Let me show you if I preview it

00:00:34.965 --> 00:00:37.365
and if I click on
it, nothing happens.

00:00:37.365 --> 00:00:40.990
That's because there is no
destination for listening.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.190
I'm going to double-click
on this navbar,

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.145
and I'm going to select
this navbar logo link.

00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:49.130
And then on the right side
you can see that we have

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.370
the brand settings and here
we have different options.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.730
What we are interested
in is the type and URL.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.265
So what kind of behavior
are we looking for?

00:00:58.265 --> 00:00:59.780
We want to achieve this when

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.015
the user clicks on this logo,

00:01:02.015 --> 00:01:04.325
it should take the
user to the homepage.

00:01:04.325 --> 00:01:06.560
So I'm going to select type.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.125
By default, it's set
to external URL.

00:01:09.125 --> 00:01:10.999
I'm going to change it to page.

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:13.730
And then from this
page drop menu we have

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.360
created to static pages
home and contact us.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.165
So I'm going to choose
Homepage just like that.

00:01:20.165 --> 00:01:22.580
Then we can specify
whether it should open it

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.535
in the same tab or in a new tab.

00:01:25.535 --> 00:01:27.515
I'm going to set
it to this step.

00:01:27.515 --> 00:01:29.885
Now let's go ahead
and check it out.

00:01:29.885 --> 00:01:32.030
If I click on it, there we go.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.695
That's exactly what we want.

00:01:33.695 --> 00:01:35.780
So what about other links here?

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.280
I'm going to double-click on it.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.975
I'm going to select
this home link.

00:01:38.975 --> 00:01:41.120
I'm going to change the type to

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.415
page and the page
is gonna be home.

00:01:43.415 --> 00:01:46.730
What about projects and
services and contact us?

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.050
Let me first select

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.670
this Contact Us and then

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.889
I'm going to change
the type to page.

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:55.025
It's going to take the user
to the Contact Us page.

00:01:55.025 --> 00:01:57.124
But what about
projects and services?

00:01:57.124 --> 00:01:58.220
Well, as you remember,

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.290
we created the project section

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.735
and the Services section
on our homepage.

00:02:02.735 --> 00:02:06.140
So when the user clicks
on these projects link,

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.640
the user should be taken to

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.429
that particular section
of our homepage.

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.020
How is that possible?

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.070
It's very simple.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.480
First, let me go back to

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.820
my instance and I'm
going to scroll down.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.235
Let me go to the
recent project section

00:02:19.235 --> 00:02:20.945
and I'm going to
select this section.

00:02:20.945 --> 00:02:22.670
Then if you head over to

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.905
the elements settings
on the right side,

00:02:24.905 --> 00:02:27.185
here we have this field ID.

00:02:27.185 --> 00:02:30.635
I'm going to specify an ID
for this particular section.

00:02:30.635 --> 00:02:32.195
It should be a unique ID.

00:02:32.195 --> 00:02:34.100
Remember that I'm
going to write,

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.680
projects are right, cool,

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.315
but what about services?

00:02:38.315 --> 00:02:39.950
I'm going to scroll down.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.160
I'm gonna do the same thing
for these services section.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.205
And here I'm going
to write services.

00:02:46.205 --> 00:02:48.395
Nice. We're almost there.

00:02:48.395 --> 00:02:50.255
I'm going to scroll up and

00:02:50.255 --> 00:02:52.310
I'm going to double-click
on my nav bar.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.445
And if I select these projects
link on the right side,

00:02:55.445 --> 00:02:58.055
if I open up this
type drop-down menu,

00:02:58.055 --> 00:03:00.410
we have different
options apart from

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.785
external URL and page
that we use before.

00:03:03.785 --> 00:03:06.995
We have phone, email
section and fine,

00:03:06.995 --> 00:03:09.425
I'm going to choose
section and then

00:03:09.425 --> 00:03:11.900
we have this new
section drop menu.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.460
And if I open it up here,

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.125
we have different sections.

00:03:15.125 --> 00:03:17.404
These two are for our forums.

00:03:17.404 --> 00:03:18.875
I'm going to select projects.

00:03:18.875 --> 00:03:21.365
This is the section
that we just created.

00:03:21.365 --> 00:03:24.470
Now let's see what
happens if I go back to

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.395
my instance and if I
preview this project,

00:03:27.395 --> 00:03:29.435
I'm going to click on projects.

00:03:29.435 --> 00:03:30.650
And there we go.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.094
We are taken to the
project section.

00:03:33.094 --> 00:03:35.090
You can find this
kind of behavior on

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.295
many different
websites nowadays.

00:03:37.295 --> 00:03:40.385
Let's go ahead and do the
same thing for the services.

00:03:40.385 --> 00:03:42.020
So let me select this type.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.395
I'm going to choose section
and let me select services.

00:03:45.395 --> 00:03:48.005
Alright, we're done
except we aren't.

00:03:48.005 --> 00:03:49.745
Let me go back to the instance.

00:03:49.745 --> 00:03:51.215
I'm going to preview it.

00:03:51.215 --> 00:03:53.720
I'm going to click on services.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:54.965
There we go.

00:03:54.965 --> 00:03:57.665
It looks fine. However,
we have a problem.

00:03:57.665 --> 00:04:00.005
If I go to another page, e.g.

00:04:00.005 --> 00:04:01.790
our Contact Us page.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.545
Let me show you what happens.

00:04:03.545 --> 00:04:07.145
I'm going to preview it and
if I click on projects,

00:04:07.145 --> 00:04:09.230
as you can see, nothing
happens because

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.495
we don't have the
project section here.

00:04:11.495 --> 00:04:14.885
The same thing happens if
I click on this services.

00:04:14.885 --> 00:04:16.340
So how can we fix that?

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.675
Let me show you how.

00:04:17.675 --> 00:04:20.300
I'm gonna go back
to my homepage.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.775
And I'm going to
double-click on this navbar

00:04:22.775 --> 00:04:25.714
and let me select these
projects link here.

00:04:25.714 --> 00:04:27.815
The type is set to section.

00:04:27.815 --> 00:04:30.740
I'm going to turn it
back to external URL.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.220
And here I'm going to
remove this hashtag sign

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.895
and we can simply write a back
tick and a forward slash.

00:04:37.895 --> 00:04:40.385
And then I'm going to
add a hashtag sign.

00:04:40.385 --> 00:04:43.595
And finally, we need to
specify our sections ID.

00:04:43.595 --> 00:04:45.485
So let me ride projects.

00:04:45.485 --> 00:04:48.124
I'm gonna do the same
thing for these services.

00:04:48.124 --> 00:04:49.775
So let me select this link.

00:04:49.775 --> 00:04:53.030
I'm going to change its
type to external URL.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.400
And I'm going to write
back tick forward

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.655
slash a hashtag
sign and services.

00:04:58.655 --> 00:05:00.605
This way we are using
an anchor link.

00:05:00.605 --> 00:05:04.175
So this forward means to go
to our homepage and then

00:05:04.175 --> 00:05:06.380
this hashtag services means

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.870
to go to these
particular section.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.600
Alright, now let's go
ahead and see if it works.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.010
But in order to check it out,

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.390
you need to first publish

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.115
your website because
it doesn't work.

00:05:16.115 --> 00:05:18.290
If we simply go ahead
and preview it.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:19.955
So I'm going to publish it.

00:05:19.955 --> 00:05:22.205
I'm going to select
this staging domain,

00:05:22.205 --> 00:05:25.640
and let's hit this published
to select a domains.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.160
Nice. And then if
I open it up here,

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.095
I can click on projects.

00:05:30.095 --> 00:05:32.465
And I will be taken
to this section.

00:05:32.465 --> 00:05:34.355
If I click on services,

00:05:34.355 --> 00:05:36.515
I will be taken to this section.

00:05:36.515 --> 00:05:41.525
But the cool part is that if
I go to the Contact Us, e.g.

00:05:41.525 --> 00:05:43.415
if I click on projects,

00:05:43.415 --> 00:05:45.935
we will be taken back
to our homepage,

00:05:45.935 --> 00:05:47.900
right, to these
projects section.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.865
That's so useful, isn't it?

00:05:49.865 --> 00:05:51.590
All right, now
let's go ahead and

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.435
select this getting
touch button.

00:05:53.435 --> 00:05:55.715
I'm going to click on
the Settings icon.

00:05:55.715 --> 00:05:58.475
And then here I'm going to
go to the page section.

00:05:58.475 --> 00:06:00.680
Let me choose Contact Us.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.135
What about CR work?

00:06:02.135 --> 00:06:03.680
I'm going to select it and I'm

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.210
going to choose section here,

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.555
page section, and let
me choose projects.

00:06:08.555 --> 00:06:10.550
Let me scroll down here.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.835
These layer and more
buttons have dynamic URLs,

00:06:13.835 --> 00:06:15.455
so we don't need to modify them.

00:06:15.455 --> 00:06:17.345
What about these? And
learn more buttons?

00:06:17.345 --> 00:06:20.690
We didn't create a page for
our services because this is

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.000
a fictional project
and we don't need to

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.925
create some simple pages
again and again and again.

00:06:25.925 --> 00:06:27.590
So far you learned how to create

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.230
a modern page with
complex interactions.

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.120
So if you want, you can
go ahead and create

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.205
a page for these services,

00:06:34.205 --> 00:06:37.025
but it's not necessary
for this course.

00:06:37.025 --> 00:06:38.750
I'm going to scroll down here.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.415
We have different links as well.

00:06:40.415 --> 00:06:42.905
We didn't create any
page for them as well.

00:06:42.905 --> 00:06:44.330
It's totally fine because I

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:45.800
just wanted to show you how you

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.295
can create a footer
with different links.

00:06:49.295 --> 00:06:51.634
You can always go
ahead and create

00:06:51.634 --> 00:06:54.965
some other pages and set a
destination for these links.

00:06:54.965 --> 00:06:57.110
Now, let's move on
to our main topic,

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:58.175
which is the editor.

00:06:58.175 --> 00:06:59.645
When you develop a website,

00:06:59.645 --> 00:07:02.150
your client doesn't
know how to work

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:05.390
with their workflows designer
and they shouldn't. Why?

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.880
Because it's too complex
for them to learn

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.745
all the things that you've
learned in this course.

00:07:10.745 --> 00:07:12.605
And it's totally understandable.

00:07:12.605 --> 00:07:14.360
So should they always contact

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.340
you if they want to
modify something,

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.545
modifying the contents
of their website.

00:07:18.545 --> 00:07:21.440
Of course not. They can use
the editor if you head over

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.365
to this W icon on
the top left corner,

00:07:24.365 --> 00:07:25.685
and if you click on it,

00:07:25.685 --> 00:07:27.035
you can find the editor.

00:07:27.035 --> 00:07:28.580
I'm going to click on it and we

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.425
will be taken to the editor.

00:07:30.425 --> 00:07:31.745
Here is the editor.

00:07:31.745 --> 00:07:35.015
As you can see, we have
this toolbar at the bottom.

00:07:35.015 --> 00:07:37.925
We have pages,
collections, settings.

00:07:37.925 --> 00:07:39.380
Then we have two buttons,

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.840
back to live site and Publish.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.580
So how can the clients go

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.665
ahead and modify
the contents here?

00:07:45.665 --> 00:07:46.820
It's so simple.

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:49.385
Let's suppose that you want
to modify the heading.

00:07:49.385 --> 00:07:51.245
They can just hover
over this heading.

00:07:51.245 --> 00:07:52.865
They can click on it and then

00:07:52.865 --> 00:07:54.620
they can start modifying it.

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.285
Let's suppose I want to change

00:07:56.285 --> 00:07:58.460
this stunning work with amazing,

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.740
just like that. It's so simple.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.659
They don't need to
go to the designer

00:08:02.659 --> 00:08:03.815
and modify everything.

00:08:03.815 --> 00:08:06.170
They can also
insert a link here.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:08.060
They can wrap it with span,

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:09.410
all sorts of things,

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:12.755
but they can't modify the
layout of the website.

00:08:12.755 --> 00:08:13.940
It's very important.

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.129
They can change your
display setting,

00:08:16.129 --> 00:08:19.205
the CSS properties, and
those kinds of things.

00:08:19.205 --> 00:08:20.930
Let's suppose they
want to change this,

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:22.280
get in touch button.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.720
They can hover over it.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.435
And if they click on
the Settings icon here,

00:08:26.435 --> 00:08:28.010
they can edit the text.

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:29.915
They can edit the link as well.

00:08:29.915 --> 00:08:32.495
I'm going to click
on edit text here.

00:08:32.495 --> 00:08:36.095
I'm going to change it to get
us started, for instance.

00:08:36.095 --> 00:08:37.805
Just like that.

00:08:37.805 --> 00:08:38.975
I'm going to undo it.

00:08:38.975 --> 00:08:40.415
What, what about images?

00:08:40.415 --> 00:08:43.055
Well, changing images
as easy as well.

00:08:43.055 --> 00:08:46.370
They can hover over an image
and if they click on it,

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:49.100
they can select a new
image from their computer.

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.510
I'm going to scroll down.

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:51.650
They can even modify

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:54.065
the content from their
collections list.

00:08:54.065 --> 00:08:56.315
So let me click on
this Learn More button

00:08:56.315 --> 00:08:58.535
and now we are on
the project page.

00:08:58.535 --> 00:09:01.190
Do you remember when we
talked about the rich text,

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:03.604
the one that we used
here for the details.

00:09:03.604 --> 00:09:05.210
When we use a rich text,

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:07.970
the client can simply
modify that here.

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:10.265
They can edit it,
they can format it,

00:09:10.265 --> 00:09:11.795
they can make it bold.

00:09:11.795 --> 00:09:12.935
They can add links.

00:09:12.935 --> 00:09:16.475
They can even add images
and videos to this section.

00:09:16.475 --> 00:09:18.455
****, if I just click here,

00:09:18.455 --> 00:09:20.910
I can click on this plus button.

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:21.680
There we go.

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.035
I can choose an image, a video.

00:09:24.035 --> 00:09:25.820
It can even embed code.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:29.075
It's only available for a
paid site or paid account.

00:09:29.075 --> 00:09:32.000
They can add a bullet
point list, etc.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.120
So that's why using
a rich text is so

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.495
beneficial when you're designing
a website for a client,

00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:40.880
because they don't
need to know how to

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.745
modify the paragraphs,
the headings, etc.

00:09:43.745 --> 00:09:46.235
They can even add a
heading here if they want.

00:09:46.235 --> 00:09:48.245
But what about dynamic content?

00:09:48.245 --> 00:09:49.985
So I'm going to go to homepage.

00:09:49.985 --> 00:09:52.655
And here in this
toolbar at the bottom,

00:09:52.655 --> 00:09:54.305
if I click on pages,

00:09:54.305 --> 00:09:55.895
I can see all the pages.

00:09:55.895 --> 00:09:58.730
I can see a static
pages, project pages.

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:02.315
I can modify the settings
of these pages 1 by one.

00:10:02.315 --> 00:10:03.695
But what if I want to add

00:10:03.695 --> 00:10:06.260
even more projects
to my website?

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:07.280
It's so simple.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.155
I can hit over to
the collections.

00:10:09.155 --> 00:10:11.239
I can go to the
Projects collection

00:10:11.239 --> 00:10:13.100
and all my projects are here.

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.340
I can simply select one of
them if I want to modify them.

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:19.310
Here are all the fields
that we created before,

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:21.230
like the image project

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:23.780
type completion date
project details,

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:25.205
even the alt-text.

00:10:25.205 --> 00:10:27.245
If I want to create
a new project,

00:10:27.245 --> 00:10:29.375
I can hit this green button

00:10:29.375 --> 00:10:31.100
and I can create a project and

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.110
the client can simply manage

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:36.155
his or her website
without your help.

00:10:36.155 --> 00:10:37.940
Of course, if you want to modify

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:41.105
the layout or do some
complex modifications,

00:10:41.105 --> 00:10:42.395
they can reach out to you.

00:10:42.395 --> 00:10:45.440
Otherwise, they can
simply modify contents,

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.110
add new content without
contacting you.

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:50.810
And finally, once the
changes are done,

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:53.045
they can hit this Publish button

00:10:53.045 --> 00:10:54.935
to publish all the changes.

00:10:54.935 --> 00:10:58.055
As you can see here, it says
two unpublished changes.

00:10:58.055 --> 00:10:59.135
If I click on it,

00:10:59.135 --> 00:11:00.680
you can preview the changes you

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.675
made and you can hit publish,

00:11:02.675 --> 00:11:06.530
publish to changes, and now
those changes are live.

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:09.260
Alright, so this is
all about the editor.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.780
It's a very useful
tool for modifying

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:14.434
the contents and
adding new content,

00:11:14.434 --> 00:11:16.595
especially for your clients.

00:11:16.595 --> 00:11:19.385
Because now you are a
professional Webflow user

00:11:19.385 --> 00:11:21.365
and you don't need
to use the editor,

00:11:21.365 --> 00:11:22.925
but your client isn't.

00:11:22.925 --> 00:11:25.910
Therefore, he or she
needs to use the editor

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:29.180
in order to add content
or modify contents.

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.745
Are right guys, that's
all for this video.

00:11:31.745 --> 00:11:35.880
I hope you enjoyed it and I'll
see you in the next video.
