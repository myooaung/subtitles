00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.890
Any website you visit
nowadays is using

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.055
one of the six display
settings here.

00:00:11.055 --> 00:00:14.175
If you head over to the layout
section on the right side,

00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:17.565
you can see that we have six
different displays settings.

00:00:17.565 --> 00:00:19.125
In this video, we're
going to talk about

00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:20.910
each of these display settings.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.815
What is the difference
between them,

00:00:22.815 --> 00:00:24.250
how you can use them,

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.645
and when you should
use each of them,

00:00:26.645 --> 00:00:29.795
It's important to learn these
display settings is very,

00:00:29.795 --> 00:00:31.565
very well because if you don't,

00:00:31.565 --> 00:00:33.380
it's very hard for you to create

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.299
different layouts
for your projects.

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:36.980
So make sure to pay attention to

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.400
the details because sometimes
the difference is subtle.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.680
However, in real-world projects,

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.985
it makes a difference.

00:00:43.985 --> 00:00:47.345
Alright, so without further
ado, let's get started.

00:00:47.345 --> 00:00:49.730
First of all, I'm gonna
go ahead and add a

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.385
heading into this container.

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:53.720
I'm gonna go ahead and select

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.005
this container and
remove this top padding.

00:00:57.005 --> 00:00:58.175
I don't need that.

00:00:58.175 --> 00:00:59.630
Now we have this heading.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.250
Let me give it a class.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.320
I'm going to write a one.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.930
Okay, then I'm
gonna go ahead and

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.690
modify its color that
you could see it better.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:09.335
Alright?

00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:13.250
Any elements like heading,
paragraph, div, block,

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.440
button, et cetera, use

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.110
the block display
setting by default.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.425
So here we have six
different display settings.

00:01:21.425 --> 00:01:22.880
We have the block,

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.430
we have the flex or flexbox,

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.585
we have the grid,

00:01:26.585 --> 00:01:28.730
we have the inline-block,

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.289
we have the inline,

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:32.480
and finally we have none.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.085
As you can see by default,

00:01:34.085 --> 00:01:36.560
it has the block
display setting.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.180
What does it mean
when the display

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.130
setting is set to block?

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.170
It means that your
element takes up

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.944
the whole width of its parent.

00:01:44.944 --> 00:01:46.190
So in this case,

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.505
the parents of this
element is container.

00:01:49.505 --> 00:01:52.505
And as you can see, when I
select this h one elements,

00:01:52.505 --> 00:01:57.095
this boundary takes up the
whole width of this container.

00:01:57.095 --> 00:02:01.370
The width of this container
is set to 1,100 pixels.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.160
Therefore, this H1 element takes

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.250
up 1,100 pixels here as well.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.320
And one more important thing is

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.260
that if I add more
elements here,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.365
since this heading
is set to block,

00:02:15.365 --> 00:02:18.335
if I add more headings,
just like that,

00:02:18.335 --> 00:02:19.520
you can see that it takes

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.680
the next available line it wants

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.960
sits right next to this heading.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.285
This is how the block
element behaves.

00:02:26.285 --> 00:02:29.540
So let me give it the
H1 tag just like that.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.435
And if I copy and paste
it multiple times,

00:02:32.435 --> 00:02:35.315
you can see that each
of these elements

00:02:35.315 --> 00:02:38.435
takes up the whole
width of its parent,

00:02:38.435 --> 00:02:40.489
which is in this
case the container.

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.565
That's why they cannot
sit next to each other.

00:02:43.565 --> 00:02:45.875
The next display setting
we're going to talk about

00:02:45.875 --> 00:02:48.365
is called flex or flexbox.

00:02:48.365 --> 00:02:50.780
It's one of the most
important display settings

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.955
we can work with for
web development.

00:02:52.955 --> 00:02:54.800
So let me show you how it works.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.185
Unlike the block display setting

00:02:57.185 --> 00:02:59.600
that is applied to
the element itself,

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.760
the flicks display setting is

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.100
applied to the parents
of our elements.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.905
In this case is this
container, okay,

00:03:06.905 --> 00:03:09.380
so we don't select our
elements and change

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.005
the display setting to Flexbox.

00:03:12.005 --> 00:03:12.545
Why?

00:03:12.545 --> 00:03:16.549
Because Flexbox is used for
aligning different elements,

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.754
either horizontally
or vertically.

00:03:18.754 --> 00:03:20.225
So let me show you how it works.

00:03:20.225 --> 00:03:23.615
Let's suppose we have
multiple headings here.

00:03:23.615 --> 00:03:26.270
Just like that, we have
three different headings and

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.325
the display setting of these
headings is set to block.

00:03:31.325 --> 00:03:34.775
So they take up the whole
width of this container.

00:03:34.775 --> 00:03:36.725
Then if I select this container,

00:03:36.725 --> 00:03:38.165
as you can see by default,

00:03:38.165 --> 00:03:40.850
the display setting
is set to block.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.475
If I change it to Flexbox,

00:03:43.475 --> 00:03:45.470
see what happens now.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.485
These elements are aligned
next to each other.

00:03:48.485 --> 00:03:50.404
And here under the layout,

00:03:50.404 --> 00:03:52.685
I have different
properties to work with.

00:03:52.685 --> 00:03:54.530
I have direction. By default,

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.195
it's set to horizontal.

00:03:56.195 --> 00:03:59.044
I can set it to vertical
to stack them vertically.

00:03:59.044 --> 00:04:01.414
I can align the
elements to the center,

00:04:01.414 --> 00:04:04.115
both horizontally
and vertically.

00:04:04.115 --> 00:04:07.115
I can align these
elements however I want.

00:04:07.115 --> 00:04:09.350
But for now, you just need to
know that whenever we want

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.795
to create a
one-dimensional layouts,

00:04:11.795 --> 00:04:13.550
we can use Flexbox,

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.880
but what if I wanted to create
two-dimensional layout?

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.175
In that case, we
need to use a grid.

00:04:19.175 --> 00:04:21.725
And you're right, we
already talked about grid.

00:04:21.725 --> 00:04:23.030
And if you remember,

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.770
I told you that we can turn
any kind of box into a grid.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.635
And this is exactly
what I meant here.

00:04:30.635 --> 00:04:32.975
If I change the display setting

00:04:32.975 --> 00:04:36.455
from Flexbox to grid,
look what happens.

00:04:36.455 --> 00:04:37.085
Now.

00:04:37.085 --> 00:04:39.455
We have a two-by-two grid,

00:04:39.455 --> 00:04:42.410
and now I can modify my
grid however I want.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.605
Basically you can turn a
div block into a grid,

00:04:45.605 --> 00:04:48.020
a container into a grid
because you can change

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.320
the display setting of
those elements easily.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.120
So if you have a container

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.935
and you want to
turn it to a grid,

00:04:54.935 --> 00:04:57.470
you can simply change
the display setting

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.200
here and then you
will get a grid.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.050
Alright, now let's talk about
the inline-block, okay,

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.425
first, I'm going to set it
back to block display setting.

00:05:06.425 --> 00:05:09.875
If I want these headings
to sit next to each other,

00:05:09.875 --> 00:05:11.885
I can use the inline block.

00:05:11.885 --> 00:05:13.865
So let's turn it
to inline-block.

00:05:13.865 --> 00:05:14.735
And there we go.

00:05:14.735 --> 00:05:18.320
As you can see now these
elements sit next to each other

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.385
and they don't take up the
whole width of their parents,

00:05:22.385 --> 00:05:23.660
which is this container.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.275
It's good for when you
want to create some tank,

00:05:26.275 --> 00:05:28.370
is that they need to
be placed next to

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.265
each other or other
different use cases.

00:05:31.265 --> 00:05:33.034
But what about the inline?

00:05:33.034 --> 00:05:35.750
This one is called inline-block.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.610
We have the inline as well.

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.230
If I turn it to inline,

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:40.550
Let's see what happens.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:41.840
The main difference between

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.090
the inline block
and inline is that

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.660
the inline doesn't respect
the spacing property.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.795
So you cannot modify the
spacing properties here,

00:05:50.795 --> 00:05:53.555
but you can modify the
topography properties

00:05:53.555 --> 00:05:56.330
or let's say the
backgrounds property.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:57.425
Let's give it a try.

00:05:57.425 --> 00:06:00.410
Now that our display
setting is set to inline,

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.960
I'm going to change
the background here to

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.390
something else, just like that.

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.595
And I can't modify the
padding or margin.

00:06:07.595 --> 00:06:09.560
But why should we ever use

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.600
the inline display
setting when we

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.165
can modify the
padding or margin?

00:06:14.165 --> 00:06:18.125
Well, let me show you a very
good use case for that.

00:06:18.125 --> 00:06:19.880
I'm going to remove
these headings.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.830
I'm gonna go to the Add section.

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.870
And from here I'm
going to drag and

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.974
drop a paragraph
into my container.

00:06:26.974 --> 00:06:28.850
Now, let me go ahead and

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.580
change the color
of this paragraph.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.575
But first let me give it a tag.

00:06:33.575 --> 00:06:35.899
I'm going to call
it p for paragraph,

00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:38.240
and let me change it to white.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.860
By default, this paragraph is

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.945
using the block display setting,

00:06:41.945 --> 00:06:43.505
and that's totally fine.

00:06:43.505 --> 00:06:47.554
First, let me modify the
width of this paragraph.

00:06:47.554 --> 00:06:52.685
I'm going to set it to 500
pixels, just like that.

00:06:52.685 --> 00:06:56.450
And let me increase the font
size a little bit cool.

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:58.745
And also the line-height.

00:06:58.745 --> 00:07:02.195
I'm going to set it
to 150 per cent.

00:07:02.195 --> 00:07:05.570
We will talk about these
units later, but for now,

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:09.365
I just want you to focus on
this paragraph right now.

00:07:09.365 --> 00:07:12.110
This paragraph has some styling.

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.005
It uses the p class,

00:07:15.005 --> 00:07:17.885
and this class has some styling.

00:07:17.885 --> 00:07:21.890
What if I want to style a
specific word here differently?

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:23.165
Well, in that case,

00:07:23.165 --> 00:07:27.080
I can select that particular
word, e.g. this one.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.350
And then from here I'm going
to click on this icon,

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:33.935
this brush icon, and it
says Wrap with span.

00:07:33.935 --> 00:07:35.030
Let's see what it does.

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:38.045
If I click on that, it
creates a tech span.

00:07:38.045 --> 00:07:40.310
And this takes
span by default is

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:42.890
using the inline
display setting.

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:45.650
We can modify the
padding or margin,

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:49.175
even if we want to change
the size properties here,

00:07:49.175 --> 00:07:50.735
it doesn't affect this word.

00:07:50.735 --> 00:07:54.335
Let me prove it to you. I'm
going to write 500 here.

00:07:54.335 --> 00:07:56.540
As you can see, nothing
happens because

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.910
the inline display
setting doesn't

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:02.090
respect the size or
spacing properties.

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:04.835
Alright, let me
reset that for now.

00:08:04.835 --> 00:08:07.160
Since we created this takes pan,

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:11.750
I'm going to go ahead and call
it highlight. There we go.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:14.375
What I'm gonna do is change

00:08:14.375 --> 00:08:18.530
the background color of
this particular tech span.

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:21.440
I'm going to head over to
the background section here.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.720
And let me change the
background color to

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:27.035
something else like this.

00:08:27.035 --> 00:08:29.090
Let me make it lighter.

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:29.525
Then.

00:08:29.525 --> 00:08:32.930
I'm going to modify the
topography property here.

00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:34.040
Just like that.

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:36.065
As you can see, we could style

00:08:36.065 --> 00:08:39.830
this particular word
using a tech span,

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:43.250
and this takes span is
using the inline display.

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:45.245
So this is a very good use case

00:08:45.245 --> 00:08:47.180
of the inline display setting.

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:49.940
And if we have
multiple paragraphs

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.785
in our project like this,

00:08:51.785 --> 00:08:55.190
and we want to just
highlight another word.

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:57.230
We can simply choose that word,

00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:58.759
rapid with a span.

00:08:58.759 --> 00:09:00.680
And from here, I'm
going to give it

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.304
the same class that
we just created.

00:09:03.304 --> 00:09:04.685
Highlight.

00:09:04.685 --> 00:09:08.300
There we go. If I modify
the properties here,

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:10.625
since it's just a
class that changes,

00:09:10.625 --> 00:09:13.040
apply immediately
to all the elements

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.200
that are using these
particular class.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.715
So let me modify that.

00:09:16.715 --> 00:09:17.780
There we go.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:19.880
Alright, now let's move on to

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:23.165
the last display
setting, which is none.

00:09:23.165 --> 00:09:25.565
None actually hides
the elements.

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:27.830
Let me show you how it works.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:30.724
I'm gonna go ahead and
remove these paragraphs.

00:09:30.724 --> 00:09:33.140
And here inside this container,

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:38.015
I'm going to add a div
block, just like this.

00:09:38.015 --> 00:09:41.285
And this div block is
going to have a class.

00:09:41.285 --> 00:09:43.070
I'm going to write new card,

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:44.120
and then I'm going to change

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.595
its background color to white.

00:09:46.595 --> 00:09:48.950
All right, Now I'm
gonna go ahead and add

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:52.250
some more elements into
this particular div block.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:55.190
So let me start with
adding a heading,

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:59.315
and then I'm going to
add a paragraph here.

00:09:59.315 --> 00:10:03.110
And finally, I'm going to
add a button just like that.

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:04.610
Okay, Then let me select

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:08.510
this new card blog and
modify its height,

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:11.000
okay, by default,
it's set to auto.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.210
I'm going to change
it to 400 pixels.

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.520
As I mentioned before, by
default the heading and

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.595
paragraph or using the
block display setting.

00:10:19.595 --> 00:10:21.875
But what if we want to
hide an element here?

00:10:21.875 --> 00:10:23.615
Well, let's see what happens.

00:10:23.615 --> 00:10:26.840
If I click on this
non display setting.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.085
The last option.

00:10:28.085 --> 00:10:28.970
There we go.

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:30.365
Now it's hidden.

00:10:30.365 --> 00:10:31.970
And if I turn it back,

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:34.925
just like that, you can
see that now it's visible.

00:10:34.925 --> 00:10:36.740
But you may say, Can
we just decrease

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.080
the opacity of this element?

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.670
Let's see what's the difference

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:42.470
between turning the opacity

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:46.025
down and setting the
display setting to none.

00:10:46.025 --> 00:10:48.140
I'm going to select
this paragraph.

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:50.975
And from the typography section,

00:10:50.975 --> 00:10:52.940
I'm going to decrease
the opacity of

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:55.475
these elements
using this slider.

00:10:55.475 --> 00:10:56.225
There we go.

00:10:56.225 --> 00:10:57.380
It's not visible.

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.135
However, it's still there.

00:10:59.135 --> 00:11:01.340
As you can see, it
takes up some space.

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:02.690
And if I preview it,

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:04.625
you can see that
something is there.

00:11:04.625 --> 00:11:06.425
And I can select this text,

00:11:06.425 --> 00:11:07.805
but it's not visible.

00:11:07.805 --> 00:11:09.395
So in this case,

00:11:09.395 --> 00:11:11.945
it's better to use a display.

00:11:11.945 --> 00:11:12.695
None.

00:11:12.695 --> 00:11:14.990
Okay, one thing to
mention is that when

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:17.525
you use the display
non setting here,

00:11:17.525 --> 00:11:20.630
the elements still
shows up in your code.

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:22.655
It just disappears on the page.

00:11:22.655 --> 00:11:24.170
And from the interface,

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:25.925
it doesn't take up any space,

00:11:25.925 --> 00:11:28.550
but it's still
there in our code.

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:30.080
So if you want to
remove something

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.775
completely from your code,

00:11:31.775 --> 00:11:34.085
you need to remove that element.

00:11:34.085 --> 00:11:36.620
To do that, you can just hit

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:39.875
the delete or backspace
button on your keyboard,

00:11:39.875 --> 00:11:41.510
or you can right-click on

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:44.255
your element and
click on Delete.

00:11:44.255 --> 00:11:46.865
Alright guys, that's
all for this video.

00:11:46.865 --> 00:11:49.235
In the next video we're
going to talk about

00:11:49.235 --> 00:11:53.100
flexbox in detail.
So see you then.
