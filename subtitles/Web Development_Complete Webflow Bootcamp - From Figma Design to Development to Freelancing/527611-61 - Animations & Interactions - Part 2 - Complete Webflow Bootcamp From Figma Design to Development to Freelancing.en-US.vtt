00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.500
Hey, welcome back.
In this video,

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.030
we're going to start creating

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.885
some interactions and
animations for our website.

00:00:12.885 --> 00:00:14.655
Are you ready? Let's begin.

00:00:14.655 --> 00:00:15.840
So first things first,

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.340
we're going to think
about the kinds of

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.125
animation we're going to create.

00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:20.650
So what do we need here?

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.370
Let's preview this website.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.095
As you can see,
all these elements

00:00:24.095 --> 00:00:26.480
load at the same
time and it's fine,

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.845
but we can make it better.

00:00:27.845 --> 00:00:29.600
So what I wanna
do here is that I

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.340
want all of these elements

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.075
to fading one-by-one
once the page is loaded.

00:00:35.075 --> 00:00:38.960
So first this navbar should
fading, then this heading,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.420
then the description,
these buttons,

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.415
the main image and these cards.

00:00:43.415 --> 00:00:45.080
We can also move these elements

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.034
slightly to create a
more advanced animation.

00:00:48.034 --> 00:00:49.280
Alright, so what should we

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.005
do for these kind of animation?

00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:53.120
We don't need an
element trigger.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.190
As I mentioned in
the previous video,

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.760
an element trigger is required
when we need the user to

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.605
interact with something first

00:01:00.605 --> 00:01:02.435
and then the animation
should play.

00:01:02.435 --> 00:01:05.435
But in this case, there is
no interactions involved.

00:01:05.435 --> 00:01:07.175
So when the page loads,

00:01:07.175 --> 00:01:09.155
these elements
should be animated.

00:01:09.155 --> 00:01:11.795
I'm going to go ahead and
create a page trigger.

00:01:11.795 --> 00:01:12.980
How can I do that?

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.515
Let me go to the
interactions here.

00:01:15.515 --> 00:01:18.605
And this time, instead of
creating this element trigger,

00:01:18.605 --> 00:01:20.330
I'm going to create
a page trigger.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.890
So let me click on this plus

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.305
button and which
option should be used?

00:01:24.305 --> 00:01:26.970
Mouse moving,
viewport, wild pages,

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.050
scrolling, page,
load, page scroll.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.380
We need to use a page load
and you can read what kind

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.635
of interaction we can
achieve using this trigger.

00:01:36.635 --> 00:01:40.340
It says animate when the page
starts or finishes loading.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.200
That's exactly what we want.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.910
I'm going to click on page load.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.150
Great. Here we have two
different sections.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.415
When page starts loading,

00:01:49.415 --> 00:01:51.320
when page finishes loading,

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.945
I'm going to use when
page finishes loading.

00:01:53.945 --> 00:01:54.260
Why?

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.330
Because I want all
the content of

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.435
the website to load before
playing the animation,

00:01:59.435 --> 00:02:01.340
these images should
be loaded and

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.455
also these texts,
blocks and buttons.

00:02:03.455 --> 00:02:05.270
So I'm gonna go with when page

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.700
finishes loading and I'm
going to create an action.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.130
So here I'm going to
start an animation.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.140
It's going to be a
custom animation.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.430
And then I'm going to click on

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.470
this plus button. There we go.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.390
Let's name this animation,

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.850
hero animation, because it's
related to the hero section.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.175
I'm going to press Enter. Nice.

00:02:25.175 --> 00:02:27.934
So now it's time to go ahead
and create our actions.

00:02:27.934 --> 00:02:29.225
What should we achieve here,

00:02:29.225 --> 00:02:30.455
as I mentioned before,

00:02:30.455 --> 00:02:33.155
I want all of these
elements to fade in.

00:02:33.155 --> 00:02:34.865
Some of them should be scaled,

00:02:34.865 --> 00:02:36.875
some of them should
be moved as well.

00:02:36.875 --> 00:02:38.435
But let's go one by one.

00:02:38.435 --> 00:02:41.000
If I want them to fade in first,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.370
I need to set their
opacity to zero.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.000
Why?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.255
Because right now their
opacity is set to 100 per cent

00:02:47.255 --> 00:02:50.555
and there is no way I can
achieve that animation.

00:02:50.555 --> 00:02:51.965
So I have two options.

00:02:51.965 --> 00:02:54.095
I can either go ahead and select

00:02:54.095 --> 00:02:57.260
all these elements here,
e.g. this heading.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.435
And I can go to the style panel,

00:02:59.435 --> 00:03:02.240
decrease the opacity
to zero per cent here.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.430
Or I can do the exact same thing

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.290
here in the
Interactions section.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.820
Why go to page load?

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.755
I'm going to click
on Hero animation.

00:03:09.755 --> 00:03:12.050
Here I can create an action e.g.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.755
opacity, and I can turn its
opacity to zero per cent.

00:03:15.755 --> 00:03:17.675
But let's start
with the nav bar.

00:03:17.675 --> 00:03:19.550
So I'm going to
select this nav bar

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.365
and I'm going to
create an action here.

00:03:21.365 --> 00:03:24.350
But in order to create
an action for a symbol,

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.240
first you need to
double-click on it.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.160
Now this navbar is selected

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.160
the master symbol and I
can create an action.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.245
Then I'm going to
choose Opacity.

00:03:33.245 --> 00:03:35.420
And let's turn its opacity from

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.120
100 per cent to zero per cent.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.500
Okay, nice.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.185
It disappeared and it's
exactly what we want.

00:03:42.185 --> 00:03:45.140
This is what we call
the initial state.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.200
Here. If you head over
to the timing section,

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.420
you can see we have this switch

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.985
that says Set as initial state.

00:03:52.985 --> 00:03:55.055
If I hover over
these question mark,

00:03:55.055 --> 00:03:57.545
it says setting initial state

00:03:57.545 --> 00:04:01.235
applies styles to the
element before page load.

00:04:01.235 --> 00:04:04.355
It's useful for hiding elements
before animating them.

00:04:04.355 --> 00:04:07.145
Interview. That's exactly
what we need to do.

00:04:07.145 --> 00:04:10.160
So since I set its
opacity to zero per

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.265
cent and it's going to
be our initial state.

00:04:13.265 --> 00:04:14.975
I'm going to enable this switch.

00:04:14.975 --> 00:04:16.100
What else should we do?

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.025
I'm going to select all of
these elements one by one.

00:04:19.025 --> 00:04:20.180
I'm going to decrease

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.580
their opacity to zero
per cent as well.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.980
So let's select this
heading and then I'm

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.680
gonna go to my animation
here once again,

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.575
and I'm going to create
a new action opacity.

00:04:30.575 --> 00:04:33.395
Let's set its opacity
to zero per cent.

00:04:33.395 --> 00:04:34.880
And remember to enable

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.705
this switch just like that
set as initial state,

00:04:38.705 --> 00:04:40.130
as you can see now,

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.845
these are grouped
because this top group

00:04:42.845 --> 00:04:46.370
holds all the actions with
the initial state on.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.055
Okay, now I'm going to
select this description.

00:04:49.055 --> 00:04:50.675
I'm going to do the same thing,

00:04:50.675 --> 00:04:54.680
opacity, and I'm going to
turn its opacity to 0%.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.215
And I'm going to set it
as the initial state.

00:04:57.215 --> 00:05:01.175
I'm gonna do the same thing
for these buttons one by one.

00:05:01.175 --> 00:05:03.545
I'm going to select
this primary button,

00:05:03.545 --> 00:05:05.555
and let's create opacity.

00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:08.600
I'm going to decrease its
opacity to zero per cent.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.550
It's going to be
an initial state.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.025
Let's do it for this
text button as well.

00:05:13.025 --> 00:05:14.660
I'm going to select Opacity.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.925
Let's decrease it
to zero per cent.

00:05:16.925 --> 00:05:18.905
And it's going to be
the initial state.

00:05:18.905 --> 00:05:21.650
Next, let's select
this image and let's

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.770
decrease its opacity to
zero per cent as well.

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.615
It's going to be
the initial state.

00:05:26.615 --> 00:05:28.070
And finally, we need to select

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.845
these two cards and
do the same thing.

00:05:30.845 --> 00:05:32.390
So let's choose Opacity,

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.220
decrease its opacity, and

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.530
finally enable the
initial state.

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:37.655
And last but not least,

00:05:37.655 --> 00:05:39.575
I'm going to select
this card and

00:05:39.575 --> 00:05:41.719
I'm going to do the
same thing here.

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:46.040
Let's decrease its opacity
and enable the initial state.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.330
But wait a second, why

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.645
all these elements disappeared
except our navbar?

00:05:50.645 --> 00:05:54.935
Well, that's because our
navbar is a symbol in reality,

00:05:54.935 --> 00:05:57.005
if I preview my project now,

00:05:57.005 --> 00:05:58.925
you can see that it disappeared.

00:05:58.925 --> 00:06:00.695
But since it's a symbol,

00:06:00.695 --> 00:06:02.040
we will see that.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.155
That's the reason.

00:06:03.155 --> 00:06:05.210
But don't worry, it
works perfectly.

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.894
Alright, we created
our initial states.

00:06:07.894 --> 00:06:11.660
We set the opacity of all our
elements to zero per cent.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.040
Now it's time to create

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.205
the next keyframe in
order to fade them in.

00:06:16.205 --> 00:06:19.745
So we need to increase the
opacity to 100 per cent.

00:06:19.745 --> 00:06:22.250
To do that, I'm going
to select my nav bar.

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.095
Once again, double-click on it,

00:06:24.095 --> 00:06:25.865
and I'm going to
click on this end

00:06:25.865 --> 00:06:28.099
here to create a new keyframe.

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:29.645
Let's choose Opacity.

00:06:29.645 --> 00:06:33.740
And this time it's opacity
should be set to 100 per cent.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.830
So make sure that it's
set to 100 per cent.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.120
We're not going to modify

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.205
the duration and
delay right now,

00:06:40.205 --> 00:06:42.200
but in a few minutes we're
going to modify them.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.240
So for now, we just need to

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.795
turn all the opacities
back to 100%.

00:06:47.795 --> 00:06:50.075
Now I'm going to select
my heading here.

00:06:50.075 --> 00:06:52.190
I can choose it
in the navigator.

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:55.190
And then let's go to
my animation and let's

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:58.025
create a new keyframe
here, opacity.

00:06:58.025 --> 00:07:01.370
And I'm going to set
the opacity to 100%.

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:04.625
I'm gonna do the same thing
for all our elements here.

00:07:04.625 --> 00:07:06.650
Let's choose the description.

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:10.040
I'm going to create a
new keyframe opacity.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.745
And then I'm going to
set the opacity to 100%.

00:07:13.745 --> 00:07:16.535
I'm going to choose the
buttons one by one.

00:07:16.535 --> 00:07:18.695
Let's repeat the same process

00:07:18.695 --> 00:07:21.305
and increase the
opacity to 100%.

00:07:21.305 --> 00:07:22.760
I'm not going to fast forward

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.010
this process because
I want you to get

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:28.775
used to the process of creating
interactions are right.

00:07:28.775 --> 00:07:30.905
I'm going to select
the Next button here.

00:07:30.905 --> 00:07:33.650
Let's create a new
keyframe opacity.

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:36.845
And I'm going to set
the opacity to 100%.

00:07:36.845 --> 00:07:38.870
Now let's select the main image.

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:41.870
Let's create a new
keyframe opacity,

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:45.035
and turn its opacity to 100%.

00:07:45.035 --> 00:07:47.600
And finally, we are going
to select our cards

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:52.835
one-by-one opacity and
set its opacity to 100%.

00:07:52.835 --> 00:07:54.215
And last but not least,

00:07:54.215 --> 00:07:56.210
we need to select our last card,

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:59.225
create a new keyframe
here, opacity,

00:07:59.225 --> 00:08:02.870
and set its opacity to
100 per cent. Nice.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:06.920
Now let's hit save and
preview our project.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.705
There we go.

00:08:08.705 --> 00:08:11.510
All of these elements
fading one by one.

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:14.075
Let me preview that once again.

00:08:14.075 --> 00:08:16.400
That's exactly what you want.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.740
It can you see how
easy it is to create

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.110
animations in Webflow
without coding.

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:22.955
That's amazing. But wait,

00:08:22.955 --> 00:08:24.740
can we even make it better by

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.975
adding more animations
to our elements?

00:08:26.975 --> 00:08:27.860
Yes, we can.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.185
And this is exactly
what we're gonna do.

00:08:30.185 --> 00:08:34.279
Now that's our fading animation
is successfully created.

00:08:34.279 --> 00:08:35.480
I'm going to go ahead and add

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.640
some other actions
to these elements.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.530
For instance, I'm going to make

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:43.400
this heading and this
description moved down slightly.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.990
And also, I'm gonna make

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:48.335
these two cards scale
up a little bit.

00:08:48.335 --> 00:08:50.000
And finally, I'm going to make

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.970
this hero image move up as well.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:54.965
So let's start with
this heading first.

00:08:54.965 --> 00:08:56.630
I'm gonna go to my animation.

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:58.610
I'm gonna go to
here I animation,

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:00.605
and then I'm going to
select my heading.

00:09:00.605 --> 00:09:04.520
One thing to mention here
is that I don't want this

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.260
heading to move down from

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.990
its original position,
which is here.

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:12.350
I want to move it
up slightly and set

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:14.450
the initial state
for that and turn

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:16.565
it back to its
original position.

00:09:16.565 --> 00:09:18.155
So that's what we're gonna do.

00:09:18.155 --> 00:09:20.120
I'm gonna select
this heading and I'm

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.160
going to create an action Move.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.520
It has been created inside
the initial state group,

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.485
and that's exactly what I want.

00:09:27.485 --> 00:09:29.330
If you create it somewhere else,

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:32.060
you can simply enable
this switch set as

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:34.325
initial state and
it will be grouped

00:09:34.325 --> 00:09:36.755
with other initial
state elements.

00:09:36.755 --> 00:09:39.905
Then I'm going to move
it up by 20 pixels.

00:09:39.905 --> 00:09:42.830
So I'm going to write -20.

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:45.604
We can see that, but
it moved slightly.

00:09:45.604 --> 00:09:47.150
Then I'm gonna do the same thing

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:49.115
for the hero description.

00:09:49.115 --> 00:09:50.570
So let me select it.

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:52.640
I'm going to create
a new action here.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:57.260
Move and let me move
it by 20 pixels -20.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.405
Now I'm going to
select my main image,

00:09:59.405 --> 00:10:02.720
but this image shouldn't
move from top to bottom.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.015
It should move from
bottom to top.

00:10:05.015 --> 00:10:07.279
So I'm going to
create a move action.

00:10:07.279 --> 00:10:11.825
But this time I'm going to
set the y to 20 pixels,

00:10:11.825 --> 00:10:14.240
not -20 to move it down.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.870
And remember, these are
all our initial states.

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:19.925
Finally, as I mentioned before,

00:10:19.925 --> 00:10:21.875
I'm going to scale my cars,

00:10:21.875 --> 00:10:24.920
those two little
cards up slightly.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:28.295
So first I'm going to
select this Hero Card one,

00:10:28.295 --> 00:10:31.640
and I'm going to scale it
down as the initial state.

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:34.025
So let me create an action here.

00:10:34.025 --> 00:10:35.615
I'm going to choose scale,

00:10:35.615 --> 00:10:37.400
and I'm going to set the x to

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:41.360
0.8 and the y-axis will
be changed as well.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.115
Since these are linked,

00:10:43.115 --> 00:10:45.650
then I'm going to
select Hero Card to,

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:48.244
let's create the
same action scale.

00:10:48.244 --> 00:10:52.250
And I'm going to
modify its X to 0.8.

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:54.830
Hit Enter, but this
one is not grouped

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:57.725
with other initial
state actions.

00:10:57.725 --> 00:11:00.815
I can either drag and drop
it inside this group,

00:11:00.815 --> 00:11:05.030
or I can simply enable this
switch set as initial state.

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:06.410
Now it's grouped with

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:10.070
other initial state actions
here are right, Nice.

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:12.440
Now we need to go ahead and turn

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.810
them back to their
original position.

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:17.615
But how should we do that
here we have many keyframes.

00:11:17.615 --> 00:11:21.575
Should we create a keyframe
here after the last keyframe?

00:11:21.575 --> 00:11:22.685
Know why?

00:11:22.685 --> 00:11:24.725
Because if we do that, first,

00:11:24.725 --> 00:11:27.290
all those elements will fade in

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:30.110
and then they start
moving and scaling.

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:31.415
That's not what we want.

00:11:31.415 --> 00:11:33.170
We want them to move and

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:36.050
fading simultaneously
for the cards,

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:39.455
we want them to scale and
fading at the same time.

00:11:39.455 --> 00:11:41.930
So I'm gonna go ahead and
select this hero heading.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:44.105
I'm going to create
a new action here,

00:11:44.105 --> 00:11:45.515
and it's going to be moved.

00:11:45.515 --> 00:11:47.735
We created a new keyframe here.

00:11:47.735 --> 00:11:51.410
Then I'm going to change
its y here to zero.

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:55.115
This way, we turn it back
to its original position.

00:11:55.115 --> 00:11:57.470
Finally, I'm going
to drag it and

00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:59.974
put it on top of the
opacity keyframe.

00:11:59.974 --> 00:12:03.020
This way, we can group
them and the opacity

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:06.275
and move actions occur
at the same time,

00:12:06.275 --> 00:12:09.110
just like that, as you can
see now they are grouped.

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:11.600
I'm going to do the same
thing for the description.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:12.995
So let's select it.

00:12:12.995 --> 00:12:15.724
I'm going to create
a new action move.

00:12:15.724 --> 00:12:18.110
Then I'm going to set
the wine to zero.

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:19.505
Let me group them together.

00:12:19.505 --> 00:12:21.995
I'm going to drag it and
drop it on top of that.

00:12:21.995 --> 00:12:24.515
Let's do the same thing
for the hero main.

00:12:24.515 --> 00:12:26.270
I'm going to select
it and I'm going to

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:28.430
create a new action move.

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:31.025
And I'm going to set
its wine to zero.

00:12:31.025 --> 00:12:34.324
And let's group it with
the opacity keyframe.

00:12:34.324 --> 00:12:37.460
And finally, I'm going to
select this Hero Card one.

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.335
I'm going to create
a new action.

00:12:39.335 --> 00:12:41.240
It's going to be
scale because we

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:43.190
are going to scale
it up this time.

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:46.235
And I'm going to set
the x and y to one.

00:12:46.235 --> 00:12:47.780
Okay, let's group it with

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:50.615
the Hero Card, one
opacity keyframe.

00:12:50.615 --> 00:12:54.380
And then I'm gonna do the same
thing for the second card.

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:55.744
So let me create

00:12:55.744 --> 00:12:58.220
this scale action
and I'm going to

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:00.920
set the x and y, y21. Nice.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.540
And finally, let's group them

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:05.180
together are right,
it was a lot.

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.685
So now let's save our animation.

00:13:07.685 --> 00:13:10.860
And I'm going to go
ahead and preview that.

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:13.990
How cool is that?

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:16.030
Let me preview it once again.

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:19.540
So first the nav we're
phasing than these elements.

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:22.345
They move and they
scale at the same time.

00:13:22.345 --> 00:13:23.845
But here we have a problem.

00:13:23.845 --> 00:13:25.420
As you can see, the duration of

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:27.250
this animation is too much.

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:29.470
So we're going to need
to go ahead and modify

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:31.945
the duration of these keyframes.

00:13:31.945 --> 00:13:35.065
First, I'm gonna go to
hero animation here.

00:13:35.065 --> 00:13:37.285
So I'm going to
select this opacity.

00:13:37.285 --> 00:13:38.650
I'm going to decrease

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:42.265
the duration from
half a second to 0.3.

00:13:42.265 --> 00:13:44.469
We need to repeat
this same process

00:13:44.469 --> 00:13:47.035
for the move action as well.

00:13:47.035 --> 00:13:49.810
I'm going to decrease it to 0.3.

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:53.265
And then let's do the same
thing for other elements.

00:13:53.265 --> 00:13:54.710
I'm gonna go ahead and select

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:57.035
this hero description opacity.

00:13:57.035 --> 00:13:59.495
It's going to be 0.3.

00:13:59.495 --> 00:14:01.580
Then I'm going to
select the move.

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:04.895
It's going to be 0.3 as well.

00:14:04.895 --> 00:14:09.980
Let's do the same thing for
this primary button, 0.3.

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:14.270
Here, 0.3, I'm going to
fast forward this process.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:15.740
I'm gonna go ahead and select

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:17.735
all of these
elements one by one,

00:14:17.735 --> 00:14:22.580
and decrease the duration
to 0.3 are right, Done.

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:24.905
Now, let me save this animation.

00:14:24.905 --> 00:14:27.050
Let's preview it once again.

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:27.635
Cool.

00:14:27.635 --> 00:14:29.915
As you can see, it's
much quicker now.

00:14:29.915 --> 00:14:32.460
Let's preview it again.

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:36.305
Beautiful. I hope you like it,

00:14:36.305 --> 00:14:38.255
but I'm going to show
you one more thing.

00:14:38.255 --> 00:14:39.500
Do you remember when we talked

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.585
about animations
and interactions,

00:14:41.585 --> 00:14:44.105
I told you about
the easing method.

00:14:44.105 --> 00:14:45.710
I said that we
will talk about it

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:48.755
later and this is exactly
what we're gonna do.

00:14:48.755 --> 00:14:50.855
If I go to the
interaction section

00:14:50.855 --> 00:14:52.565
and if I choose this animation,

00:14:52.565 --> 00:14:54.290
I'm going to select e.g.

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:55.925
one of these actions.

00:14:55.925 --> 00:14:58.070
Let's select this
hero heading move.

00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:00.005
And if I head over
to the timing,

00:15:00.005 --> 00:15:02.525
you can see that we
have this easing tab

00:15:02.525 --> 00:15:04.684
and we have presets or costume.

00:15:04.684 --> 00:15:09.155
By default, all actions have
the linear non using method,

00:15:09.155 --> 00:15:12.560
and it means the animation
plays in a linear way.

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.435
But if I open up this drop menu,

00:15:14.435 --> 00:15:17.075
you can see that we have many
different using methods.

00:15:17.075 --> 00:15:18.875
We have easy ease in,

00:15:18.875 --> 00:15:20.435
ease out, ease in out.

00:15:20.435 --> 00:15:22.070
So what's the difference
between them?

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:25.850
I'm going to show you a very
cool website created by Mr.

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:28.490
Christopher travelers
that illustrates

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:31.040
the difference between
all easing methods.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.015
It's very cool.

00:15:32.015 --> 00:15:35.090
It's called easing
that Webflow dot io.

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:37.205
So you can go ahead
and check it out.

00:15:37.205 --> 00:15:39.455
The difference between
these easing methods

00:15:39.455 --> 00:15:41.570
is usually the speed.

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:44.105
So here when we have this 0x01,

00:15:44.105 --> 00:15:48.035
the animation starts slowly
and it finishes faster.

00:15:48.035 --> 00:15:50.360
On the other hand, if
we choose, Ease out,

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:54.290
the animation starts quickly
and then it slows down.

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:57.200
So here you can compare
all these options.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:00.065
You can see which one
suits your needs.

00:16:00.065 --> 00:16:02.510
Alright, let's move
back to Webflow in

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:04.985
order to make our
animations look better.

00:16:04.985 --> 00:16:06.545
I'm gonna go ahead and set

00:16:06.545 --> 00:16:09.695
all these animations
to easing out.

00:16:09.695 --> 00:16:11.675
So let's go ahead and
do it one by one.

00:16:11.675 --> 00:16:13.550
We can change the initial states

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:14.885
here and we don't need to.

00:16:14.885 --> 00:16:17.210
As you can see, it's
disabled because there is

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:20.135
no animations playing
in the initial states.

00:16:20.135 --> 00:16:23.090
I'm going to select this navbar
opacity and I'm going to

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:26.165
change it's easing
method to easing out.

00:16:26.165 --> 00:16:28.850
And I'm gonna do it for
all these elements.

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:30.950
Let me fast forward this process

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:33.095
to save you some time are rife,

00:16:33.095 --> 00:16:35.000
it's done and now
I'm going to save

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.850
the animation and let me
go ahead and preview it.

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:41.120
There we go.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.515
It looks much better.

00:16:42.515 --> 00:16:45.170
All right guys, I hope
you liked this video.

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:47.810
We successfully created
some animations

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:49.400
for our hero section.

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:50.630
In the next video,

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:52.430
we're going to continue creating

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:56.704
some interactions for other
sections of this website.

00:16:56.704 --> 00:16:58.830
So see you then.
