00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.975
If you want to create
an image gallery

00:00:06.975 --> 00:00:09.089
or a slideshow for your website,

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:11.745
you can use the
slider component.

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:13.830
From here. You can drag a slider

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.064
and drop it inside
your container,

00:00:16.064 --> 00:00:18.675
or you can put it
wherever you want.

00:00:18.675 --> 00:00:21.540
I'm going to place it
inside the container and it

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.570
takes up the full
width of my container.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.485
As you can see, this slider
has multiple elements.

00:00:28.485 --> 00:00:29.715
If I expand it,

00:00:29.715 --> 00:00:32.715
you can see that there are
four main components here.

00:00:32.715 --> 00:00:35.264
The mask, which
includes our slides,

00:00:35.264 --> 00:00:37.090
the left arrow link,

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.785
right arrow link,
and the slide nav,

00:00:39.785 --> 00:00:42.005
which is this indicator
at the bottom.

00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:44.090
If you click on
these indicators,

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.280
you can move between
your slides.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.235
And if you want to
add more slides,

00:00:49.235 --> 00:00:51.110
you need to select your slider

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.210
and go to the slider settings.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.540
From here, you can get access
to the slider settings.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.699
We have many options to modify.

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:00.710
We're going to go
through each of them.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.540
If you want to add more slides,

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.305
you can hit this add slight
button just like that.

00:01:06.305 --> 00:01:08.450
If you want to move
through your slides,

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.695
you have different ways.

00:01:09.695 --> 00:01:12.155
First, you can click
on these indicators.

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:14.510
Second, you can use these arrows

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.225
here in the slider settings.

00:01:17.225 --> 00:01:20.555
Third, if you know exactly
where you want to go,

00:01:20.555 --> 00:01:23.630
you can choose your
slide from here, e.g.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.925
slide three or slide five.

00:01:25.925 --> 00:01:28.580
Let me remove these
two slides for now,

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.055
and I'm going to explain
different options here.

00:01:31.055 --> 00:01:33.155
A slider has
different properties.

00:01:33.155 --> 00:01:35.090
It has the animation property,

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.745
the easing method,
and the duration.

00:01:37.745 --> 00:01:40.085
And also you have some
advanced settings here.

00:01:40.085 --> 00:01:41.540
So the animation lets you

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.330
control the type of
transition that occurs.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.895
You can choose slide crossfade,

00:01:46.895 --> 00:01:50.075
fade-out in, fade
over and slide over.

00:01:50.075 --> 00:01:51.590
You can check them out and see

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.780
which one suits your needs.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.370
The easing method is also

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.710
related to the animation
and to the transition.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.005
And since it's a
more advanced topic,

00:02:00.005 --> 00:02:02.255
we're not going to
talk about it now,

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:05.585
but later when we start
talking about interactions,

00:02:05.585 --> 00:02:08.480
we will talk about the
easing method a lot.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.995
Then we have the duration.

00:02:09.995 --> 00:02:11.885
This is the duration of

00:02:11.885 --> 00:02:15.725
our transition and the
unit is milliseconds.

00:02:15.725 --> 00:02:18.965
So here, if I specify 1,000,

00:02:18.965 --> 00:02:21.455
the animation
occurs in precisely

00:02:21.455 --> 00:02:24.605
1 s. Here we have
different options as well.

00:02:24.605 --> 00:02:26.735
We have the infinite
repeat slides.

00:02:26.735 --> 00:02:28.970
We have disabled swipe gestures.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.435
By default, the slider
has the swipe gestures

00:02:32.435 --> 00:02:36.185
whenever the user interacts
with it on tablets or phones,

00:02:36.185 --> 00:02:38.375
you can disable this
option if you want.

00:02:38.375 --> 00:02:40.970
You have the autoplay
slides option.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.875
You have the height at each end.

00:02:42.875 --> 00:02:44.480
So what it does is this.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.580
If I check this option,

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.160
it hides the left arrow for

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.090
the first slide and the right
arrow for the last slide.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.410
So let's give it a try.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.465
Here. We don't have
the left arrow.

00:02:56.465 --> 00:02:59.030
Then if I go to the
third one here,

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.710
we don't have the right arrow.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.520
So you can customize these
options however you want.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.305
Then we have this slide, nav.

00:03:06.305 --> 00:03:08.555
This is all about
these indicators.

00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:10.745
So I can check rounded

00:03:10.745 --> 00:03:14.435
or you can uncheck that
to get these squares.

00:03:14.435 --> 00:03:16.820
You can check number labels,

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.775
we can check shadow,
invert colors.

00:03:19.775 --> 00:03:22.010
And also you can
specify the spacing in

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.770
pixels like I can specify ten.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.425
And I'm going to
uncheck all of them,

00:03:27.425 --> 00:03:28.820
and I'm going to check rounded.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.555
Great, alright, now let's
add content to our slides.

00:03:32.555 --> 00:03:35.494
A slide can contain
any kind of container.

00:03:35.494 --> 00:03:37.760
You can add some
deep blacks to it.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.500
You can add background images,

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.620
you can add an image to it
that's totally up to you.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.710
But for now, I'm going to
select this slide one.

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.170
And I'm going to scroll down in

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.975
the style panel and
from the backgrounds,

00:03:50.975 --> 00:03:54.545
I'm going to hit Image and
gradient and choose image.

00:03:54.545 --> 00:03:55.745
And from my assets,

00:03:55.745 --> 00:03:57.680
I'm going to choose
one of these images.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.060
Cool. And let's set

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.640
the position to center
and it's going to

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.740
cover just like that and do
not tie for the next one.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.405
I'm going to do the same thing.

00:04:08.405 --> 00:04:12.095
So let me choose my
image just like this.

00:04:12.095 --> 00:04:14.810
Let me change the
position and size.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.415
And last but not least,

00:04:16.415 --> 00:04:17.915
for the last slide,

00:04:17.915 --> 00:04:19.760
I'm going to choose
another image.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.880
This one, Let's change the
position to center and

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.405
the size is going to be
cover and do not tie it.

00:04:26.405 --> 00:04:27.500
Okay, great.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.885
Alright, our slider is ready.

00:04:29.885 --> 00:04:33.605
However, I'm going to
modify its height. Okay?

00:04:33.605 --> 00:04:35.750
So I'm going to
select the slider,

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.605
make sure to select your
slider element From the size,

00:04:39.605 --> 00:04:43.120
I can specify a
specific height, e.g.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.555
500 pixels.

00:04:44.555 --> 00:04:46.100
It looks much better now.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.575
Now if I click on
these indicators,

00:04:48.575 --> 00:04:51.320
I can move between these images.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.230
So now I'm going to
select the slider.

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.230
Then let's go to the
elements settings.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.650
From here, I'm going to
check autoplay slides.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.125
Here I can specify
the timer delay.

00:05:03.125 --> 00:05:06.079
By default, it's set
to 4,000 milliseconds.

00:05:06.079 --> 00:05:07.820
It means that
transition occurs in

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.150
precisely 4 s. If
I preview it now,

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.330
after 4 s, the
transition occurs,

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.965
you can modify that.

00:05:15.965 --> 00:05:18.845
I'm going to set it to 1,000.

00:05:18.845 --> 00:05:20.720
There we go.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.050
It's too much. Maybe
I can set it to 2000.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.770
Now it's better.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.585
So as I mentioned before,

00:05:29.585 --> 00:05:31.925
a slide can contain anything.

00:05:31.925 --> 00:05:35.060
So here I can add some
other elements, e.g. a.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.720
Heading.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.500
Let's drag and drop a
heading inside this slide.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:40.835
And there we go.

00:05:40.835 --> 00:05:44.210
I can give it a title. Slide.

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.780
One, I can modify
its CSS properties,

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.565
everything for each slide,

00:05:49.565 --> 00:05:50.750
I can do the same thing.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.695
I can add a paragraph
as well here.

00:05:54.695 --> 00:05:58.100
Alright guys, that's all
for the slider components.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.070
I hope you enjoyed it and I'll
see you in the next video.
