00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.575
In this video, we're going
to talk about borders.

00:00:07.575 --> 00:00:10.200
If you scroll down here
on the right side,

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.975
you can see that we have
the borders section right?

00:00:12.975 --> 00:00:14.385
Under the backgrounds.

00:00:14.385 --> 00:00:17.025
We use borders
almost all the time.

00:00:17.025 --> 00:00:18.840
It has different
properties that we can

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.480
customize and we're gonna
go through all of them.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.300
So let's get started
first things first,

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.370
I'm going to show you
a very common example.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.000
I'm going to select this button.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.500
And as you can see, this button

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.285
has just a background color.

00:00:32.285 --> 00:00:34.445
But what if I want
to make it rounded?

00:00:34.445 --> 00:00:37.760
Well, I can hit over to the
border section and I can

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.675
modify the radius property
here to make it rounded.

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:45.515
If I increase the corner
radius amount, there we go.

00:00:45.515 --> 00:00:48.425
We've got this cool
rounded button.

00:00:48.425 --> 00:00:50.000
But what if I want to modify

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.260
the corner radius amount of
each corner independently?

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.985
Well, we can do that as well.

00:00:55.985 --> 00:01:00.124
If I click on this option
that says individual corners,

00:01:00.124 --> 00:01:02.195
I can control the
corner radius amounts

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:04.130
of each corner separately.

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.965
One thing to mention
is that you can still

00:01:06.965 --> 00:01:09.800
use all the units we
talked about before,

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.605
like pixel percentage, em, rem,

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:15.920
CH, VW and we h. Okay?

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.650
So here let's suppose I want to

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.845
just make the two top
corner radius rounded.

00:01:21.845 --> 00:01:22.970
Therefore, I'm going to set

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.315
the bottom corners
coordinate radius to zero.

00:01:26.315 --> 00:01:27.920
Let's see what happens.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.595
There we go.

00:01:28.595 --> 00:01:31.010
We've got this weird
looking button now,

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.170
let me undo the process.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.395
Alright, so that's all
about corner radius amount.

00:01:36.395 --> 00:01:38.525
But what if you want to create

00:01:38.525 --> 00:01:41.150
an outline button instead
of a contained button?

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.815
Right now we have
a contained button

00:01:42.815 --> 00:01:45.050
because it just has
a background color.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.325
It doesn't have any border.

00:01:46.325 --> 00:01:48.575
If I want to make an
outline button first,

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:51.680
I can add a combo class
year because I use

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.120
this button class somewhere

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.100
else for this register button.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.645
And this is Learn More button.

00:01:56.645 --> 00:02:00.125
And I'm not going to change
the default properties.

00:02:00.125 --> 00:02:03.800
Therefore, I'm gonna go ahead
and give it a combo class.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.255
So let me write contact
us just like that.

00:02:08.255 --> 00:02:09.770
Then if I head over to

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.185
the color, this
background scholar,

00:02:12.185 --> 00:02:15.005
I can write transparent

00:02:15.005 --> 00:02:18.380
and our button disappeared
except it didn't.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.685
It's still there.

00:02:19.685 --> 00:02:22.085
But we can see that
it's not visible

00:02:22.085 --> 00:02:25.070
because we just set the
background color to transparent.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.570
If I click on that,
you can see that

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.880
the alpha amount is set to zero.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.205
That's why we can
see our elements.

00:02:31.205 --> 00:02:34.700
So the next thing I'm gonna
do is obviously change

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.390
the color of my text
here to something else.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.175
I'm going to change it to black.

00:02:40.175 --> 00:02:44.899
All right, then I need
to add some borders.

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:46.835
If you head over to the borders,

00:02:46.835 --> 00:02:50.405
here we have the border section
right under the radius.

00:02:50.405 --> 00:02:53.570
And we can decide whether
we want to create

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.545
borders for all edges or
just for specific edges.

00:02:57.545 --> 00:03:00.920
If you want to create
borders for all four edges,

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.065
you need to select
this middle one,

00:03:03.065 --> 00:03:05.045
the one that is in the center.

00:03:05.045 --> 00:03:07.249
And then you can
select your style.

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:09.830
I'm going to select
Solid are right,

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.075
we've got our border,

00:03:11.075 --> 00:03:12.740
but I'm going to
increase the width.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:13.295
Okay.

00:03:13.295 --> 00:03:15.500
I can go ahead and
manually increase it.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.160
E.g. I.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.365
Can set an amount here to three.

00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:20.450
But if you just want
to eyeball and you

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.805
want to experiment with
different amounts,

00:03:22.805 --> 00:03:24.620
you can hold down the option key

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.495
on your keyboard or Alt key,

00:03:26.495 --> 00:03:29.210
and then you can click and drag,

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.410
increase and decrease the
width here, just like that.

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.500
Alright, I think four
pixels looks great.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.300
Now we can modify the color of

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.450
your border as well to
whatever color you want.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.200
And you can modify the style
of your borders like this.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.835
That's so simple, isn't it?

00:03:46.835 --> 00:03:48.230
But let's see what happens.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.055
If I want to just add borders
to some specific edges.

00:03:52.055 --> 00:03:53.585
I'm going to remove the style

00:03:53.585 --> 00:03:54.680
and then I'm going to select

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.365
a specific h here, e.g. left.

00:03:57.365 --> 00:03:59.840
And then I'm going to
set the style to solid.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.540
And there we go. One thing
to mention is that when

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.915
your element doesn't have a
specific width or height,

00:04:05.915 --> 00:04:08.690
when you add some
borders to that,

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.654
its size will be changed.

00:04:10.654 --> 00:04:12.200
However, when you define

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.380
a specific width and
height for your element,

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.790
it doesn't matter if it's

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.385
a button or a div
block or anything.

00:04:19.385 --> 00:04:21.515
The dimensions of your element,

00:04:21.515 --> 00:04:24.110
one change because
the border will be

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.900
added from the inside,
not the outside.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.150
So let me show you
what I mean by that.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.500
I'm going to go ahead and select

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.780
this image, this div block.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.465
And this block has
a specific width,

00:04:35.465 --> 00:04:37.400
not a specific height.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.670
And I'm going to go ahead
and add some borders here.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.250
I'm going to select the
middle one, the center,

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.235
since I'm going to add
borders to all four edges.

00:04:46.235 --> 00:04:49.640
And let me select the
style solid or right.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.220
And then I'm going to
increase the width.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.525
Just like that.

00:04:53.525 --> 00:04:55.760
As you can see, the
actual dimension of

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.084
this div block is not changing.

00:04:58.084 --> 00:05:00.080
And the reason is I have

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.690
a specific width
defined already.

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.345
But what happens
if we remove that?

00:05:05.345 --> 00:05:07.505
Okay, Let's see what happens.

00:05:07.505 --> 00:05:09.080
I'm going to set it to auto,

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.290
and then I'm going to move
this image outside of

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.445
this image wrapper for a second
to show you how it works.

00:05:16.445 --> 00:05:20.090
Then let me increase
and decrease the width.

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.010
And as you can see now,

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.325
the actual dimension
is changing.

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:26.480
Why?

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.990
Because there is no width
and height defined.

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.170
If I set a specific
width here, e.g.

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:37.355
350 pixels, and I
adjust the width,

00:05:37.355 --> 00:05:40.130
we can see that the
border is added inside.

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.365
Alright, let me
undo the process.

00:05:42.365 --> 00:05:43.880
Okay, cool.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.630
Let's suppose you want to
create a perfect circle, e.g.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.040
you want to create,

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.695
let's say, a circular
profile page.

00:05:51.695 --> 00:05:54.440
In that case, you can
use radius as well.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.660
So here is our image.

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.835
To create a perfect circle,

00:05:58.835 --> 00:06:00.950
you need to take some steps.

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.650
First of all, you need
to select your image

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.929
which is inside your diblock.

00:06:05.929 --> 00:06:08.720
And then you need to make
sure that its width and

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.230
height are set to 100 per cent.

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.205
So they take up the whole width
and height of its parent,

00:06:16.205 --> 00:06:18.245
which is this image diblock.

00:06:18.245 --> 00:06:21.245
While the image is
selected, not the diblock,

00:06:21.245 --> 00:06:25.385
head over to the fit and
change it from fail to cover.

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:27.020
And now you can select

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.590
your image div block
and go to the borders.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.390
And from here, I'm going to set

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.135
the radius to 50 per cent.

00:06:35.135 --> 00:06:37.040
But nothing happens because

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.600
we need to do two more things.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.815
Let me scroll up.

00:06:39.815 --> 00:06:43.835
As you can see, our div
block has a specific width.

00:06:43.835 --> 00:06:46.775
But in order to create
a perfect circle,

00:06:46.775 --> 00:06:49.820
our width and our height
should be the same.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.240
So I'm gonna go ahead and set
a specific height for that,

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.055
which is equal to width.

00:06:55.055 --> 00:06:57.980
I'm going to write 350 pixels.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.050
Great. The last thing we need to

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:02.570
do is change the overflow.

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.360
So I'm gonna go to the
overflow and then I'm

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.255
going to change it from
visible to hidden.

00:07:08.255 --> 00:07:11.645
And there we go. Here
is our perfect circle.

00:07:11.645 --> 00:07:13.820
But why does it
function like that?

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.295
Do you remember when we
talked about overflow,

00:07:16.295 --> 00:07:18.680
when we created a
card and inside

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.125
that card there was
a paragraph that was

00:07:21.125 --> 00:07:24.635
overlapping the card to
remember that this is

00:07:24.635 --> 00:07:28.579
exactly the same scenario
when it's set to Visible.

00:07:28.579 --> 00:07:30.935
Our circle has been created

00:07:30.935 --> 00:07:33.995
since we set the
radius to 50 per cent.

00:07:33.995 --> 00:07:36.455
But we can see that
because this image

00:07:36.455 --> 00:07:39.680
inside this div luck is
overlapping our shape,

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.200
therefore we need to
set the overflow to

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.705
hidden to create
these kind of mask.

00:07:44.705 --> 00:07:46.700
The last thing I'm going
to mention is that

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.965
when you work with borders,

00:07:48.965 --> 00:07:50.270
you have control over

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:53.120
properties of each
edge a specifically.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.680
So if you want to select

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:58.055
the left edge and change
the color, you can do that.

00:07:58.055 --> 00:07:59.600
You can set another color for

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.285
the top age that's
totally up to you.

00:08:02.285 --> 00:08:05.660
You are not limited in
any way, are right guys.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:07.265
That's all for this video.

00:08:07.265 --> 00:08:08.570
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:11.160
I'll see you in the next one.
