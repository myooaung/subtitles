00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.690
Hey, in this video,

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.990
we're going to start creating
this client section.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.285
As you can see in
the client section,

00:00:12.285 --> 00:00:14.505
we are going to have
different logos.

00:00:14.505 --> 00:00:17.115
Actually, we need to place
five different logos.

00:00:17.115 --> 00:00:20.010
By default, these logos
should be black and white,

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.185
and when the user
hovers over them,

00:00:22.185 --> 00:00:24.135
they should turn colorful.

00:00:24.135 --> 00:00:26.190
So what do we need
for this section?

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.360
As you can see here,

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.330
we need another section
and inside we need

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.420
to have a container that
includes our logos.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.760
Each logo should be
put inside a diblock.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.390
So let's get started.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.040
First of all, I'm going to go

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.275
ahead and create a new section.

00:00:42.275 --> 00:00:44.690
Okay, I'm going to
select body and

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.180
I'm going to hit Command
key or Control key.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.240
And let's look for
section. There we go.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.130
A new section has been added.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.185
Then as usual, we need to

00:00:54.185 --> 00:00:57.440
add the section class
to this section.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.915
Are right. Let me
look for section.

00:00:59.915 --> 00:01:01.100
Okay, Great.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.510
Are section is ready.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.520
Now inside this section,

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.869
we need a container.

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:08.540
So while this
section is selected,

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.210
I'm gonna hit Command
key or Control K,

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.265
and I'm gonna look
for the if block.

00:01:13.265 --> 00:01:15.440
Okay, there we go.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.235
And I'm going to give it the
container class. Fantastic.

00:01:19.235 --> 00:01:20.930
Our container is ready.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.360
Our section is ready as well.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.585
But this section doesn't
have any margin yet.

00:01:26.585 --> 00:01:30.020
So I'm gonna go ahead and
check its margin here.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.815
It needs to have a
130 pixel top margin.

00:01:33.815 --> 00:01:36.560
Therefore, here
for this section,

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.849
I'm going to add a combo
class called logos.

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:43.174
For our hero section.

00:01:43.174 --> 00:01:46.490
We added the hero combo
class for this section,

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.800
I'm going to add logos.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.120
Then I'm going to add
130 pixels, top margin.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.915
There we go.

00:01:53.915 --> 00:01:55.790
Now we have enough space to work

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.010
with are right inside
this container.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.885
We need to have
different div blocks.

00:01:59.885 --> 00:02:02.540
Actually, we need to have
five different div box.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.540
So how should we align
those div blocks?

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.775
Well, we have two
options to choose from.

00:02:07.775 --> 00:02:10.985
Option one, we can turn
this container into

00:02:10.985 --> 00:02:15.125
a flexbox option to we
can turn it into a grid.

00:02:15.125 --> 00:02:17.705
Well, a flexbox
is a good option,

00:02:17.705 --> 00:02:19.220
but I'm gonna go with grid,

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.680
although it's a
one-dimensional layout.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.600
Why am I going to choose grid?

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.585
Because later on when it
comes to responsiveness,

00:02:26.585 --> 00:02:29.615
when we want to make
our webpage responsive,

00:02:29.615 --> 00:02:32.255
it would be much easier
to work with grid.

00:02:32.255 --> 00:02:35.405
I will prove that to you
in our future lessons.

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:37.220
But for now, I'm going to select

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.780
this container and I'm going to

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.715
add a new div block inside.

00:02:40.715 --> 00:02:43.520
I'm not going to turn
this container to grid.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.510
I'm going to add a new div
block inside, just like that.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.745
And let's give it a class.

00:02:49.745 --> 00:02:54.860
I'm going to write greed,
underscore, underscore logos.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.885
And I'm going to
turn this def block

00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:58.805
to a grid just like that.

00:02:58.805 --> 00:03:02.180
So how many rows and how
many columns do we need?

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.470
Well, basically we need

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.710
only one row and five
different columns,

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:07.925
as you can see here.

00:03:07.925 --> 00:03:11.840
So I'm going to remove the
second row here, alright?

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.900
And I'm going to add
three more columns to

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.185
get five columns in
total. Alright, cool.

00:03:18.185 --> 00:03:19.325
Our grid is ready.

00:03:19.325 --> 00:03:21.770
Now it's time to
add our logos here.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.075
As I mentioned before,

00:03:23.075 --> 00:03:25.925
each logo should be
put inside a div.

00:03:25.925 --> 00:03:28.910
So I'm going to select
this grid and I'm going to

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.700
hit Command key or Control
key on my keyboard.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.815
And then let's add
a div block here.

00:03:33.815 --> 00:03:37.745
Now, our def block takes up
the first cell here, okay?

00:03:37.745 --> 00:03:39.890
And that's exactly what we want.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.255
And I'm going to call it

00:03:41.255 --> 00:03:45.515
client underscore,
underscore logo.

00:03:45.515 --> 00:03:46.385
Alright, cool.

00:03:46.385 --> 00:03:48.260
And finally, inside this,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.435
the Blog, I'm going
to add an image.

00:03:50.435 --> 00:03:53.120
So let's hit Command
key or Control K.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.770
And I'm gonna look for image.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.875
There we go. And let's
choose the logos here.

00:03:57.875 --> 00:04:00.425
By default, the
logos are colorful.

00:04:00.425 --> 00:04:02.870
That's totally fine because
later we're going to

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.765
make them black and white
and make them interactive.

00:04:05.765 --> 00:04:07.625
But for now, I'm going to select

00:04:07.625 --> 00:04:10.715
the Airbnb logo here
or right, cool.

00:04:10.715 --> 00:04:13.460
And then I'm going to
select this diblock

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.220
and I'm going to give it a
specific width and height.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.865
Okay?

00:04:16.865 --> 00:04:20.075
So here, if I select
this first logo,

00:04:20.075 --> 00:04:22.760
if I select this box here,

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.590
you can see that the width is

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.595
150 pixels and the height is 96.

00:04:28.595 --> 00:04:31.160
So let's set its width to

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:37.325
150 pixels and it's
high to 96 are right.

00:04:37.325 --> 00:04:41.210
Then I'm going to turn this
div black to a flexbox.

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.580
I'm going to align
it to the center and

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.220
I'm going to justify it
to the center as well.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.860
Right? That's exactly
what we were looking for.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.660
Okay. What else
do we need to do?

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.205
Our first logo is ready.

00:04:52.205 --> 00:04:53.810
I'm going to copy this div blog,

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.120
hit Command C or Control C,

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.210
and then hit Command
V or Control V

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.780
four times to get
five different logos.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.760
Then I'm gonna go
ahead and modify

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.385
the image of each logo here.

00:05:07.385 --> 00:05:09.590
So I'm going to select this one.

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.215
I'm going to change
it to Google.

00:05:12.215 --> 00:05:14.315
I'm going to go ahead
and select this one.

00:05:14.315 --> 00:05:16.550
I'm going to change
it to Microsoft.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.395
I'm going to select the next one

00:05:18.395 --> 00:05:21.425
and let me change it to FedEx.

00:05:21.425 --> 00:05:24.020
And finally, I'm going to select

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.535
this last image and let's
change it to Amazon.

00:05:28.535 --> 00:05:30.380
Fantastic, are right guys,

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:31.985
that's all for this video.

00:05:31.985 --> 00:05:33.275
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:05:33.275 --> 00:05:36.240
I'll see you in the next video.
