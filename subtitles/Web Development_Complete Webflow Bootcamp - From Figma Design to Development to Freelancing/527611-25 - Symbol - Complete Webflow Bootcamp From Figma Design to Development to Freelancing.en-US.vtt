00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.600
As designers and developers,

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.615
we always try not to
repeat ourselves.

00:00:09.615 --> 00:00:12.720
So we want to avoid
copying and pasting and

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.230
redoing everything again
and again and again.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.190
To do so, we need to learn
how we can create an element

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.170
once and reuse it multiple
times across our project.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.505
How can we do that?

00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:28.935
Well, we can use symbols.

00:00:28.935 --> 00:00:31.530
If I go to the Add section and I

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.455
tried to drag and
drop a nav bar here.

00:00:34.455 --> 00:00:35.415
Just like that.

00:00:35.415 --> 00:00:40.085
I'm going to place it right
below my body are right here.

00:00:40.085 --> 00:00:41.990
We have a navigation bar.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.125
Let's suppose we want to
turn it into a symbol.

00:00:45.125 --> 00:00:46.295
How can we do that?

00:00:46.295 --> 00:00:48.065
We have different ways to do so.

00:00:48.065 --> 00:00:51.260
First, we can go to
the Symbols page here,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
and then we can hit the
Create new symbol button

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.405
and we need to name our symbol.

00:00:56.405 --> 00:01:00.560
I'm going to name it
navbar and create single.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.185
As you can see, it turns green.

00:01:03.185 --> 00:01:05.420
A green boundary appears here,

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.325
and it means that our symbol

00:01:07.325 --> 00:01:09.140
has been created successfully.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.690
But now we are inside
the master symbol.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.065
You can press Escape to
exit the master symbol,

00:01:15.065 --> 00:01:18.500
or you can click on this
green bag to instance Martin.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.165
So here we have a symbol.

00:01:20.165 --> 00:01:22.115
How can we reuse that?

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:26.075
Well, let's go ahead
and create a new page.

00:01:26.075 --> 00:01:27.665
I'm going to go to pages.

00:01:27.665 --> 00:01:31.730
And from here I'm going to
click on create new page.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.994
Let's name it. I'm going to
name it contact and create.

00:01:36.994 --> 00:01:39.485
Alright, now we have
an empty canvas.

00:01:39.485 --> 00:01:41.180
I'm going to go to symbols.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.595
From here. We have our nav bar.

00:01:43.595 --> 00:01:45.980
If I drag and drop it
here, there we go.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.870
We've got our nav bar, but wait,

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.460
can you just copy and paste

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.365
it instead of creating symbols?

00:01:51.365 --> 00:01:54.290
Yes, we can, but it's
not an efficient way.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.950
Why?

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.455
Because when you copy
and paste and elements,

00:01:57.455 --> 00:02:00.979
if you make any change to
one of those elements,

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:02.840
that change is unique to

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.850
that particular
element and it doesn't

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.920
affect the duplicated elements.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.404
But when we use symbols,

00:02:08.404 --> 00:02:10.325
let me show you how it works.

00:02:10.325 --> 00:02:11.810
Let's suppose I want to change

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.710
this contact is contact
takes to contact us instead.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:16.880
To do that first,

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.775
you need to go to
the master symbol.

00:02:19.775 --> 00:02:22.655
If you double-click on
that, as you can see,

00:02:22.655 --> 00:02:25.700
now we are inside
the master symbol.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.280
And I can double-click
on this text.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.445
And I'm going to modify
that to Contact Us.

00:02:31.445 --> 00:02:34.670
Then I'm going to hit the
bag to Instance button here.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.480
Alright, now we change it
here in our contact page.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.330
If I go back to my homepage,

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.225
you can see that the
change has been applied

00:02:44.225 --> 00:02:47.435
automatically to this
instance as well.

00:02:47.435 --> 00:02:49.175
So when you work with symbols,

00:02:49.175 --> 00:02:53.060
you make changes once and the
changes apply automatically

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.125
to all instances of
that particular symbol.

00:02:57.125 --> 00:02:59.720
It's so powerful
because imagine you

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.870
have 100 different
pages on your website.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.515
And if you want to just
manually go ahead and modify

00:03:06.515 --> 00:03:10.295
your navigation bar or any
other elements one by one.

00:03:10.295 --> 00:03:12.065
It's going to take so much time.

00:03:12.065 --> 00:03:14.614
And believe me, it's
a boring process.

00:03:14.614 --> 00:03:17.780
So if you can use symbols,
make sure to use it.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.520
It's usually useful for

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.400
creating navigation
bars, footers.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.865
We will talk about the use
cases later, but for now,

00:03:25.865 --> 00:03:27.860
I'm going to show
you how you can use

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.050
them and how you can
modify the content,

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.095
how you can override
the content here.

00:03:33.095 --> 00:03:36.695
So, so far we've learned
how to create a symbol,

00:03:36.695 --> 00:03:38.315
how to reuse a symbol,

00:03:38.315 --> 00:03:40.150
how to edit a symbol.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.905
Now, we're going to
talk about overriding,

00:03:42.905 --> 00:03:46.175
how we can override the
contents of our symbols.

00:03:46.175 --> 00:03:49.580
Here I created a simple
card with some elements,

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.065
a heading, an image,

00:03:51.065 --> 00:03:53.030
a paragraph, and a button.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.015
Okay, I'm going to
turn it into a symbol.

00:03:56.015 --> 00:03:58.100
The other way of creating

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.175
a symbol is to just
right-click on your element.

00:04:01.175 --> 00:04:02.990
And from here, you can

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.510
choose Create symbol,
just like that.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:06.965
Now we can name it,

00:04:06.965 --> 00:04:10.190
let's say card or
write our card.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.435
Symbol is ready.

00:04:11.435 --> 00:04:15.305
Now what I'm gonna do is
copy and paste it two times.

00:04:15.305 --> 00:04:20.105
So I'm gonna hit Command C
or Control C and Command V,

00:04:20.105 --> 00:04:22.130
or Control V two times.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.635
So these two new cards are
incenses of our card symbol.

00:04:27.635 --> 00:04:31.775
If I make any changes to
that first card, e.g.

00:04:31.775 --> 00:04:34.625
if I change the
size of this image,

00:04:34.625 --> 00:04:38.690
the changes apply immediately
to other cars as well.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.720
If I modify this heading to H2,

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.650
you can see that the changes
apply to all the instances.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.825
But how can we
overwrite the contents

00:04:47.825 --> 00:04:50.300
of these two instances
since we have

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.790
three different cars and
for sure we are not going

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.265
to use the same
content for all cars.

00:04:55.265 --> 00:04:57.920
We need to learn how we
can override content.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.030
To do that first,

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.039
you need to create some fields.

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:03.380
Your symbols, I'm going
to double-click on

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.155
this symbol to go to
the master symbol.

00:05:06.155 --> 00:05:08.285
And I will be able
to edit things.

00:05:08.285 --> 00:05:09.890
And then I'm going to select

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.740
the element that we want
to create a field for.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.810
Okay, I'm going to
start with this image

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.120
because this image
should be replaceable.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.545
I'm going to select that.

00:05:18.545 --> 00:05:21.410
And if I go to the
image settings here,

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.385
at the top, I can see that
there is image settings here.

00:05:25.385 --> 00:05:28.205
And I have this pair pill button

00:05:28.205 --> 00:05:30.380
right on the top left corner.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.135
If I hover over that,

00:05:32.135 --> 00:05:34.985
you can see that it
turns to a plus button.

00:05:34.985 --> 00:05:36.830
I'm going to click on it
and then I'm going to

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.335
hit new field just like that.

00:05:39.335 --> 00:05:40.550
And as you can see, it says,

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.830
this new field
will automatically

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.215
be linked to this
image override.

00:05:45.215 --> 00:05:49.175
And I'm going to name it
image, create and link.

00:05:49.175 --> 00:05:50.900
It says you've just created and

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.525
linked and overwrite
fields are right, cool.

00:05:53.525 --> 00:05:55.970
Now I'm going to
select this heading,

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.675
and from here I'm going to
click on this link to field,

00:05:59.675 --> 00:06:01.955
create new field, and

00:06:01.955 --> 00:06:05.285
let's call it title,
create and link.

00:06:05.285 --> 00:06:08.675
Great. I'm gonna do the same
thing for the paragraph.

00:06:08.675 --> 00:06:10.310
Let's create a new field.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:15.370
And here I'm going to write
description, create and link.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:16.360
And that's all.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.865
I'm not going to create
a field for the button,

00:06:18.865 --> 00:06:21.355
but if you want, you
can do that as well.

00:06:21.355 --> 00:06:22.585
So how does it work?

00:06:22.585 --> 00:06:25.645
First, let me exit
the masters symbol.

00:06:25.645 --> 00:06:27.805
I'm going to click
and drag to instance.

00:06:27.805 --> 00:06:30.940
And now if I select my second
card on the right side,

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.655
you can see that we have
instance overwrites.

00:06:33.655 --> 00:06:34.720
We have the image,

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.970
these are the fields
that we just created.

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:38.275
We have the image,

00:06:38.275 --> 00:06:40.450
the title, and the description.

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:42.610
Each field has a
default contents.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.200
Okay, so I'm going to replace

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.945
this image simply with this.

00:06:46.945 --> 00:06:50.830
I'm going to modify the
text here to car two,

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:54.730
and we can modify the paragraph
as well just like that.

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.070
And then let me choose

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.025
the third card and we're gonna

00:06:58.025 --> 00:07:00.230
do the same thing for this one.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:03.110
This one is going to be a three.

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.585
And for this one
I'm going to remove

00:07:05.585 --> 00:07:08.750
the first sentence
just like that.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:10.655
So this is basically how you can

00:07:10.655 --> 00:07:13.325
override your symbols content.

00:07:13.325 --> 00:07:15.170
The last thing I'm
going to talk about

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:17.915
is unlinking your symbols.

00:07:17.915 --> 00:07:19.775
How can you unlink symbol?

00:07:19.775 --> 00:07:20.990
There are times that you want to

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:22.670
make some changes and you want

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:25.745
these changes to be applied
to specific elements,

00:07:25.745 --> 00:07:27.515
okay, to do that first,

00:07:27.515 --> 00:07:29.840
select your symbol,
Right-click on it.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.275
And from here you can
find link instance.

00:07:33.275 --> 00:07:35.375
If you click on
Edit main symbol,

00:07:35.375 --> 00:07:37.670
you will be taken to
the master symbol

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:39.335
and you will be able to edit it.

00:07:39.335 --> 00:07:42.590
But if you unlink
instance just like that,

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:45.170
now, it's just a simple div.

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:47.990
As you can see, it's
no longer a symbol.

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:50.990
And you can recognize that
from the Navigator because

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:54.875
here the icon of these
symbols is green.

00:07:54.875 --> 00:07:58.205
But this is just a
simple div block.

00:07:58.205 --> 00:08:01.895
Now, if I change the
dimension of this image,

00:08:01.895 --> 00:08:05.795
this change is unique to
this particular card,

00:08:05.795 --> 00:08:07.835
right guys, that's
all for this video.

00:08:07.835 --> 00:08:11.880
I hope you enjoyed it and
I'll see you in the next one.
