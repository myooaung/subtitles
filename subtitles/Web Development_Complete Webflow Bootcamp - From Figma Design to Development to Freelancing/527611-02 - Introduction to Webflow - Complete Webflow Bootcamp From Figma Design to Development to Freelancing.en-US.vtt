00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.449
What is workflow?

00:00:06.449 --> 00:00:09.600
Well, workflow is a
modern and powerful tool

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.650
that lets you build

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.380
professional and
costume design websites

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.375
visually with no code.

00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:16.560
Don't get me wrong.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.500
It's not another
template-based website builder

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.640
like Wix and

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.400
Squarespace that
limits your creativity

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.720
to a great extent.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.885
In fact, it's an
incredibly powerful tool

00:00:27.885 --> 00:00:29.730
that lets you code visually.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.485
Yes, you heard me right?

00:00:31.485 --> 00:00:33.645
With Webflow, we can actually

00:00:33.645 --> 00:00:36.720
develop custom
websites visually.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.315
It doesn't come with
all the limitations

00:00:39.315 --> 00:00:42.250
of those template
based websites.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.135
When it comes to
web development,

00:00:44.135 --> 00:00:48.200
there is a wide variety of
ways to develop a website.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.455
We can build a website
by writing custom code,

00:00:51.455 --> 00:00:54.425
I mean HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript.

00:00:54.425 --> 00:00:56.990
We can use
template-based platforms

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.290
like weeks, Squarespace
and WordPress.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.720
Or we can use Webflow.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.285
If you don't know how they
differ from each other,

00:01:05.285 --> 00:01:08.225
don't worry, let me
elaborate more on that.

00:01:08.225 --> 00:01:11.555
The first option requires
knowing how to code.

00:01:11.555 --> 00:01:13.490
You need to learn HTML,

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.520
CSS, and JavaScript
to create a website.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.265
The second option
doesn't require coding,

00:01:19.265 --> 00:01:23.180
and it gives you some pre-built
templates to work with.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.970
This option is suitable
for anyone who wants

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.790
to build a simple
website quickly.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.360
But the trade-off is the
limitation that it comes with.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.755
Last but not least,

00:01:33.755 --> 00:01:37.460
you can use Webflow to
actually develop a website

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.405
from scratch without writing
a single line of code,

00:01:41.405 --> 00:01:45.080
and most importantly,
without any limitations.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.984
But how is that possible?

00:01:46.984 --> 00:01:49.250
Well, when you're using Webflow,

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.530
you're actually coding a website

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.915
from the ground
up, but visually.

00:01:53.915 --> 00:01:57.200
So that's why Webflow
allows you to build

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.990
professional and
custom-made websites

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.330
without any limitations.
