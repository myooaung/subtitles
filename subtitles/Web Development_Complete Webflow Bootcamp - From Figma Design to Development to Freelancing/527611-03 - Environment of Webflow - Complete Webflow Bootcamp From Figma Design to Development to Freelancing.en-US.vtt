00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.110
Hey, in this video
we're going to talk

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.690
about the environment
of Webflow.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.100
I'm going to show
you how you can

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.975
register and how you can login,

00:00:12.975 --> 00:00:14.520
which plan should you use,

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.075
and also how the whole
interface looks.

00:00:18.075 --> 00:00:20.985
So without further ado,
let's get started.

00:00:20.985 --> 00:00:23.580
First of all, in order
to work with Webflow,

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.590
you need to register, okay,

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.990
if you hit the Get Started
button right at the top here,

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.075
you can sign in with
your Gmail account

00:00:32.075 --> 00:00:35.599
or you can register
with your email.

00:00:35.599 --> 00:00:37.250
It's totally up to you.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.675
Once you've signed in,

00:00:38.675 --> 00:00:41.405
you will be redirected
to the dashboard.

00:00:41.405 --> 00:00:42.920
In order to use Webflow,

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.690
you can use different options.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.075
You can use the free account

00:00:47.075 --> 00:00:49.535
or you can use one
of their plants.

00:00:49.535 --> 00:00:50.990
So what's the difference?

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.180
Let me show you which plan you

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.730
need in order to proceed
with this course.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.380
Basically, Webflow has site
plans and account plans.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.175
We're gonna dive into the
details later, but for now,

00:01:04.175 --> 00:01:05.765
you need to know that Webflow

00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:08.315
offers three different
account plans.

00:01:08.315 --> 00:01:11.780
The starter, which
is free, light,

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.225
which is $16 per month,

00:01:14.225 --> 00:01:17.315
and Pro, which is $35 per month.

00:01:17.315 --> 00:01:20.450
For this course, you need
to use a free plan, okay,

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.695
the starter plan, you can
create up to two projects.

00:01:24.695 --> 00:01:26.225
There are some limitations,

00:01:26.225 --> 00:01:29.795
but it's perfect for the
educational purposes.

00:01:29.795 --> 00:01:33.860
And in order for you to get
used to the tool and practice

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.990
later on when you want to

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.764
create projects
for your clients,

00:01:38.764 --> 00:01:42.185
you can upgrade to the
lite plan or the Pro plan.

00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:44.630
We're going to talk
about it later.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.890
But for now, just register
and use a free account.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.360
Once you are registered,

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.775
you will be redirected
to this page.

00:01:52.775 --> 00:01:54.470
This is the dashboard.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.990
You can hit the
new project button

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.685
and you will see this page.

00:01:58.685 --> 00:02:01.415
There are some free
templates that you can use

00:02:01.415 --> 00:02:04.505
and there are also
some paid templates.

00:02:04.505 --> 00:02:05.915
However, for this course,

00:02:05.915 --> 00:02:09.200
we're not gonna use any of
these templates because we're

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.665
going to learn how to build
a website from scratch.

00:02:12.665 --> 00:02:15.605
So we always need to
create a blank side.

00:02:15.605 --> 00:02:17.420
You just need to
select this option,

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.560
the first one here you can
specify your project's name.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.835
By default. It gives
you a default name.

00:02:25.835 --> 00:02:28.055
However, you can specify

00:02:28.055 --> 00:02:30.845
a precise name for
your project as well.

00:02:30.845 --> 00:02:32.540
Let's call it new.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.775
I'm going to hit Create Project.

00:02:34.775 --> 00:02:35.855
And there we go.

00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:37.415
Here is the designer.

00:02:37.415 --> 00:02:39.079
Actually, we can divide

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.950
the whole interface into
different main parts.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.255
On the left side,

00:02:44.255 --> 00:02:46.520
you can see that
there is the toolbar,

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.530
Okay, we have different options.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.585
Then we have the
navigator, okay?

00:02:50.585 --> 00:02:53.014
Right now the
navigator is selected.

00:02:53.014 --> 00:02:55.190
We have the Add option that

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.490
includes some elements that
we will talk about later.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.475
We have symbols, we
have again navigator,

00:03:01.475 --> 00:03:02.975
I already showed you.

00:03:02.975 --> 00:03:04.505
We have pages.

00:03:04.505 --> 00:03:07.100
We have CMS collections,

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.260
we have e-commerce, and
finally we have assets.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.475
And last but not least,

00:03:13.475 --> 00:03:15.290
we have settings at the top,

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.760
we have different options.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.725
These are our breakpoints

00:03:18.725 --> 00:03:21.020
that we're going to
talk about later on.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.785
But as you can see, we have
desktop, we have tablets,

00:03:24.785 --> 00:03:26.540
we have mobile landscape,

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.655
and we have mobile portrayed.

00:03:28.655 --> 00:03:32.585
So this basically determines
the dimension of our screen.

00:03:32.585 --> 00:03:34.160
On the right side here you

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.140
can see we have
different options.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.730
We have the Publish button,

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.049
which is so important.

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:43.955
We have to share project button
and we have export code.

00:03:43.955 --> 00:03:47.044
And on the right side we
have the style panel,

00:03:47.044 --> 00:03:48.995
we have the settings,

00:03:48.995 --> 00:03:50.645
we have the Style Manager,

00:03:50.645 --> 00:03:53.210
and we have the
interactions tap.

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.100
We're going to
talk about each of

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.700
these tabs specifically
in detail later on.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.350
But for now, you
just need to know

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.300
what the interface looks like.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.649
Right in the middle,

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:04.955
we have the canvas.

00:04:04.955 --> 00:04:07.085
This is basically
where we design

00:04:07.085 --> 00:04:09.245
our website and
build our website.

00:04:09.245 --> 00:04:11.975
It's an empty canvas,
as you can see,

00:04:11.975 --> 00:04:15.365
since I selected this
body element here,

00:04:15.365 --> 00:04:18.860
you can see that the style
panel has some properties.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.920
Now, these are the CSS
properties that we can

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.340
modify and use for our projects.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.545
Each project has a
project settings.

00:04:27.545 --> 00:04:30.980
So if you head over to
the top left corner,

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.880
you can see this a
w or Webflow logo.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.025
If you hover over this logo,

00:04:37.025 --> 00:04:39.245
you will see this
hamburger menu button.

00:04:39.245 --> 00:04:40.370
If I click on that,

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:41.720
we have three options.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.100
We have Dashboard.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.720
If you click on
that, you will be

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.415
redirected to the dashboard.

00:04:46.415 --> 00:04:49.310
We have Project Settings
and we have editor.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.755
For now we're not
going to talk about

00:04:51.755 --> 00:04:54.545
Editor because we have a
specific video for that.

00:04:54.545 --> 00:04:56.660
But right now, I'm going to show

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.180
you how the Project
Settings looks.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.425
If I click on that,

00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:03.409
we will be redirected to
the project settings.

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:04.910
Here we have different options.

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.525
We have general, we can
specify the project name.

00:05:08.525 --> 00:05:10.550
We have different options here

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.710
that we're not going
to talk about now.

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.070
We have hosting, we have editor,

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.650
we have billing, SEO,

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:25.115
forums, funds, backups,
integrations, and custom code.

00:05:25.115 --> 00:05:27.590
Once we start creating
our projects,

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.210
I will show you how you can
use these options one by one.

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.265
But for now, you just
need to know that

00:05:34.265 --> 00:05:37.175
the project settings
exist actually.

00:05:37.175 --> 00:05:39.530
And there are some options

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.825
that you can get access to here.

00:05:41.825 --> 00:05:43.430
If I click on Designer,

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.295
we will be redirected
to the designer tool,

00:05:46.295 --> 00:05:49.070
which is this
environment are right,

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.690
that's all for this video.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.250
I'll see you in the next one.
