00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.650
When it comes to web design
and web development,

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.440
Typography plays
an important role.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.165
I can't imagine designing

00:00:12.165 --> 00:00:15.240
a website without
using text, can you?

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.240
So in this video, we're going
to talk about typography.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.475
If you head over
to the Add section

00:00:20.475 --> 00:00:22.799
under the topography category,

00:00:22.799 --> 00:00:25.425
you can see that we have
six different elements.

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:28.380
We have heading,
paragraph, text,

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.535
link, text, block, block
code, and reach ticks.

00:00:32.535 --> 00:00:34.650
So let's dive into each of them.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.310
I'm going to start with heading.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.140
Well, heading is an HTML tag.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.875
It's used to create
titles and subtitles.

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:47.630
We have six different
headings from H1 to H6.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.745
One important thing
about headings

00:00:49.745 --> 00:00:52.055
is that search engines and

00:00:52.055 --> 00:00:54.770
screen readers try to understand

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.235
the content of our website
based on headings.

00:00:58.235 --> 00:01:00.950
So you need to make sure
to use them properly.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.770
Right now, here I have
two different cards,

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.470
and right at the top
I have a heading.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.315
As you can see, it says H1.

00:01:08.315 --> 00:01:11.195
If I click on this
settings icon,

00:01:11.195 --> 00:01:13.385
I can choose the heading type.

00:01:13.385 --> 00:01:16.205
As you can see, we have
six different headings.

00:01:16.205 --> 00:01:18.620
H1 is the largest one,

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.365
H6 is the smallest one.

00:01:21.365 --> 00:01:24.725
Well, H1 defines the
most important title

00:01:24.725 --> 00:01:26.975
or subtitle on your webpage,

00:01:26.975 --> 00:01:30.815
while HCX defines the
least important title

00:01:30.815 --> 00:01:32.734
or subtitle on your webpage.

00:01:32.734 --> 00:01:34.520
So you need to make
sure to use them

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.905
wisely because
Google, for instance,

00:01:36.905 --> 00:01:39.320
checks your headings to analyze

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.855
your content and
rank your website.

00:01:41.855 --> 00:01:43.805
When we start
building our project,

00:01:43.805 --> 00:01:46.655
we will talk about headings
a lot, but for now,

00:01:46.655 --> 00:01:47.870
you just need to know that we

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.775
have six different headings.

00:01:49.775 --> 00:01:52.145
And H1 is the most
important one,

00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:55.640
and H6 is the least
important 11 thing

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.505
to mention here is
that you should never,

00:01:58.505 --> 00:02:01.085
ever use headings just to make

00:02:01.085 --> 00:02:04.670
a text bigger or
bold. That's wrong.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.320
To do that, you can use

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.200
CSS properties that we
will talk about later.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.035
Well, headings have
default stylings.

00:02:12.035 --> 00:02:16.415
They have default font
sizes, font weights, etc.

00:02:16.415 --> 00:02:20.255
But you can override the
default stylings later.

00:02:20.255 --> 00:02:21.470
Now let's move on to

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.715
the next topography element,
which is paragraph.

00:02:25.715 --> 00:02:30.500
Paragraph, lets us create
multi sentence content.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.835
As you can see here,

00:02:31.835 --> 00:02:33.800
I have a paragraph and there are

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.050
multiple lines of text here.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.724
I can double-click to easily
modify this paragraph.

00:02:39.724 --> 00:02:41.990
If I want to style

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.980
a specific word or
multiple words here,

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.560
I can select it just like this,

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.155
and I can use the
inline styling here.

00:02:51.155 --> 00:02:51.890
E.g. I.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.240
Can make it bold.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.360
I can make it a link
just like that,

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.175
or I can just select my
paragraph and clear formatting.

00:03:01.175 --> 00:03:04.955
We will talk about this
option wrap with span later.

00:03:04.955 --> 00:03:08.225
It's more advanced, so we're
going to leave it for now.

00:03:08.225 --> 00:03:11.570
Alright, now, let's move
on to the next element.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.000
As you can see here,
we have a text link.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.650
Well, a text link is

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.980
just a text that is clickable
just like a button.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.015
You can use it for a text
button. Drag and drop.

00:03:23.015 --> 00:03:25.310
It takes link here and
I'm going to place

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.695
it right next to this button.

00:03:27.695 --> 00:03:30.200
And as you can see,
this is just a link.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.645
It has all the
features of a link.

00:03:32.645 --> 00:03:35.555
As you can see, we
can specify a URL.

00:03:35.555 --> 00:03:38.840
We can just modify all
these preferences here.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.090
In fact, this Read
More button is

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.579
a text link with some padding.

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:45.905
So if you want to
create a custom button,

00:03:45.905 --> 00:03:48.170
you can simply use
a text link and

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.660
then style it are right.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.180
Now let's move on to
the next element,

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.145
which is textblock.

00:03:55.145 --> 00:03:57.050
Well, a textblock is used for

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.090
anything that is not a heading,

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.190
paragraph or a text link.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.470
Okay, so let me
go ahead and drag

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.705
and drop this textbook here.

00:04:05.705 --> 00:04:06.560
There we go.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.075
As you can see, it's just a
container with a text inside.

00:04:11.075 --> 00:04:14.825
You can double-click on it to
modify the text, style it.

00:04:14.825 --> 00:04:18.860
And you can even turn it into
a text link just like that.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:22.670
Now, the texts inside
is a link element.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.560
It's used for something like

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.055
a description or the
copyright disclaimer.

00:04:28.055 --> 00:04:31.655
We will talk about the use
cases of texts flux later.

00:04:31.655 --> 00:04:34.145
Alright, let's move on
to the next element,

00:04:34.145 --> 00:04:35.870
which is Blood code,

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.885
will block code, lets
you create a code.

00:04:38.885 --> 00:04:41.975
So let me drag and drop
this block code here.

00:04:41.975 --> 00:04:44.480
And as you can see,
it's just a text block

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.834
with some predefined styles.

00:04:46.834 --> 00:04:48.575
So if I double-click on that,

00:04:48.575 --> 00:04:50.930
I can simply modify the text.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.120
This is block code, okay?

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.645
And it has this left
border by default,

00:04:59.645 --> 00:05:03.020
you can obviously modify
all the properties.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.355
We will talk about that.

00:05:04.355 --> 00:05:07.250
So if you want to use a
code in your project,

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.195
you can use the blockquote
elements or alternatively,

00:05:11.195 --> 00:05:13.895
you can create it
manually, are right.

00:05:13.895 --> 00:05:16.685
Now let's move on to
the next element,

00:05:16.685 --> 00:05:18.200
which is rich texts.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.755
The rich text element
is so powerful. Why?

00:05:21.755 --> 00:05:26.240
Because it gathers all kinds
of elements together, e.g.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.520
here we have a rich takes.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.170
This rich takes can use

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.765
many different elements,
like headings,

00:05:32.765 --> 00:05:37.370
paragraphs, images, videos,
links, you name it.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.155
Why do we need to use them?

00:05:39.155 --> 00:05:42.560
Well, it's useful
because it's easier

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.265
to modify the contents
when we have a rich text.

00:05:46.265 --> 00:05:48.275
If I just double-click here,

00:05:48.275 --> 00:05:50.885
I can simply modify
this paragraph.

00:05:50.885 --> 00:05:53.225
I can just create
a new paragraph

00:05:53.225 --> 00:05:56.015
if I press Enter just like that,

00:05:56.015 --> 00:05:59.780
or I can just simply click
on this plus button and

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.530
upload an image or a
video or custom code,

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:04.865
or even at least.

00:06:04.865 --> 00:06:07.250
So let me go ahead
and upload an image.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.270
Here.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:09.860
There we go.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.645
Our image is ready.

00:06:11.645 --> 00:06:13.535
I can align it to the left.

00:06:13.535 --> 00:06:15.635
It's very easy to customize

00:06:15.635 --> 00:06:17.960
everything within the Rich Text.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.580
And most importantly, when you

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.964
create a website for a client,

00:06:21.964 --> 00:06:25.880
it's very practical to
use a regex because

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.735
the client is not a web
developer or a web designer,

00:06:29.735 --> 00:06:33.470
he or she needs to modify
the content easily.

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.990
They can just simply head over

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.245
to this reshaped and
just add images,

00:06:39.245 --> 00:06:42.350
videos, modify the
content style,

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:46.055
the heading styles,
paragraph, and so on.

00:06:46.055 --> 00:06:48.530
We will talk about
the editor later on.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.435
But for now you just
need to know that

00:06:50.435 --> 00:06:54.064
rich text can group
all kinds of elements,

00:06:54.064 --> 00:06:59.850
images, videos, headings,
paragraphs, anything.
