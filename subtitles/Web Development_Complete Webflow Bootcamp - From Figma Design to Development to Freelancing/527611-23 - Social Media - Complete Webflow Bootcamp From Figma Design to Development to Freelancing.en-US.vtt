00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.770
Adding social media buttons
to your website can

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.340
help drive more traffic to
your social media accounts.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.155
To do that, you can
use the Facebook

00:00:13.155 --> 00:00:15.000
or the tweeter components.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.660
I'm going to start
with Facebook.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.370
Let me drag and drop
it into my container.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.635
And as you can see, by default,

00:00:21.635 --> 00:00:23.285
there is a like button.

00:00:23.285 --> 00:00:25.835
There is the default
like number and this

00:00:25.835 --> 00:00:29.165
sign-up to see what your
friends like sentence.

00:00:29.165 --> 00:00:33.665
And here you can specify
the Facebook account URL.

00:00:33.665 --> 00:00:36.215
It could be the clients
Facebook account

00:00:36.215 --> 00:00:38.135
or your own Facebook account.

00:00:38.135 --> 00:00:40.040
If you are building
your own website,

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.635
you can modify the layout
here from standard

00:00:42.635 --> 00:00:45.290
to bikes to button.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.520
That's totally up to you.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.295
You can specify the
width and height here,

00:00:49.295 --> 00:00:52.070
and also you can modify
the language e.g. I.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.410
Can choose German,
I can change it

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.810
to Spanish, just like that.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.750
But for now, let's
keep it English.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:00.920
If I preview that,

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.320
if you click on that, you
will be taken to Facebook.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.245
But since we didn't
specify any account here,

00:01:06.245 --> 00:01:08.255
we will just go to facebook.com.

00:01:08.255 --> 00:01:10.880
But if you specify
an account here,

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.655
the user can like that
particular account.

00:01:13.655 --> 00:01:14.960
But what about to either,

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.435
let me remove this
Facebook component.

00:01:17.435 --> 00:01:20.180
I'm going to drag
and drop components,

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.785
the tweeter components here.

00:01:21.785 --> 00:01:23.450
And let's see what we have here.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.725
We have different options,

00:01:24.725 --> 00:01:27.035
button types like
tweet or follow.

00:01:27.035 --> 00:01:29.840
If you want the user
to tweet something,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.490
you can choose the tweet.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.925
And here you can specify
the website's URL.

00:01:34.925 --> 00:01:37.355
Here you can specify
a tweet texts,

00:01:37.355 --> 00:01:40.370
like check it out.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.700
Okay? And then you
can decide whether

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.180
the bubble should be shown
or not, just like that.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.740
And you can modify the layout

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.480
here we have the
horizontal layout.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.765
You can change it to
vertical or the size.

00:01:53.765 --> 00:01:55.820
You can change it to large.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.980
I'm going to hide
the bubble for now.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.405
Now let's preview that.

00:01:59.405 --> 00:02:02.615
If I preview it and I click
on this, there we go.

00:02:02.615 --> 00:02:05.105
I can see this, check it out.

00:02:05.105 --> 00:02:06.305
Webflow.com.

00:02:06.305 --> 00:02:09.290
This is the URL that
we can specify when we

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.695
are modifying the preferences
of that component.

00:02:12.695 --> 00:02:15.065
If I go to follow here,

00:02:15.065 --> 00:02:18.125
I can specify the
accounts username

00:02:18.125 --> 00:02:19.940
without the add sign because

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.710
the add sign is already there,

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:22.940
I can write my accounts

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.430
username and immediately
the number of

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.225
followers of that particular
account will be shown here.

00:02:29.225 --> 00:02:31.730
Okay, I'm going to
hide the bubble for

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.430
now and let's make it larger.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.545
Now let's see what happens.

00:02:36.545 --> 00:02:38.690
If I click on it, I can decide

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.895
whether I want to follow
this page or not.

00:02:40.895 --> 00:02:42.515
Since this is my own page,

00:02:42.515 --> 00:02:43.940
I'm not going to follow that.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.115
So let's move back.

00:02:46.115 --> 00:02:49.340
This is all about social
media components.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.770
I hope you enjoyed it,
and I'll see you then.
