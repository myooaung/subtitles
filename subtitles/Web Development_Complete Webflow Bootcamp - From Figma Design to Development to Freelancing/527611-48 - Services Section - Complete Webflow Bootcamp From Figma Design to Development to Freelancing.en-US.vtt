00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.290
Hey, in this video
we're going to

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.335
start building the
Services section together.

00:00:10.335 --> 00:00:12.750
So let's see how we
should structure it.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.375
As you can see here we
have another section.

00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:17.430
So first, we need to create

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.105
a section and inside
we need a container.

00:00:21.105 --> 00:00:22.890
Just like what we did here

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.110
for the recent projects section.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.795
We're gonna do the same
thing here as well.

00:00:27.795 --> 00:00:29.595
And inside this container,

00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:32.045
we're going to have
a heading for this,

00:00:32.045 --> 00:00:34.130
our services tidal and

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.710
then we're going to have
the services wrapper.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.230
It's going to be a
grid or a flexbox.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.745
We're gonna go with greed.

00:00:40.745 --> 00:00:42.920
And inside this
services container

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.765
or let's say services grid,

00:00:44.765 --> 00:00:47.360
we're going to have three
different div blocks.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.625
So here we have three
different cards,

00:00:49.625 --> 00:00:53.435
and each card should be
created using a div blog.

00:00:53.435 --> 00:00:55.565
So let's take this one, e.g.

00:00:55.565 --> 00:00:57.290
this is going to be a div block.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.850
And inside we're going to

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.370
have this icon and
we're going to create

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.450
this icon using diblock
and a div block inside.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.375
Once our top section is created,

00:01:08.375 --> 00:01:11.780
we will go ahead and
create the content section

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.215
here we need a title
and the description.

00:01:15.215 --> 00:01:18.035
And finally, we need
this Learn More button.

00:01:18.035 --> 00:01:19.265
And last but not least,

00:01:19.265 --> 00:01:21.860
we will duplicate
our diblock two

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.680
times to get three
different cards.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.435
Alright, it looks simple.

00:01:26.435 --> 00:01:29.000
So let's begin. First.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.210
I'm gonna go ahead and
select my body here.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.120
And then I'm gonna
hit Command key or

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.660
Control K and look for
a section. There we go.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.805
And new section has
been added here,

00:01:40.805 --> 00:01:42.740
and I'm gonna give it a class.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.500
The section class are right.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.180
This section is
not going to have

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.070
a specific width or height.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.665
However, I'm going to
give it a top margin.

00:01:51.665 --> 00:01:54.395
So let's take a look at
our design file here.

00:01:54.395 --> 00:01:55.985
As you can see,
we're going to need

00:01:55.985 --> 00:01:58.610
200 pixels top margin.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.460
So I'm going to select this
section and I'm going to

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.849
change its top margin
to 200 pixels.

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:07.295
There we go. But
we can see it now

00:02:07.295 --> 00:02:10.114
because there is nothing
inside our section.

00:02:10.114 --> 00:02:12.410
Okay, so how can we fix that?

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.420
First, I'm going to
select this section

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.045
and I'm gonna hit Command
key or Control K.

00:02:17.045 --> 00:02:20.195
And I'm going to add a div
block because as you know,

00:02:20.195 --> 00:02:22.055
we're going to need a container.

00:02:22.055 --> 00:02:23.735
And as you can see now we've got

00:02:23.735 --> 00:02:26.060
our 200 pixels top margin.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.804
And while this div
block is selected,

00:02:28.804 --> 00:02:31.474
I'm gonna give it
the container class.

00:02:31.474 --> 00:02:33.950
Okay, there we go.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.415
So now we have the maximum
width of 1,100 pixels.

00:02:37.415 --> 00:02:39.200
That's exactly what we need.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.609
And for this container,

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:43.130
I'm going to add a
combo class as well.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.530
I'm going to write services.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.395
And inside this container
we're going to have

00:02:48.395 --> 00:02:51.335
a heading and the
services wrapper.

00:02:51.335 --> 00:02:53.720
So while this
container is selected,

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.190
hit Command key or Control
K. And look for heading.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.335
This heading has been added,

00:03:00.335 --> 00:03:02.720
and I'm going to
choose H three here.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.805
And let me go ahead
and give it a class.

00:03:04.805 --> 00:03:07.460
Since it's CSS
properties should be

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.715
exactly the same as the
recent projects heading.

00:03:10.715 --> 00:03:12.350
Therefore, I'm going to set

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.920
the projects heading for
this heading as well.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.560
So I'm going to select
it and let's try it.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.950
Projects heading. There we go.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.060
Then I'm going to change
its text to our services.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.740
Let me go ahead and copy it.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:28.775
Okay, Cool.

00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:30.320
Are heading is ready.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.460
What else do we need?

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.845
We need the services wrapper.

00:03:33.845 --> 00:03:36.500
So while this
container is selected,

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.720
I'm gonna hit Command
key or Control K.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.015
And let's look for diblock.

00:03:41.015 --> 00:03:44.885
Then this diblock needs
a class as usual.

00:03:44.885 --> 00:03:46.490
So since we are going to change

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.785
the display setting
to grid later on,

00:03:48.785 --> 00:03:52.399
I'm going to name it
services underscore.

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:54.035
Underscore grid.

00:03:54.035 --> 00:03:54.815
Okay.

00:03:54.815 --> 00:03:56.135
It's not a grid now,

00:03:56.135 --> 00:03:58.940
but later we will
change it to greet.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.960
This services grid needs
to have some top margins.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.490
Let me check it out here.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.220
If I select this
services wrapper and

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.980
I hold down the Alt key or
Option key on my keyboard,

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.645
you can see that
we're going to need

00:04:11.645 --> 00:04:14.195
70 pixels, a top margin.

00:04:14.195 --> 00:04:15.890
So I'm going to select

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.960
this services grid and

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.970
I'm going to add
some margins to it.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.525
So let's set it to 70 pixels.

00:04:23.525 --> 00:04:24.755
Are right, cool.

00:04:24.755 --> 00:04:28.925
Now that's our services
greed def block is created.

00:04:28.925 --> 00:04:31.220
We need another div block inside

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.430
for our service card,
okay, therefore,

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.069
while this service
grid is selected,

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:39.410
let's look for a div block,

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.770
and this block is going
to have a new class.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.360
Let's name it service
underscore, underscore card.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.110
This card is going to have
a specific maximum width,

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.625
but we're not going to specify

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:54.065
a particular height for now,

00:04:54.065 --> 00:04:55.940
we're going to set
the height to auto.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.450
But if I select this
service one card here,

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.695
you can see that the width
is set to 340 pixels.

00:05:03.695 --> 00:05:05.480
Therefore, we're going to set

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.470
the maximum width to 340 pixels.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.425
Nice, and this card is white.

00:05:12.425 --> 00:05:13.535
So what should we do?

00:05:13.535 --> 00:05:14.750
Yes, you are right.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.465
We need to change the
background color here.

00:05:17.465 --> 00:05:18.710
So I'm going to hit over to

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.740
the background section and
using these color picker,

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.650
I'm going to change
its color to white.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.855
Okay. Cool. But it
looks too small.

00:05:26.855 --> 00:05:28.580
Yes, because we didn't set

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.595
a specific height for net
and that's totally fine.

00:05:31.595 --> 00:05:34.835
As soon as we add more
elements to this diblock,

00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:36.365
its height will grow.

00:05:36.365 --> 00:05:37.835
So don't worry about it.

00:05:37.835 --> 00:05:40.775
Alright, who wants this
service card is selected.

00:05:40.775 --> 00:05:43.175
We're going to add
some elements to it.

00:05:43.175 --> 00:05:46.235
What do we need? We
need two div blocks.

00:05:46.235 --> 00:05:48.230
We need the service icon,

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.350
the blog, and the service
content if block.

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.245
So let's look for the block.

00:05:54.245 --> 00:05:55.550
And again, I'm going to select

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.495
service card and look for
another div block, okay?

00:05:59.495 --> 00:06:01.310
Now we have two blocks

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.170
that are placed on
top of each other.

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:06.500
I'm going to give them a
class for the first block,

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.150
for this top block,

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:13.039
I'm going to name it service
underscore, underscore icon.

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:14.855
For the bottom div block.

00:06:14.855 --> 00:06:18.770
I'm going to name it
service underscore,

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.930
underscore content.

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.710
The top div block is gonna
be used for our icon and

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.220
the bottom diblock is going
to contain our content.

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.350
So let's start with the icon.

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:32.975
I'm going to select the
service icon, the block,

00:06:32.975 --> 00:06:35.795
and let's head over to
our design fine here.

00:06:35.795 --> 00:06:37.235
If I select this icon,

00:06:37.235 --> 00:06:39.320
you can see that we
have this circle and

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.425
its width and height
are set to 80 pixels.

00:06:42.425 --> 00:06:45.110
Therefore, I'm going to
specify the width and height

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.900
here to 80 pixels,
just like that.

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.455
And then I'm going to modify
its backgrounds color.

00:06:51.455 --> 00:06:54.845
Here, we need to use
neutral light blue.

00:06:54.845 --> 00:06:56.480
So let's go ahead and modify

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.200
the background's color
to neutral light blue,

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.349
just like that, then we
need to make it circular.

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:07.520
So I'm going to change the
radius to 50 per cent.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.835
And there we go, our
circle is ready.

00:07:10.835 --> 00:07:12.185
But what about the icon?

00:07:12.185 --> 00:07:13.595
Well, for the icon,

00:07:13.595 --> 00:07:14.765
we have two options.

00:07:14.765 --> 00:07:17.765
First, we can go ahead
and add an image here.

00:07:17.765 --> 00:07:19.055
Second, we can add

00:07:19.055 --> 00:07:22.130
another div block inside
this service icon,

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:25.190
the block and put
our icon there.

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:29.075
The second option is more
flexible in terms of alignment.

00:07:29.075 --> 00:07:31.775
But let's go ahead and
check out the first option.

00:07:31.775 --> 00:07:33.785
I'm going to add an image here

00:07:33.785 --> 00:07:35.810
using the bank runs
image section,

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:39.170
and I'm going to choose
this first icon.

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:42.695
Then I'm going to change
its position to center.

00:07:42.695 --> 00:07:45.079
And I am going to set
the time to downtime.

00:07:45.079 --> 00:07:45.875
There we go.

00:07:45.875 --> 00:07:47.615
Our icon is ready.

00:07:47.615 --> 00:07:50.540
Now we need to move
on to the next block.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:51.875
But before doing that,

00:07:51.875 --> 00:07:55.865
let's give this service
icon diblock some margins.

00:07:55.865 --> 00:07:57.845
I'm going to scroll up.

00:07:57.845 --> 00:08:01.970
I'm going to set its top
margin to 40 pixels.

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:04.310
Let's take a look
at our design file.

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:06.140
Yes, the top margin
is going to be

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:10.070
40 pixels and the left margin
is going to be 30 pixels.

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:13.505
So I'm going to set
its top margin to 40

00:08:13.505 --> 00:08:17.345
and it's left margin
to 30 pixels.

00:08:17.345 --> 00:08:20.540
But look, I couldn't get
the 40 pixel top margin.

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:21.440
Why is that?

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.300
That's because the
second div block,

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.760
this service content
div block is

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.415
taking up the
available space here.

00:08:28.415 --> 00:08:30.980
Therefore, this icon,
the service icon,

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.115
can have that for the
pixel top margin,

00:08:34.115 --> 00:08:36.185
since we didn't give
a specific height

00:08:36.185 --> 00:08:37.625
to this service card.

00:08:37.625 --> 00:08:39.365
So that's totally fine.

00:08:39.365 --> 00:08:41.960
Now, let's move on to
the service content,

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.780
and later on we will
get that top margin.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:47.690
So what do we need inside
this service content?

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:50.075
Let's take a look
at our design file.

00:08:50.075 --> 00:08:52.790
Inside that service content div.

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:54.995
We're going to have
another div block

00:08:54.995 --> 00:08:57.140
to put these texts layers in.

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.060
And then we're going
to need a link,

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:00.725
Martin, okay, it takes link.

00:09:00.725 --> 00:09:03.410
So let's go ahead and
create a div block.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:06.034
Wildly service
content is selected.

00:09:06.034 --> 00:09:08.435
I'm gonna hit Command
key or Control K

00:09:08.435 --> 00:09:11.420
and look for a
diblock. There we go.

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.385
Inside this service contents,

00:09:13.385 --> 00:09:15.290
we have a new div block.

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:18.890
This new div block is
going to need a class.

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:20.180
So I'm gonna go to

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.790
the selector and let's
add a new class.

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:27.754
I'm going to write service
underscore, underscore text.

00:09:27.754 --> 00:09:30.875
And inside we need two
different texts blocks.

00:09:30.875 --> 00:09:32.750
So while it's selected,

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:34.100
let's hit Command key or

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.875
Control K and look
for textblock.

00:09:36.875 --> 00:09:39.665
There we go. This is
the first textblock.

00:09:39.665 --> 00:09:41.840
I'm going to need
another one as well.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.690
So once again, I'm going to
select service contents,

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:46.655
hit Command key or Control K,

00:09:46.655 --> 00:09:48.470
and look for textblock.

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:50.930
Okay, we've got two
texts plugs ear,

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.030
but they don't have any classes.

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:54.560
So I'm gonna select

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.365
the first one and I'm
gonna give it a class.

00:09:57.365 --> 00:10:01.310
I can write service
underscore, underscore title.

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:05.390
However, since this title and
the description is going to

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:09.965
have the same styling as
we have here for this car,

00:10:09.965 --> 00:10:11.300
for this project card,

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.310
I'm going to give it the
class that we created

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:15.635
for this tidal and
for the description,

00:10:15.635 --> 00:10:17.795
it should be project
description.

00:10:17.795 --> 00:10:20.945
So let's go ahead and
select the first textblock

00:10:20.945 --> 00:10:24.410
and let's ride project title.

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:25.940
Okay, there it is.

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:27.305
And for the next one,

00:10:27.305 --> 00:10:31.520
I'm going to write project and
then look for description.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.815
Here it is, our right. Cool.

00:10:33.815 --> 00:10:36.065
Now I'm gonna go ahead and

00:10:36.065 --> 00:10:38.840
copy this text and
paste it here.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.640
And for the description as well,

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.095
I'm going to copy it.

00:10:42.095 --> 00:10:45.620
And let's paste it right here,

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:48.154
right below this service text,

00:10:48.154 --> 00:10:50.570
we're going to need
a link blog as well.

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:51.800
However, as you can see,

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.975
this project description is not

00:10:53.975 --> 00:10:56.930
inside our service
texts, the blog.

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:59.570
I'm going to drag it and I'm
going to make sure that it's

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:02.420
nested inside the
service diblock.

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:05.060
Okay, now I'm going to select

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:08.135
service content and I'm
gonna look for a text link.

00:11:08.135 --> 00:11:10.085
Okay, there we go.

00:11:10.085 --> 00:11:13.385
We've got our text link and
we don't need to create

00:11:13.385 --> 00:11:15.080
new properties for that

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.435
because we have our
link button here.

00:11:17.435 --> 00:11:20.060
So I'm going to choose
that and I'm going

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:23.195
to give it the
link button class.

00:11:23.195 --> 00:11:24.635
There we go.

00:11:24.635 --> 00:11:28.985
Can you see how beneficial it
is to use classes properly?

00:11:28.985 --> 00:11:33.605
And finally, I'm going to
change its text to learn more.

00:11:33.605 --> 00:11:34.985
Our right Cool.

00:11:34.985 --> 00:11:36.365
We're almost done.

00:11:36.365 --> 00:11:36.650
Now.

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:39.920
We just need to change some
properties in order to

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.445
make our card larger and
modifying the alignment.

00:11:43.445 --> 00:11:47.765
First, I'm going to select
this service content div blog.

00:11:47.765 --> 00:11:51.305
And as you can see, the display
setting is set to block.

00:11:51.305 --> 00:11:53.450
I'm gonna change
it to Flexbox and

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:55.745
I'm going to change the
direction to vertical,

00:11:55.745 --> 00:11:56.810
and I'm going to change

00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:59.390
the justification
to space between.

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:02.660
Then I'm going to select the
service card, the block.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:04.475
And I'm going to
repeat the same thing.

00:12:04.475 --> 00:12:06.875
I'm going to change
the display setting to

00:12:06.875 --> 00:12:08.270
Flexbox and I'm going to

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:10.370
change the direction
to vertical.

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:12.680
Okay, now we've got
our top margin.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.450
However, for this description

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:16.355
we don't have any bottom margin.

00:12:16.355 --> 00:12:17.960
Therefore, I am going to select

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.150
this project description and I'm

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:22.445
going to give it
some bottom margin.

00:12:22.445 --> 00:12:25.460
Its bottom margin is
set to ten pixels.

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:28.625
I'm going to give it a
40 pixel bottom margin.

00:12:28.625 --> 00:12:30.485
So let's modify that.

00:12:30.485 --> 00:12:32.345
Now it looks much better.

00:12:32.345 --> 00:12:34.790
As you can see, our
current looks exactly the

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:37.940
same as what we have
here in our design file.

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:40.295
And that's exactly what
we were looking for.

00:12:40.295 --> 00:12:41.615
What should we do now?

00:12:41.615 --> 00:12:44.105
Well, the hard part is done.

00:12:44.105 --> 00:12:46.685
Now we need to select
our service card.

00:12:46.685 --> 00:12:47.960
We need to duplicate it.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.850
So I'm going to
right-click here.

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:52.760
And I'm going to hit
duplicate two times.

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.160
I'm going to repeat
this process two times.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.130
And there we go. We've got
three different cards.

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:00.935
However, they are stacked
on top of each other.

00:13:00.935 --> 00:13:02.420
And we have two options.

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:06.125
We can either go with a
flexbox or with grid.

00:13:06.125 --> 00:13:09.410
Since I'm going to keep
our design consistent,

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:11.510
I'm gonna go with
grid because for

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:13.880
this section we use
a grid as well.

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.050
Therefore, I'm going to select

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:17.015
the services grid live black,

00:13:17.015 --> 00:13:18.770
and I'm going to
change its display

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:20.750
setting to create nice,

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:22.295
You know what we need to do?

00:13:22.295 --> 00:13:23.960
We need to remove one of

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:27.230
these rows and we need to
add one more column here.

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:30.005
And finally, I'm going
to change the gap from

00:13:30.005 --> 00:13:34.040
16 pixels to 40 pixels,
just like that.

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:37.160
Alright, cool. Our
cards are almost ready.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.140
The only thing I need to do is

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.600
modify these icons
and the content.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:45.065
So let me go ahead and
quickly modify this icon.

00:13:45.065 --> 00:13:48.395
If I select this service
icon, the block,

00:13:48.395 --> 00:13:49.580
I can head over to

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:53.105
the background section and
I can choose another image.

00:13:53.105 --> 00:13:56.075
But something happens as
soon as I change this image,

00:13:56.075 --> 00:14:00.170
since I didn't add a combo
class to this base class,

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:01.715
if I change this icon,

00:14:01.715 --> 00:14:04.190
all these icons
will be affected.

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:06.290
So let me show you what I mean.

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:07.280
There we go.

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.855
This is not what we want.

00:14:08.855 --> 00:14:11.705
Therefore, what I'm
gonna do is go ahead and

00:14:11.705 --> 00:14:15.230
add a combo class to this
service icon diblock.

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:16.835
I'm going to write two.

00:14:16.835 --> 00:14:18.125
And for this one,

00:14:18.125 --> 00:14:20.720
I'm going to write 3.4,

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.195
the first one,
That's right, one,

00:14:23.195 --> 00:14:25.670
although the first
one is not necessary,

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:27.605
I'm gonna give you the
combo class that I could

00:14:27.605 --> 00:14:29.720
organize my elements easily.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:33.019
Alright, now I can
select this series icon.

00:14:33.019 --> 00:14:35.840
And then if I change its icon,

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:38.060
the other icons
won't be affected.

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:39.980
So I'm going to choose
the second one.

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:40.880
Nice.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.335
For the third one,

00:14:42.335 --> 00:14:44.195
I'm going to do the same thing.

00:14:44.195 --> 00:14:45.635
And let's choose this one.

00:14:45.635 --> 00:14:48.335
Our right, our icons are ready.

00:14:48.335 --> 00:14:49.550
Now I am going to go ahead and

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:51.965
change the title and
the description.

00:14:51.965 --> 00:14:56.015
So let me quickly copy and
paste these texts here.

00:14:56.015 --> 00:14:58.700
Are right guys, that's
all for this video

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.610
are services section
is ready as well.

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:05.700
I hope you enjoyed it and
I'll see you in the next one.
