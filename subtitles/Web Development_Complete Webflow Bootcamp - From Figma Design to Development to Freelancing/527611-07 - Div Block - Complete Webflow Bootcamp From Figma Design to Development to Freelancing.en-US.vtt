00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.765
What's a div block?

00:00:06.765 --> 00:00:12.060
Well, I do blog is the most
basic blocks on a web page.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.085
If you go to the Add section,

00:00:14.085 --> 00:00:17.190
you can see that we have
different sections here we

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.910
have layout, basic
topography, etc.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.690
And under the basic section
we have different elements.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.300
And the first one is
called div block.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.690
If I try to drag and
drop it into my Canvas,

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.190
you can see that the DFF block

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.035
has been added to
my canvas here,

00:00:34.035 --> 00:00:37.260
and it takes up the whole
width of the canvas.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.510
A def block actually is sized

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.885
based on that content inside.

00:00:41.885 --> 00:00:43.400
However, here, as you can see,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.680
it created a boundary
and it seems

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.530
that there is a
some space inside.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.540
However, if I preview that,

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.195
if I just click on this icon,

00:00:53.195 --> 00:00:55.115
you can see that
nothing is here.

00:00:55.115 --> 00:00:57.320
It's actually an empty box.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.570
It's a dynamic bikes
because when you

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.985
add more and more
elements into it,

00:01:01.985 --> 00:01:04.325
it's size will be
changed accordingly.

00:01:04.325 --> 00:01:05.765
So let's give it a try.

00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:07.865
I'm going to go
ahead and try to add

00:01:07.865 --> 00:01:10.505
a heading into this diblock.

00:01:10.505 --> 00:01:12.950
Just like that. Now, I'm

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.065
gonna go ahead and
add a paragraph.

00:01:15.065 --> 00:01:16.280
There we go.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.865
And let me go ahead
and add a button.

00:01:19.865 --> 00:01:21.470
Okay, cool.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.295
Now these three elements
are inside this div block.

00:01:25.295 --> 00:01:26.435
And as you can see,

00:01:26.435 --> 00:01:29.960
that def block size has
been changed accordingly.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.629
If I remove one of
these elements,

00:01:32.629 --> 00:01:35.855
you can see that the def
block size has been changed.

00:01:35.855 --> 00:01:38.855
Again, a def block
generally can be anything.

00:01:38.855 --> 00:01:40.385
It could be an image,

00:01:40.385 --> 00:01:42.020
it could be a line.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.695
But most of the time we use
a div block in order to

00:01:45.695 --> 00:01:50.150
align elements and group
elements together, e.g.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.090
here we group these
two elements together.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.300
And whenever we
want to modify e.g.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.480
the margin of this
particular div block,

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.910
we can just head over
to this pasting section

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.815
on the Stein panel here.

00:02:03.815 --> 00:02:04.700
E.g. I.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.760
Can set the top margin to 70.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.810
And there we go.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.270
Both these elements
have been moved because

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.790
they are grouped
inside this div luck,

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.470
although a def block takes up

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.229
the whole width of the
canvas by default,

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:21.800
we can also give it a
specific width and height.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.110
If you head over to
the Size section

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.805
on the style panel here,

00:02:25.805 --> 00:02:28.940
you can specify a
particular width, e.g.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.770
400 pixels.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:31.745
And there we go.

00:02:31.745 --> 00:02:33.680
We can modify the
height as well.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.365
You can set it to 300 pixels

00:02:36.365 --> 00:02:39.785
and the deep blacks
height has been modified.

00:02:39.785 --> 00:02:41.600
Now this div luck has

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.680
a fixed width and height
depending on our needs,

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.820
we can give our div blocks
specific width and height.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:50.975
As I mentioned before,

00:02:50.975 --> 00:02:54.155
a def block can be
anything e.g. an image.

00:02:54.155 --> 00:02:55.985
Let me go ahead
and drag and drop

00:02:55.985 --> 00:02:59.990
another div block here
right below this paragraph.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.190
And let's suppose we want
to add an image here, e.g.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.755
we want to make this
diblock an image.

00:03:06.755 --> 00:03:08.750
We can go to the side panel,

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.235
we can scroll down.

00:03:10.235 --> 00:03:12.709
And if we go to the
background section

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.515
here we have image and gradient.

00:03:15.515 --> 00:03:18.740
If I click on this
plus button from here,

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.425
I can click on Choose image and

00:03:21.425 --> 00:03:24.815
I can get access to
all my assets, e.g.

00:03:24.815 --> 00:03:27.635
let's use this
image and for now,

00:03:27.635 --> 00:03:29.990
we're not going to talk
about all these settings,

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.084
but let me change the
position to center and cover.

00:03:34.084 --> 00:03:34.730
There we go.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.905
As you can see, we
have this def block,

00:03:36.905 --> 00:03:40.910
but this def block actually
has an image bank around.

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.980
If I want to make it bigger,

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.470
I can set the size, e.g.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.050
the high to 400 pixels.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.625
Of course, we are
going to talk about

00:03:49.625 --> 00:03:51.440
all these properties actually,

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.950
these are CSS properties
in the upcoming videos,

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.150
but for now we just need to

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.520
focus on the web flows elements.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.180
We need to understand how
they work and why do we need

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.140
them in order to build a
professional and modern website.
