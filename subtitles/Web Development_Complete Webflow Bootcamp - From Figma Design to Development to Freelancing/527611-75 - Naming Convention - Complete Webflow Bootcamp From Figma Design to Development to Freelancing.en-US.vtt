00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.990
Hey, in this video
we're going to

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.255
talk about naming convention.

00:00:09.255 --> 00:00:10.920
Well, when you build a website,

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.515
you use many different
CSS classes,

00:00:13.515 --> 00:00:16.050
just like what we did
in our own project,

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.745
the circle agency project.

00:00:17.745 --> 00:00:20.175
And as you create more
and more classes,

00:00:20.175 --> 00:00:21.930
it gets harder and harder to

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.510
maintain and organize
all the classes,

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.405
combo classes, global
classes, everything.

00:00:27.405 --> 00:00:29.580
So in this video, I'm
going to introduce you to

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.650
a very popular naming convention

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.405
that you can use
in your projects.

00:00:33.405 --> 00:00:34.740
It's called bam.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.085
Bam stands for block
elements and modifier.

00:00:38.085 --> 00:00:39.615
Does it sound complicated?

00:00:39.615 --> 00:00:42.070
Don't worry, I'm going to
break it down for you.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.915
So first, I'm gonna go ahead
and create an elements.

00:00:44.915 --> 00:00:48.410
I'm going to just drag and
drop this navbar element here.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.660
And this navbar doesn't
have any class.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.195
So let's suppose we want
to create a class year.

00:00:53.195 --> 00:00:54.500
How should we named it?

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.810
Basically, it's
totally up to you.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.195
You can use your own
naming convention

00:00:59.195 --> 00:01:00.380
as long as you can keep

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.060
your classes organized and you

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.655
understand what you're
doing, it's totally fine.

00:01:04.655 --> 00:01:06.320
But if you're
working with a team

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.210
of developers and designers,

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.590
it would be better to use

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.615
a naming convention
system That's

00:01:11.615 --> 00:01:13.835
all other developers understand.

00:01:13.835 --> 00:01:16.430
So how does the system work?

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.885
Well, as I mentioned before,

00:01:17.885 --> 00:01:21.109
it stands for block,
element and Modifier.

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:22.880
So what does block refer to?

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.725
Block is our main element.

00:01:24.725 --> 00:01:26.555
For instance, here in this case,

00:01:26.555 --> 00:01:28.775
this navbar is our block,

00:01:28.775 --> 00:01:32.840
therefore, we're going to
just name it nav bar. Okay?

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.450
So we created our base class.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.670
Then if I extend it
in the Navigator,

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.470
we have a container here.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.450
This container is
going to be named

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.285
container because this
is another block.

00:01:44.285 --> 00:01:45.965
This is a main block.

00:01:45.965 --> 00:01:48.320
And then inside
we're going to have

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.990
different elements
like this brand link.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.970
We have this Nav Menu and

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.160
these nav links and

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.145
also this Menu button
which is hidden.

00:01:58.145 --> 00:02:01.175
So let's suppose we want
to name this brand link.

00:02:01.175 --> 00:02:02.330
How can we do that?

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.565
First, we need to
write our blockName.

00:02:04.565 --> 00:02:05.840
What's our main block?

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.140
It's navbar, rewrite navbar.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.965
And then we use two
underscores just like that.

00:02:12.965 --> 00:02:15.485
And then you need to write
the name of element.

00:02:15.485 --> 00:02:18.470
Here it's going to be
logo, just like that.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.425
Now we have our black name
and our element here.

00:02:21.425 --> 00:02:23.345
Okay, But what
about the modifier?

00:02:23.345 --> 00:02:26.329
Well, the modifier refers
to our combo classes.

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:28.490
So for instance, if I
just go ahead and select

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.670
this nav link and I
just give it a class.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.475
Let's write nav menu.

00:02:34.475 --> 00:02:37.895
Underscore, underscore nav link.

00:02:37.895 --> 00:02:39.905
Okay, so here we have

00:02:39.905 --> 00:02:42.050
our block and then we
have our elements,

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.135
and this link has
some properties.

00:02:44.135 --> 00:02:46.099
But let's suppose
we want to override

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.860
these properties
using a combo class.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.650
Then we can go ahead and
create a combo class.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.930
And this combo class is
going to be our modifier.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.435
Let's suppose we want
to change the color of

00:02:56.435 --> 00:02:59.300
these home link, e.g. to read.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.160
In this case, I can create

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.935
a new combo class and you can
write something like this.

00:03:03.935 --> 00:03:08.420
You can write dot
is dash, dash, red.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.400
Okay?

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.660
Then you can go ahead and modify

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.095
the color right in the
typography section to read.

00:03:15.095 --> 00:03:17.780
And here this dot is dash ash,

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.745
red is our modifier.

00:03:19.745 --> 00:03:21.230
You can name it
however you want,

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.780
but this is how
the system works.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.670
If I want to create
a new modifier,

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.160
I can remove this class
and then I can write

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.010
that is dash, dash green.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.469
For instance.

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:36.920
Let me go ahead and modify
this color to green.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.645
Something like this.

00:03:38.645 --> 00:03:41.465
And now I can simply switch
between these modifiers.

00:03:41.465 --> 00:03:43.460
It says is green is read.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:44.660
The whole point of using

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.760
this naming convention
system is that you

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.630
can simply understand what
each class does, e.g.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.405
here, you can immediately
understand that it's,

00:03:53.405 --> 00:03:56.525
a modifier, is green, is red.

00:03:56.525 --> 00:04:00.185
You can create different
modifiers like is big,

00:04:00.185 --> 00:04:02.090
is large, and e.g.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.115
if I choose navbar logo here,

00:04:04.115 --> 00:04:06.365
you will immediately
see the blockName,

00:04:06.365 --> 00:04:09.155
which is navbar, and
then the element logo.

00:04:09.155 --> 00:04:11.945
And you can simply
organize all your elements

00:04:11.945 --> 00:04:15.245
within the navigator when you
use this naming convention.

00:04:15.245 --> 00:04:16.910
But again, it's totally up to

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.875
you how you name your classes,

00:04:18.875 --> 00:04:22.250
as long as you keep them
organized and understandable,

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.540
you are free to use any

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.565
naming convention
system you want.

00:04:25.565 --> 00:04:28.295
But remember, you may
work on a small project

00:04:28.295 --> 00:04:31.625
and you may use your own
naming convention system.

00:04:31.625 --> 00:04:33.275
And it works perfectly.

00:04:33.275 --> 00:04:34.430
However, if we apply

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.954
the same naming convention
to a large-scale project,

00:04:37.954 --> 00:04:41.030
you may face difficulties
because if you create hundreds

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.435
of different pages and
hundreds of different classes,

00:04:44.435 --> 00:04:47.090
it could be a challenge to
organize and understand

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.300
all the combo classes
and classes you create.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.510
So in that case, you can use
the BAM naming convention.

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:54.515
Are right guys.

00:04:54.515 --> 00:04:56.600
I hope you found
this video helpful.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.400
I see you in the next video.
