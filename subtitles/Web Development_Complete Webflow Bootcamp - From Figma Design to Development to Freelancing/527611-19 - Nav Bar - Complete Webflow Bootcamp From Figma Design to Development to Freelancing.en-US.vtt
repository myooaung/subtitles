00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:10.065
Most websites nowadays have
a navigation bar at the top.

00:00:10.065 --> 00:00:12.855
If you take a look at
some famous websites,

00:00:12.855 --> 00:00:15.450
you can see that they
use a navigation bar in

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.750
order to show some many
options to the user, e.g.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.540
here we have the
navigation bar that has

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.960
some menus like
NAC, iPad, iPhone.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.339
Or here we have the navigation
worked at has products,

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:32.115
use cases, developers,
et cetera,

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:33.450
and also a button.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.155
Most navigation bars have
some common elements,

00:00:37.155 --> 00:00:40.140
like a logo that is clickable.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.830
So this is a link blog.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.180
They have some menu options.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.475
They are also usually
linked blocks,

00:00:46.475 --> 00:00:49.100
and they have a button
on the right side.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.805
So we can create
navigation bar manually

00:00:52.805 --> 00:00:56.960
using a div block and a link
blogs and other elements.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.320
But there is a pre-built
elements in Webflow.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.720
So if I scroll down here,

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.320
under the components,
there is the nav bar.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.180
If I drag and drop it into

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.820
my body element here,
as you can see,

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.250
this navbar has been added to

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.815
my canvas and it
has some elements.

00:01:15.815 --> 00:01:16.505
Inside.

00:01:16.505 --> 00:01:17.870
There is a container,

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.295
it's just a div block.

00:01:19.295 --> 00:01:20.750
We already talked about it.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.060
And inside there are
some other elements.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.505
There is a link blog
in which we will put

00:01:25.505 --> 00:01:28.670
our logo and then we
have the nav menus.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.035
This is another div plug
that holds all these links.

00:01:33.035 --> 00:01:35.975
And finally, there
is the Menu button,

00:01:35.975 --> 00:01:38.345
but we can't see any
menu button here.

00:01:38.345 --> 00:01:39.875
Just wait a second.

00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:44.345
Nav bar element is
dynamic and responsive.

00:01:44.345 --> 00:01:45.440
And if we go from

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.070
the desktop breakpoint
to tablet break point,

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.600
you can see what happens.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.005
All those menu links
are disappeared.

00:01:54.005 --> 00:01:57.305
And instead we have this
hamburger menu button.

00:01:57.305 --> 00:01:59.000
And this is associated with

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.820
this Menu button
in the Navigator,

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.655
which was not visible in
the desktop breakpoint.

00:02:04.655 --> 00:02:07.115
So the navbar is
already responsive.

00:02:07.115 --> 00:02:08.870
If I preview this project,

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.470
this Menu button appears.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.720
There is no logo because
we didn't add one yet.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.680
So this is basically
how a navbar works.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.675
We can customize these links.

00:02:20.675 --> 00:02:23.270
If we double-click on
any of these links,

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.655
we can modify the text.

00:02:25.655 --> 00:02:29.135
We can also select
this nav link element.

00:02:29.135 --> 00:02:32.795
And if I click on
this Settings icon,

00:02:32.795 --> 00:02:34.715
I can modify the URL.

00:02:34.715 --> 00:02:37.790
We can ask this to
take the user to

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.690
a specific page or to a specific
section of our website.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.300
This is just a link blog, okay?

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.735
Therefore, we have all the
properties of a link block.

00:02:47.735 --> 00:02:50.855
So a nav bar is
basically a diblock,

00:02:50.855 --> 00:02:52.835
which is responsive already,

00:02:52.835 --> 00:02:56.945
and it has some pre-built
elements that we can use.

00:02:56.945 --> 00:02:58.070
If you want to create

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.470
a custom navbar,
that's totally fine.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.435
You can do that simply.

00:03:02.435 --> 00:03:04.865
But most of the time we will use

00:03:04.865 --> 00:03:07.640
the nav bar element
because it makes

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.550
our life much easier
since it's already

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.790
responsive and everything
is ready for us.
