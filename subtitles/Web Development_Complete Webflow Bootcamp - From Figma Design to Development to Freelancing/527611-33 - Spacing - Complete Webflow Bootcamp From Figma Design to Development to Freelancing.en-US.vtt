00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.405
Here I have a card,

00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:07.770
but it doesn't look good.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.620
Why? Because of
the spacing here,

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.270
the content cannot breathe.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.740
Therefore, I need to modify

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.660
the spacing between
these elements,

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.800
as I mentioned before,

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.165
when it comes to spacing,

00:00:18.165 --> 00:00:20.025
we have two main components.

00:00:20.025 --> 00:00:22.215
We have the margin
and the padding.

00:00:22.215 --> 00:00:25.230
The margin is the space
outside the element,

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.375
and the padding is the
space inside an element.

00:00:28.375 --> 00:00:30.605
So let's take a look here.

00:00:30.605 --> 00:00:32.155
I'm going to select my card.

00:00:32.155 --> 00:00:33.260
If I want to add

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.930
some breathing room for
these texts block here,

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.195
I'm going to select
that and I can add

00:00:38.195 --> 00:00:41.705
left padding and right
padding just like that.

00:00:41.705 --> 00:00:43.850
Alternatively, what I can do is

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.745
select the card and
add the padding.

00:00:46.745 --> 00:00:49.130
However, this padding applies to

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.115
all the elements
inside this card,

00:00:52.115 --> 00:00:56.255
to all the children of
these card diblock.

00:00:56.255 --> 00:00:57.590
Let's give it a try.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.940
Just like that.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.455
And there we go.

00:01:00.455 --> 00:01:01.850
But this is not what I want.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.515
I'm going to undo the process

00:01:03.515 --> 00:01:05.345
and I'm going to
select the textblock,

00:01:05.345 --> 00:01:06.980
and I'm going to add 20 pixels

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.465
and left and right padding.

00:01:08.465 --> 00:01:11.510
However, it's very tedious
and time-consuming

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.885
to add the padding for
each side one by one.

00:01:14.885 --> 00:01:17.300
Therefore, I can hold
down the Option key on

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.894
Mac and Alt key on Windows,

00:01:19.894 --> 00:01:21.590
and then click and drag to

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.990
adjust the padding
for opposing sides.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.190
Just like that.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.315
If I want to change the padding
for all sides like top,

00:01:29.315 --> 00:01:30.965
bottom, left, and right.

00:01:30.965 --> 00:01:33.125
Instead of Option or Alt key,

00:01:33.125 --> 00:01:35.000
I need to hold down
the Shift key on

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.465
my keyboard and then click
and drag, check it out.

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:40.340
That saves a lot of time.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.840
But what about the margin?

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.050
Let me set the top
padding here to zero.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.170
And I'm going to select
this heading this time.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.455
Instead of padding, I'm
going to change the margin,

00:01:51.455 --> 00:01:53.840
the bottom margin, as
I mentioned before,

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.125
the margin is the space
outside of an element.

00:01:57.125 --> 00:01:59.960
Therefore, I'm going
to increase that by

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.310
ten pixels and the top margin
by ten pixels as well.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.905
Alright, it looks
much better now.

00:02:06.905 --> 00:02:10.400
Alright, now this card
is inside a container.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.445
If I take it outside this
container for a second,

00:02:13.445 --> 00:02:15.995
you can see that it
touches the edges.

00:02:15.995 --> 00:02:20.060
If I want to align it to
the center of my section,

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.655
let me remove this
container for a second.

00:02:22.655 --> 00:02:26.225
If I want to center it both
horizontally and vertically,

00:02:26.225 --> 00:02:27.860
I have some options.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.960
The first option
is that I can go

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.600
ahead and set the
margin manually,

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.775
just like this, which is nuts,

00:02:34.775 --> 00:02:37.730
a good option and you
shouldn't try that ever.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.865
The reason is when you
set the margin manually,

00:02:40.865 --> 00:02:43.595
it may look good on one device.

00:02:43.595 --> 00:02:46.595
However, if you go to
the iPad breakpoint,

00:02:46.595 --> 00:02:49.505
you can see that it's not
centered because it still

00:02:49.505 --> 00:02:52.580
has a 435 pixel margin.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.250
So you should never
do that, are right.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.410
I'm going to reset this margin.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.685
I'm going to click on that.

00:02:58.685 --> 00:03:00.470
And let's click on Reset.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.005
Alternatively, you can
hold down the Option or

00:03:03.005 --> 00:03:06.770
Alt key and then click
on that just like this.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.395
Alright, so how can I
align it to the center?

00:03:09.395 --> 00:03:10.760
I have different options.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.560
Whenever you have
an element that has

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.390
a fixed width like this,

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.075
when the width is defined here,

00:03:17.075 --> 00:03:20.105
as you can see here, the
width is 300 pixels.

00:03:20.105 --> 00:03:23.300
You can set the left and
right margin to auto.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.620
If I click on that,

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.065
I can set the left
margin to auto.

00:03:27.065 --> 00:03:28.580
And then I'm going to set

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.905
the right margin
to auto as well.

00:03:30.905 --> 00:03:31.850
There we go.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.935
Now it's centered perfectly.

00:03:33.935 --> 00:03:35.870
Let's give it a try. I'm
going to check if it's

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.150
responsive and if
it works properly,

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.590
I'm going to go to tablet.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.575
As you can see, it's
still in the middle.

00:03:42.575 --> 00:03:45.335
That's perfect. Alright,
this is one option.

00:03:45.335 --> 00:03:47.870
Okay, let me reset
these margins.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.245
You could just click on
this button right here.

00:03:51.245 --> 00:03:55.085
Now both left and right
margins are set to auto.

00:03:55.085 --> 00:03:57.650
However, keep in mind
that this way only

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.320
works when you have
a defined width.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.510
If not, you can use another way,

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.220
and that is flexbox.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.680
Alright, let me
reset this margins.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.350
Now I have this card
and I'm going to select

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.980
the section and the display
setting is set to block.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.779
I'm going to set it to flex.

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:16.340
I'm going to align it to

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.100
the center and justify
it to the center.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:19.790
There we go.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.335
We've got the same thing,

00:04:21.335 --> 00:04:23.165
but this option works even if

00:04:23.165 --> 00:04:26.540
your element doesn't
have a defined width.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.820
Alright, now I'm going to
show you another example.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.190
First, I'm going to
select this card,

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.300
and as you can see,

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.910
it's display setting
is set to block.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.665
Okay, I'm going to change it to

00:04:36.665 --> 00:04:38.975
flicks for a second
and everything

00:04:38.975 --> 00:04:41.780
is disorganized
because the direction

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.235
is set to horizontal.

00:04:43.235 --> 00:04:44.960
I'm going to change
it to vertical

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.445
or right, we're good again.

00:04:46.445 --> 00:04:49.625
And now I'm going to change
the alignment to center.

00:04:49.625 --> 00:04:51.170
Let me select the image now.

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.755
Let me change its
width to 200 pixels.

00:04:54.755 --> 00:04:57.485
It's high to 200 pixels as well.

00:04:57.485 --> 00:05:00.350
Sometimes we might need
to move this image

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.620
up in order to have
an overlay image.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:04.865
Okay, to do that,

00:05:04.865 --> 00:05:06.710
we can use negative space.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.675
Let me show you how it works.

00:05:08.675 --> 00:05:12.695
I'm going to select this
image here in the margin.

00:05:12.695 --> 00:05:15.320
I'm going to give it
a negative margin.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.335
Okay, just like
that, There we go.

00:05:18.335 --> 00:05:20.945
Using negative margins
is totally fine.

00:05:20.945 --> 00:05:24.470
In fact, many popular
websites use them,

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.095
are right guys, that's
all about spacing.

00:05:27.095 --> 00:05:28.430
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.440
I'll see you in the next video.
