00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.630
In this video, we're
going to create

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.045
the recent projects
section together.

00:00:09.045 --> 00:00:10.740
As you can see, this section has

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.545
a container that
contains this heading.

00:00:13.545 --> 00:00:17.645
And also this bottom section,
the project section.

00:00:17.645 --> 00:00:21.810
This project section, or
let's say projects rapper,

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.075
has a three different projects,

00:00:24.075 --> 00:00:27.045
and each project has
different elements,

00:00:27.045 --> 00:00:31.155
like an image at the
top, a title, subtitle.

00:00:31.155 --> 00:00:34.035
And finally, this
Learn More link.

00:00:34.035 --> 00:00:36.245
I'm going to go
ahead and as usual,

00:00:36.245 --> 00:00:38.120
first create a section.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.750
So let me select my body
and hit Command key or

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.425
Control K and look for
section. There we go.

00:00:45.425 --> 00:00:47.105
Our section has been added.

00:00:47.105 --> 00:00:49.670
Then I'm going to give
it the section class.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.640
So I'm going to write
section perfect.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.505
And finally, I'm gonna
give you the combo class,

00:00:55.505 --> 00:00:57.890
which is going to
be called projects.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:58.985
Fantastic.

00:00:58.985 --> 00:01:00.440
As you can see, since there is

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.255
nothing inside this section,

00:01:02.255 --> 00:01:03.470
it doesn't take up

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.755
any space here and
it's understandable.

00:01:06.755 --> 00:01:09.440
Now, widely section is selected.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.080
I'm gonna hit Command
key or Control key,

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.300
and I'm going to
look for a diblock.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.315
Now at this block is
inside this section,

00:01:17.315 --> 00:01:19.985
and I'm going to give
it the container class.

00:01:19.985 --> 00:01:21.125
There we go.

00:01:21.125 --> 00:01:23.765
Now our container
is ready as well.

00:01:23.765 --> 00:01:25.670
And finally, I'm
going to give this

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.220
section some top margins.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.920
So let me take a look
at my design here.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.650
If I select this
project section and if

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.530
I hold down the Option key
or Alt key on my keyboard,

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.370
you can see that it has
a 200 pixel top margin.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.335
So I'm gonna go
ahead and give it

00:01:42.335 --> 00:01:45.530
a 200 pixel top
margin here as well.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.795
Right? There we go.

00:01:47.795 --> 00:01:50.930
Now, what do we need
inside this container,

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.760
we are going to
need a heading and

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.040
then we need this
project's rapper.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.800
Okay, So first, let me
look for a heading.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.260
I'm gonna hit Command
key or Control K,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.940
and I'm going to write heading.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.250
Make sure to select
your container

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.845
while you are looking
for your elements.

00:02:06.845 --> 00:02:09.080
Because these elements
will be nested

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.855
inside the element that
is currently selected.

00:02:11.855 --> 00:02:14.150
So I am going to click
on this heading.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.020
There we go.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.320
Now this heading is
inside my container.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.489
And finally, I'm going
to change H1 to H2, H3.

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.550
And this is not right
because basically it should

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.790
be H2 and I will
explain it later.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.715
But I'm going to intentionally
make this mistake

00:02:31.715 --> 00:02:35.000
because later on when we will
talk about accessibility,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.830
I'm going to show
you why choosing

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.050
the right heading matters.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.985
But for now, Let's keep it.

00:02:40.985 --> 00:02:43.085
H three are right,

00:02:43.085 --> 00:02:44.900
and I'm gonna give it a class.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.160
I'm going to write

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.855
projects underscore
underscore heading.

00:02:50.855 --> 00:02:53.450
Then I'm going to modify some

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.060
of its topography properties.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.609
I'm going to change its font
size from 24 pixels to 40.

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:06.215
Finally, let me copy this
text and paste it over there.

00:03:06.215 --> 00:03:09.965
Great recent projects,
our heading is ready.

00:03:09.965 --> 00:03:12.065
So what else do we need now,

00:03:12.065 --> 00:03:13.655
right under this heading,

00:03:13.655 --> 00:03:16.430
we are going to have
the projects wrap her.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.290
Okay, so I'm going to select

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.540
this container and I'm
going to hit Command key

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.860
or Control K and look for
a diblock just like that.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.705
And I'm gonna give it a class.

00:03:26.705 --> 00:03:31.729
Let's call it Projects
underscore, underscore wrapper.

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:34.415
Alright, and now
these two elements

00:03:34.415 --> 00:03:36.829
are placed inside
this container.

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:40.430
However, this container has
a block display setting.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.260
I'm going to turn it to Flexbox,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.580
but before doing that,

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.695
make sure to give
it a combo class.

00:03:45.695 --> 00:03:47.360
It's so important. Why?

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.220
Because as I mentioned before,

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.070
when you don't add a
combo class and you

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.630
change the display setting or

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.445
any of these properties here,

00:03:55.445 --> 00:03:57.695
you are making the
changes globally.

00:03:57.695 --> 00:03:59.780
So if I turn it to Flexbox,

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.270
you can see that these
logos are messed up.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.430
If I change the
direction to vertical,

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.015
everything looks messed up
and that's not what we want.

00:04:08.015 --> 00:04:09.830
So here I'm going to select

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.130
the container and I'm going
to give it a combo class.

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.210
I'm going to ride
projects are right now.

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:20.900
I can change the display
setting to Flexbox and I'm

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.490
going to change the direction

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.665
from horizontal to vertical.

00:04:24.665 --> 00:04:25.400
Great.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.310
And let's change
the justification

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.725
to space between as well.

00:04:30.725 --> 00:04:32.870
Right now when I choose
that nothing happens,

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.975
but later on when we add
content to our projects wrapper

00:04:35.975 --> 00:04:39.530
and also add some
margins to this heading.

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:40.880
We will see the difference.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.400
Alright, so I'm gonna
select these projects,

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.594
wrap her, and I'm gonna
give it a top margin.

00:04:46.594 --> 00:04:50.345
So let me add 70
pixels top margin.

00:04:50.345 --> 00:04:52.640
If I take a look
at my design here,

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.425
I have 70 pixels,

00:04:54.425 --> 00:04:56.150
top margin as well.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.610
Alright, so inside we're

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.410
going to have three
different cards.

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.575
Therefore, I'm going to
need a main diblock.

00:05:03.575 --> 00:05:05.075
That is our main card.

00:05:05.075 --> 00:05:08.600
And inside that, we're going
to need two more blocks,

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.030
one for the top image and

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.625
the second one for
the bottom content.

00:05:13.625 --> 00:05:16.535
Okay, So let's start with adding

00:05:16.535 --> 00:05:20.450
the main diblock wireless
projects wrapper is selected.

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.820
I'm gonna hit Command
key or Control key,

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.740
and I'm going to
look for the block.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.360
Now inside there is

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.835
a diblock and I'm
gonna give it a class.

00:05:28.835 --> 00:05:32.630
Let's write project
card, just like that.

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.850
And this project card takes up

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.105
the whole width and whole
height of its parents,

00:05:38.105 --> 00:05:40.505
which is this project wrapper.

00:05:40.505 --> 00:05:42.320
And it's not what we want.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.505
We wanted to have

00:05:43.505 --> 00:05:47.600
a maximum width and
also a specific height.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.125
Okay, so if I go to
my design file here,

00:05:51.125 --> 00:05:54.110
and if I select this
project one, e.g.

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.060
you can see that this card has

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:01.895
a 340 pixel width and
a 444 pixel height.

00:06:01.895 --> 00:06:05.270
So I'm going to set
the maximum width to

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:11.720
340 pixels and the height to
444 pixels, just like that.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.970
All right, Our project
card is ready.

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.740
We're not going to
duplicate it now

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.930
because first we are
going to design it.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.880
Later, we will duplicate it.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.265
So what do we need
here inside that,

00:06:22.265 --> 00:06:24.860
we will need two
different div blocks,

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.360
as I mentioned before, one for

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.105
the image and the second
one for the content.

00:06:29.105 --> 00:06:31.100
So while it's selected,

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.710
I'm gonna hit Command
key or Control K,

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.005
and I'm gonna look
for a diblock.

00:06:36.005 --> 00:06:36.800
Okay?

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.335
Our first div block is ready,

00:06:39.335 --> 00:06:41.675
and I'm going to
give it a class.

00:06:41.675 --> 00:06:44.780
So let's call it
project underscore,

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.795
underscore image,
just like that.

00:06:47.795 --> 00:06:51.500
And inside we will need
to add an image element.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.020
So while this project image,

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.475
the black is selected,

00:06:55.475 --> 00:06:58.820
I'm going to look for an
image component here.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.405
And let me look for
one of these images.

00:07:02.405 --> 00:07:05.750
Number one, from my
assets are right, cool.

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.270
I'm going to select this
image in my design file.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:12.635
And as you can see, the
height is set to 240 pixels.

00:07:12.635 --> 00:07:14.990
Therefore, I'm going to go ahead

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:17.570
and here I'm going to
give it a class first.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:20.809
Let's write project underscore,

00:07:20.809 --> 00:07:25.880
underscore card, underscore
image, just like that.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:30.964
And finally, I'm going to set
its height to 240 pixels.

00:07:30.964 --> 00:07:34.355
And let me modify the
feet from field to cover.

00:07:34.355 --> 00:07:36.680
This way, I can make
sure that it will

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.995
cover the project image,
the black perfectly.

00:07:39.995 --> 00:07:44.240
And also I'm gonna
give it a 100% width.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.585
So I'm going to set
its width to 100%.

00:07:47.585 --> 00:07:51.470
This way, it will take up the
whole width of its parent,

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:55.220
which is this project image
and also the project card.

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:58.100
Alright, cool. The
first part is ready.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.395
Now while this project card,

00:08:00.395 --> 00:08:01.925
div black is selected,

00:08:01.925 --> 00:08:04.565
I'm going to add
another div block here.

00:08:04.565 --> 00:08:05.750
There we go.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:07.085
And I'm going to
give it a class.

00:08:07.085 --> 00:08:12.095
And let's name it Project
underscore, underscore content.

00:08:12.095 --> 00:08:14.360
First, I'm going
to make sure that

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.625
this project content div block

00:08:16.625 --> 00:08:19.595
takes up the whole
available height here.

00:08:19.595 --> 00:08:22.130
As you can see, we
have some space,

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:24.365
but this project
content div block

00:08:24.365 --> 00:08:26.930
is not covering all this space.

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:29.000
Therefore, I'm going
to select that.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.265
And if I head over
to the side section,

00:08:31.265 --> 00:08:36.035
I can set its height to
100% just like that.

00:08:36.035 --> 00:08:37.235
But there is a problem.

00:08:37.235 --> 00:08:41.195
As you can see now it's
outside our project card. Why?

00:08:41.195 --> 00:08:44.345
Because this project card
has a specific height

00:08:44.345 --> 00:08:47.705
and the display setting
is set to luck.

00:08:47.705 --> 00:08:49.940
So in order to fix this problem,

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.050
I'm going to select this

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:52.910
project card and
I'm going to change

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:56.720
its display setting
from block to Flexbox.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.690
And it's gonna be vertical
because we will have

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:01.940
two different
children inside that

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.609
should stack on top of
each other vertically.

00:09:04.609 --> 00:09:07.685
Okay, so now
everything looks good.

00:09:07.685 --> 00:09:09.605
We have the project content.

00:09:09.605 --> 00:09:12.350
We have the project
card image as well.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:13.880
If I go to my design file,

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.360
you can see that this card
has a white background,

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.235
but here we don't
have any background.

00:09:19.235 --> 00:09:20.690
So let me select

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:24.889
my project card and then if
I head over to the color,

00:09:24.889 --> 00:09:27.125
I'm going to write white here.

00:09:27.125 --> 00:09:27.875
There we go.

00:09:27.875 --> 00:09:30.185
Now we've got the
white background.

00:09:30.185 --> 00:09:32.465
And inside this project content,

00:09:32.465 --> 00:09:35.045
we will need to have one title,

00:09:35.045 --> 00:09:39.080
one subtitle, and
one Learn More link.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.495
Okay, so how can
we structure that?

00:09:41.495 --> 00:09:42.440
Let me see.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:47.300
If I turn this project
content to a flexbox.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:51.710
And inside I put a div
block and a link blog.

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:54.590
I could easily get
what I have here.

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:59.075
How when I turn this project
content to a flexbox,

00:09:59.075 --> 00:10:01.440
I can change its
justification easily,

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.640
then I can achieve this
exact same design.

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.725
So let me show you how it works.

00:10:06.725 --> 00:10:09.365
Right now, this project content.

00:10:09.365 --> 00:10:11.930
As the block display
setting and there

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:14.644
is nothing inside
while it's selected.

00:10:14.644 --> 00:10:16.760
I'm gonna hit Command
key or Control

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.130
K. And I'm going to
add a div block here,

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:21.290
and I'm going to
give it a class.

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:23.975
So let's go ahead
and create a class.

00:10:23.975 --> 00:10:28.174
I'm going to write project
underscore, underscore text.

00:10:28.174 --> 00:10:30.365
And inside this div block,

00:10:30.365 --> 00:10:32.765
I'm going to have two
different texts blocks.

00:10:32.765 --> 00:10:34.880
I'm going to hit Command
K and I'm going to look

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.040
for textblock. There we go.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.225
This is the first one.

00:10:38.225 --> 00:10:39.545
Let me give it a class.

00:10:39.545 --> 00:10:42.200
I'm going to run it
project underscore,

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.690
underscore title,
and I'm going to

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:47.600
modify its topography
properties.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.460
The font is gonna be Roboto.

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.850
The weight is going
to be 500 or medium.

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:57.290
The size is going to be 24
pixels, just like that,

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:58.580
the line-height is gonna be

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:02.540
150 per cent and the
color looks fine.

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:06.365
Now I'm gonna go ahead and
copy and paste this title.

00:11:06.365 --> 00:11:07.790
Let me choose that,

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:10.160
copy it and paste it here.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.650
Simplifying, this is the
name of the project.

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:14.270
These are fictional projects,

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:16.205
by the way, are right, cool.

00:11:16.205 --> 00:11:18.305
So our title is ready.

00:11:18.305 --> 00:11:20.375
Now I'm going to
modify its spacing.

00:11:20.375 --> 00:11:22.730
I'm going to give
it some margins.

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:24.530
I'm going to hold
down the Option key

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:26.525
and Shift key on my keyboard.

00:11:26.525 --> 00:11:31.130
And let's add an equal
margin. All sides.

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:34.100
I'm going to give it
a 30 pixel margin.

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:37.835
Maybe I could decrease the
bottom margin to 20 pixels.

00:11:37.835 --> 00:11:39.620
Alright, now I'm going to copy

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:42.320
this title Command
C or Control C,

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.745
Command V or Control V.

00:11:43.745 --> 00:11:47.495
Then I'm going to add my
description or subtitle here.

00:11:47.495 --> 00:11:51.290
However, make sure to
duplicate your class first.

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:53.090
It's so important
because we're going

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:54.725
to modify its properties.

00:11:54.725 --> 00:11:58.100
Otherwise, we will change
the project title as well.

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:01.130
So first, click on
this little arrow,

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:03.455
duplicate this class, and change

00:12:03.455 --> 00:12:06.740
its name to project description.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:11.645
Just like this description.

00:12:11.645 --> 00:12:15.935
The first thing I'm gonna do
is remove the top margin.

00:12:15.935 --> 00:12:18.470
I don't need it. I'm going to
hold down the option key on

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:21.395
my keyboard or Alt
key and click on it,

00:12:21.395 --> 00:12:25.745
then I'm going to decrease the
bottom margin to ten here.

00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:27.275
There we go.

00:12:27.275 --> 00:12:31.355
Now, I can go ahead and modify
the topography properties.

00:12:31.355 --> 00:12:33.620
So let's start with the weight.

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:35.600
It's going to be normal.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.235
The size is going to be

00:12:37.235 --> 00:12:40.640
17 peach cells and the
height looks fine.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.800
However, the color
should be changed

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.515
to our mutual medium color.

00:12:45.515 --> 00:12:50.569
Now I can simply copy this
text and paste it here.

00:12:50.569 --> 00:12:53.060
There we go. Alright,
now I'm going to

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:55.820
select this project texts
and I'm going to change

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:58.655
its display setting to Flexbox

00:12:58.655 --> 00:13:01.970
and make sure to change
the direction to vertical.

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:04.130
It looks much better
now and make sure

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:06.425
that it's justified to the top.

00:13:06.425 --> 00:13:10.009
Now wine the project
content block is selected.

00:13:10.009 --> 00:13:13.385
I'm gonna hit Command key or
Control key on my keyboard.

00:13:13.385 --> 00:13:15.875
And let me look for a text link.

00:13:15.875 --> 00:13:18.350
We're going to
create a text link

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:21.245
like what we did here
for this hero section.

00:13:21.245 --> 00:13:23.045
So first, as usual,

00:13:23.045 --> 00:13:24.650
we will give it a class.

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:28.715
I'm going to write Link
button, just like that.

00:13:28.715 --> 00:13:31.895
Then I'm going to modify
its topography properties.

00:13:31.895 --> 00:13:33.395
The weight looks great.

00:13:33.395 --> 00:13:37.160
I'm going to modify
its size to 17 pixels.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.610
It's color is going to
be primary default.

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:44.689
And finally, the declaration
should be set to none.

00:13:44.689 --> 00:13:48.905
And let me modify this
text to learn more.

00:13:48.905 --> 00:13:51.335
Learn more.

00:13:51.335 --> 00:13:54.230
Alright, let me give
it some margins here.

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:55.640
I'm going to give it left,

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.590
bottom and right margins.

00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:59.750
However, since this text link

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:02.465
using the inline
display setting,

00:14:02.465 --> 00:14:04.985
I can't modify the
bottom margin.

00:14:04.985 --> 00:14:06.185
Therefore, I'm going to change

00:14:06.185 --> 00:14:08.660
its display setting to lock.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:11.885
Then I can give it
a 30 pixel left,

00:14:11.885 --> 00:14:14.000
bottom, and right margin.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.370
Just like that.

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:19.220
There we go. Now what
else should we do?

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.859
As we can see, they are
not aligned perfectly.

00:14:21.859 --> 00:14:25.430
So I'm going to select the
project content div black.

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:28.805
And as you can see, the display
setting is set to block.

00:14:28.805 --> 00:14:31.880
I'm going to change
it to Flexbox and I'm

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:35.120
going to change the
direction to vertical. Nice.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.770
And also I'm going to change

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:39.500
the justify to space between.

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.360
Now, it looks much better.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:42.305
Alright, cool.

00:14:42.305 --> 00:14:44.120
But what about other cards?

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:45.710
Well, we're going to select

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:48.815
this project card now and
we are going to copy it,

00:14:48.815 --> 00:14:51.875
hit Command C and
paste it two times,

00:14:51.875 --> 00:14:54.275
hit Command V or Control V.

00:14:54.275 --> 00:14:56.240
But right now, these cards are

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:58.655
stacked on top of each
other vertically.

00:14:58.655 --> 00:15:00.080
This is not what we want.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:03.680
We want them to sit next to
each other horizontally.

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.765
So how can we fix that?

00:15:05.765 --> 00:15:07.250
Well, we can select our

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:09.755
projects wrapper
and we can change

00:15:09.755 --> 00:15:11.540
its display setting from

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:14.585
block to Flexbox,
just like that.

00:15:14.585 --> 00:15:18.725
Then we can change the
justify to space between.

00:15:18.725 --> 00:15:19.580
There we go.

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:21.395
We've got what we have here.

00:15:21.395 --> 00:15:24.215
Now, I'm going to go ahead
and modify the content.

00:15:24.215 --> 00:15:26.540
So I'm going to
select this image and

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:28.970
I'm going to go and
replace the image,

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:30.800
and I'm going to
choose the second one.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.165
For the third one,

00:15:32.165 --> 00:15:34.520
I'm going to repeat
the same process.

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.325
I'm going to change
it to number three.

00:15:37.325 --> 00:15:40.130
And also I'm going to
change the name of

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:43.040
these projects and also
their description.

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:47.300
So let me quickly go ahead
and modify the titles.

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:48.440
There we go.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:52.625
And now I'm going to modify
the description here.

00:15:52.625 --> 00:15:56.825
And for the third project here.

00:15:56.825 --> 00:15:58.730
Alright, we're almost done,

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:00.890
but there is one more
thing we need to do.

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:03.245
If I take a look at
this design file,

00:16:03.245 --> 00:16:04.940
we can see that the
spacing between

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:08.000
these cars is less than
what we have here.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.655
As you can see, the gap
is much bigger here.

00:16:10.655 --> 00:16:11.705
Why is that?

00:16:11.705 --> 00:16:15.635
We already set a maximum
width for that and a height.

00:16:15.635 --> 00:16:19.010
That's the key we set the
maximum width, therefore,

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:21.620
we need to select the
project card, one of them,

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:23.285
it doesn't matter
because we didn't

00:16:23.285 --> 00:16:25.145
add any combo class here.

00:16:25.145 --> 00:16:27.575
I'm gonna select the
first one, for instance,

00:16:27.575 --> 00:16:30.350
let me just go ahead and
select the first one.

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:33.230
And then in sizing,
as you can see,

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:35.510
it says shrink if needed,

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:38.990
I'm going to change it
to grow if possible.

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:40.640
There we go, it's fixed.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:44.810
Now the spacing here is
equal to what we have here.

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:47.630
We have an equal spacing
between them and

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:51.320
the yard growing when
they have enough space.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.215
Alright, our recent
projects section is ready.

00:16:54.215 --> 00:16:56.660
However, I'm going to
show you another way of

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:59.225
creating such a
layout using grids.

00:16:59.225 --> 00:17:02.540
Because if you use grid
instead of a flexbox,

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:05.629
it would be much easier to
make your design responsive.

00:17:05.629 --> 00:17:07.580
The only thing I need to do is

00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:09.740
select these projects wrapper.

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:12.095
And then instead of flexbox,

00:17:12.095 --> 00:17:14.030
I'm going to change it to grid.

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:14.855
Right now.

00:17:14.855 --> 00:17:17.405
I have two rows and two columns.

00:17:17.405 --> 00:17:20.165
I'm going to remove
one of those rows.

00:17:20.165 --> 00:17:22.310
I'm going to add
one more column.

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:26.165
There we go. And here I'm going
to modify the gap between

00:17:26.165 --> 00:17:30.650
our columns to 40 pixels
and hit Done, That's it.

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:32.630
Now instead of using flexbox,

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:36.575
we are using a grid and we've
got the exact same layout.

00:17:36.575 --> 00:17:38.675
However, in terms
of responsiveness,

00:17:38.675 --> 00:17:40.835
it will make our
life much easier.

00:17:40.835 --> 00:17:43.415
All right guys, that's
all for this video.

00:17:43.415 --> 00:17:46.805
Our recent projects
section is ready as well.

00:17:46.805 --> 00:17:48.620
I hope you enjoyed
it and I'll see

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:52.020
you in the next
video. See you then.
