00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.720
In web development, there are

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.270
different size units
that we can use.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.130
In this video,
we're going to talk

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.125
about every single one of them.

00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:14.775
So let's get started.

00:00:14.775 --> 00:00:17.550
First of all, I'm going
to go ahead and drag

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.355
and drop an image
into my Canvas.

00:00:20.355 --> 00:00:22.950
Let me drop it inside
my section here.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.450
For images, you can specify

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.420
the dimensions right here
in the image settings,

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.265
but it's not a good way.

00:00:29.265 --> 00:00:31.245
Why? Let me show you here.

00:00:31.245 --> 00:00:33.330
I'm going to change the width to

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.930
400 pixels and the height
is going to be O2.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.460
Okay, for now, it looks fine.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.820
But if I go to

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.455
the desktop break point

00:00:42.455 --> 00:00:44.615
and if I want to
make some changes,

00:00:44.615 --> 00:00:47.450
specifically for this dimension,

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.330
the changes are applied to
the desktop version as well.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.110
Let me show you.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.600
I'm going to double-click on
it and I'm going to decrease

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.405
the width here to 300 pixels.

00:00:56.405 --> 00:00:59.945
And if I go back to the desktop
breakpoint, There we go,

00:00:59.945 --> 00:01:02.840
our image is resized
and this is not

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.945
good when we want to design
a responsive web pages.

00:01:05.945 --> 00:01:08.330
Therefore, it's
always good to use

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.075
classes in order to
size your images.

00:01:11.075 --> 00:01:12.650
You should avoid sizing

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.200
your images here as
much as you can.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.540
I'm going to set it to
auto. Alright, great.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.145
Now on the right side,

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:20.570
you can see that in

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.840
the side panel we have
the size section.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.040
As I mentioned before,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.710
these are all CSS properties and

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.950
the size is also a CSS property.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.095
We have different
units to work with.

00:01:33.095 --> 00:01:35.105
The simplest one is pixel.

00:01:35.105 --> 00:01:38.990
Any elements dimensions by
default are set to auto, okay?

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.195
As you can see, it says O2.

00:01:41.195 --> 00:01:43.970
O2 determines the dimensions of

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.330
that element in respect to
the parent of that element.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.170
In this case, the parents of
this image is this section.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.200
Here, the width and
height are set to auto.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.440
So I'm going to select this
image and instead of O2,

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.975
I'm gonna give it
a specific value,

00:01:59.975 --> 00:02:03.635
let's say 350 pixels.

00:02:03.635 --> 00:02:04.940
To write the unit,

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.430
you can just simply write Px,

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.230
or you could just click on

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:11.360
this little Px here and

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.550
you will see all the
available units.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.065
I'm going to select Px,

00:02:15.065 --> 00:02:16.670
let me make it larger.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.745
I'm going to set
it to 450 pixels.

00:02:19.745 --> 00:02:22.190
Now this image has
a specific width.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.995
We can set a specific
height for that as well.

00:02:24.995 --> 00:02:29.930
Let's set it to 350
pixels, just like that.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.745
But what about other units?

00:02:31.745 --> 00:02:32.915
We have percentage.

00:02:32.915 --> 00:02:34.280
I'm going to choose that, well,

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.305
percentage is actually relative

00:02:36.305 --> 00:02:38.315
to the parent element as well.

00:02:38.315 --> 00:02:40.970
So for instance, if I want
this image to take up

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.665
30% of the available space
here in this section,

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:47.165
which is the parent element,

00:02:47.165 --> 00:02:50.075
I can select it and
I can set it to

00:02:50.075 --> 00:02:52.340
30% and keep in mind that

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.670
the percentage actually take
some of the available space.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.499
So here for this section,

00:02:57.499 --> 00:03:01.430
right now I have a 40 pixel
left and right padding.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.480
Therefore, it takes up 30%
of the left space here.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.220
Let me select my image.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.960
I can simply set it to

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.990
50 per cent or whatever
amount I want.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.660
The same thing happens
to height if I

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.675
move this image out
of my section here.

00:03:17.675 --> 00:03:20.120
And the parent of this
image now is the body.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.765
So it takes up 50 per cent
of the browser window.

00:03:23.765 --> 00:03:24.935
Let's check it out.

00:03:24.935 --> 00:03:26.930
If I preview that,
as you can see,

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.945
it takes up 50 per cent
of my browser window.

00:03:29.945 --> 00:03:32.345
If I just modify the dimension,

00:03:32.345 --> 00:03:34.790
you can see that
it still takes up

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.579
50 per cent of the dimension.

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.110
It's easy, isn't it?

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.065
Alright, now, let's move
on to the next unit.

00:03:42.065 --> 00:03:44.120
The next unit is m.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.070
We're going to talk
about ems and rems,

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.870
although they are
not that useful.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.340
Let's start with EMS.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.690
Actually, ems and rems are
relative to the font size.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:54.755
Here.

00:03:54.755 --> 00:03:58.640
The font size to 14 pixels and

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.405
one m is equal to 14 pixels.

00:04:02.405 --> 00:04:04.775
So if I want to
set the width to,

00:04:04.775 --> 00:04:07.160
let's say 280 pixels,

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.955
I can just multiply that
amount by this font size.

00:04:10.955 --> 00:04:12.515
So let's say 20.

00:04:12.515 --> 00:04:17.165
So 20 m equals to 180 pixels.

00:04:17.165 --> 00:04:20.285
So let's write 20
ams. There we go.

00:04:20.285 --> 00:04:23.315
If I just write 280 pixels,

00:04:23.315 --> 00:04:25.685
you can see that this
is the same thing.

00:04:25.685 --> 00:04:27.500
Let me prove that to you.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.580
There we go.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.170
Now I think changes because

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:34.190
280 pixels is equal to 20 ems.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.860
Let me write 20 EMS again.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.860
And now if I try to
increase the font size,

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.265
this width changes
as well accordingly.

00:04:43.265 --> 00:04:45.020
So I'm going to hold down

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.480
the option key on my
keyboard or Alt key

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.460
if you're using Windows and just

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.650
click and drag. There we go.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.290
I'm going to set the
font size to 30 and

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.009
1M now is equal to 30 pixels.

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:03.260
Therefore, the width of this
image now is 600 pixels.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.020
You can use ems sometimes e.g.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.210
if you want to design
a card and you want

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.060
all the elements to
respect the font size.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.010
But one of the
best use cases for

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.050
using ems is in buttons.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.305
So I'm gonna go ahead and
drag and drop a button here.

00:05:18.305 --> 00:05:20.495
So this button, by default

00:05:20.495 --> 00:05:23.945
has a 15 pixel left
and right padding.

00:05:23.945 --> 00:05:28.580
Let's see what happens if I
change the font size first,

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.785
let me give this button a class.

00:05:30.785 --> 00:05:33.860
I'm going to write new button.

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.265
Alright, if I try to
increase the font size,

00:05:37.265 --> 00:05:38.720
Let's see what happens.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.274
Can you see that the
padding stays the same?

00:05:42.274 --> 00:05:44.165
We can just fix this problem.

00:05:44.165 --> 00:05:48.815
First, I'm going to set the
size to 16 pixels are right.

00:05:48.815 --> 00:05:51.214
Now here for the padding,

00:05:51.214 --> 00:05:53.900
I'm going to use
EMS for the top,

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.645
bottom, left, and right padding.

00:05:56.645 --> 00:05:58.265
I'm going to select top padding.

00:05:58.265 --> 00:06:02.180
And here I'm going to write
one m for the bottom,

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.770
the same thing, one
M or the left 1M.

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.175
And for the right one
m. Alright, cool.

00:06:10.175 --> 00:06:12.710
Now we have a fully
responsive Martin,

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.315
because these padding are now
relative to our font size,

00:06:17.315 --> 00:06:19.805
so they respect our font size.

00:06:19.805 --> 00:06:23.030
I'm gonna go ahead and
increase the font size.

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.395
And as you can see,

00:06:24.395 --> 00:06:26.285
the padding scale as well.

00:06:26.285 --> 00:06:28.820
This is one of the most
popular use cases,

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.305
but what about rems?

00:06:30.305 --> 00:06:31.805
Let me select this image.

00:06:31.805 --> 00:06:35.615
Well, rims actually
stands for root EMS,

00:06:35.615 --> 00:06:37.730
and it means that
it doesn't respect

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.980
the topography size
that we set here.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.669
It only checks the font
size of the user's browser.

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:45.440
By default, it's set to

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.830
16 pixels unless the
user changes that.

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.950
If I set the width
to 20 RAM here,

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.370
just like that, and I try
to increase the font size.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.320
Nothing happens because RAM

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.480
doesn't respect the
font size here.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.640
Let's give it a
try. There we go.

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:02.825
Nothing happens.

00:07:02.825 --> 00:07:04.310
However, if I go to

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:08.705
my browser settings and I try
to increase the font size,

00:07:08.705 --> 00:07:11.075
this image will be larger.

00:07:11.075 --> 00:07:12.920
These are some advanced units

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.035
that you might not
need to use them,

00:07:15.035 --> 00:07:18.064
but I just want you to
know that they exist.

00:07:18.064 --> 00:07:20.075
Now let's talk about CAH,

00:07:20.075 --> 00:07:21.650
let me go ahead and drag and

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.510
drop a paragraph here that you

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:27.335
could truly understand
what the CH means.

00:07:27.335 --> 00:07:29.570
I'm going to drag
and drop it right

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:32.000
inside my section, right?

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.395
And let me modify the
color here to white.

00:07:36.395 --> 00:07:36.980
Cool.

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:39.155
As you can see, the
text width here

00:07:39.155 --> 00:07:41.720
is so long, therefore,

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:45.155
it's very hard to
read this paragraph,

00:07:45.155 --> 00:07:47.300
and it's a good practice
to limit the number

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.445
of characters in a paragraph.

00:07:49.445 --> 00:07:50.720
So how can we do that?

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.255
We can either set a
specific width for that.

00:07:53.255 --> 00:07:57.185
We can use percentage
or we can use CH.

00:07:57.185 --> 00:07:58.820
I'm going to set it to CH.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.365
So what's a CH?

00:08:00.365 --> 00:08:02.750
Actually ten CH equals to

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:06.095
ten zeros of that
particular font.

00:08:06.095 --> 00:08:07.400
What do I mean by that?

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.070
Let me set this width to,

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:12.305
let's say 50 CH.

00:08:12.305 --> 00:08:13.475
It means the width.

00:08:13.475 --> 00:08:15.590
This paragraph is now set to

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:18.980
50 zeros of this
particular font.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.155
Let me show you how it works.

00:08:21.155 --> 00:08:23.315
I'm going to write
something here.

00:08:23.315 --> 00:08:25.745
Let me make this font size

00:08:25.745 --> 00:08:28.415
larger and we're
gonna set it to 20.

00:08:28.415 --> 00:08:30.785
And let's write hello.

00:08:30.785 --> 00:08:34.130
And then I'm going to
change the width to ten.

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:38.420
Ch. Ch doesn't mean
ten characters.

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:41.975
This is a very common mistake
that most beginners make.

00:08:41.975 --> 00:08:44.045
This is not about characters.

00:08:44.045 --> 00:08:46.070
Let me prove that to you. Here.

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:47.600
I'm going to write hello.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.000
Again, I'm going to write hello.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.945
And once again, let's
write hello only HE here.

00:08:53.945 --> 00:08:55.070
Let's count it.

00:08:55.070 --> 00:09:04.400
1,234,567,891,011.12,

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.140
it's 12 characters.

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:10.010
But if I hit Enter and
I try to write zeros,

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:11.270
we should be able to write

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:19.940
precisely ten zeros,
123,456,789.10.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:22.940
The next zero goes
to the next line.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.730
So this is how the CH works.

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:29.045
If I change the font
here to something else,

00:09:29.045 --> 00:09:32.195
you can see that the
width changes as well.

00:09:32.195 --> 00:09:33.935
Can you see that are right?

00:09:33.935 --> 00:09:36.590
Now, let's move on
to the next unit,

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:39.305
which is we w and we h.

00:09:39.305 --> 00:09:41.015
Well, vw stands for

00:09:41.015 --> 00:09:45.470
viewport width and we H
stands for viewport height.

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:47.015
So what do they mean?

00:09:47.015 --> 00:09:49.970
Well, I'm going to select
this image and I'm going to

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:54.020
set the width to 50 V w.

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:54.995
What does it mean?

00:09:54.995 --> 00:09:58.835
Viewport is actually the
size of our browser window.

00:09:58.835 --> 00:10:01.040
If I use the 13 inch screen,

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.455
my viewport is a 13 inch.

00:10:03.455 --> 00:10:05.435
If I use a larger screen,

00:10:05.435 --> 00:10:07.684
my viewport will be larger.

00:10:07.684 --> 00:10:10.850
So if I set the width to 50 V W,

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:12.710
it means that this
image should take up

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:16.190
50 per cent of the
viewport width.

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:17.630
Let's give it a try.

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:20.600
There we go. As you can see,

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.785
it takes up 50 per cent
of the viewport width.

00:10:24.785 --> 00:10:27.185
We can do the same
thing for height.

00:10:27.185 --> 00:10:29.060
I can set the height to,

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:32.179
let's say 50 V H.

00:10:32.179 --> 00:10:33.575
Let's give it a try.

00:10:33.575 --> 00:10:36.530
As you can see, it
takes up 50 per cent of

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:40.055
my browser windows
height, just like that.

00:10:40.055 --> 00:10:43.265
Now, let's circle out minimum
width and minimum height.

00:10:43.265 --> 00:10:45.605
These are super, super powerful.

00:10:45.605 --> 00:10:47.930
Sometimes we don't
need to explicitly

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:51.755
specify a specific
size for our elements.

00:10:51.755 --> 00:10:53.705
Instead, we can
use minimum width,

00:10:53.705 --> 00:10:56.840
minimum height, and maximum
width, and maximum height.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.925
Let me show you how it works.

00:10:58.925 --> 00:11:01.415
So I'm gonna go to
another example.

00:11:01.415 --> 00:11:03.350
Here I have a card.

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:05.420
And if I select that,
you can see that

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:07.820
the width and height
are set to auto.

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:09.860
However, it doesn't look good.

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:10.580
Why?

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.695
Because it takes
up the whole width

00:11:12.695 --> 00:11:15.485
of the section, its
parent element.

00:11:15.485 --> 00:11:16.835
How can I fix that?

00:11:16.835 --> 00:11:20.645
Well, instead of setting a
specific width for that,

00:11:20.645 --> 00:11:22.985
I'm going to set a minimum width

00:11:22.985 --> 00:11:25.085
and a maximum width for that.

00:11:25.085 --> 00:11:27.935
Let's say we want
this image to have

00:11:27.935 --> 00:11:31.355
a minimum width of 350 pixels.

00:11:31.355 --> 00:11:32.960
Therefore, I'm going to set

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.965
the minimum width to 350 pixels.

00:11:36.965 --> 00:11:40.010
Nothing changes because
this is minimum width.

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:41.090
If we want to limit

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:44.495
the maximum width of
this image or this card,

00:11:44.495 --> 00:11:47.885
Let's say I need to
modify the maximum width.

00:11:47.885 --> 00:11:52.340
So here the maximum width
is going to be 400 T cells.

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:53.225
And there we go.

00:11:53.225 --> 00:11:56.615
Now this card is 400 pixels,

00:11:56.615 --> 00:12:00.170
but it can't be smaller
than 350 pixels.

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:01.640
So let's give it a try.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.005
So if I preview that,

00:12:03.005 --> 00:12:05.975
you can see that it
can be smaller than

00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:12.035
350 pixels because we set
a minimum width for that.

00:12:12.035 --> 00:12:14.780
If I make it smaller, e.g.

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:16.580
the minimum width
is going to be,

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:19.235
let's say, 250 pixels.

00:12:19.235 --> 00:12:21.440
Now, it can be smaller.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.190
Okay?

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:25.895
Just like that, this
is minimum width.

00:12:25.895 --> 00:12:28.145
We can use minimum
height as well.

00:12:28.145 --> 00:12:30.230
It functions exactly the same.

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:33.230
We can use that for
our hero section, e.g.

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:37.235
for our sections, we can
set the minimum height to,

00:12:37.235 --> 00:12:40.430
let's say, 100 vh.

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:44.090
And it means that it
takes up at least 100% of

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:45.680
the viewport height and it

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.900
doesn't mess up
with our content.

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:50.495
As I mentioned, these
units are advanced

00:12:50.495 --> 00:12:53.569
and if you don't know how
they work completely,

00:12:53.569 --> 00:12:56.300
That's totally fine because
it takes time and practice

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:59.180
to completely get
used to these units.

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:02.570
Now let's move on to the next
topic which is overflow.

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:06.155
So here in our card
I have a paragraph.

00:13:06.155 --> 00:13:07.640
Alright, I'm going to reset

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.100
this minimum width
and minimum height.

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.125
And here I'm going to
set a specific width,

00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:15.125
like 340 pixels.

00:13:15.125 --> 00:13:17.300
And the height instead of auto,

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:18.665
I'm going to set it to,

00:13:18.665 --> 00:13:20.690
let's say 400 pixels.

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:24.365
Okay, now, if I try to
add more sentences here,

00:13:24.365 --> 00:13:26.134
Let's see what happens.

00:13:26.134 --> 00:13:28.955
There we go. Now we
have the overflow.

00:13:28.955 --> 00:13:32.195
It happens sometimes,
and we can fix that.

00:13:32.195 --> 00:13:34.160
To fix that, we need to select

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.635
the parents of these elements.

00:13:36.635 --> 00:13:39.545
The parents of this
next plug is this card.

00:13:39.545 --> 00:13:41.150
Make sure to select the parent.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:43.160
And if you head over
to the overflow here,

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.095
we can set the
overflow to hidden.

00:13:45.095 --> 00:13:48.155
It kind of mask the
overflowing content.

00:13:48.155 --> 00:13:49.235
If I preview that,

00:13:49.235 --> 00:13:52.250
you can see that there is
no overflow happening.

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:54.125
We have other options as well.

00:13:54.125 --> 00:13:55.580
We have scroll.

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:57.065
If I select that,

00:13:57.065 --> 00:13:59.510
you can see that the user can

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:02.765
scroll through the
content just like that,

00:14:02.765 --> 00:14:05.390
we have one more option
and that is auto.

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:08.660
Auto means that the browser
first checks if there is

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:12.455
so much content here that
doesn't fit into this card,

00:14:12.455 --> 00:14:14.570
it will show the scroll.

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:20.014
But if I try to remove some
sentences here like this,

00:14:20.014 --> 00:14:22.880
it will not show this
cruel are right.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.520
Now we need to talk
about the last property

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.565
of the size section,
which is fit.

00:14:28.565 --> 00:14:32.045
Let me drag and drop a
diblock here. There we go.

00:14:32.045 --> 00:14:33.890
I'm going to give it a class.

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:35.915
Let's call it demo.

00:14:35.915 --> 00:14:37.505
And for this demo,

00:14:37.505 --> 00:14:40.760
I'm gonna go ahead and drag
and drop an image here.

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.290
So let's suppose that we want

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:45.110
this image to cover
this diblock.

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:47.555
So first, I'm going
to select this image.

00:14:47.555 --> 00:14:51.170
I'm going to set the
width and height to 100%.

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:56.285
It means that it takes
100% of its parent width,

00:14:56.285 --> 00:14:58.550
which is this
demoed if block and

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:02.090
100% of its parents height,

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:04.910
which is exactly
this demo diblock.

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:07.175
Then while this
image is selected,

00:15:07.175 --> 00:15:10.775
I'm going to change the
fit from field to cover.

00:15:10.775 --> 00:15:12.260
Now let's see what happens.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.660
If I select this demo diblock.

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.460
I can give it a
specific width and

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:18.875
height like 400 pixels.

00:15:18.875 --> 00:15:20.240
And you can see that the image

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.565
covers this def block perfectly.

00:15:22.565 --> 00:15:24.260
If I modify the height,

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.615
let's say to 500 pixels.

00:15:26.615 --> 00:15:27.275
There we go.

00:15:27.275 --> 00:15:30.080
It covers the image
and it doesn't change

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.955
the aspect ratio of the image

00:15:31.955 --> 00:15:34.655
since we set the fit to cover.

00:15:34.655 --> 00:15:36.980
If I change it to, let's say,

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:39.740
feel it will change
the aspect ratio.

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:41.975
But since it's set to cover,

00:15:41.975 --> 00:15:45.365
it doesn't change the
aspect ratio our image.

00:15:45.365 --> 00:15:46.520
But what if you are not

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:49.250
satisfied with the
positioning of this image?

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:52.745
Well, there is an advanced
option right next to this fit.

00:15:52.745 --> 00:15:54.185
If you select your image,

00:15:54.185 --> 00:15:58.010
you can click on this three
dots icon and then you can

00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:02.330
position your image however
you want, are right guys.

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:04.235
That's all for this video.

00:16:04.235 --> 00:16:05.450
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:07.340
If you didn't understand some of

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:10.085
those advanced units,
that's totally fine.

00:16:10.085 --> 00:16:12.500
You can always reach out
to me and then you will

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:15.050
try to simplify
everything for you.

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:17.270
But believe me, if you start

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:20.060
practicing them in
real-world projects,

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.680
for sure, you will get used to

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.780
them as quickly as possible.

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:25.650
See you then.
