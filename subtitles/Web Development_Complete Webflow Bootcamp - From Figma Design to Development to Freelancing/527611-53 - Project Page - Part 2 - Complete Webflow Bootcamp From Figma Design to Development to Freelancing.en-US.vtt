WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.075
Our right.

00:00:06.075 --> 00:00:07.350
In this video, we're going to

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.615
continue working on
our project page.

00:00:09.615 --> 00:00:11.130
Now it's time to go ahead and

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.140
create this project section.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.480
So let's analyze
this section and see

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.835
how we can structure
it on Webflow.

00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:20.505
So here we need to
create a section

00:00:20.505 --> 00:00:23.760
and inside we need to
create a container.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.345
And inside that container
we need to have a heading,

00:00:27.345 --> 00:00:29.955
this project type,
this completion date,

00:00:29.955 --> 00:00:31.375
and the projects image,

00:00:31.375 --> 00:00:33.095
and finally the details.

00:00:33.095 --> 00:00:34.460
And as you can see here,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.970
this project's image
has some drop shadows,

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.830
but it's not a
simple drop shadow.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.420
If I zoom in, you can see that

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.625
this drop shadow has
different colors.

00:00:43.625 --> 00:00:46.010
I didn't use a simple
dark drop shadow

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.600
because in real world we don't

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.845
get dark shadows for
colorful images and objects.

00:00:51.845 --> 00:00:54.140
Therefore, it would
be more realistic to

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.375
have the colors of our object,

00:00:56.375 --> 00:00:57.500
or in this case,

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.380
our image for our
drop shadow as well.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.910
So how did I do that?

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.560
Well, it was so simple.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.290
I just duplicated
this image and I put

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.440
that duplicated layer
behind our main image,

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.950
and then I added this
layer blur effect to it.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.875
Okay, let me show
you how it looks.

00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:19.115
If I just decrease
this player to zero.

00:01:19.115 --> 00:01:22.475
You can see that this is
exactly the same image here,

00:01:22.475 --> 00:01:24.425
but if I increase
the blur amount,

00:01:24.425 --> 00:01:25.955
it will be blurry.

00:01:25.955 --> 00:01:27.905
And if we'd look
like a drop shadow.

00:01:27.905 --> 00:01:30.244
And finally, I
decrease the opacity

00:01:30.244 --> 00:01:33.095
of this duplicated
layer to 50 per cent.

00:01:33.095 --> 00:01:34.880
So we're going to use
the same technique

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.200
in Webflow as well.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.690
For these paragraphs,
we're going to use

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.675
a rich text because
we want our client,

00:01:41.675 --> 00:01:44.450
we want the design
agency to be able to add

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.315
some rich media like images,

00:01:47.315 --> 00:01:51.380
videos, and easily modify
the details of each project.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.820
Okay, so here we have

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.685
this heading and in order
to create this section,

00:01:55.685 --> 00:01:58.415
the project type and
this completion date,

00:01:58.415 --> 00:02:00.320
we are going to
create a div black,

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.390
and we're going to put them
inside that div block.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.980
And finally we will turn that

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.705
they've blank to a flex max.

00:02:05.705 --> 00:02:08.585
Why? Because we want
them to touch the edges

00:02:08.585 --> 00:02:11.540
of this boundary are
right, it looks easy.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.460
So let's go ahead and create it.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.685
First of all, I'm going to
go ahead and select my body.

00:02:16.685 --> 00:02:18.200
I'm going to hit Command K or

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.940
control K. And let's look for

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.130
a section or write
this section has been

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.455
added here right
below my filter.

00:02:24.455 --> 00:02:27.650
So in the navigator I'm
going to drag it and

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.460
drop it right above the
CTA section right here.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.015
And this section is going
to have a class as usual.

00:02:35.015 --> 00:02:37.220
I'm going to give
it a section class.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.195
There we go.

00:02:38.195 --> 00:02:40.760
And also I am going to
give it a combo class.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.250
So let's ride project.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.900
Okay, cool.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.629
Now this section
requires a container.

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:48.905
So while it's selected,

00:02:48.905 --> 00:02:50.690
I'm gonna hit Command
key or Control

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.270
K. And let's look
for a div block,

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.550
and I'm going to give
it the container class.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.300
There we go. Our container
is ready as well.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.715
So what do we need
inside this container?

00:03:01.715 --> 00:03:03.740
Yes, you're right,
we need a heading.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.140
So why this container
is selected?

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.565
Let's hit Command key or
Control K and look for heading.

00:03:10.565 --> 00:03:13.910
It's gonna be H1, and I'm
going to give it a class.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.880
Let's write Project page title,

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.909
page underscore,
underscore title.

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:20.945
There we go.

00:03:20.945 --> 00:03:22.625
And I'm not going to
change this title

00:03:22.625 --> 00:03:24.830
because later on we will connect

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.030
all these elements to

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.190
our collections fields because

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.140
we're going to work
with dynamic content.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.215
So what else do we need here
right below this heading,

00:03:33.215 --> 00:03:35.210
we need to create
this project type

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:36.905
and also this completion date.

00:03:36.905 --> 00:03:39.860
But let's analyze this
section. The completion date.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.395
Since the completion
date should be dynamic.

00:03:42.395 --> 00:03:45.515
Here I'm going to create
two different texts blocks.

00:03:45.515 --> 00:03:47.945
One for this
completed on section,

00:03:47.945 --> 00:03:50.360
and the other one
for the date itself.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.525
Later when we connect our
elements to our fields,

00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:55.610
we will just connect
the right takes

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.785
blood to the
completion date field.

00:03:57.785 --> 00:04:00.800
So let me go ahead and
create a div block.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.990
I'm going to select
this container and

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.435
I'm going to hit
Command K or control K.

00:04:05.435 --> 00:04:07.175
Let's look for a div blog.

00:04:07.175 --> 00:04:09.575
There we go, and I'm
going to give it a class,

00:04:09.575 --> 00:04:12.710
let's ride project type
wrapper, just like that.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.800
And inside I'm going to
place a text block here.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.300
So while it's selected,

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.955
I'm going to look
for it takes block.

00:04:19.955 --> 00:04:21.095
There we go.

00:04:21.095 --> 00:04:23.915
And this takes block is going
to have a class as well.

00:04:23.915 --> 00:04:29.735
So let's write Project page
underscore, underscore type.

00:04:29.735 --> 00:04:32.945
And I'm going to modify
its topography properties.

00:04:32.945 --> 00:04:34.550
I'm going to go to
my design file.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.515
I'm going to select
this project type.

00:04:36.515 --> 00:04:38.090
And as you can see, I'm using

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.535
muddy medium and body medium.

00:04:40.535 --> 00:04:42.995
Its font size is 24 points,

00:04:42.995 --> 00:04:44.645
and it's also medium.

00:04:44.645 --> 00:04:48.620
Therefore here I'm going to
change the size to 24 pixels.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.220
And also its weight is
going to be 500 or medium,

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.430
and its color is going
to be neutral medium.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.110
Just like that. I'm not going to

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.165
modify its text are right, cool.

00:04:59.165 --> 00:05:01.985
But what about the completion
date section right here?

00:05:01.985 --> 00:05:03.035
So as I mentioned,

00:05:03.035 --> 00:05:04.730
I'm going to create a div block.

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.355
So I'm going to select
this project type wrapper,

00:05:07.355 --> 00:05:09.230
and then I'm going to
add a div black here

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.605
inside this div block is
going to have a class,

00:05:12.605 --> 00:05:16.535
let's ride project underscore,
underscore completion.

00:05:16.535 --> 00:05:17.510
There we go.

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:18.785
And inside this div,

00:05:18.785 --> 00:05:21.545
we're going to place
two text blocks.

00:05:21.545 --> 00:05:23.030
So while it's selected,

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.765
hit Command key or Control
K and look for textblock.

00:05:26.765 --> 00:05:28.490
This is our first text block.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.430
I'm going to just copy it
Command C or Control C

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.460
and paste it to get
my second text block.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.090
Now each of these texts
blogs should have a class.

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:39.710
I'm going to select
the first one

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.090
and I'm gonna give it a class.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.000
So let's write
project underscore.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.910
Underscore, completed
just like that.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.025
And the second one
is going to be

00:05:49.025 --> 00:05:52.205
project underscore
underscore date.

00:05:52.205 --> 00:05:56.285
Now, let's go ahead and
modify its CSS properties.

00:05:56.285 --> 00:05:57.560
So I'm going to select the first

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.270
one this project completed,

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.910
and let me go ahead and
modify its font size to

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.735
20 pixels and also its
color to neutral dark.

00:06:05.735 --> 00:06:07.205
And what about the second one?

00:06:07.205 --> 00:06:09.410
The second one, which
is this project date,

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.795
is gonna be 20 pixels as well,

00:06:11.795 --> 00:06:15.320
but its color is going to be
neutral medium are right,

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.105
nice, but it doesn't look good.

00:06:17.105 --> 00:06:17.510
Why?

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:18.530
Because we didn't turn

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.965
this project completion
diblock to a flexbox.

00:06:21.965 --> 00:06:24.350
So I'm going to select
this project completion,

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.060
the black in my navigator.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.950
And then I'm going to
change the display

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.915
setting to flake spikes.

00:06:29.915 --> 00:06:31.190
Now the direction is

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.145
horizontal and they are
sitting next to each other.

00:06:34.145 --> 00:06:35.720
It's exactly what I want.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.270
Now I'm going to select the
first text and I'm going to

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.825
change its takes
to completed on.

00:06:41.825 --> 00:06:44.105
And to see how it will look,

00:06:44.105 --> 00:06:46.265
I'm going to change
this text as well,

00:06:46.265 --> 00:06:49.400
although this one is going
to have dynamic content,

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.395
but just to see
how it will look,

00:06:51.395 --> 00:06:54.605
I'm going to write June 22,

00:06:54.605 --> 00:06:57.635
comma 2021. Okay, Nice.

00:06:57.635 --> 00:07:00.140
So here we need some
margins between them.

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.929
So I'm going to select this
completed on textblock,

00:07:02.929 --> 00:07:06.095
and I'm going to give it a
five pixel right margin,

00:07:06.095 --> 00:07:07.430
just like that.

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:08.660
Now it looks much better.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:10.984
But as you can see,
these two elements,

00:07:10.984 --> 00:07:13.310
this project page type and also

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.965
this div blocks are sitting
on top of each other.

00:07:15.965 --> 00:07:17.360
That's not what we want.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.920
So I'm going to select

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.380
this project type
wrapper and I'm going to

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.870
turn it into a flexbox,

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.750
are right, the direction
is going to be horizontal.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:28.160
However, I'm going to change

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.205
the justification to
space between why?

00:07:31.205 --> 00:07:34.820
Because we want them to touch
the edges of this boundary.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:38.030
I'm going to set it to
space between Nice,

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.235
our layout is almost ready.

00:07:40.235 --> 00:07:42.860
Alright, let me head
over to my design file.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.680
If I select this
project type and if

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.515
I hold down the Alt key or
Option key on my keyboard,

00:07:48.515 --> 00:07:51.410
I can see that it has
a 20 pixel top margin.

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:54.260
So while this div
black is selected,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.255
this project type wrapper,

00:07:56.255 --> 00:07:59.735
I'm going to give it a
20 pixel top margin.

00:07:59.735 --> 00:08:01.295
It looks much better now.

00:08:01.295 --> 00:08:03.620
Alright, now let's move
on to the next part,

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.375
which is this image.

00:08:05.375 --> 00:08:06.290
Here.

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:08.855
While this container
is selected,

00:08:08.855 --> 00:08:11.869
the navigator, I'm going
to select this container.

00:08:11.869 --> 00:08:15.410
I'm gonna hit Command key or
Control K. And let's create

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:17.570
a new div block
because we're going

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:19.880
to create a wrapper
for our image.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.460
So here I'm going to
write the if block,

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.785
and this block is
going to have a class.

00:08:24.785 --> 00:08:27.320
So let me write
project underscore,

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:30.935
underscore, image, underscore,
underscore wrapper.

00:08:30.935 --> 00:08:32.795
And in science,
we're going to place

00:08:32.795 --> 00:08:35.254
one image while it's selected,

00:08:35.254 --> 00:08:37.580
I'm gonna hit Command
key or Control K.

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:39.845
And let's look for
the image elements.

00:08:39.845 --> 00:08:41.240
Here. There we go.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.370
And I'm going to give
this image a class.

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:45.560
So let's create a class here.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:49.160
I'm gonna write Project
page underscore,

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.975
underscore image.

00:08:50.975 --> 00:08:52.760
In this image should take up

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.650
the whole width of its parent,

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:56.270
which is this new div block

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.280
that we created,
this image wrapper.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.765
So what should I do?

00:08:59.765 --> 00:09:00.830
Yes, you are right.

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:05.120
I'm gonna go ahead and
change the width to 100%.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:05.825
There we go.

00:09:05.825 --> 00:09:09.170
Now it takes up the whole
width of its parent,

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:11.855
but its height has been
increased as well.

00:09:11.855 --> 00:09:13.535
So how can I fix that?

00:09:13.535 --> 00:09:15.260
Let me go to my design file.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:16.850
And if I select this image here,

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:18.050
if I double-click on it,

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:22.970
you can see that it has a
specific height, 444 pixels.

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:24.830
Therefore, I'm going
to set the height

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:27.530
here to 444 pixels.

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:28.835
However, as you can see,

00:09:28.835 --> 00:09:31.565
our image doesn't take
up the whole width now,

00:09:31.565 --> 00:09:33.530
doesn't cover this area.

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:35.630
Therefore, I'm gonna
go ahead and change

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:38.225
the fit from field to cover.

00:09:38.225 --> 00:09:40.520
Now, I'm going to
double-click on it and

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.830
let's choose an image
from the assets for now,

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:44.465
I'm going to choose
the first one.

00:09:44.465 --> 00:09:46.220
It covers the whole wrapper.

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.390
Our image is ready,

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:49.085
but what about the drop shadow?

00:09:49.085 --> 00:09:50.375
As I mentioned before,

00:09:50.375 --> 00:09:52.730
I'm going to duplicate this
image and I'm going to

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:55.265
put it behind this main image.

00:09:55.265 --> 00:09:57.410
And then I'm going to
add some filters to it.

00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:00.125
I'm going to right-click
on this blue part here,

00:10:00.125 --> 00:10:03.170
and then I'm going to
choose Duplicate, right?

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:04.370
As you can see now we have

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:07.655
two identical images
with the same class.

00:10:07.655 --> 00:10:09.785
It's very important to modify

00:10:09.785 --> 00:10:12.110
the class of this
duplicated layer.

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:15.320
Why? Because we want to
modify its CSS properties.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.155
So I'm going to select
this duplicated layer,

00:10:18.155 --> 00:10:20.210
and I'm going to go
ahead and click on

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:23.075
this little arrow and let
me duplicate this class

00:10:23.075 --> 00:10:25.010
and I'm going to
rename it to project

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:28.400
page image underscore,
underscore effect.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.045
There we go.

00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:31.745
Now it has a new
class and we can

00:10:31.745 --> 00:10:34.760
easily go ahead and modify
its CSS properties.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:38.600
So how can we put this image
behind our main image?

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.070
We can go ahead and modify

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:43.010
its position here
while it's selected.

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:46.865
I'm going to change its position
from static to absolute.

00:10:46.865 --> 00:10:49.145
And as you can see,
it's kinda messed up.

00:10:49.145 --> 00:10:50.285
It's not what we want.

00:10:50.285 --> 00:10:51.440
Why does it happen?

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.350
That's because its new
position is relative to body.

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:55.460
If you remember, when we've

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:57.185
worked with position absolute,

00:10:57.185 --> 00:10:59.390
I mentioned that it's
always looks for

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:02.375
a parent element that has
the position relative.

00:11:02.375 --> 00:11:03.740
So if I go ahead and change

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.990
the position of
this project image,

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:08.569
wrap her to relative
from static,

00:11:08.569 --> 00:11:10.625
and then I select this image,

00:11:10.625 --> 00:11:12.320
this duplicated image, I can

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.810
simply set it's
position to top-left.

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:17.705
And now this image is on
top of our main image.

00:11:17.705 --> 00:11:20.240
How can we put it
behind our main image?

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.640
Well, we can use the Z index.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.285
Here.

00:11:23.285 --> 00:11:25.940
I'm going to set the
Z index to minus one.

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:27.920
And this way I can
make sure that

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.900
this duplicated layer with

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:33.260
this project page image
effect class is behind

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:37.235
my main image because I
gave it a negative Z index.

00:11:37.235 --> 00:11:40.325
Now we need to go ahead and
add some effects to it.

00:11:40.325 --> 00:11:42.455
So if I head over to
the Effects section,

00:11:42.455 --> 00:11:44.000
I can go to filters.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.785
And if I hit this plus button,

00:11:45.785 --> 00:11:47.990
I can add the blur filter to it.

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:52.504
And let's set the radius
to around 40 pixels.

00:11:52.504 --> 00:11:53.435
Just like that.

00:11:53.435 --> 00:11:55.760
As you can see, we've
got our drop shadow,

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.290
and also I'm going to increase

00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:59.540
the intensity of my colors.

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:02.420
So I'm going to add
a new filter here.

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:06.380
So let's go ahead and add
the saturation filter.

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:09.365
And I'm going to set its
amount to 200 per cent.

00:12:09.365 --> 00:12:11.300
Now as you can see,
the intensity of

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:13.415
my colors has been increased.

00:12:13.415 --> 00:12:15.500
However, this drop shadow is too

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.215
bright and it doesn't
look realistic.

00:12:18.215 --> 00:12:20.180
So I'm gonna go
ahead and decrease

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:23.510
its opacity to 40%. There we go.

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:25.025
Now it looks much better,

00:12:25.025 --> 00:12:26.645
but I'm gonna do one more thing.

00:12:26.645 --> 00:12:28.460
If I select this drop shadow,

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:31.085
I can simply move it
a little bit down.

00:12:31.085 --> 00:12:34.580
So I'm going to add the 2D
and 3D transforms here.

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:36.380
And I'm going to
move it a little bit

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:38.330
down using the y-axis.

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.075
So let me move it
down by 14 pixels,

00:12:41.075 --> 00:12:43.415
just like that, it
looks much better now.

00:12:43.415 --> 00:12:47.045
All right, Our project image
wrapper is ready as well.

00:12:47.045 --> 00:12:49.100
Now, it's time to
go ahead and add

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:52.175
our rich texts here
right below this image.

00:12:52.175 --> 00:12:54.140
So I'm going to
select the container

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.250
and then I'm going to give it

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:57.035
a combo class and
we're going to write

00:12:57.035 --> 00:12:59.060
project just like that.

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:02.480
And finally, I'm going to
modify its display setting

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.490
because I want all
of these elements

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:06.635
to stack on top of
each other vertically.

00:13:06.635 --> 00:13:09.695
And later when we want to
make our design responsive,

00:13:09.695 --> 00:13:11.255
it would be so beneficial.

00:13:11.255 --> 00:13:13.460
So I'm going to change
its display setting to

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.110
Flexbox and I am going to

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:17.090
change the direction
to vertical.

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:19.370
Now wireless container
is selected.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:21.785
I'm going to hit Command
key or Control K.

00:13:21.785 --> 00:13:25.265
And let me add a rich
text here. There we go.

00:13:25.265 --> 00:13:27.410
Our reach takes has
been added here,

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:29.194
and I'm gonna give it a class.

00:13:29.194 --> 00:13:34.339
Let's write project
underscore, underscore detail.

00:13:34.339 --> 00:13:37.445
Okay, So let me head
over to my design file.

00:13:37.445 --> 00:13:38.825
I'm going to select this

00:13:38.825 --> 00:13:41.600
paragraph and I'm going to
check out its top margin.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.495
As you can see, I need
a 70 pixel top margin.

00:13:44.495 --> 00:13:46.685
So while it's selected here,

00:13:46.685 --> 00:13:49.925
I'm going to give it a
70 pixel top margin.

00:13:49.925 --> 00:13:52.745
We're not going to modify
the content here for now.

00:13:52.745 --> 00:13:54.230
Alright, now let's go ahead and

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:56.360
modify the spacing
between these elements.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.235
If I go to my design fine.

00:13:58.235 --> 00:14:00.665
And if I select
this project type,

00:14:00.665 --> 00:14:03.740
you can see that it's bottom
margin is set to 80 pixels.

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:06.905
So I can head over
to my project here,

00:14:06.905 --> 00:14:09.755
I can select this
project type wrapper

00:14:09.755 --> 00:14:12.785
and I'm going to give it
an 80 pixel bottom margin.

00:14:12.785 --> 00:14:14.450
Everything is ready and we

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:16.265
can move on to the next section.

00:14:16.265 --> 00:14:18.725
So let me head over
to my design file,

00:14:18.725 --> 00:14:20.630
right under that, we need to

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:23.045
have these other
projects section.

00:14:23.045 --> 00:14:27.335
It looks exactly the same as
this recent project section.

00:14:27.335 --> 00:14:30.665
I think it would be wise to
just copy and pasted here.

00:14:30.665 --> 00:14:32.435
So let me go to Workflow.

00:14:32.435 --> 00:14:35.420
I'm going to go to my homepage.

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.640
And from here I'm
going to select

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:40.295
this section, recent
project section.

00:14:40.295 --> 00:14:41.345
I'm going to copy it,

00:14:41.345 --> 00:14:43.565
hit Command C or Control C.

00:14:43.565 --> 00:14:45.590
Then I'm gonna go
to pages and I'm

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:47.705
going to go to projects
template page.

00:14:47.705 --> 00:14:49.310
And let me select the body and

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:51.470
hit Command V or Control V.

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:53.360
Just like that, this section has

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.445
been added right
below my footer.

00:14:55.445 --> 00:14:57.919
So I'm just going to
reposition it inside

00:14:57.919 --> 00:14:59.960
my navigator and
I'm gonna put it

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.375
below my project section.

00:15:02.375 --> 00:15:03.800
Alright, first things first,

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.480
I'm gonna go ahead and duplicate

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.850
these projects combo class,

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:09.410
and I am going to change it to

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:14.555
other projects to keep
everything organized.

00:15:14.555 --> 00:15:17.360
Then I'm going to change
this name here from

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.450
recent projects to
other projects.

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:23.150
And finally, I'm going
to modify its top margin

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:26.300
because right now it's
too much, it's 200.

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.765
If I head over to my design
file, if I select it,

00:15:29.765 --> 00:15:33.560
you can see that it's top
margin is set to 70 pixels.

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:36.350
So I'm going to
set it to 70 here.

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:37.580
If I select this section,

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.655
you can see we have too much
margin here at the top.

00:15:40.655 --> 00:15:43.460
So I'm going to select
this section and I'm

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.430
going to override
its default margin.

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:47.495
If I click on it,

00:15:47.495 --> 00:15:49.310
you can see that it says value

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:51.380
comes from section. It's fine.

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:54.890
But since we added this
new combo class project,

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:56.480
we can simply overwrite it

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:59.135
without affecting
either sections.

00:15:59.135 --> 00:16:02.180
So I'm going to set
it to 70 pixels.

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:06.365
Are right guys, the layout of
our project page is ready,

00:16:06.365 --> 00:16:08.015
and now it's time to connect

00:16:08.015 --> 00:16:10.445
all our elements to
our collections,

00:16:10.445 --> 00:16:12.740
items and collections fields,

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:15.080
but we are gonna do that
in our next lesson.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.700
I hope you enjoyed this video

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:19.440
and I'll see you
in the next one.
