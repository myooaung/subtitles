00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.250
What's the container?

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.490
In this video, we're going
to talk about containers.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.100
If I go to the Add
section, as usual,

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.400
I can head over to
the layout section.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.440
And from here right
next to the section,

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.850
I can find container.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.695
As I mentioned in
the previous video,

00:00:20.695 --> 00:00:22.540
when we design a website,

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.470
we try to structure our
website in a particular way.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.470
Actually, we try to keep
everything organized.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.355
That's why we have all these
different elements here.

00:00:33.355 --> 00:00:36.535
Basically sections and
containers are just div,

00:00:36.535 --> 00:00:39.505
blocks with some
predefined styles.

00:00:39.505 --> 00:00:40.720
E.g. a.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.755
Container has a specific width.

00:00:43.755 --> 00:00:45.590
If I try to drag and drop

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.215
a container into my
Canvas. There we go.

00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:49.340
As you can see, it's

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.495
just a simple div that
has a maximum width.

00:00:53.495 --> 00:00:58.940
It has a specific width
of 940 pixels by default.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.970
So if I want to keep
everything organized,

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.400
I can take this def block.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.765
Okay, I'm going to set the
width to oto just like that.

00:01:08.765 --> 00:01:10.595
And as you can see,
this div block,

00:01:10.595 --> 00:01:13.940
since the width and
height are set to auto,

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.175
takes the whole
width of the page.

00:01:16.175 --> 00:01:18.005
And if I want to keep everything

00:01:18.005 --> 00:01:20.555
neatly organized in the center,

00:01:20.555 --> 00:01:23.180
I can select this
div like and drag

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.104
it and drop it
into my container.

00:01:26.104 --> 00:01:29.090
There we go. Now everything
is placed inside

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.465
this container that
has a default width.

00:01:32.465 --> 00:01:34.220
Of course, you can
go ahead and modify

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.590
its width if you want, e.g.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.660
for larger screens, you

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.060
can head over to
the size property,

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.580
to the size section here and set

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.270
the maximum width to 1,100.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.950
Just like that, it's totally

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.780
up to you how you
want to use them.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.570
You can decide not to
use a container and just

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.050
use a div block and set a
specific width for that.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.265
That's totally fine.

00:01:58.265 --> 00:02:00.350
You just need to
know that these are

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.450
just pre-built elements in

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.595
order to make our
lives much easier.

00:02:04.595 --> 00:02:06.230
So I hope now you know,

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.925
the real difference between

00:02:07.925 --> 00:02:11.300
a section container
and a diblock.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.475
They are basically all the same.

00:02:13.475 --> 00:02:15.455
They are variations of

00:02:15.455 --> 00:02:18.290
a div block with
predefined styles,

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.285
as I mentioned in
the previous video,

00:02:20.285 --> 00:02:22.805
whenever we want to
design a website,

00:02:22.805 --> 00:02:24.770
whenever we want to
build a website,

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.245
we first use a section,

00:02:27.245 --> 00:02:29.300
then we use a container

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.565
and inside we will
put our elements.

00:02:31.565 --> 00:02:33.305
So this is the best way to

00:02:33.305 --> 00:02:36.140
organize and
structure a website.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.390
And if we need to
create more sections,

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.900
we can simply drag and
drop more sections here.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.270
Or we can just simply copy and

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.730
paste our sections like that.
