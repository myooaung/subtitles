00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.850
Sometimes we might need to
have some tapped content,

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.324
some interactive tabbed content.

00:00:11.324 --> 00:00:13.065
In that case, we can use

00:00:13.065 --> 00:00:16.290
the tabs element under
the component section,

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.685
we have the tabs elements.

00:00:17.685 --> 00:00:20.220
One of the most
common use cases of

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.105
tabs is the pricing section
of different websites.

00:00:24.105 --> 00:00:25.770
Here, as you can see,

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.470
I prepared two
different deep blacks

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.975
and inside there
are some other div,

00:00:30.975 --> 00:00:32.520
blocks with some elements.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.410
And what we're gonna do is put

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.134
these pricing bike
says in two tabs,

00:00:38.134 --> 00:00:40.850
okay, the top row is
our monthly plan and

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.685
the bottom row is
our yearly plan.

00:00:43.685 --> 00:00:46.430
So we're going to need
two different tabs.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.830
But first, let's go
ahead and drag and

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.340
drop the tabs element
into my container.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.540
Just like that.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.730
And by default, as you can see,

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.480
the tabs element as a
three different tabs.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.305
Basically the tabs element
has different components.

00:01:03.305 --> 00:01:06.695
The tabs menu, which are
these tabs at the top,

00:01:06.695 --> 00:01:10.310
and the taps content
inside the taps content,

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.884
as you can see, it's a mask.

00:01:11.884 --> 00:01:14.780
This icon indicates
that it's a mask.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.805
Inside these taps contents,

00:01:16.805 --> 00:01:18.500
we have three different pain,

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.180
so we have tab-pane,

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.795
tab1, tab2, and tap three.

00:01:23.795 --> 00:01:25.940
So the contents of
our tab should be

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.235
placed inside the tab pane.

00:01:28.235 --> 00:01:31.115
And whenever we want to
modify the tabs name,

00:01:31.115 --> 00:01:33.500
we need to work
with tabs, menus.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.650
Okay, So here, if I just
double-click on this text,

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:37.850
I can modify that.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.820
So let's write monthly.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.930
And for the next one I'm
going to write a yearly.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.080
This third one is not necessary,

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.150
so I can hit Delete or

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.615
Backspace on my keyboard
to remove these tap link.

00:01:53.615 --> 00:01:54.620
Just like that.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.750
Now I have two different tabs,

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.145
but what about the content?

00:01:58.145 --> 00:02:01.325
Well, first, I'm going to
select this div block,

00:02:01.325 --> 00:02:04.010
this top pricing box.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.920
I'm going to drag it and drop it

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.830
inside the first tab pane,

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.679
make sure that it's
nested correctly.

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:15.800
Okay, take a look at your
navigator and make sure

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.370
that this is nested
inside the tab pane,

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.975
one, just like that.

00:02:20.975 --> 00:02:23.540
Now, this pricing box, okay,

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.280
these boxes are part
of tab-pane one. Okay.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.155
We're gonna do the
same thing for

00:02:30.155 --> 00:02:32.585
these bottom or yearly plan.

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:34.940
I'm going to drag
it and drop it.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.920
And I'm going to make
sure that it's nested

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.520
inside tab pane to
just like that.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.775
But now it's invisible.
From now on.

00:02:43.775 --> 00:02:46.295
If I want to check
out my taps contents,

00:02:46.295 --> 00:02:49.640
I need to click on
these tab panes, e.g.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.010
I'm going to click
on tab-pane one.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.275
This is our monthly plan.

00:02:54.275 --> 00:02:58.205
And if I click on tab pane
to this is our yearly plan.

00:02:58.205 --> 00:03:01.190
By default, there
is no top margin,

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.649
so I'm going to
select tabs Content,

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:07.655
which is basically a
wrapper for our Paine's.

00:03:07.655 --> 00:03:10.280
And then I'm going to give
it some margin, okay,

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.055
Some top margin,
maybe 30 pixels.

00:03:13.055 --> 00:03:15.485
Okay, so let's see
what happens now.

00:03:15.485 --> 00:03:16.850
I'm going to preview it.

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.140
We are on yearly plan.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.600
I'm going to click on
monthly. There we go.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.715
Can you see this transition?

00:03:22.715 --> 00:03:25.835
So this is basically
how the tabs work.

00:03:25.835 --> 00:03:28.535
Of course, you can
style these tabs

00:03:28.535 --> 00:03:31.445
and we will talk
about stylings later.

00:03:31.445 --> 00:03:32.750
But for now you
just need to know

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.165
how the tap element works.

00:03:35.165 --> 00:03:37.850
If you want to add more tabs,

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.839
I can select my tabs
element in the navigator.

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:44.180
And if I head over
to the tap Settings,

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.205
I can click on this Add button

00:03:46.205 --> 00:03:48.425
just like that to add more tabs.

00:03:48.425 --> 00:03:51.215
As you can see, tap three
has been added here.

00:03:51.215 --> 00:03:54.830
And I can rearrange
my tabs like this.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.615
I can set the initial tab
that the user sees, e.g.

00:03:59.615 --> 00:04:01.070
it's going to be tapped one,

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.440
I'm going to remove tab 34 now.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.705
You can rename the taps here,

00:04:05.705 --> 00:04:08.510
but just in terms
of organization.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.430
Okay, so if I rename it here,

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.195
nothing changes on
the actual tab,

00:04:14.195 --> 00:04:16.655
on the actual link
because this is

00:04:16.655 --> 00:04:19.730
a text and you need to
modify that on the canvas.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.520
But if you want to
organize them properly,

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.975
you can simply write one e.g.

00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:30.080
and for this to just like that,

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.525
you can modify the
easing method. For now.

00:04:32.525 --> 00:04:33.890
You don't know what it is,

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.870
but we will talk about it later.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.855
It's all about the
animation here.

00:04:38.855 --> 00:04:41.810
The fading is set
to 300 milliseconds

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.094
and the fade-out is set
to 100 milliseconds.

00:04:45.094 --> 00:04:46.370
It's too fast.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.475
So to see the real
difference here,

00:04:49.475 --> 00:04:50.705
I'm going to set it to,

00:04:50.705 --> 00:04:52.790
the fading is going to be

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.180
500 milliseconds and
the fade-out is going

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.405
to be 500 milliseconds as well.

00:04:59.405 --> 00:05:01.580
Now, let's preview it are right,

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.175
the monthly plan is
already selected.

00:05:04.175 --> 00:05:06.529
I'm going to click on a yearly.

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:10.220
And there we go. It's
much slower now.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.545
Alright, so let's recap.

00:05:12.545 --> 00:05:16.025
The tabs element has
two main components,

00:05:16.025 --> 00:05:19.159
tabs menu and taps content.

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:21.230
The tabs menu includes

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.350
all these tabs is tab
links at the top.

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.730
And the taps content
includes our tab panes here.

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.210
So whenever we want to modify
the content of our tabs,

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.075
we should only head over
to the taps content.

00:05:35.075 --> 00:05:37.550
Select our tab pane.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.535
If you want to modify
the appearance of

00:05:40.535 --> 00:05:44.045
our tab links or even
the name, the text.

00:05:44.045 --> 00:05:47.930
We should always go to tabs
menu and choose our tab link.

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.165
Alright, that's all
for this video.

00:05:50.165 --> 00:05:54.090
I hope you enjoyed it and
I'll see you in the next one.
