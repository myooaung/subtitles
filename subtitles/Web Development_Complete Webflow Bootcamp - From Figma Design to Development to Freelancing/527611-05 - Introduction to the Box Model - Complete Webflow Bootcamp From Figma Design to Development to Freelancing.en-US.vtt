00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.290
Here is a simple
webpage that has

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.150
some HTML elements like
heading, paragraph, an image.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.740
The box model actually

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.575
defines how the layout
works on the web.

00:00:16.575 --> 00:00:18.600
For instance, here, each of

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.245
these HTML elements
is treated as a box.

00:00:22.245 --> 00:00:24.240
It's like a boundary
on each of them.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.790
All these boxes can
be positioned and

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.135
aligned according to the CSS
properties we give them.

00:00:30.135 --> 00:00:32.440
But why does the
web work like this?

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.185
Can we just create a webpage
like a PowerPoint slide?

00:00:36.185 --> 00:00:40.025
Well, we can, but the problem
is when you design a snide,

00:00:40.025 --> 00:00:41.750
it's not responsive and you

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.865
design it for a
specific dimension,

00:00:43.865 --> 00:00:46.235
but it's not the
case for a webpage.

00:00:46.235 --> 00:00:47.960
When building a website,

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.840
we always want to make
it responsive so that it

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.750
could be displayed
perfectly on any device,

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.849
no matter if it's a MacBook,

00:00:55.849 --> 00:00:59.030
iMac, iPhone, you get the idea.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.805
So using the box model and CSS,

00:01:01.805 --> 00:01:04.235
we can make
responsive web pages.

00:01:04.235 --> 00:01:07.280
And other important thing
about the box model is that

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.505
we can put boxes
inside other biases.

00:01:10.505 --> 00:01:13.010
And this way, we can
decide whether they

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.905
stack on top of each other
or next to each other.

00:01:15.905 --> 00:01:18.860
We can also align
them however we want.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.020
If we want to
modify the spacing,

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.420
we can use margins and padding.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.540
Margin adds space
outside the bikes,

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.435
while Padding adds
space inside the box.

00:01:29.435 --> 00:01:31.924
Let's take a look at
a real-world example.

00:01:31.924 --> 00:01:33.889
Here we have different cards

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:36.274
and inside we have
different elements.

00:01:36.274 --> 00:01:39.680
In fact, they are all
considered as boxes that are

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.510
positioned either next to each

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.385
other or inside each other.

00:01:43.385 --> 00:01:46.190
We can modify the CSS
properties of each of

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.960
these boxes to control

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.975
the styling and layout
of every element.

00:01:50.975 --> 00:01:53.675
Let's take a look at
some famous websites.

00:01:53.675 --> 00:01:56.374
As you can see,
all these websites

00:01:56.374 --> 00:01:58.535
are built using the box model.

00:01:58.535 --> 00:01:59.750
And if you want to become a

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.329
professional web
designer and developer,

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:04.040
you need to understand how

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.380
the box model works thoroughly.
