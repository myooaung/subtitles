00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:09.615
Sometimes we might need to
use a video in our project.

00:00:09.615 --> 00:00:12.360
In this case, we can
use a video elements.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.375
So if you go to the
media from here,

00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:18.944
you can drag and drop a video
element into your Canvas.

00:00:18.944 --> 00:00:20.429
I'm going to put it inside

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:23.820
my container to keep
everything organized.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.165
And this video elements
works like a place holder.

00:00:27.165 --> 00:00:29.595
You can paste a video link from

00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:34.110
any third party source
like Vimeo or YouTube.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.230
It doesn't matter.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.765
So for now, I'm going to
paste a YouTube link.

00:00:38.765 --> 00:00:40.745
And as soon as I pasted, it,

00:00:40.745 --> 00:00:44.435
loads it here, and I can
simply preview my project.

00:00:44.435 --> 00:00:46.760
I can play this video easily.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.945
As you can see, we have

00:00:47.945 --> 00:00:51.350
all the options of the
YouTube video player,

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.185
but we have another
element as well.

00:00:54.185 --> 00:00:56.330
Let me remove this
video element,

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.860
then I'm going to drag and
drop this YouTube elements.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.225
So what's the difference?

00:01:02.225 --> 00:01:03.875
Well, with the video elements,

00:01:03.875 --> 00:01:07.160
you can use any link
from any platforms,

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.885
but with the YouTube element,

00:01:08.885 --> 00:01:11.465
you can only use a YouTube link.

00:01:11.465 --> 00:01:12.890
So what's the main difference

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.720
here with the YouTube element?

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.985
We have more options
to work with.

00:01:16.985 --> 00:01:18.395
We have different settings,

00:01:18.395 --> 00:01:22.685
like start at, we can mute
the video by default.

00:01:22.685 --> 00:01:24.770
We can enable the auto play.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.995
We can modify the
player controls,

00:01:27.995 --> 00:01:32.030
whether we want to show the
player controls or not.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.320
We can also modify the
privacy settings as well.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.654
So this is basically

00:01:37.654 --> 00:01:40.535
the main difference between
these two elements.

00:01:40.535 --> 00:01:42.710
And just like any
other elements,

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.920
you can modify all
the CSS properties

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.560
of this video elements as well.
