00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.105
What's agreed In this video,

00:00:07.105 --> 00:00:09.745
we're gonna talk
about CSS grids.

00:00:09.745 --> 00:00:11.740
If you head over
to the Add section

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.660
under the layout category,

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.345
you can see that we
have a grid element.

00:00:16.345 --> 00:00:18.490
It's actually a CSS grid.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.760
It's not an HTML tag
because basically we

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.390
can turn any bikes into a grid.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.075
We will talk about it
in the upcoming videos.

00:00:28.075 --> 00:00:30.820
But for now, let's go
ahead and drag and

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.135
drop this element
into our Canvas.

00:00:34.135 --> 00:00:35.365
There we go. Here.

00:00:35.365 --> 00:00:38.829
I have a section and
then I have a container.

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:40.495
And inside this container,

00:00:40.495 --> 00:00:42.645
I'm going to drop my grid.

00:00:42.645 --> 00:00:46.955
As we can see, a grid
is nothing but a guide.

00:00:46.955 --> 00:00:51.500
Grids help us organize our
content in a dynamic way.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.290
So when we have multiple
images, for instance,

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.830
that we want to organize
dynamically or even when we have

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.795
some deep likes that we want to

00:00:59.795 --> 00:01:02.285
organize dynamically and neatly,

00:01:02.285 --> 00:01:03.860
we can use greets.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.205
You need to understand that
a grid serves as a guide.

00:01:07.205 --> 00:01:10.865
So it's like a placeholder
for our content.

00:01:10.865 --> 00:01:13.205
As you can see now we
are in the editing mode.

00:01:13.205 --> 00:01:16.655
So here by default we have
two columns and two rows.

00:01:16.655 --> 00:01:19.535
And if you take a look
at the right side,

00:01:19.535 --> 00:01:21.830
you can see that here we can

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.550
modify the preferences
of our grid, e.g.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.380
we can modify the gutter amount,

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.785
which is the spacing
between rows and columns.

00:01:30.785 --> 00:01:34.430
By default, it's set
to 16 by 16 pixels.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.444
You can set it to
whatever amount you want.

00:01:37.444 --> 00:01:41.720
You can also modify it here
manually, just like that.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.980
And if you want to add

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.695
more columns and more
rows to your grid,

00:01:45.695 --> 00:01:47.330
you can simply click on

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.665
this plus button right
here to add more columns.

00:01:51.665 --> 00:01:53.540
If you want to add more rows,

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.270
you can click on this
plus button here.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.435
Alternatively, you can
hit this Plus button

00:01:59.435 --> 00:02:03.635
right in the settings to add
a new column and four rows,

00:02:03.635 --> 00:02:06.125
you can click on
this plus button.

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:07.940
Once you've created your grid,

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.085
you need to exit the edit mode.

00:02:10.085 --> 00:02:13.610
To do so, you can press Escape
on your keyboard or you

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.525
can click on this blue Done
button at the bottom here.

00:02:17.525 --> 00:02:18.995
Alright, as you can see,

00:02:18.995 --> 00:02:22.580
I already created for
simple div blocks,

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.250
and each of them
includes a heading,

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.785
a paragraph, and a button.

00:02:27.785 --> 00:02:30.635
So what we're gonna
do is drag and drop

00:02:30.635 --> 00:02:33.875
these deep blacks into our grid.

00:02:33.875 --> 00:02:36.440
But first, let's see how
many div blocks we have.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.020
We have actually four
different IP blocks.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.650
Therefore, I'm going to
select my grid element here.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.090
Then I'm going to click on
this read or pinkish button.

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.900
So since we have four
different div blocks,

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.095
I'm going to remove some
of these columns and rows.

00:02:54.095 --> 00:02:55.850
Let's remove two of

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.515
these columns and two
of these rows, okay?

00:03:00.515 --> 00:03:03.335
Now we have a two-by-two grid.

00:03:03.335 --> 00:03:07.760
We have two columns and
two rows. That's perfect.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.925
Now I'm going to adjust
the gap or the gutter.

00:03:10.925 --> 00:03:15.320
So let's set it to 20 for
both columns and rows.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.995
Great.

00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:19.655
I'm going to click on this
Done button, and that's all.

00:03:19.655 --> 00:03:24.335
Now what we need to do
is select our diblock,

00:03:24.335 --> 00:03:29.180
drag it, and drop it inside
the grid, just like that.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.610
One thing to mention
about grids is that

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.070
when you add content
to your grid,

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.825
the content will take

00:03:35.825 --> 00:03:39.095
the next available
cell within the grid.

00:03:39.095 --> 00:03:43.520
As you can see, the first
diblock took the first cell.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.990
And now if I select this,

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.695
the Blog and drag and
drop it inside the grid,

00:03:48.695 --> 00:03:51.860
we can see that it took
the next available cell.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.385
Of course, if I modify their
order in the navigator,

00:03:55.385 --> 00:03:59.075
you can see that their place
changes just like that.

00:03:59.075 --> 00:04:01.220
Okay, Now let's
do the same thing

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.685
for the remaining
two div blocks.

00:04:03.685 --> 00:04:08.000
I'm going to select them and
drag and drop them here.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.740
There we go. Let's do

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.710
the same thing for
the last diblock.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.165
Are right, cool.

00:04:14.165 --> 00:04:17.720
Now our div likes
are inside our Grid.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.550
However, if I select

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:22.715
my grid and if I go
to the Edit mode,

00:04:22.715 --> 00:04:26.120
you can see that these
cells are bigger and this

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.380
def blacks don't take up the
whole width of each cell.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.525
That's because I gave these
deep blacks a fixed width.

00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:38.675
So if I select content
and modify the width

00:04:38.675 --> 00:04:42.365
from 400 to Auto,
see what happens.

00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:45.710
Now it takes up the whole
width of that cell,

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.885
and that's exactly what we want.

00:04:47.885 --> 00:04:50.285
If you want to modify
the height of your grid,

00:04:50.285 --> 00:04:52.490
you can select your grid and

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.950
set the height to four incense,

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.890
700 pixels, just like that,

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.410
or I can set it to 500 pixels.

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.645
Let me remove this
section for a second.

00:05:02.645 --> 00:05:05.015
One of the most
important things.

00:05:05.015 --> 00:05:08.645
About grids is that they
are way default responsive.

00:05:08.645 --> 00:05:10.310
So let's take a look.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.370
If I hit the Preview
button here and I

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.030
tried to modify the
dimension of my screen.

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.900
You can see that these
contents are dynamic.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.905
They are responsive by default
because we used a grid.

00:05:24.905 --> 00:05:26.990
That's why reads are so

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.720
powerful in terms
of responsiveness.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.075
If I go to the
desktop base point

00:05:32.075 --> 00:05:34.310
and I want to add some padding,

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.020
I can select the container.

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.649
And then here I can
set some padding.

00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:43.220
Of course we will talk about
all these properties later.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.820
But I just want to show
you how the grids work

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.435
actually in terms of
responsiveness. There we go.

00:05:50.435 --> 00:05:53.480
But what if I want to modify
the layout of this grid?

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.860
That's so simple.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.465
I can select my grid.

00:05:56.465 --> 00:05:59.645
I can go to the Edit
mode. From here.

00:05:59.645 --> 00:06:03.125
I can modify the number
of rows and columns.

00:06:03.125 --> 00:06:07.340
Let's suppose I want to stack
these content vertically.

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.805
So I just need to
have one column.

00:06:10.805 --> 00:06:13.070
I'm going to remove this
column and I'm going to

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.695
add two more rows and hit done.

00:06:15.695 --> 00:06:16.550
And it's done.

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.110
As you can see, now we have

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.920
four different rows that are
placed on top of each other.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.750
The yard dynamic.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.830
So if I try to check
its responsiveness,

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.835
you can see that they are
steel dynamic on all devices.

00:06:31.835 --> 00:06:34.175
But what if you
want to make one of

00:06:34.175 --> 00:06:37.190
these div blocks take
more than one cell,

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:38.690
we can do so as well.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.880
Let's add one column and remove

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.690
these additional two
rows just like that.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:49.385
And I'm going to remove
heading for this last block.

00:06:49.385 --> 00:06:51.605
And suppose that
you want to take

00:06:51.605 --> 00:06:54.545
heading three, this last blog,

00:06:54.545 --> 00:06:57.965
and you wanted to take
the last two cells, okay,

00:06:57.965 --> 00:06:59.090
to do so you can use

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.865
this handle right at
the bottom corner.

00:07:01.865 --> 00:07:07.070
If I left-click on that and
drag and drop, there we go.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:08.810
Now it could easily spend

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.015
the content to take
up more cells.

00:07:11.015 --> 00:07:12.395
And the good news is,

00:07:12.395 --> 00:07:16.400
it's still dynamic and
it's still a responsive.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.540
Let's take a look.

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:22.550
Sometimes we might need to
place our content manually.

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:24.575
As you remember,
I mentioned that

00:07:24.575 --> 00:07:26.900
when you add content
to your grid,

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.889
it takes up the next
available cell by default.

00:07:30.889 --> 00:07:34.580
But what if I want to
place them manually?

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:35.945
Well, we can do that.

00:07:35.945 --> 00:07:37.730
Let me undo the operation.

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:39.350
So what if I want to place

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:44.420
this last def block here
into this last cell?

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.010
Well, we can do so first

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:47.750
we need to select
this div block.

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:48.920
And if we head over to

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.160
the grid child settings
on the right side,

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.705
you can see that by default,

00:07:53.705 --> 00:07:56.015
it's position is set to auto.

00:07:56.015 --> 00:07:58.430
If I set it to manual, now,

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:00.920
I can just drag it
and drop it here.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.715
Now, we could easily position
our content Manually,

00:08:04.715 --> 00:08:06.350
are right, I hope now you have

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:08.345
a better understanding
of grades.

00:08:08.345 --> 00:08:10.340
We're going to work with
grids at large when

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.485
we start creating our projects.

00:08:12.485 --> 00:08:14.460
So see you then.
