00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.715
Hey, welcome back to another
section of this course.

00:00:08.715 --> 00:00:10.770
In this section,
we're going to start

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.320
building our real-world
project together.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.595
I'm so excited.

00:00:14.595 --> 00:00:17.310
So first I'm going to show
you what we are going to

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.355
build and then I'm going
to explain the process.

00:00:20.355 --> 00:00:21.930
And finally, we're going to set

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.715
up our project in Webflow.

00:00:23.715 --> 00:00:26.430
So without further ado,
let's get started.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.930
This is the project
that we're going

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.415
to build in this section.

00:00:29.415 --> 00:00:31.140
It's actually a website for

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.215
a fictional design
agency called circle.

00:00:34.215 --> 00:00:36.590
So together, you
and I are going to

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.169
build this website from scratch.

00:00:39.169 --> 00:00:42.020
You're not going to talk about
the user interface process

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.900
because this is not the
main goal of this course.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.800
The main objective of this
course is to teach you how to

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.275
convert a user interface design

00:00:51.275 --> 00:00:53.449
to fully functional website.

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.070
Therefore, we're
not going to design

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.750
this project from scratch.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.180
So I prepare the design
and I'm going to

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.730
show you how you can get
access to this project.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.440
So first of all,
let me show you how

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.210
the design looks
in this project.

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.940
We are going to build
three different pages.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.265
The homepage, the project page,

00:01:10.265 --> 00:01:11.795
and the Contact Us page.

00:01:11.795 --> 00:01:15.530
We're gonna be able to static
pages and one dynamic page,

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.450
of course, we will talk
about the difference

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.060
between static pages
and dynamic pages.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.030
But for now, let me show
you how the homepage looks.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.640
I'm going to scroll
down just like that.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.905
As you can see, we have
different sections.

00:01:27.905 --> 00:01:30.005
We have testimonial section,

00:01:30.005 --> 00:01:33.410
we have services, we have
a call to action section.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:34.925
And finally, filter.

00:01:34.925 --> 00:01:36.170
I'm going to zoom out.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.840
I'm going to show you
other pages as well.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.315
So here we have
the project page.

00:01:41.315 --> 00:01:43.295
As you can see, there
are some information

00:01:43.295 --> 00:01:45.530
about the latest projects that

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.900
this company has
recently done and

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.600
also the other projects
section and again,

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.800
the call to action.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.495
And finally, there is

00:01:53.495 --> 00:01:57.485
this Contact Us page that we
will need to build together.

00:01:57.485 --> 00:02:02.165
So these are the main pages
of this project homepage,

00:02:02.165 --> 00:02:05.225
or let's say the landing
page that showcases

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:08.885
the recent projects of this
company called circle,

00:02:08.885 --> 00:02:10.775
this fictional
company, let's say,

00:02:10.775 --> 00:02:13.820
and also displays they
are services, e.g.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.560
here we have user
interface design,

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.955
user experience design,

00:02:16.955 --> 00:02:18.440
application development,

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.990
and a call to
action with a form.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.820
So first, we're going to build

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.740
this design in sight Webflow,

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.425
and then we're going
to make it responsive.

00:02:27.425 --> 00:02:29.705
And finally, we are
going to work with

00:02:29.705 --> 00:02:32.000
interactions and animations in

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.920
order to make the
website look much

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.965
better and improve
the user experience,

00:02:36.965 --> 00:02:39.020
you're going to
learn how to create

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.675
advanced interactions
inside Webflow.

00:02:41.675 --> 00:02:44.690
And also you will learn how
to create advanced animation.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.690
So this is the main points
that I needed to mention here.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.525
As you can see, we have
a design system as well.

00:02:50.525 --> 00:02:52.175
Here we have the colors, styles,

00:02:52.175 --> 00:02:54.455
and the textiles
on the right side.

00:02:54.455 --> 00:02:56.195
I already prepared them.

00:02:56.195 --> 00:02:58.130
And I'm going to show you how

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.110
you can get access
to this project.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.425
Now, the software I'm
using is called Figma.

00:03:03.425 --> 00:03:05.780
You may or may not be
familiar with that,

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:06.830
but if you aren't,

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.110
That's totally fine
because we're not going

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.435
to work with Figma
in this project.

00:03:11.435 --> 00:03:15.620
We just need Figma to see how
this project is structured.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.900
And maybe we just need to check

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.260
some properties like the
font size or the colors.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.765
Okay, so nothing complicated.

00:03:23.765 --> 00:03:25.805
If you haven't worked
with Figma before,

00:03:25.805 --> 00:03:28.445
don't worry, you won't
face any issues.

00:03:28.445 --> 00:03:29.525
Alright, first of all,

00:03:29.525 --> 00:03:31.760
I'm going to ask you
to go ahead and create

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.270
a free Figma account if you
don't have any already.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.265
If you go to figma.com,

00:03:37.265 --> 00:03:39.980
you can click on
this sign-up button

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.615
on the top right corner.

00:03:41.615 --> 00:03:44.555
And here you can enter
your email address and

00:03:44.555 --> 00:03:46.010
choose a password for

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.380
your account and hit
the Create Account.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.240
Once you are logged in,

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.265
you will see this
dashboard, okay.

00:03:52.265 --> 00:03:55.880
You may be inside a recent
tab or the Draft tab.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.155
That's totally fine.

00:03:57.155 --> 00:03:58.805
What you're gonna do is

00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:01.670
upload the project that
I prepared for you.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:02.165
Okay?

00:04:02.165 --> 00:04:04.775
So if you're inside
a draft or resent,

00:04:04.775 --> 00:04:08.090
you can just head over
to this new button on

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.860
the right side and
you can click on

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.695
that and you can hit
the Import button.

00:04:12.695 --> 00:04:14.450
I'm going to show
you here as well.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.395
I'm inside a team and I am
going to hit this new button.

00:04:18.395 --> 00:04:20.750
I'm going to click on import.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.175
And then I can import the
project from my computer.

00:04:25.175 --> 00:04:27.290
Alternatively, you
can just drag and

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.870
drop the file that I
prepared for you here.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.400
So first, you need to download

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.740
the Figma project that
I prepared for you

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.760
from the resources section
or from the assets lecture,

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.625
okay, once you
download the zip file,

00:04:40.625 --> 00:04:41.930
you need to unzip that.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.700
And once you unzip the file,

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.340
you will get this a
Webflow project dot

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.090
50k file extension is dot fig,

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.415
and you can just simply
drag and drop it

00:04:52.415 --> 00:04:55.685
inside your Figma
dashboard, just like that.

00:04:55.685 --> 00:04:57.650
Once it's imported, you can

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.975
double-click on
it and it's done.

00:04:59.975 --> 00:05:01.655
You will get access
to the project

00:05:01.655 --> 00:05:03.875
with all the details you need.

00:05:03.875 --> 00:05:07.415
So this is basically what
you need to do inside Figma.

00:05:07.415 --> 00:05:08.585
Nothing more.

00:05:08.585 --> 00:05:10.160
First, create an account.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.350
Second, download
the Figma project

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.760
that I prepared for you.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.450
In a third, import that
project to your Figma account.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:18.230
That's all.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.425
Alright, once you've
done these three steps,

00:05:21.425 --> 00:05:24.335
it's time to go ahead and set
up the project on Webflow.

00:05:24.335 --> 00:05:26.839
So I'm gonna go to my
web flows dashboard.

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:29.990
And here I'm going to hit
this new project button,

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.555
and then I'm going to
choose this blank site.

00:05:32.555 --> 00:05:34.940
Select here, Let's name it.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:35.885
Seroquel.

00:05:35.885 --> 00:05:37.730
You can name it
whatever you want.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:38.870
That doesn't matter.

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.435
And let's hit the
Create Project button.

00:05:41.435 --> 00:05:42.140
Perfect.

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.510
Now we are inside
the designer and we

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.375
have an empty canvas
for this project.

00:05:47.375 --> 00:05:49.340
We need to work
with some assets.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.815
If I go to my Figma
project here,

00:05:51.815 --> 00:05:53.840
as you can see, we
have different images,

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.505
we have different logos.

00:05:55.505 --> 00:05:57.575
Also, we have some images for

00:05:57.575 --> 00:06:01.474
our projects and these
emojis and also some icons.

00:06:01.474 --> 00:06:03.950
So we need to export
these assets and

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.935
then import it to our
web flows project.

00:06:06.935 --> 00:06:08.690
But in order to save your time,

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:10.670
I already exported them and I

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.965
prepared an asset
folder for you.

00:06:12.965 --> 00:06:14.120
You can download it from

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.200
the resources section or
from the assets lecture.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.820
Later on we will talk about

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.085
how you should
export your images,

00:06:22.085 --> 00:06:24.890
how you should optimize your
images for web development.

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:28.535
But for now, you just need to
get access to those assets.

00:06:28.535 --> 00:06:30.920
And you need to learn
how you can use

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.700
those assets in order to
build a real-world project.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.520
We're not going to
dive into details

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.805
about image optimization at
this stage of discourse,

00:06:40.805 --> 00:06:42.770
but later we will
talk about that.

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.540
So let's go to Webflow.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.675
And then if I head over to
the asset section here,

00:06:47.675 --> 00:06:49.895
I can drop my files here.

00:06:49.895 --> 00:06:51.230
So once you download it,

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.855
the Assets folder
and you unzip that,

00:06:53.855 --> 00:06:56.675
you can simply drag and
drop those files here,

00:06:56.675 --> 00:06:58.310
let me show you how it works.

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.410
So inside the Assets folder,

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.080
you have different folders
like hero section,

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.900
logos, newsletter,
project section,

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.615
Services section, and
testimonial section.

00:07:08.615 --> 00:07:10.460
We are going to open
up each of them and

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.590
we're going to import
them one by one.

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:14.000
Okay, I'm going to start with

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.785
hero section. And there we go.

00:07:15.785 --> 00:07:17.990
I'm going to select
all of them and

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.570
drag and drop them.
Just like that.

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.400
I'm going to repeat
the same process

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.989
for all those folders.

00:07:23.989 --> 00:07:26.660
And I'm going to fast
forward this process to

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.870
save you some time
are right, It's done.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:34.220
All our images and icons have
been uploaded successfully.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.915
So what else do we need to do

00:07:35.915 --> 00:07:37.925
in order to set up our project?

00:07:37.925 --> 00:07:40.865
In this project, we're going
to use a specific fonts,

00:07:40.865 --> 00:07:43.355
okay, if I go to my
Figma as projects here,

00:07:43.355 --> 00:07:46.505
and if I select one of
these texts layers,

00:07:46.505 --> 00:07:49.565
I'm going to double-click and
this tidal, this heading.

00:07:49.565 --> 00:07:52.355
And I can show you what
funds are used for an ad.

00:07:52.355 --> 00:07:53.840
It's called roboto.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.405
This is a Google font
and it's free to use,

00:07:56.405 --> 00:07:58.220
and we're going to
need that as well.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.615
So as you remember,

00:07:59.615 --> 00:08:01.580
in order to work
with these fonts,

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:05.465
we need to add the font
inside our project settings.

00:08:05.465 --> 00:08:09.064
So if I go to Webflow and if
I go to Project Settings,

00:08:09.064 --> 00:08:11.900
I can head over to the
fonts tab are right,

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.450
and here I'm going to
choose font from least.

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:16.325
I'm going to look for Roboto.

00:08:16.325 --> 00:08:17.045
There we go.

00:08:17.045 --> 00:08:18.649
I'm going to choose Roboto.

00:08:18.649 --> 00:08:20.375
And here I'm going to choose

00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:22.265
different variants of this font,

00:08:22.265 --> 00:08:24.230
different weights for this font,

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:25.924
regular should be selected.

00:08:25.924 --> 00:08:30.830
I'm going to select 300,500.700.

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:32.435
We're not going to need 900.

00:08:32.435 --> 00:08:34.385
It's gonna be too bold.

00:08:34.385 --> 00:08:37.325
So these are the necessary funds

00:08:37.325 --> 00:08:39.470
we're going to need for
these projects later on,

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:40.970
if we need more variants,

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:42.290
we can always come to

00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:45.740
this section and just
add more variance.

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:49.100
I'm going to hit the Add
font button, and that's all.

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.930
I'm going to head
over to the designer.

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:51.680
Perfect.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.600
And we are ready to start

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.700
building our project
because our assets are

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.829
imported and our funds

00:08:57.829 --> 00:09:00.260
have been added to
this project as well.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.510
All right, guys, that's
all for this video,

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:05.060
we successfully set up our
project and we're going

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:07.760
to start building our
project in the next video.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.750
See you then.
