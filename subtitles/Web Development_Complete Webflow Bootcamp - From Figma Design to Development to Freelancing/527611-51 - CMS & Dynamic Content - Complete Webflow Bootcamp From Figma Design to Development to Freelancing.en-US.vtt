00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.205
Hey, in this video we're
going to talk him out.

00:00:08.205 --> 00:00:10.800
Cms and dynamic content.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.510
When it comes to
web development,

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.655
we have two types of webpages.

00:00:14.655 --> 00:00:17.055
We have static and
dynamic pages.

00:00:17.055 --> 00:00:18.330
So what's the difference

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.385
between static and
dynamic pages?

00:00:20.385 --> 00:00:24.800
Well, static means fixed
and dynamic means something

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.155
that is more functional and

00:00:27.155 --> 00:00:29.630
changes based on
the user's action.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:30.755
So if you remember,

00:00:30.755 --> 00:00:32.960
I already told you that
we are going to create

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.385
two static pages and one dynamic
page for these projects.

00:00:37.385 --> 00:00:39.815
So let me tell you
what it means.

00:00:39.815 --> 00:00:41.690
Here is our homepage and we

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.585
created all the
elements in Webflow.

00:00:44.585 --> 00:00:46.850
But this is a static
page right now.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.025
Why? Because the
content of this page

00:00:49.025 --> 00:00:51.260
is not going to
change frequently.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.075
The image is going to be fixed.

00:00:53.075 --> 00:00:55.070
These logos are
going to be fixed.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.775
This testimonial is gonna
be fixed and so on.

00:00:58.775 --> 00:01:01.355
So that's why it's
a static page.

00:01:01.355 --> 00:01:03.680
But sometimes you might need

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.035
to create some dynamic pages.

00:01:06.035 --> 00:01:08.240
Well, let me give
you a good example.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.140
Let's suppose you want to
create a block for a blog.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.689
You usually have
hundreds or thousands

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:16.115
of different blog posts.

00:01:16.115 --> 00:01:18.635
Therefore, you need to
create dynamic pages.

00:01:18.635 --> 00:01:21.620
Well, dynamic pages
have dynamic content.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.455
It means we can create
the page you once,

00:01:24.455 --> 00:01:25.970
and then we can just modify

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.520
the contents again
and again and again,

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.950
depending on the user's actions.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.640
For our blog, we can create
a blog post page once with

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.890
a specific layout and then just

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.115
modify the contents again
and again and again.

00:01:40.115 --> 00:01:42.635
That's why we need to use a CMS.

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:43.865
So in this project,

00:01:43.865 --> 00:01:47.870
we are going to create one
dynamic page for our projects.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.390
As you can see here
on our homepage,

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.310
we have three
different projects,

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.425
and it says recent projects.

00:01:54.425 --> 00:01:57.650
But what if this agency
creates more projects

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.770
in the future and they
want to present them here.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.260
Should they contact you
as a web developer or

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.574
web designer and ask you
to modify the content?

00:02:06.574 --> 00:02:08.240
Well, the answer is no,

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.145
because this is not
an efficient way.

00:02:10.145 --> 00:02:12.590
In this case, you can
create a dynamic page,

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.760
as you can see here,

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.250
we have this project page and it

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.920
displays the details
of each project.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.390
We have the subtitle,

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.880
we have the title, we
have the completion date,

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.235
we have some information
about the project,

00:02:25.235 --> 00:02:28.160
and then we have this
other projects section.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.990
So it would be very
hard to create

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.820
some static pages if you want to

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.830
change the content frequently.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.150
So when should you use

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.585
a static page and when should
you use a dynamic page?

00:02:38.585 --> 00:02:40.700
Well, if you want to create

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.000
just a landing page with
some informational contents,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.730
you can go with static
pages because they are

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.045
much easier to create and
they are not time-consuming.

00:02:50.045 --> 00:02:52.280
However, if you or your client

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.995
wants to modify the
content frequently,

00:02:54.995 --> 00:02:57.830
or let's say add some new
content to the website.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.874
It's better to create
dynamic pages.

00:03:00.874 --> 00:03:02.735
So here for this project,

00:03:02.735 --> 00:03:04.925
we're going to create
a dynamic page.

00:03:04.925 --> 00:03:07.445
As you can see here,
the project page.

00:03:07.445 --> 00:03:09.110
And these projects are going to

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.450
be changed dynamically later.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.225
If the client wants to
add one more project,

00:03:14.225 --> 00:03:16.130
the project will
be automatically

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.665
added to these recent
project section.

00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:20.510
And you don't need to
go ahead and manually

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.925
create a separate
project page for that,

00:03:22.925 --> 00:03:25.520
because we create a
project page once

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.235
and if the client
adds more content,

00:03:28.235 --> 00:03:31.505
the content of this page
will be changed accordingly.

00:03:31.505 --> 00:03:33.170
Alright, so what do we need in

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.135
order to create dynamic pages?

00:03:35.135 --> 00:03:36.860
Well, to create dynamic pages,

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.660
we need dynamic content and we

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.685
need to store our
contents somber.

00:03:40.685 --> 00:03:42.470
So how can we do it at?

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.480
Well, we can use workflows,

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.925
CMS, Let me go to Workflow.

00:03:46.925 --> 00:03:49.415
And if I go to the
CMS section here,

00:03:49.415 --> 00:03:51.740
we can create a CMS collection.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.110
Well, what does CMS stand for?

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.005
Cms stands for content
management system

00:03:57.005 --> 00:03:59.480
and it lets you
store some content.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.939
And then your website
can reference

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:04.730
these contents again
and again and again.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.029
And once you make some
changes to these contents,

00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:11.525
all the dynamic pages will
be updated immediately.

00:04:11.525 --> 00:04:13.715
So it's so beneficial to use

00:04:13.715 --> 00:04:15.380
CMS collections if you

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.404
want to update the
content frequently.

00:04:17.404 --> 00:04:19.190
So the first thing
we need to do is

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.379
create a CMS collection.

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:23.150
To do that, you need to click on

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.600
this blue icon on the top
right corner. There we go.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.554
And here we can create
a new collection.

00:04:29.554 --> 00:04:32.150
At first glance, it
may seem complicated,

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.715
but don't worry,
it's very simple.

00:04:34.715 --> 00:04:37.925
Right at the top, we have
some collection templates.

00:04:37.925 --> 00:04:39.365
We have blood pools,

00:04:39.365 --> 00:04:43.354
Arthur's categories,
projects, clients, etc.

00:04:43.354 --> 00:04:44.420
But we're going to create

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.730
a collection from scratch
because I'm going to show

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.390
you how you can create a
collection step-by-step.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.845
A collection lets us create
a structure for our content.

00:04:54.845 --> 00:04:57.950
Okay, So if we have
some projects,

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.265
let's say here each
project has some content.

00:05:01.265 --> 00:05:03.980
We have an image,
we have this name,

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.485
project name, we
have the subtitle.

00:05:06.485 --> 00:05:08.705
And then in the
project page here.

00:05:08.705 --> 00:05:10.580
We have the completion date and

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.605
we have these information here.

00:05:12.605 --> 00:05:15.754
So these are gonna be
our collection fields.

00:05:15.754 --> 00:05:18.725
Each collection has some fields,

00:05:18.725 --> 00:05:21.005
but first, we need
a collection name.

00:05:21.005 --> 00:05:23.630
So let's call it projects
because we are going to

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.290
create a collection
for our projects here.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.929
In Webflow automatically creates

00:05:29.929 --> 00:05:32.015
this collection URL for us.

00:05:32.015 --> 00:05:33.965
You don't need to worry
about that for now.

00:05:33.965 --> 00:05:35.240
We will talk about it later.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.340
As you can see, it
says Project page.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.485
Once you create a collection,

00:05:39.485 --> 00:05:41.690
Webflow automatically creates

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.195
a separate page for
your collection,

00:05:44.195 --> 00:05:46.325
a page for our project here,

00:05:46.325 --> 00:05:49.565
okay, alright, let's head over
to the collection fields.

00:05:49.565 --> 00:05:52.685
And here is where we
need to add some fields.

00:05:52.685 --> 00:05:54.769
So what do we need
for our project?

00:05:54.769 --> 00:05:57.515
Well, obviously each
project has a name

00:05:57.515 --> 00:06:00.380
and remember that each
field has a specific type.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.615
As you can see here,
it says plain text.

00:06:02.615 --> 00:06:04.550
That's because we have a name.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:05.555
Then we have the slide.

00:06:05.555 --> 00:06:07.175
This is just the URL that's

00:06:07.175 --> 00:06:09.350
Webflow automatically
creates for us,

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:10.850
so we don't need to change that.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.355
And then we can add
some custom fields.

00:06:13.355 --> 00:06:16.325
If I click on this
Add new field here.

00:06:16.325 --> 00:06:17.675
Here we have different types.

00:06:17.675 --> 00:06:18.829
We have plaintexts.

00:06:18.829 --> 00:06:21.935
And as soon as I hover
over these field types,

00:06:21.935 --> 00:06:23.645
you can see on the right side,

00:06:23.645 --> 00:06:25.490
we get some information.

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.950
So you can go ahead
and read them one

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.485
by one if you want to
learn more about them.

00:06:30.485 --> 00:06:33.815
But let me go ahead and
quickly explain them to you.

00:06:33.815 --> 00:06:35.120
Well, the plain text is

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.600
just a simple texts for
basic texts content.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.490
We have reached texts.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.400
Well, the rich takes is
for long form content.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.045
Let's say you want to have
a paragraph than a heading,

00:06:47.045 --> 00:06:49.010
than a video or an image.

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.380
In that case, you
can use a rich text.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:52.670
Then we have the image.

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:54.800
Well, you can use
that for an image.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.285
Then we have multi image.

00:06:56.285 --> 00:06:57.770
If you have more images,

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:59.540
you can use this multi image.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.265
Then we have video link,

00:07:01.265 --> 00:07:04.324
link, email, phone number,

00:07:04.324 --> 00:07:06.395
date, switch, color,

00:07:06.395 --> 00:07:09.230
option file and reference
and multi reference.

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.825
These two last
options are advanced.

00:07:11.825 --> 00:07:14.285
We're not going to talk
about them now, but for now,

00:07:14.285 --> 00:07:16.010
we just need to go
ahead and create

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:19.475
our custom fields using
these simple types.

00:07:19.475 --> 00:07:22.295
Okay, so we have the name here.

00:07:22.295 --> 00:07:23.675
What else do we need?

00:07:23.675 --> 00:07:26.795
Let me go ahead and check
out my design file here.

00:07:26.795 --> 00:07:28.430
Here we have an image,

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.965
so obviously we need an image.

00:07:30.965 --> 00:07:33.290
So let's go ahead
and choose Image.

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:34.730
Then we need a label.

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:38.045
I'm going to write
project image.

00:07:38.045 --> 00:07:41.120
We can add a Help
takes here or not.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.655
If we add this Help takes later,

00:07:43.655 --> 00:07:47.435
if a collaborator wants
to modify the content,

00:07:47.435 --> 00:07:50.945
he or she will know what
this field is all about.

00:07:50.945 --> 00:07:52.610
But don't worry about it now,

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:54.455
then we can check this checkbox.

00:07:54.455 --> 00:07:56.765
It says this field is required.

00:07:56.765 --> 00:07:58.700
And I'm going to check
that because we can

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:01.160
create a project without
a project image.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.495
So I'm going to check it.

00:08:02.495 --> 00:08:04.280
Then save field.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.025
There we go. Our
project image is ready.

00:08:07.025 --> 00:08:08.795
So what would be the next field?

00:08:08.795 --> 00:08:10.355
Let me go ahead
and check it out.

00:08:10.355 --> 00:08:12.365
Here we have this subtitle

00:08:12.365 --> 00:08:14.720
and it's going to be
our project type.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.780
So if I go to the
project page here,

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:18.890
you can see that's right.

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:20.300
Under the project's name,

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.085
we have the project type,

00:08:22.085 --> 00:08:24.335
UI design, an app development.

00:08:24.335 --> 00:08:26.510
Therefore, here I'm going to go

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:28.714
ahead and add a new field.

00:08:28.714 --> 00:08:30.290
And this new field
is going to be

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:33.170
option because I'm going
to create some options.

00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:36.964
And later when I want to
create some collection items,

00:08:36.964 --> 00:08:38.810
I can choose from those options.

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:40.355
Let me show you how it works.

00:08:40.355 --> 00:08:44.975
This design agency has some
specific services, e.g.

00:08:44.975 --> 00:08:47.225
UI design, an app development,

00:08:47.225 --> 00:08:49.910
web development, user
experience design.

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:52.295
So we already know
about the services.

00:08:52.295 --> 00:08:55.295
That's why we can create
some default options.

00:08:55.295 --> 00:08:57.905
And then when we want to
create some projects,

00:08:57.905 --> 00:09:00.095
or let's say some
collection items,

00:09:00.095 --> 00:09:02.420
we can just choose
from those options.

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:04.655
Let me go ahead and
choose option here.

00:09:04.655 --> 00:09:06.575
Then I'm going to
give it a label.

00:09:06.575 --> 00:09:09.920
Let's write project type.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.725
And here, using
this green button,

00:09:12.725 --> 00:09:14.569
I can add some options.

00:09:14.569 --> 00:09:16.325
Alright, let me add
some options here.

00:09:16.325 --> 00:09:17.990
I'm going to write UI,

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:22.280
design and app development.

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:25.040
I'm going to press
Enter to save.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.425
Then I'm going to
create another option.

00:09:27.425 --> 00:09:30.515
Let's write web development.

00:09:30.515 --> 00:09:32.810
I'm going to press Enter.

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:34.595
I'm going to add another option.

00:09:34.595 --> 00:09:38.569
That's right, user
experience design.

00:09:38.569 --> 00:09:40.310
Press Enter.

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:42.995
The next one is going
to be UI design.

00:09:42.995 --> 00:09:46.775
And the next one is going
to be just app development.

00:09:46.775 --> 00:09:50.165
And the last one is going
to be UI UX design.

00:09:50.165 --> 00:09:52.235
Alright, our options are ready.

00:09:52.235 --> 00:09:55.580
This field is also required
because we can create

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:59.270
a collection item without
choosing the project type.

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:00.949
So it's going to be required.

00:10:00.949 --> 00:10:02.570
I'm going to hit Save Field.

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:04.055
We need two more fields.

00:10:04.055 --> 00:10:06.050
We need the completion date,

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:07.415
as you can see here,

00:10:07.415 --> 00:10:10.325
project page, we have
this completion date.

00:10:10.325 --> 00:10:12.935
So let me go ahead and
create a new field.

00:10:12.935 --> 00:10:15.965
And this time I'm going to
choose date and time, okay?

00:10:15.965 --> 00:10:18.605
I'm going to write
completion date, okay?

00:10:18.605 --> 00:10:20.870
And here we have two checkboxes.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:23.465
The first one says
Include time picker.

00:10:23.465 --> 00:10:25.430
I'm going to check
that as you can see,

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:28.085
when I create these
fields on the right side,

00:10:28.085 --> 00:10:30.155
I can preview my custom fields.

00:10:30.155 --> 00:10:32.045
Here I have Project image,

00:10:32.045 --> 00:10:33.590
I have project type,

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:35.450
and I have completion date,

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:37.685
and it's going to be required,

00:10:37.685 --> 00:10:39.575
then I'm going to
hit Save Field.

00:10:39.575 --> 00:10:40.955
And last but not least,

00:10:40.955 --> 00:10:42.830
I'm going to create a field for

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:45.920
the project detail here
for these paragraphs.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.845
So let me go ahead and
create a new field.

00:10:48.845 --> 00:10:52.595
This time I'm going to
choose a rich text. Why?

00:10:52.595 --> 00:10:55.550
Because later the
client can easily add

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:58.415
some images or videos
without my help.

00:10:58.415 --> 00:11:00.200
So it's gonna be so useful,

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.775
I'm going to choose rich text

00:11:01.775 --> 00:11:04.460
and let me call it
project details.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:05.660
Here we can specify

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:09.125
some minimum character count
or maximum character count.

00:11:09.125 --> 00:11:10.955
It's optional. I'm
going to leave it.

00:11:10.955 --> 00:11:14.480
I'm going to check this
checkbox and hit Save Field.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.880
Our right, our fields are ready.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.680
We have the name,
we have the slag,

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.300
these are the basic info,

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.355
and then we have
some custom fields.

00:11:22.355 --> 00:11:23.705
We have projected image,

00:11:23.705 --> 00:11:27.454
project type, completion
date, project details.

00:11:27.454 --> 00:11:30.125
Once we added our fields
on the right side,

00:11:30.125 --> 00:11:34.025
we can preview our fields
here we have name slag,

00:11:34.025 --> 00:11:36.170
these are the basic information.

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:38.660
Then we have custom
fields, project image,

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.100
project type, we have

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.245
completion date and
project details.

00:11:42.245 --> 00:11:44.075
So if everything looks fine,

00:11:44.075 --> 00:11:46.250
you can hit the Create
Collection button.

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:46.955
And there we go.

00:11:46.955 --> 00:11:50.420
We've successfully created
our CMS collection.

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:53.509
And on the left side you
can see it says projects,

00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:55.775
this is our CMS collection.

00:11:55.775 --> 00:11:58.895
If I click on this projects
on the right side,

00:11:58.895 --> 00:12:01.310
I can create some
collection items.

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:03.425
This is how the CMS works.

00:12:03.425 --> 00:12:06.635
This is how we can create a
structure for our content.

00:12:06.635 --> 00:12:10.595
We create some collections
with some custom fields.

00:12:10.595 --> 00:12:14.615
Then we create some items for
that particular collection.

00:12:14.615 --> 00:12:18.335
And later, we can just use
these collections and items

00:12:18.335 --> 00:12:22.190
in our project and design
around our dynamic contents.

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:22.880
Let's see.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.145
So here we have
different options.

00:12:25.145 --> 00:12:27.740
We can either add
some dummy items.

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.830
If I click on add
five items, workflow,

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:34.040
create some random items
with the random content.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.795
For me, it's a good option,

00:12:35.795 --> 00:12:37.955
especially if you
don't have the content

00:12:37.955 --> 00:12:40.460
or the content is not ready yet.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.875
However, since we
have the content,

00:12:42.875 --> 00:12:44.660
I'm going to go ahead and hit

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:46.745
the New Project button here.

00:12:46.745 --> 00:12:48.425
Why it says new project?

00:12:48.425 --> 00:12:50.180
How does it know that
this is going to

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:51.965
be a project because we named

00:12:51.965 --> 00:12:55.085
our collection
projects and Webflow

00:12:55.085 --> 00:12:59.675
automatically uses that name
and make it singular here.

00:12:59.675 --> 00:13:01.655
And it says New Project.

00:13:01.655 --> 00:13:05.390
If I create a new collection
and I call it members,

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:07.085
here you will see new member.

00:13:07.085 --> 00:13:09.184
So I'm going to hit New Project.

00:13:09.184 --> 00:13:10.205
And there we go.

00:13:10.205 --> 00:13:11.900
We've got our fields here.

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.310
First we need to specify

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:16.700
the name I'm going to
write simplifying.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.520
This is our first
fictional project,

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.260
and as you can see, this slide

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.180
has been created automatically.

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:25.805
Then here we need to
upload our project image.

00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:27.590
If I click on it, I can choose

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:29.390
the image from my
computer or right,

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:31.430
I'm going to choose
the first image.

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:32.720
You have these images in

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.330
the assets folder that
you downloaded before.

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:36.980
Okay, now I am going to select

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:39.530
the project type
using these options.

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:40.970
As you can see, these are

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:43.205
the options that we
already created.

00:13:43.205 --> 00:13:45.320
So I'm going to
choose UI, design,

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.210
an app development, and then I'm

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:49.175
going to need a completion date.

00:13:49.175 --> 00:13:51.050
So here using this date picker,

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:54.755
I can just simply choose
my date and time.

00:13:54.755 --> 00:13:57.710
So let me go ahead and
choose a specific date.

00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:58.925
I'm going to choose

00:13:58.925 --> 00:14:02.210
June 1st and you need to
specify the time as well,

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:03.905
but I'm going to leave it since

00:14:03.905 --> 00:14:06.080
it's gonna give me
a default time,

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.435
it's not important, we're
not going to show that.

00:14:08.435 --> 00:14:10.565
But if you want to
display this time,

00:14:10.565 --> 00:14:12.935
you can specify it here as well.

00:14:12.935 --> 00:14:16.565
And then here I'm going to
just add some dummy text.

00:14:16.565 --> 00:14:19.595
Okay, So I already
prepared some texts.

00:14:19.595 --> 00:14:22.100
I'm just going to go ahead
and copy and paste it.

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:25.430
You can also use this text
here from the design file.

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:27.140
You can just copy and paste it.

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:30.305
And here it says simplify
is blah, blah, blah.

00:14:30.305 --> 00:14:32.330
This way I can make sure that

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:35.720
these paragraphs are
related to these project.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:38.240
Alright, now let me
hit the Create button.

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.925
Our first collection
item is ready,

00:14:40.925 --> 00:14:43.085
and it says staged for Publish.

00:14:43.085 --> 00:14:46.655
It's not published yet because
we didn't use that before.

00:14:46.655 --> 00:14:48.290
But now I'm gonna go ahead and

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:50.525
create five more
collection items.

00:14:50.525 --> 00:14:53.195
Okay, I'm going to create
five more projects.

00:14:53.195 --> 00:14:56.015
If you have so many different
projects to create,

00:14:56.015 --> 00:14:58.265
you can also use
the import option.

00:14:58.265 --> 00:15:00.605
If I click this
Import button here,

00:15:00.605 --> 00:15:03.845
I can drag and drop
a CSV file here.

00:15:03.845 --> 00:15:05.285
And then Webflow creates

00:15:05.285 --> 00:15:07.745
all the items for
me automatically,

00:15:07.745 --> 00:15:08.990
but I'm gonna go ahead and

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:11.179
manually create those projects.

00:15:11.179 --> 00:15:14.165
So let me go ahead and
create this new project.

00:15:14.165 --> 00:15:16.490
I'm going to name it dash coin.

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:18.800
And for the image, let
me choose the image

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.604
from my project section folder,

00:15:21.604 --> 00:15:23.000
the second one, and then

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.135
the project type is gonna
be web development.

00:15:26.135 --> 00:15:27.440
Now I'm going to specify

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.035
the completion date
to something else.

00:15:30.035 --> 00:15:32.045
Let me choose June 17th.

00:15:32.045 --> 00:15:34.190
And here I'm going
to add the details.

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:36.260
So let me just paste
the previous texts

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.690
here and just change
the first word that

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:39.920
we could recognize that

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:43.595
this detail is related
to this project.

00:15:43.595 --> 00:15:46.340
So I'm going to copy
this dash coin name

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:47.840
and I'm going to paste it here.

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.370
Instead of simplifying.

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:50.540
Alright, cool.

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:52.685
Let me copy this project detail

00:15:52.685 --> 00:15:54.050
because we're going
to need that.

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:56.630
I'm going to create it
and I'm going to repeat

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:59.345
the same process
four more times.

00:15:59.345 --> 00:16:02.030
So you can skip this
part or you can just go

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:05.045
ahead and create those
projects one by one with me.

00:16:05.045 --> 00:16:10.220
Okay, so let's name the
third project, Victoria phi.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:14.300
And then I'm going to need
an image, the third image.

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:15.980
And the project type is going to

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:18.080
be user experience design.

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:21.275
The completion date is
gonna be something else.

00:16:21.275 --> 00:16:24.365
Let me choose June 23rd.

00:16:24.365 --> 00:16:25.625
Okay, Nice.

00:16:25.625 --> 00:16:27.485
And I'm going to need
project details.

00:16:27.485 --> 00:16:30.095
I'm going to paste the
previous project detail.

00:16:30.095 --> 00:16:33.695
And let me just change
the first word here,

00:16:33.695 --> 00:16:35.750
just like that. All right, Cool.

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:37.025
Let me create that.

00:16:37.025 --> 00:16:39.980
I'm gonna go ahead and
create three more projects.

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:42.335
This one is going
to be called Orbit,

00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:45.740
and the project image is
going to be the fourth one.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:47.645
The project type is going to be

00:16:47.645 --> 00:16:50.195
UI design and a completion date.

00:16:50.195 --> 00:16:52.295
Let me set it to something else,

00:16:52.295 --> 00:16:56.390
maybe July 1st, and I'm going
to need project details.

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:58.880
So let me paste it here and

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.865
I'm going to change the
first war to orbit.

00:17:01.865 --> 00:17:03.980
Nice. I'm going to create that.

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:06.365
Then I'm going to create
two more projects.

00:17:06.365 --> 00:17:08.585
It's going to be called purify.

00:17:08.585 --> 00:17:10.415
Let me choose its image.

00:17:10.415 --> 00:17:12.590
It's gonna be the fifth image.

00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:16.025
The project type is going
to be UI UX design.

00:17:16.025 --> 00:17:17.285
And the completion date,

00:17:17.285 --> 00:17:20.030
I'm going to choose July 5th,

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:23.060
and the details is
going to be the same.

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:26.450
So let me change the
first war to purify.

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:28.595
Nice, hit Create.

00:17:28.595 --> 00:17:29.915
And last but not least,

00:17:29.915 --> 00:17:32.855
I'm going to go ahead and
create that last project,

00:17:32.855 --> 00:17:35.225
which is going to be
called creep two pi.

00:17:35.225 --> 00:17:36.980
Let me choose the project image.

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:38.555
It's gonna be the last image.

00:17:38.555 --> 00:17:41.735
The project type is gonna
be app development.

00:17:41.735 --> 00:17:43.895
The completion date is gonna be,

00:17:43.895 --> 00:17:46.205
let's say July 9th.

00:17:46.205 --> 00:17:48.500
And the details here,

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:54.110
I'm going to modify the
first word to crypto Pi.

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:56.705
Nice, our collection items are

00:17:56.705 --> 00:17:59.840
all ready and we can
start using them.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:03.305
So how can we use our collection
in our collection items?

00:18:03.305 --> 00:18:05.810
Well, we can use a
collection list and

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:07.295
the collection page that's

00:18:07.295 --> 00:18:09.845
Webflow automatically
created for us.

00:18:09.845 --> 00:18:12.365
As soon as we created
this collection,

00:18:12.365 --> 00:18:16.310
Webflow created a specific
page for our project.

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:18.365
If I go to the pages here,

00:18:18.365 --> 00:18:19.460
you can see that we have

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:22.085
one static page which
is called Home.

00:18:22.085 --> 00:18:24.485
Then we have to utility pages.

00:18:24.485 --> 00:18:26.360
These are created by default.

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:29.270
And if you head over to
the CMS collection pages,

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:30.770
you can see that Webflow

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:33.485
created this project
template for us.

00:18:33.485 --> 00:18:34.760
And if I click on that,

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:36.230
nothing is there and it's

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:37.970
fine because we
didn't design it.

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:39.515
But what should we put here?

00:18:39.515 --> 00:18:42.800
Well, we need to design
our project page here.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:46.715
So since this project page is
going to be a dynamic page,

00:18:46.715 --> 00:18:50.330
we need to design it here
inside this projects template.

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:52.850
And then the content
of this page gonna be

00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:55.700
changed for each
collection item.

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:57.335
As you can see at the top,

00:18:57.335 --> 00:18:59.015
we have this item option.

00:18:59.015 --> 00:19:00.275
And if I click on that,

00:19:00.275 --> 00:19:02.870
you can see that we
have all our items,

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:05.405
but this is going to be the
topic of our next lesson.

00:19:05.405 --> 00:19:07.130
For now, I'm going
to show you how you

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:08.975
can use a collection list.

00:19:08.975 --> 00:19:12.305
Let me go to pages and I'm
going to go to the homepage.

00:19:12.305 --> 00:19:14.135
And if I scroll down here,

00:19:14.135 --> 00:19:15.455
as I mentioned before,

00:19:15.455 --> 00:19:17.480
this page is static and

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.520
these contents are
static as well,

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:23.524
but now it's time to replace
them with dynamic content.

00:19:23.524 --> 00:19:24.815
So how can we do that?

00:19:24.815 --> 00:19:26.060
As I mentioned before,

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:27.875
we need a collection list.

00:19:27.875 --> 00:19:29.480
So let me open up this section

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:31.400
here in the navigator
and then we have

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.440
this container and
inside we have

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:36.770
this project's wrapper
and projects heading.

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:38.720
I'm going to go to
the Add section.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:42.320
And if I scroll down right
under the CMS section,

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.285
we have this collection list.

00:19:44.285 --> 00:19:48.965
And if I drag and drop it
inside this section right here,

00:19:48.965 --> 00:19:50.060
we can see that we will get

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:53.020
this collection list
rapper by default it has

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:54.890
three different items and it

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:57.380
says double-click to
connect to a collection.

00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:00.815
So now we need to connect
this collection list wrapper

00:20:00.815 --> 00:20:02.330
to the collection that we just

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:04.924
created to the
projects collection.

00:20:04.924 --> 00:20:07.640
If you just double-click
on it here,

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:08.660
you will get access to

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:11.675
this collection list
settings and from source,

00:20:11.675 --> 00:20:13.355
you can choose projects.

00:20:13.355 --> 00:20:14.030
There we go.

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:15.650
And as soon as I connected

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:18.815
this collection lists
wrapper to my collection,

00:20:18.815 --> 00:20:21.305
you can see that the
number of items here

00:20:21.305 --> 00:20:24.860
increased and now we have
the name of our items,

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:26.885
we have the name of
our projects here,

00:20:26.885 --> 00:20:29.360
crypto pipe, purify,
orbit vector,

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.279
refined, dash coin,
and simplifying,

00:20:31.279 --> 00:20:33.935
it means that everything
works perfectly.

00:20:33.935 --> 00:20:35.750
But what should we do? Now?

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:37.550
If I open up this collection

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:39.365
list rapper in the navigator,

00:20:39.365 --> 00:20:41.600
you can see that we have
two different elements.

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.995
We have the collection this,

00:20:42.995 --> 00:20:44.375
and we have the empty state.

00:20:44.375 --> 00:20:46.400
We don't need to talk
about the empty state.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.320
Now, what we need is just go

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.600
ahead and open up
this collection list.

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.330
And inside we have
this collection item.

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:55.310
So our cards here should be

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:58.190
placed inside this
collection item.

00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:59.990
Always your content should be

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:02.240
placed inside the
collection item,

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:04.205
Okay, Not the collection list.

00:21:04.205 --> 00:21:06.995
The collection list
is just this wrapper.

00:21:06.995 --> 00:21:08.555
So what should we do now?

00:21:08.555 --> 00:21:10.550
Well, it's very simple.

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:11.990
I'm going to go ahead and select

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:14.480
the first card,
this project card.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:17.690
I'm going to drag it in
the navigator and I am

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:20.795
going to drop it inside
the collection item.

00:21:20.795 --> 00:21:21.920
It's very important.

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:24.710
Pay attention to the
hierarchy of your elements.

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:26.510
It should be nested inside

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:29.195
the collection item,
just like that.

00:21:29.195 --> 00:21:30.530
And as soon as I dropped

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:33.200
this item inside this
collection list,

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:36.425
you can see that six
different project cards

00:21:36.425 --> 00:21:39.155
have been created
here. One, why?

00:21:39.155 --> 00:21:41.000
Because the collection
lists wrapper

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.205
knows how many projects we have.

00:21:43.205 --> 00:21:45.305
So what about these
project cards?

00:21:45.305 --> 00:21:46.265
We don't need them.

00:21:46.265 --> 00:21:48.365
I'm going to select
this project card.

00:21:48.365 --> 00:21:51.455
I'm going to hit Backspace
or Delete to remove it.

00:21:51.455 --> 00:21:53.690
And I'm going to do the
same thing for this one.

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:56.615
But what about these
projects, rapper, right now,

00:21:56.615 --> 00:21:58.580
these projects are stacked

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:00.155
on top of each other vertically.

00:22:00.155 --> 00:22:02.435
The good news is
the collection list

00:22:02.435 --> 00:22:04.295
as also display setting.

00:22:04.295 --> 00:22:06.080
So if I go ahead and change

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:08.375
the display setting
from blog to grid,

00:22:08.375 --> 00:22:10.595
we will get exactly
what we need.

00:22:10.595 --> 00:22:12.815
Let me go ahead and
give it a class first,

00:22:12.815 --> 00:22:16.850
I'm going to write collection
list. There we go.

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:20.105
And I'm going to change the
display setting to grid.

00:22:20.105 --> 00:22:22.295
Now I have two
columns and two rows.

00:22:22.295 --> 00:22:24.440
I'm going to remove
one of these rows,

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.915
and I'm going to add
one more column here.

00:22:26.915 --> 00:22:28.250
Okay, nice.

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:30.680
Then I'm going to
change the gap to

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:33.545
40 pixels and I'm
going to hit Done.

00:22:33.545 --> 00:22:36.425
It doesn't look right
now, but bear with me.

00:22:36.425 --> 00:22:38.510
I'm going to show you
how we can fix that.

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:40.235
First of all, the content of

00:22:40.235 --> 00:22:43.730
all these cars is the same
and we need to fix that.

00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:44.855
What should we do?

00:22:44.855 --> 00:22:47.869
Well, we need to connect
our elements like image,

00:22:47.869 --> 00:22:50.090
tidal project description and

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:51.890
this link to the fields that

00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:53.840
we created for our collection.

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.930
And it's very simple. If I
just click on this image here,

00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:59.660
and if I click on the
Settings icon here,

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:02.030
it says gets image
from projects.

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:03.965
And if I check this checkbox,

00:23:03.965 --> 00:23:06.815
then I can select a
field project image.

00:23:06.815 --> 00:23:09.995
It automatically prisons the
appropriate field to you.

00:23:09.995 --> 00:23:12.260
Since I selected an image here,

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:14.405
it doesn't show me
all the fields.

00:23:14.405 --> 00:23:18.140
So we have only one image
field, project image.

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:19.460
I'm going to select it.

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:20.210
There we go.

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:22.205
Now the images are different.

00:23:22.205 --> 00:23:23.525
What about the tidal?

00:23:23.525 --> 00:23:25.400
We're gonna do the
same thing here.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:27.035
I'm going to select the title.

00:23:27.035 --> 00:23:30.335
I'm going to click on the
Settings icon and let me check,

00:23:30.335 --> 00:23:34.115
get texts from projects
and from the strop menu,

00:23:34.115 --> 00:23:37.250
I'm going to choose
name just like that.

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:41.435
Now we have crypto Pi
purify orbits, et cetera.

00:23:41.435 --> 00:23:43.310
Now, let me do the same thing

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:45.245
for the project description.

00:23:45.245 --> 00:23:46.655
So once I select it,

00:23:46.655 --> 00:23:48.710
I'm going to hit
the settings icon

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:49.880
and I'm going to check,

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:51.605
get texts from projects.

00:23:51.605 --> 00:23:55.400
And here I'm going to
choose project type.

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.395
Nice. And last but not least,

00:23:57.395 --> 00:23:59.255
I'm going to select
this link Martin,

00:23:59.255 --> 00:24:02.060
and I am going to check
git URL from projects.

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:05.555
But wait, we didn't create
any URL for our projects.

00:24:05.555 --> 00:24:06.485
Yes, you are right.

00:24:06.485 --> 00:24:08.720
But Webflow the
data automatically.

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.955
Do you remember when
we talked about slug,

00:24:10.955 --> 00:24:13.625
That's exactly the URL
we're looking for.

00:24:13.625 --> 00:24:15.005
So what should happen here?

00:24:15.005 --> 00:24:17.135
When the user clicks
on this link,

00:24:17.135 --> 00:24:19.190
the user should be redirected to

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:21.560
this crypto Pi project page.

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:25.520
Okay, therefore here I'm
gonna go to Collection page,

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:29.420
and from here I'm going to
choose current project.

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:30.980
That's what we need to do here.

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:33.755
We can check this
checkbox open in new tab.

00:24:33.755 --> 00:24:35.180
I'm not gonna do that and

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:36.860
there is nothing
else we need to do.

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:40.460
Now, our cars are using
dynamic content and

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:44.300
if we make changes to our
CMS collection items,

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:46.220
the changes will be applied to

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:48.110
all these cards automatically.

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:51.215
That's amazing, but here we
have six different cards.

00:24:51.215 --> 00:24:53.240
We can filter our items.

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:54.005
How?

00:24:54.005 --> 00:24:57.440
If I select my collection
list wrapper and if I go to

00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:01.250
the elements settings right
next to the style panel,

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:03.965
we have different options
here we have filters,

00:25:03.965 --> 00:25:06.425
sort order, display limits.

00:25:06.425 --> 00:25:08.870
Alright, let's head over
to the display limits.

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:11.869
And here I am going
to check limit items.

00:25:11.869 --> 00:25:14.180
And then here I can
specify the number

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.445
of items that I'm
going to display here.

00:25:16.445 --> 00:25:18.155
So let's write three.

00:25:18.155 --> 00:25:20.674
Now we've got three items,

00:25:20.674 --> 00:25:24.035
but here we have crypto
pipe, purify orbits.

00:25:24.035 --> 00:25:25.400
But in our design we have

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.545
simplified dash Queen
Victoria thigh.

00:25:27.545 --> 00:25:30.455
So now we can use the
sort order option.

00:25:30.455 --> 00:25:32.465
If I click on this plus button,

00:25:32.465 --> 00:25:36.560
I can source my projects
based on the completion date,

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:37.955
based on the name,

00:25:37.955 --> 00:25:40.130
based on the created on date.

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:41.915
This is a field that's Webflow

00:25:41.915 --> 00:25:43.955
automatically creates for us.

00:25:43.955 --> 00:25:45.800
I'm going to choose
completion date.

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.780
And here I can
choose all less to

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:50.135
newest and newest to oldest.

00:25:50.135 --> 00:25:53.915
I'm going to hit all lists
to newest and hit Save.

00:25:53.915 --> 00:25:54.470
There we go.

00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:56.810
Now we have simplified dash coin

00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:59.870
and vector phi, just like that.

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:01.535
So now that you are ordered

00:26:01.535 --> 00:26:03.605
based on their completion date,

00:26:03.605 --> 00:26:05.000
what else should we do?

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.130
Well, here this collection lists

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:09.799
wrapper is outside
our container.

00:26:09.799 --> 00:26:12.530
That's why it's taking
up so much space.

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:15.410
Therefore, I'm gonna
go ahead and just drag

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:18.485
it and drop it inside
our container.

00:26:18.485 --> 00:26:21.170
And I'm going to remove the
projects wrapper that we

00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:23.900
created before, just like that.

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:25.460
Now why this collection,

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:27.050
this wrapper is selected?

00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:29.330
I'm gonna go ahead
and give it a class.

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:34.550
Let's write collection,
least rapper.

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:37.489
And I'm going to add
some top margins.

00:26:37.489 --> 00:26:41.705
Let's give it a 70 pixel top
margin and we're good to go.

00:26:41.705 --> 00:26:43.715
Can you see how
easy it is to use

00:26:43.715 --> 00:26:46.835
a CMS and collections
and collection lists.

00:26:46.835 --> 00:26:48.185
So from now on,

00:26:48.185 --> 00:26:49.925
these contents are dynamic.

00:26:49.925 --> 00:26:52.670
This webpage
references our content

00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:55.505
inside our collections
and collection items.

00:26:55.505 --> 00:26:58.820
So if I go to my
CMS and if I go to,

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:00.560
let's say simplify here,

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:03.695
and I decide to modify its
name to something else.

00:27:03.695 --> 00:27:07.070
Let's write simplify
plas and I save it.

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:10.595
Now this change affects
this card here as well,

00:27:10.595 --> 00:27:12.440
but I need to preview that here.

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:15.740
There we go. We've got our
new title or right guys,

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:17.300
that was a lot to digest.

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:19.385
So let's recap this lesson.

00:27:19.385 --> 00:27:21.635
First, we talked about the CMS.

00:27:21.635 --> 00:27:24.680
Cms is where you can
create some collections

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:28.715
and let's say create some
structures for your content.

00:27:28.715 --> 00:27:30.125
To create a collection,

00:27:30.125 --> 00:27:32.000
you need to create some fields.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.870
We created some custom
fields like project image,

00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:39.410
project type, completion
date, and project details.

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:43.009
Then we created
some project items.

00:27:43.009 --> 00:27:45.185
We added a collection list here,

00:27:45.185 --> 00:27:46.970
and we connected our collection,

00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:49.579
this wrapper to our
projects collection.

00:27:49.579 --> 00:27:50.810
Then we drag and drop

00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:54.335
our project card inside
this collection item.

00:27:54.335 --> 00:27:57.890
And finally, we selected all
our elements one by one,

00:27:57.890 --> 00:27:59.510
the image, the title,

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:01.160
the description, and the link.

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:02.660
And we connected them with

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:05.105
the appropriate field here, e.g.

00:28:05.105 --> 00:28:09.529
for this image, we chose
project image for this title,

00:28:09.529 --> 00:28:12.350
we chose project
name, as you can see.

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:15.740
And finally, we selected our
collection lists wrapper,

00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:18.440
and we went to the
elements settings.

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:20.825
And from here, we
limited the number of

00:28:20.825 --> 00:28:24.095
items that we wanted to
display here to three.

00:28:24.095 --> 00:28:27.650
And also we use the sort
order option to display

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:28.940
our content based on

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:32.315
the completion date and
from oldest to newest.

00:28:32.315 --> 00:28:33.785
Just like that.

00:28:33.785 --> 00:28:36.215
Alright guys, that's
all for this video.

00:28:36.215 --> 00:28:37.505
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:28:37.505 --> 00:28:39.260
In the next video, we will start

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:43.080
creating our project
page. So see you then.
