00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:09.210
Hey, now that we build
our website successfully,

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.165
it's time to make our
website responsive.

00:00:12.165 --> 00:00:13.500
We already talked about

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.170
the basics of
breakpoints and now it's

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.300
time to apply all
the things you've

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.520
learned before to our project.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.200
When it comes to responsiveness,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.210
we can choose two
different ways.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.590
We can go ahead and make

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.530
our website responsive
section by section.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:29.850
Or we could make

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.190
our website responsive
breakpoints by

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.979
breakpoint and both
ways are correct.

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:36.675
That's a matter of preference.

00:00:36.675 --> 00:00:38.950
That's up to you which
one you need to choose.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.285
So let me show you how it works.

00:00:41.285 --> 00:00:43.205
I'm going to start
with the first way,

00:00:43.205 --> 00:00:44.840
which is section by section.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.260
It means I need to go
ahead and make this navbar

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.475
responsive in all
breakpoints in tablet,

00:00:52.475 --> 00:00:55.055
mobile landscape,
and mobile portrait.

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:57.650
However, in the second
way, which is breakpoint.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.390
By breakpoint, we need to go to

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.640
the tablet breakpoint
and when to modify

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.710
all the sections
here until we are

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.285
satisfied with the results

00:01:05.285 --> 00:01:07.190
of these particular breakpoint.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.325
And then we will move on
to the next breakpoint.

00:01:10.325 --> 00:01:12.380
This is exactly what
we're gonna do.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.730
So first, we will go to

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.470
the tablet break point and we

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.570
will modify all
the elements here.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.805
Then we will go to
mobile landscape.

00:01:19.805 --> 00:01:23.525
And finally, we will go to
more wild portrait are right,

00:01:23.525 --> 00:01:25.190
but you are free
to choose between

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.050
those ways. Are right guys.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.625
That's all for this video.

00:01:28.625 --> 00:01:30.215
And we will start making

00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:32.885
our website responsive
in the next video.

00:01:32.885 --> 00:01:34.800
See you then.
