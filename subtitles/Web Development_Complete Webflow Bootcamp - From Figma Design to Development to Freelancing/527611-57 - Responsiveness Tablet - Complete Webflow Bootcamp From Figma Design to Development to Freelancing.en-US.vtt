00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.210
Our right. In this video,

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.375
we're going to start making
our website responsive.

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:10.725
As I mentioned before,

00:00:10.725 --> 00:00:14.250
we will go breakpoint by
breakpoint on all pages.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.820
Okay, we're gonna start with
tablet right now on desktop,

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.620
everything looks fine, but if

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.585
I go to the tablet break point,

00:00:21.585 --> 00:00:23.070
everything is messed up here.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.990
But don't worry, we're
going to fix that.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.270
We're going to start
with the navigation bar.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.125
As you can see here at the top,

00:00:29.125 --> 00:00:31.745
this navigation bar
has some problems.

00:00:31.745 --> 00:00:35.150
The way these elements are
aligned is wrong because on

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.085
tablet we don't need to get

00:00:37.085 --> 00:00:39.410
this Contact Us button anymore.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.670
We need to hide that.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.445
And also this
hamburger menu button

00:00:43.445 --> 00:00:45.725
should we place on
the right side?

00:00:45.725 --> 00:00:48.260
Here we have this
additional margin,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.835
this additional top margin.

00:00:49.835 --> 00:00:51.410
So let's go ahead and fix that.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.405
First of all, I'm going
to double-click on it

00:00:53.405 --> 00:00:55.520
because in order to
change this symbol,

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.235
we need to go into
the master single.

00:00:58.235 --> 00:01:00.980
Alright, so let's start
by hiding this button.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.180
I'm going to select it.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.000
And if you remember, when
you want to hide an element,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.520
you can head over to
the layout display

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.435
setting and you can change it
to display setting to none.

00:01:11.435 --> 00:01:13.055
There we go. It's hidden now,

00:01:13.055 --> 00:01:16.805
but here this logo is touching
the edge of our viewport,

00:01:16.805 --> 00:01:18.965
which is not exactly
what we want.

00:01:18.965 --> 00:01:20.975
So I'm going to select
this container,

00:01:20.975 --> 00:01:23.240
the container
inside our nav bar.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.225
And as you can see, the
padding is set to zero.

00:01:26.225 --> 00:01:28.490
I'm gonna go ahead and hold
down the option key on

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.710
my keyboard or Alt key and click

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.350
and drag and add 30 pixels

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.215
left and right padding
simultaneously.

00:01:36.215 --> 00:01:37.655
Now it looks much better.

00:01:37.655 --> 00:01:39.620
But what about this top margin?

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:40.835
As you can see here,

00:01:40.835 --> 00:01:43.475
we have 70 pixels top margin,

00:01:43.475 --> 00:01:45.005
and I'm going to select it,

00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:46.805
and then I'm going
to set it to zero.

00:01:46.805 --> 00:01:48.695
There we go. Because on tablet

00:01:48.695 --> 00:01:50.810
we don't need that
additional margin.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.910
Remember the changes I make here

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.295
will affect breakpoints as well.

00:01:55.295 --> 00:01:57.230
So later when we move on to

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.630
mobile landscape and
mobile portrait,

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.480
it would be much easier
to change the layout for

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.190
those breakpoints are rights

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.335
since we are satisfied
with the result,

00:02:06.335 --> 00:02:08.870
we can click on this
back to Instance

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.375
button and we can move
on to the next section,

00:02:11.375 --> 00:02:13.400
which is our hero section.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.805
Our hero section is
completely disorganized here.

00:02:16.805 --> 00:02:17.450
Why?

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.480
Because if you remember,
for this container,

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.770
we set the direction of the
flux spikes to horizontal.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.320
That made sense for the
desktop break point,

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.945
but for the tablets and
smaller breakpoints,

00:02:29.945 --> 00:02:31.880
it would make much more sense to

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.085
change the direction
to vertical.

00:02:34.085 --> 00:02:36.470
I'm going to select
this container here.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.360
And I'm going to
modify the direction

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.265
to vertical are right,

00:02:40.265 --> 00:02:42.335
it already looks
much better now.

00:02:42.335 --> 00:02:45.695
Then I'm going to align
everything to the center here.

00:02:45.695 --> 00:02:46.925
Alright, cool.

00:02:46.925 --> 00:02:48.560
Now it's time to select

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.615
our heading and then
I'm going to change

00:02:50.615 --> 00:02:54.590
its topography alignment
from left to center.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.545
I'm going to align all these
texts layers to the center.

00:02:57.545 --> 00:02:59.795
I'm going to select
this hero description

00:02:59.795 --> 00:03:01.835
and I'm going to do
the same thing here,

00:03:01.835 --> 00:03:03.875
but their alignment
doesn't look good.

00:03:03.875 --> 00:03:04.565
Why?

00:03:04.565 --> 00:03:06.440
Because if I select this hero

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.830
content div blog
and I scroll up,

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.665
I can open up this
alignments and order here.

00:03:12.665 --> 00:03:16.250
And here I can modify the
alignments of the flux child.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.640
In this case, this hero
content div block is

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.860
the flux child of this container

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.830
because our container
is a Flexbox,

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.395
this hero content is its child.

00:03:27.395 --> 00:03:30.574
So I'm going to change
its alignment to center.

00:03:30.574 --> 00:03:31.910
And then I'm going to change

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.135
the maximum width of
this hero content.

00:03:35.135 --> 00:03:37.700
Right now, the maximum
width of this hero

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.360
content div block is
set to 530 pixels.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.020
That's fine.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.705
However, since we
changed the direction of

00:03:44.705 --> 00:03:47.780
our Flexbox from
horizontal to vertical,

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.820
it would make much more sense

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.845
to increase the
maximum width here,

00:03:51.845 --> 00:03:54.395
since we are aligning
everything vertically now,

00:03:54.395 --> 00:03:58.595
I am going to change the
maximum width from 530 pixels.

00:03:58.595 --> 00:04:01.595
700 pixels are right, Nice.

00:04:01.595 --> 00:04:04.370
And then I'm going to select
this hero description.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:05.810
And I'm going to
do the same thing

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.655
for this text block as well.

00:04:07.655 --> 00:04:12.035
I'm going to increase its
maximum width to 600 pixels,

00:04:12.035 --> 00:04:13.985
but it's not aligned
to the center.

00:04:13.985 --> 00:04:15.365
So how can I fix that?

00:04:15.365 --> 00:04:19.010
Well, I can simply select
this hero content of luck

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.970
and I can change its
display setting to Flexbox,

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.210
and then I can change its
direction to vertical.

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.715
And finally, align
everything to the center,

00:04:28.715 --> 00:04:32.270
just like that are
right So far so good.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.435
Now it's time to go to our
hero buttons live life,

00:04:35.435 --> 00:04:36.620
as you can see are getting

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.215
touch button disappeared.
Why is that?

00:04:39.215 --> 00:04:41.600
That's because when
we change the display

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.735
setting of our button
in the navigation bar,

00:04:44.735 --> 00:04:46.655
we forgot to add a combo class.

00:04:46.655 --> 00:04:48.020
Let me show you if I go to

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.975
nav bar and if I select
this primary button,

00:04:50.975 --> 00:04:54.230
you can see that this
button has only one class.

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.055
This is the primary button
base class and are getting

00:04:58.055 --> 00:05:02.825
touch button here has also
this primary button class.

00:05:02.825 --> 00:05:05.660
Let me go to this div
black. There we go.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.580
If I select it in the navigator,

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.430
you can see that the base
class is primary button,

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.305
and here we have a combo class.

00:05:12.305 --> 00:05:14.495
Therefore, I have two
ways to fix this.

00:05:14.495 --> 00:05:16.310
I can either
override the display

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.200
setting here or I can go

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.205
ahead and add a combo class
to the button in our navbar,

00:05:22.205 --> 00:05:23.900
I think it would
be much easier to

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.855
override the display
setting to black here.

00:05:26.855 --> 00:05:29.525
Since we have this
hero combo class,

00:05:29.525 --> 00:05:31.880
I'm going to set it to
black, and there it is.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.320
It appears again, but

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.410
these buttons should sit
next to each other, okay.

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.585
They shouldn't snack
on top of each other.

00:05:38.585 --> 00:05:41.930
I'm going to select this
hero buttons diblock,

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.855
and then I'm going to change
its display setting to

00:05:44.855 --> 00:05:47.945
Flexbox and the direction
is set to horizontal.

00:05:47.945 --> 00:05:49.370
All right, Nice.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.515
Our buttons look great as well.

00:05:51.515 --> 00:05:52.910
Here as you can see, we have

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.775
so much top margins and
that's not what we want.

00:05:55.775 --> 00:05:58.085
So if I select
this hero content,

00:05:58.085 --> 00:05:59.915
you can see that
by default it has

00:05:59.915 --> 00:06:02.675
a 114 pixel top margin.

00:06:02.675 --> 00:06:06.695
This is the margin that we set
in the desktop breakpoint.

00:06:06.695 --> 00:06:09.095
I'm going to overwrite
that to zero now,

00:06:09.095 --> 00:06:11.750
but still we have so
much empty space here.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.655
So I'm going to
select my section.

00:06:13.655 --> 00:06:17.030
And here the top margin
is set to 100 pixels.

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.549
I'm going to change it to 50.

00:06:19.549 --> 00:06:21.575
Now everything looks great.

00:06:21.575 --> 00:06:23.315
But what about the
image section?

00:06:23.315 --> 00:06:24.770
As you can see this image,

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.345
it looks so big.

00:06:26.345 --> 00:06:28.235
So let's go ahead and fix that.

00:06:28.235 --> 00:06:30.935
So let me select this
hero image, the block,

00:06:30.935 --> 00:06:32.660
and I'm going to go inside and

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.655
let me choose this main image.

00:06:34.655 --> 00:06:37.445
And as you can see, we
didn't give it any class.

00:06:37.445 --> 00:06:39.410
So I'm gonna go ahead
and give it a class.

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.200
Now, let's write
hero underscore,

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.875
underscore image,
underscore, underscore main.

00:06:45.875 --> 00:06:47.450
And I can double-click on it.

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:50.240
And as you can see, the
width is set to auto.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.250
I'm gonna decrease
it to something

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:57.455
around 500 and maybe 60 or
70 pixels are right, nice.

00:06:57.455 --> 00:06:59.525
You can try different
numbers here.

00:06:59.525 --> 00:07:01.805
If you don't have
a specific number,

00:07:01.805 --> 00:07:04.280
see whether it
looks fine or not.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.675
Now it looks much better.

00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:07.670
These cards are too big as well.

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.935
So I'm going to select
this Hero Card one,

00:07:09.935 --> 00:07:11.750
and I'm going to scale it down a

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.655
little bit just like that.

00:07:13.655 --> 00:07:17.360
So here the width is 328 pixels.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.995
For this one, I'm going
to set it to 328 as well.

00:07:21.995 --> 00:07:23.120
Okay, Nice.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.230
But as you can see here,

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.240
we don't have enough
space between

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.745
our buttons and our images.

00:07:28.745 --> 00:07:29.930
Well, I'm going to select

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:33.275
this hero image and I'm going
to give it some top margin.

00:07:33.275 --> 00:07:36.335
So let me increase
the top margin to

00:07:36.335 --> 00:07:39.530
around for the pixels are right.

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.915
Our hero section
looks great now.

00:07:41.915 --> 00:07:44.150
Now we can move on
to the next section.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:45.635
So if I select this grid,

00:07:45.635 --> 00:07:49.235
you can see that on tablet
we don't have so much space.

00:07:49.235 --> 00:07:51.620
Therefore, we can remove one of

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:53.150
these logos when we go to

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:55.445
the tablet or
smaller breakpoints,

00:07:55.445 --> 00:07:56.705
how can we do that?

00:07:56.705 --> 00:07:57.965
That's so simple.

00:07:57.965 --> 00:08:01.955
I can simply select this
Amazon diblock, the last logo.

00:08:01.955 --> 00:08:03.815
And I'm going to give
it a combo class

00:08:03.815 --> 00:08:05.105
because we're going to change

00:08:05.105 --> 00:08:06.860
its display setting to none

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.305
and we're not going to
affect other logos.

00:08:09.305 --> 00:08:11.465
So let's write Amazon here.

00:08:11.465 --> 00:08:13.880
And then I'm going to
change its display

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.715
setting from flex to none.

00:08:16.715 --> 00:08:18.335
There we go, disappeared,

00:08:18.335 --> 00:08:20.555
but here we have so much space.

00:08:20.555 --> 00:08:22.670
So wouldn't it be
better if we could have

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:24.860
two lines of logo
instead of one line?

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:27.710
I think so. I'm going
to edit this grid.

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:30.260
If I select this grid logos,

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.230
and if I click on this
pink button here,

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:35.510
I can simply add
one more row and

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:37.760
I can remove some
of these columns.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.385
Okay? So let me
remove these columns.

00:08:40.385 --> 00:08:42.605
And now I have a
two-by-two grid.

00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:44.960
Then I'm going to
change the gap here for

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.885
the column to 40
pixels are right.

00:08:47.885 --> 00:08:49.010
Let me hit done.

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:50.600
They look fine but they are not

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.400
centered, as you can see here.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.700
They are aligned to the
left side of their cells.

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.395
So how can we fix that?

00:08:57.395 --> 00:08:59.675
While this greed
logos is selected,

00:08:59.675 --> 00:09:02.540
I can change its
alignment to center.

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.010
Here, center as well.

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:05.450
Nowadays, look amazing.

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:08.345
Alright, our clients
section is ready as well.

00:09:08.345 --> 00:09:10.550
Now we can move on
to the next section.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.850
Okay, so here we have the
recent project section,

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:16.445
and I think we don't need
to modify anything here.

00:09:16.445 --> 00:09:18.050
Let me change the dimension of

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:19.730
the screen to see

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:21.995
whether we need to
change anything or not.

00:09:21.995 --> 00:09:25.640
If I grab this handle here
on the right side and

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:29.510
I drag in terms of
fluidity, they look fine.

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:31.010
But here we have a problem.

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:33.275
As you can see, these
Learn More button,

00:09:33.275 --> 00:09:34.610
move down a little bit.

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:37.220
And that's because this
project description

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.199
has some bottom margins.

00:09:39.199 --> 00:09:41.420
I'm going to select it
and I'm going to decrease

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:44.180
this margin from
40% to maybe ten.

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:47.045
And now it looks much
better. There we go.

00:09:47.045 --> 00:09:50.030
Okay, now we can go
to the other section,

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:51.920
which is the
testimonial section.

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.735
So what should we do here?

00:09:53.735 --> 00:09:56.975
Well first, we need to
decrease its top margin.

00:09:56.975 --> 00:09:59.180
So I'm going to select
this section and

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:01.490
I'm going to decrease
its top margin from

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:04.504
200 pixels to 100 pixels

00:10:04.504 --> 00:10:06.890
because it's too
much now are right,

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:08.600
it looks much better
than I'm going to

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.610
select this testimonial heading.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.620
And I'm going to set
the maximum width for

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:15.215
that to have a two
line texts here.

00:10:15.215 --> 00:10:17.420
I'm going to write 400 pixels.

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:18.410
There we go.

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:20.120
Then I'm going to modify it,

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.970
takes alignments here
to center and let me

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:26.825
increase the line
height to 150 per cent.

00:10:26.825 --> 00:10:28.715
And the next thing
we need to fix here

00:10:28.715 --> 00:10:30.605
is our orbits background.

00:10:30.605 --> 00:10:33.065
As you can see, our
orbit has been repeated.

00:10:33.065 --> 00:10:35.510
So I'm going to select
my section and I'm

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.925
going to head over to
the backgrounds here.

00:10:37.925 --> 00:10:40.025
And if I click on
this orbit image

00:10:40.025 --> 00:10:41.690
from here you can see that

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:44.015
the position is set to top-left

00:10:44.015 --> 00:10:46.565
and the tile option is enabled.

00:10:46.565 --> 00:10:49.070
So I am going to set the
tile to downtime and

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:51.650
then I'm going to
reposition it to center.

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:53.585
And finally, I'm going to change

00:10:53.585 --> 00:10:56.525
its size to cover
instead of contain.

00:10:56.525 --> 00:10:57.770
Now it looks great.

00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:59.690
Alright, the next thing
I'm going to modify

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:02.165
here is the size
of these emojis.

00:11:02.165 --> 00:11:03.605
If I select them here,

00:11:03.605 --> 00:11:05.960
you can see that its width
and height are set to

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:10.430
150 pixels since we have
less space on a tablet,

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:16.175
I'm gonna go ahead and decrease
it to 130 by 130 pixels.

00:11:16.175 --> 00:11:19.505
Since these emojis have
their own combo classes,

00:11:19.505 --> 00:11:21.620
the changes I make
to this first memo

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:24.080
G don't apply to
other emojis here.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.490
So we can either go ahead and

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:27.965
modify the size of each memo G,

00:11:27.965 --> 00:11:30.845
or I could just undo
this operation,

00:11:30.845 --> 00:11:34.820
it Command Z or Control Z. I
can remove this combo class.

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:37.295
It has been moved down,
that's totally fine.

00:11:37.295 --> 00:11:40.025
Then I can decrease
its width and height,

00:11:40.025 --> 00:11:44.180
130 by 130 pixels.

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:47.180
And again, I'm going to
add its combo class to it.

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:47.780
One.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:48.440
There we go.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:52.205
Alright, our testimonial
section is done as well.

00:11:52.205 --> 00:11:55.280
Now, let's move on to
the Services section.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.650
I think everything
looks fine here,

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:59.090
but there is a problem.

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:01.565
If I just decrease
this dimension,

00:12:01.565 --> 00:12:05.210
you can see that this Learn
More button move down and

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:06.830
it's not aligned with other

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:09.170
learn more buttons.
That's the problem.

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:10.850
So how can we fix that?

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:12.410
I'm going to select this project

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:13.940
description and I'm going to

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:17.810
increase its bottom
margin from ten to,

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:20.735
let's say, 50 pixels, right?

00:12:20.735 --> 00:12:22.040
And then I'm going to select

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:24.050
the service content div block.

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:25.909
It's the block that contains

00:12:25.909 --> 00:12:28.610
the service text
and this button,

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:29.735
as you can see here.

00:12:29.735 --> 00:12:31.970
And I'm going to set a
specific high to that,

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:33.935
okay, right now
it's set to auto.

00:12:33.935 --> 00:12:37.250
I'm going to set it to
100% that it takes up

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:41.250
the whole available height
of my card. Just like that.

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:42.620
Now, it's fixed.

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:43.745
Alright, let me check it.

00:12:43.745 --> 00:12:44.660
Once again.

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:46.265
Everything looks perfect now.

00:12:46.265 --> 00:12:47.195
Okay, cool.

00:12:47.195 --> 00:12:50.405
Now let's move on to the next
section, which is our CTA.

00:12:50.405 --> 00:12:53.375
As you can see, our button
disappeared here again,

00:12:53.375 --> 00:12:55.100
this is the same problem that

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:57.020
we had with this button here,

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:58.460
with this get in touch button.

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:02.225
So we need to just override
its display setting to block.

00:13:02.225 --> 00:13:05.135
So I'm going to double-click
on the CTA section.

00:13:05.135 --> 00:13:08.000
And if I go to the
container and I look

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.390
for my button inside
the form here,

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:14.420
I can select it and I can
overwrite it to block,

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:16.265
and there is nothing
else we need to do.

00:13:16.265 --> 00:13:19.280
Everything looks great,
but what about the footer?

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.870
So let me check.

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:22.745
The footer looks nice as well.

00:13:22.745 --> 00:13:24.830
The only thing I'm
gonna do is decrease

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:27.650
its top margin because here
we have too much space,

00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:29.270
so I'm going to
double-click on it.

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:30.860
And here, as you can see,

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.785
it has a 200 pixel top margin,

00:13:33.785 --> 00:13:36.875
so I can decrease
it to 100 pixels.

00:13:36.875 --> 00:13:38.435
Now, it looks much better.

00:13:38.435 --> 00:13:41.420
I'm gonna do the same
thing for the CTA section.

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:43.010
If I double-click on it,

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:46.025
you can see it's top
margin is set to 200.

00:13:46.025 --> 00:13:47.750
I'm going to set it to 100

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:50.075
here to have a
consistent spacing.

00:13:50.075 --> 00:13:50.855
What about this?

00:13:50.855 --> 00:13:53.690
Our services here, the
same thing here as well.

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:56.210
However here I don't
have any combo class,

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:58.175
so I'm going to add
a combo class here.

00:13:58.175 --> 00:14:01.385
I'm going to write our services.

00:14:01.385 --> 00:14:04.760
Then I'm going to
decrease its top margin.

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.760
200-100 pixels are right,

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.245
it looks much better now.

00:14:09.245 --> 00:14:10.400
But here as you can see,

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.020
we still have the problem with

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.745
this Learn More button here.

00:14:13.745 --> 00:14:15.800
If I select this
project description,

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:19.100
you can see that it's
bottom margin is set to 50.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:23.165
It's too much. So I'm going
to decrease it to ten pixels.

00:14:23.165 --> 00:14:25.430
And now the problem is solved.

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:28.610
The last thing I'm gonna do
here is select this section,

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:30.425
this recent projects section,

00:14:30.425 --> 00:14:35.645
and I'm going to decrease its
top margin, 200-100 pixels.

00:14:35.645 --> 00:14:38.015
And now everything looks great.

00:14:38.015 --> 00:14:40.565
So let's go ahead and
check everything out.

00:14:40.565 --> 00:14:42.215
Our navbar looks fine.

00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:44.105
I'm going to check its fluidity.

00:14:44.105 --> 00:14:46.070
Our hero section looks fine.

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:49.475
I'm going to scroll down our
logo section looks fine.

00:14:49.475 --> 00:14:53.345
The recent projects, the
testimonial section.

00:14:53.345 --> 00:14:55.505
Then we have our services,

00:14:55.505 --> 00:14:58.190
the CTA section, and our footer.

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:00.365
Everything looks great, right.

00:15:00.365 --> 00:15:01.550
Our homepage is done,

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:03.440
but what about other pages?

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.375
Now it's time to
go ahead and make

00:15:05.375 --> 00:15:07.685
our other pages
responsive as well,

00:15:07.685 --> 00:15:10.460
like contact us and
the project page.

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:12.440
So let me go to the pages.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:15.740
And from here I'm gonna go
to the Contact Us page.

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:18.530
And as you can see, it
already looks good.

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:19.685
Why is that?

00:15:19.685 --> 00:15:21.890
That's because we
use a grid here.

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:23.630
When you use grids instead of

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:26.615
Flexbox is it's
responsive by default.

00:15:26.615 --> 00:15:30.290
As you can see, it's fluid
and everything looks great,

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:33.065
so we don't need to change
the layout entirely.

00:15:33.065 --> 00:15:34.805
The only thing we
need to do here

00:15:34.805 --> 00:15:37.115
is to select your
button and just

00:15:37.115 --> 00:15:39.290
override that display setting

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:42.380
from none to block,
just like that.

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:46.475
And now you can see that
it looks great, nice.

00:15:46.475 --> 00:15:47.780
If I preview that.

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:51.035
One more thing I noticed
here is this top margin.

00:15:51.035 --> 00:15:53.795
We have so much space
here at the top.

00:15:53.795 --> 00:15:56.405
So I'm gonna go ahead
and quickly fix that.

00:15:56.405 --> 00:15:58.865
If I select this section,

00:15:58.865 --> 00:16:02.480
you can see that it has
a 200 pixel top margin.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:05.345
So I'm gonna decrease
it to 100 pixels.

00:16:05.345 --> 00:16:06.170
And there we go.

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:09.770
Our Contact Us page is
responsive as well.

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:13.370
Now let's go ahead and
check our project page.

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:15.410
If I go to the CMS
collection page

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:17.540
and if I go to the
project page here,

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:20.435
I can check whether
everything looks fine or not.

00:16:20.435 --> 00:16:24.350
Alright, let me decrease the
dimension so far, so good.

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:26.555
We don't need to
modify the top part.

00:16:26.555 --> 00:16:27.695
What about here?

00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:29.030
Well, I think we can increase

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:30.890
the font size of
this reach takes,

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:33.110
but not only for the tablet,

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:35.465
we can increase it for
the desktop as well.

00:16:35.465 --> 00:16:38.375
So I'm gonna go to the desktop
breakpoint for a second.

00:16:38.375 --> 00:16:40.010
And while it's selected,

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:43.145
I'm going to increase
it to 20 pixels.

00:16:43.145 --> 00:16:45.230
And then I'm going to increase

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:48.920
the line height to 150 per cent.

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.705
Okay, it looks much better

00:16:50.705 --> 00:16:52.775
before gut to
increase it before,

00:16:52.775 --> 00:16:54.335
and now it's fixed.

00:16:54.335 --> 00:16:57.515
Let me see if I need to
change anything else here.

00:16:57.515 --> 00:16:58.880
It looks fine.

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.610
What about these
other projects card?

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:04.190
Let me see. No, they look great.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:06.110
What about the CTA section?

00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:07.610
It looks great as well.

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:09.860
The footer looks fine as well.

00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:12.440
So I don't need to
modify anything else.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:15.605
That's the beauty of creating
websites with Webflow,

00:17:15.605 --> 00:17:17.900
most things are
responsive by default,

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:19.010
so we don't need to make

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:21.320
so many different
changes are right guys,

00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:23.465
that's all for the
tablet breakpoint.

00:17:23.465 --> 00:17:26.255
We successfully
modified our Homepage,

00:17:26.255 --> 00:17:29.165
Contact Us page and
the project page.

00:17:29.165 --> 00:17:32.330
Now it's time to move on
to the mobile landscape.

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:34.805
And this is the task
for our next lesson.

00:17:34.805 --> 00:17:37.770
So see you in the next video.
