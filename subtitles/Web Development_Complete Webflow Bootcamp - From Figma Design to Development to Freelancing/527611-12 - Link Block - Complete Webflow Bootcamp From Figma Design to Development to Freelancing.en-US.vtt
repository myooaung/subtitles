00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.630
What is a link black?

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.900
Well, a link blog is a
clickable container,

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.480
so any content that
you put inside

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.255
the link black will
become clickable.

00:00:15.255 --> 00:00:16.800
It's very useful because

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.605
sometimes we might
need to redirect

00:00:19.605 --> 00:00:23.985
users to another page or
another section of our website,

00:00:23.985 --> 00:00:25.935
or even to another website.

00:00:25.935 --> 00:00:29.130
And we can do so by
using a link blog.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.065
If you go to the Add
section under the basic,

00:00:33.065 --> 00:00:35.420
you can see that we
have this link block.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.650
Let me drag and drop

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.770
a link plug right
into this container.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.125
And as you can see,
it's just a div blood.

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:43.985
However, it's clickable and

00:00:43.985 --> 00:00:47.075
this link block
has some settings.

00:00:47.075 --> 00:00:50.150
So by default, you
can see the URL here.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.400
You can specify the
URL that you want to

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.550
redirect the user to, e.g.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.085
here I can write google.com.

00:00:58.085 --> 00:01:00.590
I can go to the page when we

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.845
create more pages for
our website, e.g.

00:01:03.845 --> 00:01:07.115
contact page,
registration page, etc.

00:01:07.115 --> 00:01:09.830
We can choose our
page here when we

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.920
create different
sections in our website,

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.820
we can use this
page, section, e.g.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.875
when we create a nav war,

00:01:18.875 --> 00:01:21.305
we may have some menus.

00:01:21.305 --> 00:01:24.560
And when the user clicks
on one of those menus,

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.180
the user should be taken to

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.555
a specific section
of our landing page.

00:01:29.555 --> 00:01:31.445
We can choose a section here.

00:01:31.445 --> 00:01:33.380
We will talk about
all these settings

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.035
later when we actually
start using them,

00:01:36.035 --> 00:01:38.075
you can set an email address,

00:01:38.075 --> 00:01:39.980
the subject of that e-mail.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.720
You can set a phone number.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.065
And finally, you can even
choose an attachment.

00:01:45.065 --> 00:01:46.400
You need to remember
that you can

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.395
use a link blog for anything.

00:01:48.395 --> 00:01:49.970
You can use it for cards,

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.560
you can use it for a specific
element, an icon, anything.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.380
So let me go ahead
and add a heading

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.590
inside here just to
show you how it works.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.020
And as you can see,
as soon as I add the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.245
heading here into
this link block,

00:02:06.245 --> 00:02:10.325
its style has been changed
because now it's a link.

00:02:10.325 --> 00:02:14.885
I can go ahead and manually
override these settings, e.g.

00:02:14.885 --> 00:02:18.425
under the typography
section on the side panel,

00:02:18.425 --> 00:02:21.845
I can set its
declaration to non,

00:02:21.845 --> 00:02:25.370
and let me modify its color
to white, just like that.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.379
And if I preview our project,

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:29.000
now you can see that as soon as

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.995
I hover over this heading,

00:02:30.995 --> 00:02:33.800
the cursor has been
changed to a pointer.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.630
Now, if you can't
see the pointer,

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.150
probably it's because
of your browser.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.280
You can clear your
browser's cache,

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.310
or you could try it out
on another browser.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.620
But a link block automatically

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.830
changes your cursor
to a pointer.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:49.970
And if I click on that,

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.590
nothing happens because we

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.645
didn't specify a link for that.

00:02:53.645 --> 00:02:59.090
If I select this link block
and modify the URL, e.g.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.300
let's set it to google.com.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.545
Now, if I preview that
and if I click on it,

00:03:06.545 --> 00:03:08.750
I will be redirected to Google.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.085
So in a nutshell,

00:03:10.085 --> 00:03:13.610
a link block is a
clickable diblock.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.190
Well, there are times
that we want to convert

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.085
our div blocks into a link blog.

00:03:19.085 --> 00:03:22.730
Instead of creating a link
blog from scratch, Of course,

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.410
we can go ahead
and drag and drop

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.255
a link blog here and add

00:03:26.255 --> 00:03:29.915
a div block inside and design
our cards and elements.

00:03:29.915 --> 00:03:32.360
But sometimes we might

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.185
design our card or
our elements first,

00:03:36.185 --> 00:03:40.580
and then we might need to
convert it to a link blog.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:41.645
How can we do that?

00:03:41.645 --> 00:03:44.150
If we select our div block, e.g.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.265
here, this card, and if you

00:03:46.265 --> 00:03:49.940
right-click on its name
right on the canvas,

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.679
we have many options.

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:54.605
The second one says
Convert to link block.

00:03:54.605 --> 00:03:56.375
If I click on it, there we go.

00:03:56.375 --> 00:03:59.570
Now this tiling of
these elements,

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.550
the child elements has been

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.665
changed because now it's a link.

00:04:03.665 --> 00:04:06.230
Of course, I can go ahead
and override these settings,

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.460
but I'm not going to do

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:08.990
that because I just
want to show you

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.010
how the link block works
if I preview my project,

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.870
now you can see
that this card is

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.850
clickable just like that.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.935
However, the other cards or not,

00:04:18.935 --> 00:04:24.030
because the other cars are
just simple div blocks.
