00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.735
Hey, in this video,

00:00:06.735 --> 00:00:09.255
I'm gonna be talking
about project hand-off.

00:00:09.255 --> 00:00:12.105
When it's time to deliver
the project to the client,

00:00:12.105 --> 00:00:14.595
you can choose one of
the following options.

00:00:14.595 --> 00:00:16.365
Number one, host the project

00:00:16.365 --> 00:00:18.150
on your Webflow account and add

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.700
the hosting cost to
your invoice number

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.775
to create a workflow
accounts for the client,

00:00:23.775 --> 00:00:26.115
transfer the project
to their account,

00:00:26.115 --> 00:00:28.755
and add a hosting
plan to the project.

00:00:28.755 --> 00:00:30.510
So what's the difference
between them?

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.130
Which one should you choose and

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.335
which one do I
personally choose?

00:00:34.335 --> 00:00:36.795
Well, the first option
works like this.

00:00:36.795 --> 00:00:40.185
You add a hosting plan to the
project and you publish it.

00:00:40.185 --> 00:00:42.235
You are done except you aren't.

00:00:42.235 --> 00:00:43.430
Because now every time

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.980
the client wants to
modify something,

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.485
they should reach out to
you and you should do it

00:00:48.485 --> 00:00:51.035
either for free or
as a paid service.

00:00:51.035 --> 00:00:52.415
When you choose this way,

00:00:52.415 --> 00:00:54.740
you can use the Webflow
billing option.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.975
What is it and how does it work?

00:00:56.975 --> 00:00:59.720
Let's suppose you choose
the CMS plan and it

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.870
cost $192 per year,

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.850
but you can charge
your clients more for

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.055
hosting using the
billing option,

00:01:07.055 --> 00:01:09.800
you can set your hosting
price and Webflow

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.545
issues an invoice for
them on your behalf.

00:01:12.545 --> 00:01:16.340
Let's say you charge $250
per year for hosting.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.950
Web flow receives this
money and sends you

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.860
the additional $58 you charge.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.935
So this way, you can earn
some additional money.

00:01:24.935 --> 00:01:27.125
Now let's talk about
the second option.

00:01:27.125 --> 00:01:29.000
It's pretty straightforward.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.255
You transfer the project to
the client's account and

00:01:32.255 --> 00:01:35.525
add a hosting plan to the
project on their account.

00:01:35.525 --> 00:01:37.760
This way, they can easily modify

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.010
their website's content
and they shouldn't

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.410
rely on you or any
other designer.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:43.970
But keep in mind that once you

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.385
transfer the project
to their account,

00:01:46.385 --> 00:01:49.790
you can get access to it
in your account so you can

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.320
duplicate it before you

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.735
transfer the project
for your reference,

00:01:53.735 --> 00:01:56.795
I personally prefer the
second way because first,

00:01:56.795 --> 00:01:59.825
I wouldn't say I like to
charge a client for hosting.

00:01:59.825 --> 00:02:01.370
Second, I don't want to be

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.069
responsible for the
maintenance of their website.

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:06.050
And third, I don't
need to manage

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.090
the payments and yearly billing.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.024
Once you publish the project,

00:02:10.024 --> 00:02:12.005
it's time for your
training session.

00:02:12.005 --> 00:02:13.640
You can have a 30 minute meeting

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.410
with a client and explain

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.870
how Webflow works
and how they can use

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.900
the editor to modify the
contents by themselves.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.230
I personally asked them not
to make any changes using

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.270
the designer because
they may mess

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.700
up with something and
break the whole website.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.490
Always ask them to use
the editor instead.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.770
If they want to add
some collection items,

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.840
they can do it in the editor to,

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.020
since you should repeat
this step for each project,

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.720
I suggest you record
a training video,

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.889
explain everything once, and
send it to all your clients.

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:47.735
If your clients need more help,

00:02:47.735 --> 00:02:51.300
you can set up a meeting
and give them a hand.
