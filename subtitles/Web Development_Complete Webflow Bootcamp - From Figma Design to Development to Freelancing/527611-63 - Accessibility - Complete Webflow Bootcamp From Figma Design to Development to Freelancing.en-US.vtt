00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.935
Hey, in this video
we're gonna talk about

00:00:07.935 --> 00:00:11.475
accessibility as a web
designer and web developer,

00:00:11.475 --> 00:00:13.575
we always need to make sure that

00:00:13.575 --> 00:00:16.785
our website is
accessible to everyone.

00:00:16.785 --> 00:00:20.640
No matter if someone is blind
or has visual impairments,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.725
he or she should be able to use

00:00:22.725 --> 00:00:25.530
our website conveniently
and easily.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.380
But how can we make our
website more accessible?

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.745
Well, in this video,

00:00:29.745 --> 00:00:31.995
you're going to learn
some important points

00:00:31.995 --> 00:00:33.510
about accessibility.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.990
And you will learn some
techniques to make

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.810
your design more
accessible. Are you ready?

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:39.695
Let's begin.

00:00:39.695 --> 00:00:41.300
When you design your website,

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.430
you need to make
sure that you check

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.725
the contrast ratio
of your colors.

00:00:45.725 --> 00:00:48.560
Because some people
have visual impairments

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.725
and they may not process
the colors the way we do.

00:00:51.725 --> 00:00:53.540
Therefore, it's important to

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.565
make sure that our colors have

00:00:55.565 --> 00:00:59.450
enough contrast and they pass
the contrast ratio test.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.550
We usually check the
contrast ratio of

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.150
our colors when we are
designing the user interface.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.530
But as a web developer,

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.710
it's worth to check the
contrast ratio of your colors

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.160
when the development of your
project is done as well.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.780
So how can you do that?

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.325
We already talked about it,

00:01:16.325 --> 00:01:18.965
but I'm going to mention
it once again quickly.

00:01:18.965 --> 00:01:19.565
Here.

00:01:19.565 --> 00:01:22.250
If I select this
text, this heading,

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.695
and if I head over to
the typography section,

00:01:24.695 --> 00:01:26.105
I'm going to click on color.

00:01:26.105 --> 00:01:29.555
Here we have this section
that says contrast ratio,

00:01:29.555 --> 00:01:31.160
and there is a
question mark here.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.770
If I click on it, you
can see it says contrast

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.905
ratio impacts your
site's accessibility.

00:01:36.905 --> 00:01:39.170
Sufficient contrast
ratio depends on

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.630
foreground and
background colors,

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.865
font size and font weight.

00:01:43.865 --> 00:01:45.530
That's absolutely true.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.710
So basically what we
are interested in is

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.795
the color of our foreground

00:01:50.795 --> 00:01:53.105
and the color of our background.

00:01:53.105 --> 00:01:54.410
So in this case,

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.250
the color of this text
is our foreground color,

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.325
and this light blue color
is our background color.

00:02:01.325 --> 00:02:02.450
And here as you can see,

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.415
we've got the triple a grade,

00:02:04.415 --> 00:02:07.220
and it means we have the
highest contrast ratio,

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.405
which is amazing.

00:02:08.405 --> 00:02:10.925
So always aim for the AAA,

00:02:10.925 --> 00:02:13.985
but sometimes you may get
the double a as well.

00:02:13.985 --> 00:02:15.680
That's acceptable as well.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.940
Let me show you an example.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.700
If I try to modify this
color, there we go.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.639
Now I have the WA,
it's still readable,

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:25.700
but the contrast ratio is not
that much as you can see.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.365
It's four to one.

00:02:27.365 --> 00:02:30.995
So I'm going to undo the
process Command Z or Control Z.

00:02:30.995 --> 00:02:33.979
So when you finished the
development of your project,

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:37.205
you need to go ahead and check
all your colors one-by-one

00:02:37.205 --> 00:02:40.490
and see if you pass the
contrast ratio test,

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.030
okay, if you see
this triple a or WA,

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.665
it means you're good to go.

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:48.920
So you need to go ahead and
check your colors one-by-one.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.840
So I'm going to
scroll down here.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.690
Let me select this,
Learn More button.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.105
And if I head over to the color,

00:02:56.105 --> 00:02:59.255
you can see that I've
got triple a as well.

00:02:59.255 --> 00:03:00.500
What about here?

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.450
For sure it's AAA.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.135
There we go, because we
already checked that color.

00:03:05.135 --> 00:03:07.475
What about this
project description?

00:03:07.475 --> 00:03:11.210
It looks good. We've got
WA it's still acceptable.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.430
So basically you
need to go ahead and

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.085
check all your
elements one way one,

00:03:16.085 --> 00:03:17.915
here we have AAA.

00:03:17.915 --> 00:03:19.190
What about this one?

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.915
We have AAA as well.

00:03:20.915 --> 00:03:22.850
So this is the first
thing you need

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.830
to check in terms
of accessibility.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.050
Now let's move on
to the next point.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.415
I'm going to scroll up.

00:03:28.415 --> 00:03:30.530
In almost all projects,

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.239
we will use images.

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.340
We may use decorative images

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.770
or some meaningful images, e.g.

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.530
here in this recent
projects section,

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.820
you can see that we have

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.190
the project image
and these cards,

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.690
I'm going to scroll down here.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.849
We have some decorative damages.

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:48.725
These are decorative images.

00:03:48.725 --> 00:03:50.105
I'm going to scroll down.

00:03:50.105 --> 00:03:52.760
These icons are
also declarative.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.545
What do I mean by decorated?

00:03:54.545 --> 00:03:58.144
Well, when something doesn't
add value to our website,

00:03:58.144 --> 00:04:00.350
and it doesn't help
the search engine to

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.825
understand the structure
of your website.

00:04:02.825 --> 00:04:04.354
It means it's declarative.

00:04:04.354 --> 00:04:06.065
So I'm going to
scroll down here.

00:04:06.065 --> 00:04:07.865
We don't have any other images.

00:04:07.865 --> 00:04:11.000
If I go to My
Projects page here,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.310
this image is not
declarative because

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.620
this is one of our
projects images.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.380
But how can we make the
search engines understand

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.240
the structure of our website and

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.145
the meaning behind our images.

00:04:22.145 --> 00:04:25.415
Well, we can use something
called alt text.

00:04:25.415 --> 00:04:27.380
Let me go to my homepage.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.090
And here I'm going to select

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.985
this card if I click
on the Settings icon,

00:04:31.985 --> 00:04:34.655
as you can see here
we have the alt text.

00:04:34.655 --> 00:04:37.415
Alt is the short
form of alternative.

00:04:37.415 --> 00:04:40.760
So it's an alternative
text for each image,

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.995
we can specify an alt text,

00:04:42.995 --> 00:04:44.525
but why do we need to do that?

00:04:44.525 --> 00:04:46.670
Well, there are many
different reasons to

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.610
specify an alt text
for your images.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.370
Number one, search
engines could easily

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.190
understand the meaning
behind your images,

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.490
and therefore, they can
rank your website higher.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.935
This way you can
improve your SEO.

00:05:00.935 --> 00:05:03.410
The second reason
is that sometimes

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.275
our images may not be
loaded completely.

00:05:06.275 --> 00:05:09.020
In that case, the
browser will show

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.050
the alt text or alternative
texts to the user.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.760
And the last reason is that

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.400
all texts or alternative
texts could be

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.990
helpful for people with

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.290
visual impairments who
use screen readers.

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.545
People with visual impairments
usually use screen readers

00:05:24.545 --> 00:05:27.995
in order to read the
content of a webpage.

00:05:27.995 --> 00:05:31.265
When our images don't
have any alt text,

00:05:31.265 --> 00:05:34.639
the screen reader simply
reads its name, e.g.

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:36.425
if I go to my assets,

00:05:36.425 --> 00:05:37.820
I'm going to scroll down.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.515
It says card one.

00:05:39.515 --> 00:05:43.100
It's not descriptive, so
the user may be confused.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.645
If I scroll up here,

00:05:44.645 --> 00:05:47.224
you can see that
these projects images

00:05:47.224 --> 00:05:49.220
don't have descriptive names.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.055
Here we have 123456.

00:05:52.055 --> 00:05:53.840
So we should add all takes to

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.270
our images in order
to help a user

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:57.800
with visual impairments to

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.755
understand the meaning
behind your image.

00:06:00.755 --> 00:06:03.800
But how can we add all
text to our images?

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.080
Well, there are many
ways to do that.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.290
The first and simplest way
is to go to the Assets.

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.915
And then if you hover
over one of your images,

00:06:11.915 --> 00:06:14.344
you can click on
the Settings icon.

00:06:14.344 --> 00:06:17.630
And then here you can
write your alt text.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:18.905
And here we have a hint.

00:06:18.905 --> 00:06:21.620
It says write a
description of this image.

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.905
All text is used by
screen readers and,

00:06:24.905 --> 00:06:27.350
or if an image doesn't load.

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.135
Here we have two different tabs.

00:06:29.135 --> 00:06:31.534
We have descriptive,
we have decorative.

00:06:31.534 --> 00:06:33.800
So when our image is decorative,

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.445
we can simply set it to
decorative just like that.

00:06:37.445 --> 00:06:40.010
And here it says,
decorative images don't

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:43.205
convey meaning and don't
require all texts.

00:06:43.205 --> 00:06:44.060
That's right.

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.395
Therefore, we don't need to add

00:06:45.395 --> 00:06:47.480
all text to our
decorative images,

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.715
but if our image has a meaning,

00:06:49.715 --> 00:06:52.115
we need to write a
description for that.

00:06:52.115 --> 00:06:54.140
So we need to
select Descriptive.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.865
And here we need to
write something.

00:06:55.865 --> 00:06:57.605
This image is not declarative.

00:06:57.605 --> 00:07:00.545
If I go to the
testimonial section,

00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:02.315
this is our client's image.

00:07:02.315 --> 00:07:04.520
So here we can simply write

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:09.710
the image of Christine
Watson are right Done.

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.540
And from now on,
whenever you use

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.385
this image on your website,

00:07:13.385 --> 00:07:15.710
it will have this all texts.

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.575
But there is something you
need to keep in mind when you

00:07:18.575 --> 00:07:21.634
add an image using the
background section,

00:07:21.634 --> 00:07:23.300
they don't have any alt text.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.960
So here, this icon doesn't
have any alt texts.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.090
But if you want to use this icon

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.685
somewhere else using
an image element,

00:07:31.685 --> 00:07:32.885
as you can see here,

00:07:32.885 --> 00:07:35.930
you can go to your assets
and you can simply click on

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:39.785
the Settings icon and set
its alt text too decorative.

00:07:39.785 --> 00:07:41.240
Just like that, I'm going to do

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.210
the same thing for these
two icons as well.

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:46.505
Decorative and decorated.

00:07:46.505 --> 00:07:47.840
As a general rule,

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.750
our icons are always decorated.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.555
Alright, let me scroll
up a little bit.

00:07:53.555 --> 00:07:56.090
But what about these
images that are dynamic?

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:59.705
As you remember, this
image comes from our CMS.

00:07:59.705 --> 00:08:02.480
So it doesn't come from
our assets here when we

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.915
created our collection
inside our CMS here.

00:08:05.915 --> 00:08:09.455
And when we created our
collections, items, e.g.

00:08:09.455 --> 00:08:12.485
simplify plus, we
uploaded this image from

00:08:12.485 --> 00:08:16.295
our computer and here we
can specify any alt text.

00:08:16.295 --> 00:08:17.450
So what should we do?

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:18.830
Well, to fix this issue,

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:22.220
you can simply go to your
projects collection here.

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.850
Then if you click on
this settings icon here,

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:28.085
you can create a
new custom field.

00:08:28.085 --> 00:08:29.735
I'm going to add a field here.

00:08:29.735 --> 00:08:31.700
And it's going to be plain text.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.490
And the label is
going to be ALT text.

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:35.495
Okay.

00:08:35.495 --> 00:08:38.360
Just like that, it's not
going to be required.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.405
So I'm not going to check
this Required checkbox.

00:08:41.405 --> 00:08:44.480
I'm going to hit Save
Field and save collection.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.140
Now, if I go to this
simplify plus project first,

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:50.855
let me go ahead and change
its name to simplify.

00:08:50.855 --> 00:08:52.550
And if I scroll down here,

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:54.845
we have this new alt-text field

00:08:54.845 --> 00:08:57.065
and we can simply
describe this image.

00:08:57.065 --> 00:08:59.885
For now, I'm just going to
write something as an example,

00:08:59.885 --> 00:09:04.835
the image of Simplify project,

00:09:04.835 --> 00:09:06.890
not the best alt
texts by the way,

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:08.120
I'm going to save it.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.685
And now let me head
over to my design here.

00:09:10.685 --> 00:09:12.410
If I select this image and if I

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:14.495
click on the Settings icon here,

00:09:14.495 --> 00:09:16.099
as we remember, we connected

00:09:16.099 --> 00:09:18.665
this element to
our project image.

00:09:18.665 --> 00:09:20.975
And here I can simply get the

00:09:20.975 --> 00:09:23.345
all takes from my collections.

00:09:23.345 --> 00:09:24.995
If I check this checkbox,

00:09:24.995 --> 00:09:26.990
I can choose all texts,

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:28.925
plain text, and it's done.

00:09:28.925 --> 00:09:33.005
Now, each of these images
will have its own alt texts.

00:09:33.005 --> 00:09:35.975
Of course, if you already
set the alt texts for them,

00:09:35.975 --> 00:09:39.245
we can do the same thing
for the projects page.

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:41.345
If I go to the
projects template,

00:09:41.345 --> 00:09:43.160
I'm going to select
this image and

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.305
I'm going to click on
the Settings icon.

00:09:45.305 --> 00:09:47.360
I am going to get
the all texts from

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.970
projects and let me
choose the field,

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:51.905
all text just like that.

00:09:51.905 --> 00:09:54.305
Alright, that's all
about all texts.

00:09:54.305 --> 00:09:56.870
But there is one more
thing about accessibility,

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:58.985
and that is your
headings hierarchy.

00:09:58.985 --> 00:10:00.095
As I mentioned before,

00:10:00.095 --> 00:10:02.990
our headings should
have a clear structure.

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:04.925
If I go to my homepage

00:10:04.925 --> 00:10:07.084
and if I head over
to the hero section,

00:10:07.084 --> 00:10:11.555
I can see that these Tidal
has the H one HTML tag.

00:10:11.555 --> 00:10:13.280
If I click on the Settings icon,

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.620
you can see we have H1 to H6,

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:18.125
but how should you choose
your heading type?

00:10:18.125 --> 00:10:20.405
Well, let me tell you one rule.

00:10:20.405 --> 00:10:22.040
One is reserved for

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.935
the most important
words on your page.

00:10:24.935 --> 00:10:27.260
It's usually the first few words

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.960
that the user sees on your page.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.810
In this case, it's our
hero section title.

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:35.015
And remember, you
should always use

00:10:35.015 --> 00:10:38.705
the H1 heading type
once on every page.

00:10:38.705 --> 00:10:40.730
You shouldn't use
it multiple times.

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:42.020
But why does it matter?

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:43.445
Because search engines could

00:10:43.445 --> 00:10:45.620
easily understand
the structure of

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:49.294
your website when you set
the heading types properly.

00:10:49.294 --> 00:10:51.350
If you remember, when we were

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:53.990
designing this recent
projects section,

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:58.025
I said that they intentionally
set it's heading type two,

00:10:58.025 --> 00:11:00.185
h three, and it's not right.

00:11:00.185 --> 00:11:00.845
Why?

00:11:00.845 --> 00:11:02.660
Because you shouldn't skip

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.630
a heading type when you're
designing a webpage.

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:07.535
So when you use a one,

00:11:07.535 --> 00:11:09.740
then the second most
important texts on

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:12.695
your webpage should
have the H2 tag.

00:11:12.695 --> 00:11:14.615
In this case, I set it to age

00:11:14.615 --> 00:11:17.420
three to explain you
the difference here.

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:20.375
If I skip a heading type,
the search engines,

00:11:20.375 --> 00:11:22.369
like Google can't understand

00:11:22.369 --> 00:11:24.695
the structure of your
website properly,

00:11:24.695 --> 00:11:26.240
and therefore, they won't

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.400
give a higher rank
to your website.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.560
So I'm gonna go ahead
and quickly fix that.

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.655
But before doing that,

00:11:31.655 --> 00:11:34.025
I'm going to show you a
very helpful feature,

00:11:34.025 --> 00:11:35.135
the audit section.

00:11:35.135 --> 00:11:37.130
If you head over to
the bottom-left corner

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:39.275
here you can see we
have different options.

00:11:39.275 --> 00:11:40.865
We have this Help button.

00:11:40.865 --> 00:11:42.785
We have video tutorials,

00:11:42.785 --> 00:11:46.115
we have QuickFind, and then
we have the R, that section.

00:11:46.115 --> 00:11:47.420
If I click on it here,

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:49.940
you can find a missing
alt text images

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:52.100
and skipped a heading level.

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:53.705
And as you can see, it says,

00:11:53.705 --> 00:11:56.570
audits check the current
page for opportunities to

00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:59.600
improve your site's
performance and usability.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.950
I'm going to dismiss it.

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:05.015
And here, if I click on
this missing alt texts 13,

00:12:05.015 --> 00:12:06.530
you can see that it shows us

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:09.875
all the images that
don't have an alt text.

00:12:09.875 --> 00:12:12.695
It even shows us the
projects collection here and

00:12:12.695 --> 00:12:15.875
all the items inside that
don't have an alt texts.

00:12:15.875 --> 00:12:18.290
We already specified
the alt texts for

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:21.125
this Simplify project,
but take a look.

00:12:21.125 --> 00:12:23.600
Other projects don't
have an alt text.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.130
So we have two options here.

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:27.680
We can either ignore this, e.g.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:31.100
if discard one doesn't
need an alt texts,

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:34.760
we can simply click on this
bell icon to ignore it.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.010
Or if you want to simply go

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:39.710
ahead and add an alt
texts our image,

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:42.605
we can just click on
this right arrow button.

00:12:42.605 --> 00:12:44.510
It says Take me to the fix.

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:47.780
If I click on it, we will be
taken to the asset section

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:51.050
and we can specify a
descriptive alt texts here.

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:52.805
But what about the
other section?

00:12:52.805 --> 00:12:53.915
As you can see here,

00:12:53.915 --> 00:12:56.255
we have this skipped
a heading level.

00:12:56.255 --> 00:12:59.960
If I open it up here it
says ordered headings help

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.900
visitors understand
the page structure

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:04.925
and improve page navigation.

00:13:04.925 --> 00:13:08.105
And it says Projects heading h3.

00:13:08.105 --> 00:13:11.150
So something is wrong with
these projects heading.

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:14.585
This is exactly what we are
going to go ahead and fix.

00:13:14.585 --> 00:13:16.565
So I can either ignore it

00:13:16.565 --> 00:13:18.725
or I can say take me to the fix.

00:13:18.725 --> 00:13:20.780
So if I click on
this right arrow,

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:23.825
I can change the heading
type on the right side here.

00:13:23.825 --> 00:13:26.075
I'm going to change
it to age two,

00:13:26.075 --> 00:13:28.069
and now we have a
correct structure.

00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:29.525
I'm going to scroll down.

00:13:29.525 --> 00:13:31.685
Let me select this
heading as well.

00:13:31.685 --> 00:13:33.800
It's gonna be h two as well.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.020
So I'm going to set it to H2.

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:38.720
Nice. Let me scroll down.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.270
Alright, everything looks fine.

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:43.085
Now let me go to the audit.

00:13:43.085 --> 00:13:43.865
There we go.

00:13:43.865 --> 00:13:46.130
That's warning is
gone because now

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:48.530
our website has a
clear structure

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:50.195
in terms of heading Types.

00:13:50.195 --> 00:13:53.960
So I can simply go to other
pages, e.g. Contact Us.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.600
And here this
Contact Us title as

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.375
the most important
title on this page.

00:13:59.375 --> 00:14:01.985
Therefore, we use
the H1 heading type.

00:14:01.985 --> 00:14:03.710
So if I go to audit,

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:06.575
it says no issues
found. That's great.

00:14:06.575 --> 00:14:08.525
Now, let me go to another page,

00:14:08.525 --> 00:14:11.825
our projects template
here I'm going to add it.

00:14:11.825 --> 00:14:16.175
It says skipped a heading
level, again, project heading.

00:14:16.175 --> 00:14:20.720
So this project's name
has the H1 heading time.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.595
We don't have any
other heading here,

00:14:22.595 --> 00:14:25.910
except here, it's
going to be H2.

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:29.285
So I'm going to change
it to H2 just like that.

00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:30.950
And now if I added it,

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:33.620
there we go, That
warning is gone.

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:36.905
Alright guys, that's all
about accessibility.

00:14:36.905 --> 00:14:38.180
When you build a website,

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:40.715
make sure to make it
accessible to everyone.

00:14:40.715 --> 00:14:43.310
It's very important
because that's what makes

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:46.340
you a great web designer
and web developer.

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:48.065
I hope you enjoyed this video.

00:14:48.065 --> 00:14:50.640
I'll see you in the next one.
