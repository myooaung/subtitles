00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:05.645
Our right.

00:00:05.645 --> 00:00:07.515
So you have a meeting
with a client

00:00:07.515 --> 00:00:09.660
and you want to
sell them Webflow,

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.935
how to do that?

00:00:10.935 --> 00:00:14.280
First of all, you need to
ask them a few questions to

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.955
see if Webflow is the best
choice for them or not.

00:00:17.955 --> 00:00:19.785
Because as I mentioned before,

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:22.650
it's not right to push them
to use something which is

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.030
not good for them just

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.889
because we want to
get the project.

00:00:25.889 --> 00:00:27.465
So what should you ask them?

00:00:27.465 --> 00:00:29.775
You can ask them the
following questions.

00:00:29.775 --> 00:00:32.085
What do you expect
from your website?

00:00:32.085 --> 00:00:33.910
What features should it have?

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.705
You need a CMS.

00:00:35.705 --> 00:00:37.355
What about security?

00:00:37.355 --> 00:00:38.585
Does it matter to you?

00:00:38.585 --> 00:00:42.290
How often do you need to
update your website's content?

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.215
Do we care about speed
and scalability?

00:00:45.215 --> 00:00:47.900
These questions will help
you truly understand

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.945
their needs and focus on the
things that matter to them.

00:00:50.945 --> 00:00:53.045
For instance, if they
care about speed,

00:00:53.045 --> 00:00:54.485
you can talk about that.

00:00:54.485 --> 00:00:58.415
You can let them know that
Webflow is powered by AWS,

00:00:58.415 --> 00:01:00.785
which stands for
Amazon Web Services,

00:01:00.785 --> 00:01:03.350
which makes their
website load very fast.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.840
In fact, AWS is one of the most

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.644
secure and fast hosting
options available,

00:01:08.644 --> 00:01:10.775
trusted by big companies.

00:01:10.775 --> 00:01:12.545
They care about CMS.

00:01:12.545 --> 00:01:15.170
You can explain how
easy it is to work with

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.335
Webflow CMS, what
about scalability?

00:01:18.335 --> 00:01:19.640
You can tell them
they don't need

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.050
to worry about anything,

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.274
no matter how much traffic
they drive to their website.

00:01:24.274 --> 00:01:26.615
Workflow can handle that easily.

00:01:26.615 --> 00:01:28.880
If they already worked
with WordPress,

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.710
you can ask them
what they like and

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.395
dislike about it and
just focus on that.

00:01:33.395 --> 00:01:35.300
Now let's talk about
the differences

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.565
between Webflow and WordPress.

00:01:37.565 --> 00:01:39.935
They are like Mac
OS and Windows,

00:01:39.935 --> 00:01:43.385
each has its own advantages
and disadvantages.

00:01:43.385 --> 00:01:45.380
And you need to choose
between them based on

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.360
your needs and preferences.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.925
Workflow is a
relatively new tool,

00:01:49.925 --> 00:01:53.060
but WordPress is
well-known and very old.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.005
That's why most clients may
be familiar with WordPress,

00:01:57.005 --> 00:01:58.460
but it doesn't necessarily mean

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.335
that it's good for
them to use it.

00:02:00.335 --> 00:02:02.780
Workflow uses the
latest technologies

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.345
to build a clean and
modern websites.

00:02:05.345 --> 00:02:07.085
On the other hand, WordPress

00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:10.070
uses all technologies like PHP.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.620
Webflow doesn't
require any plug-ins

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.450
to create custom webpages,

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.890
but WordPress relies on

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.604
many different plugins
for almost everything.

00:02:18.604 --> 00:02:20.345
That's why Webflow generates

00:02:20.345 --> 00:02:23.315
a much cleaner code
compared to WordPress.

00:02:23.315 --> 00:02:26.795
Workflows features are paid
and it's not open source,

00:02:26.795 --> 00:02:28.460
but WordPress is totally

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.085
free and you just need
to pay for hosting.

00:02:31.085 --> 00:02:33.875
Webflow gives you
complete design freedom,

00:02:33.875 --> 00:02:37.175
whereas WordPress is
restricted by templates.

00:02:37.175 --> 00:02:39.710
So these were the most
important differences

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.780
between Webflow and WordPress.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.240
Now I'm going to show
you a very cool way

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.955
of presenting Webflow
to your clients.

00:02:46.955 --> 00:02:50.180
Webflow has created an
innovative way to let us

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.005
easily convince our clients
and friends to use Webflow.

00:02:54.005 --> 00:02:56.915
If you go to webflow.com
slash peach,

00:02:56.915 --> 00:03:00.020
you can enter your name
and e-mail address and

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.110
start creating a
customized presentation.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.330
You can write your
client's name here,

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.195
upload a screenshot of
their current website,

00:03:08.195 --> 00:03:10.010
and then you can go through

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.725
the slides and
customize some of them.

00:03:12.725 --> 00:03:15.770
E.g. here, I can
choose an option from

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.490
this drop menu and the image
will be added accordingly.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.555
You can also disable optional
slides just like that.

00:03:23.555 --> 00:03:26.150
And finally, you can
create a message for

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.600
your client and hit the
save and send button.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.100
In a few minutes, you will

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.960
receive your custom presentation

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.550
is linked to your e-mail and you

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.305
can share it with your client.

00:03:36.305 --> 00:03:37.550
How cool is that?

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.145
Our right guys, that's
all for this video.

00:03:40.145 --> 00:03:44.370
I hope you enjoyed it and I'll
see you in the next video.
