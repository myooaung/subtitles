00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.560
Hey, in this video we're
going to talk about

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.840
the typography section on

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.880
the side panel, on
the right side.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.070
Here I have some texts elements.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.130
I have a heading and
also I have a paragraph.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.995
So let me select the heading
and I'm going to show you

00:00:19.995 --> 00:00:23.595
all the properties of the
topography panel here.

00:00:23.595 --> 00:00:25.395
First, we have the font.

00:00:25.395 --> 00:00:26.700
If you open it up,

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.455
you have some default funds.

00:00:28.455 --> 00:00:30.720
If you want to add more
fonts, you can click on this,

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.580
Add Fonts at the top,

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.595
and you will be taken to
the project settings.

00:00:35.595 --> 00:00:37.560
And here under the fonts tab,

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.320
you can add different
fonts, e.g.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.235
if you want to work
with Google Fonts,

00:00:42.235 --> 00:00:44.555
Roberto or other Google fonts,

00:00:44.555 --> 00:00:46.595
you can just add them here.

00:00:46.595 --> 00:00:49.235
Let me look for
Roboto for a second.

00:00:49.235 --> 00:00:52.130
Let me see if I can find
it right there we go.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.135
Here is Roboto.

00:00:53.135 --> 00:00:56.300
Then you can select variants
of that particular font.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.580
These are the weights
of your fonts, e.g.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.345
a. Regular 500, 700,
which is black.

00:01:02.345 --> 00:01:05.060
And if you want to upload
some custom fonts,

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.655
you can upload them here
from your computer.

00:01:07.655 --> 00:01:09.725
And if you want to
use Adobe fonts,

00:01:09.725 --> 00:01:12.380
you can simply use this
section to connect

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.605
your project to Adobe
fonts using an API.

00:01:15.605 --> 00:01:18.890
Okay, now let's talk about
the topography panel.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.095
So I'm going to
select this heading.

00:01:21.095 --> 00:01:23.585
And here we talked
about the font.

00:01:23.585 --> 00:01:25.070
Then we have weight,

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.080
we have bold, different weights.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.390
Each font has different weights.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.265
Then we have size.

00:01:31.265 --> 00:01:32.780
This is our font size,

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.625
and you can use different units

00:01:34.625 --> 00:01:37.115
like the size property here.

00:01:37.115 --> 00:01:39.890
You can use pixel percent,

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.215
ems and rems, CH,

00:01:42.215 --> 00:01:44.720
viewport width and
viewport height.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.610
And finally we have
the line height,

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.164
which is so important
when we have a paragraph.

00:01:50.164 --> 00:01:52.655
So here, if I select
this paragraph,

00:01:52.655 --> 00:01:56.000
I set the line height
to 150 per cent.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.780
So it's 150 per cent
of the font size.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.015
If I just reset this setting,

00:02:02.015 --> 00:02:05.420
you can see that this
paragraph is not that legible.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.400
Therefore, it's always
a good practice

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.305
to increase your line-height,

00:02:09.305 --> 00:02:12.980
especially when you're working
with small font sizes.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.105
I'm going to set it to 150
per cent. There we go.

00:02:17.105 --> 00:02:18.500
Here we have color.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.570
You can change the
color of your font

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.030
easily to watercolor you want.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.770
Here is the hue slider.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.125
Then we have the
transparency slider.

00:02:27.125 --> 00:02:31.265
This controls the amount of
your color if you want to,

00:02:31.265 --> 00:02:33.635
let's say decrease the opacity.

00:02:33.635 --> 00:02:35.825
You can just use this slider.

00:02:35.825 --> 00:02:38.435
Here we have the hex color code.

00:02:38.435 --> 00:02:40.340
You can just copy and paste

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.780
the hex color code from

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.700
any design software
you work with.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.605
No matter if it's Figma,

00:02:45.605 --> 00:02:48.560
Sketch, Adobe XD,
it doesn't matter.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.855
Then we have HSP,

00:02:50.855 --> 00:02:53.930
which stands for hue
saturation and brightness.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.335
We're not going to talk about
these specifications here.

00:02:57.335 --> 00:03:00.185
Then we have the
alpha or the opacity.

00:03:00.185 --> 00:03:03.080
If I use this slider and
I decrease the opacity,

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.705
you can see that the
alpha amount changes.

00:03:05.705 --> 00:03:08.240
Here we have the
contrast ratio and it

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.520
actually lets us know whether

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.830
we have enough contrast between

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.500
the background color and
the foreground color.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.990
And as you can see, it says AAA,

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.105
and it means it's very legible.

00:03:20.105 --> 00:03:23.750
But if I try to use some
lighter colors like that,

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.520
you can see first we have

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.520
WA it's still fine,
it's still good.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.350
But if it says fail,

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.270
it means that your texts

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.910
may not be legible
to some pupil.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.870
It changes based on your font
size and different factors.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.730
So always make sure that

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.210
your color passes the
contrast ratio test.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.690
Okay?

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.180
All right, let me
undo the process.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.040
Alright, so what
do we have here?

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.130
Here is where we can
create our swatches.

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.010
Let's suppose we have
this color and we want to

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.745
create a color is style or
let's say a color swatch.

00:03:58.745 --> 00:04:00.755
If you're familiar with Figma,

00:04:00.755 --> 00:04:03.590
you may know that we can
create colors styles,

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.495
and this works like that.

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:06.530
Here.

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.300
We can just click on this plus

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.834
button and it creates
a new swatch.

00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:12.680
And I can name it, e.g. I.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.035
Can say neutral
slash light create.

00:04:18.035 --> 00:04:20.210
And if I select
any other element

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:23.090
here and I hit over
to the color section,

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.340
you can see that
these swatch is here.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.530
And as you can see there
is this little arrow

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.870
and it means this
is a global swatch.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.500
And I can use it for any
element just like that here.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.190
If I use this
neutral light swatch

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.630
for this paragraph and I
use it here as well, e.g.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:42.980
let me change that.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.615
So if I change it here,

00:04:44.615 --> 00:04:47.419
if I click on this pin button

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.790
and I tried to
change this color,

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.730
you can see that the changes
apply immediately to

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.165
all the elements that are
using this particular swatch.

00:04:56.165 --> 00:04:59.435
So you need to make sure to
keep your colors organized.

00:04:59.435 --> 00:05:02.075
Our right, Let's
undo the process.

00:05:02.075 --> 00:05:05.090
Let's move on to the next
property, which is a line.

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.290
It's so simple, we have

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.515
different alignments
options, left, center,

00:05:09.515 --> 00:05:12.230
right, and justify, just like

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.050
Microsoft Word or
any design software.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.675
Okay, then we have
the style property.

00:05:17.675 --> 00:05:20.720
We can it tell us size
our texts like that.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.020
We can use some
declarations here, e.g.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.955
we can use this strikethrough.

00:05:25.955 --> 00:05:29.810
We can use underlying
or over line.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.509
If you want to create
some links, e.g.

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:33.920
we can use this underline,

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.840
then we have this
more type options.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.670
By default, it's not visible,

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.275
but if you click on that,

00:05:39.275 --> 00:05:42.500
you can get access to
these advanced options,

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.285
such as letter spacing,

00:05:44.285 --> 00:05:46.700
texts in dance columns,

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.840
and these capitalize
and direction options.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.805
So let's go through
each of them.

00:05:52.805 --> 00:05:57.305
Using this field, we can control
the letter spacing, e.g.

00:05:57.305 --> 00:06:00.995
if I want to increase the
spacing between letters,

00:06:00.995 --> 00:06:03.620
I can set a higher
letter spacing here.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.345
I'm going to set it to 20 now.

00:06:05.345 --> 00:06:06.695
And as you can see now,

00:06:06.695 --> 00:06:09.590
the spacing between
letters as much higher.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:10.985
Let me decrease that.

00:06:10.985 --> 00:06:14.390
Actually, a good use case
for using letter spacing is

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.425
when we have a word that
is completely capitalist.

00:06:18.425 --> 00:06:22.235
So if I select this
interior design and if I

00:06:22.235 --> 00:06:26.540
set the capitalist option
to all caps like that,

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.275
sometimes if I work
with small font sizes,

00:06:30.275 --> 00:06:33.560
I need to increase the
letter spacing to improve

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.980
legibility and
readability of my texts.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.150
So in this case,

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.264
let me set it to five.

00:06:40.264 --> 00:06:42.125
Now, it looks much better.

00:06:42.125 --> 00:06:44.510
I can set it to three as well.

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.045
So this is used basically
for this purpose.

00:06:47.045 --> 00:06:50.630
Now, let's move on to the next
one which is text indent.

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.850
I'm going to select this
paragraph and let me

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.460
specify an amount
like 20 pixels.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.935
It just in dense the text,

00:06:57.935 --> 00:06:59.945
just like Microsoft Word.

00:06:59.945 --> 00:07:01.280
And then we have columns.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.730
Actually, I've never used
that and I rarely see

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:08.779
any website or any
designer uses this option,

00:07:08.779 --> 00:07:11.090
but it's good to
know that it exists.

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:14.330
So if I specify three here,

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.580
it takes our texts
and it divides

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.280
it into three equal columns.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.960
If I hit Enter, there we go.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.525
Now we have three
different columns

00:07:23.525 --> 00:07:26.855
and we can just modify
the gap here, e.g.

00:07:26.855 --> 00:07:30.260
the styling, we can
add some dividers.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.390
As you can see, we can modify

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:35.210
the thickness of that DY
there, just like that.

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:38.255
And also we can modify the
color of that divider.

00:07:38.255 --> 00:07:39.155
Okay.

00:07:39.155 --> 00:07:41.150
But to be honest,
I've never used

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:43.625
that and I doubt you
should use that too.

00:07:43.625 --> 00:07:46.025
Alright, let me
remove that for now.

00:07:46.025 --> 00:07:48.170
If you want to reset
any property here,

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.930
you can hold down the
Option key or Alt key on

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:53.180
your keyboard and
then just click

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.595
on that once, just like that.

00:07:55.595 --> 00:07:58.550
Okay, Then we have the
capitalist options.

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:00.095
We have all caps,

00:08:00.095 --> 00:08:01.535
as I showed you before.

00:08:01.535 --> 00:08:05.330
We have capitalize every
ward just like that.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.055
What do we have lowercase?

00:08:07.055 --> 00:08:07.880
Okay.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.575
I'm going to set it to none.

00:08:09.575 --> 00:08:11.600
Then we have the erection for

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.870
most languages we use
left to right direction.

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:17.795
But for some languages
like Arabic,

00:08:17.795 --> 00:08:21.590
you can use right to left
direction. We have breaking.

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:23.840
There are some
options like this.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.474
It's not that useful.

00:08:25.474 --> 00:08:28.955
So we're not going to touch
upon all these options

00:08:28.955 --> 00:08:32.525
since most of the time we don't
use this breaking option,

00:08:32.525 --> 00:08:34.055
then we have text shadow.

00:08:34.055 --> 00:08:36.170
If I click on this plus button,

00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:38.975
I can add shadow to my text.

00:08:38.975 --> 00:08:40.790
Just like that, I highly

00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:42.635
recommend you
should avoid adding

00:08:42.635 --> 00:08:44.930
shadows to your texts because it

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:48.035
decreases the legibility
of your texts.

00:08:48.035 --> 00:08:51.080
So I'm going to
remove this r, right?

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.465
That's all about typography.

00:08:53.465 --> 00:08:55.925
But there is one more thing
I'm going to mention here.

00:08:55.925 --> 00:08:59.120
If I go ahead and drag and
drop a div block here,

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.174
I'm going to give it a class.

00:09:01.174 --> 00:09:07.310
So let's write typography
here for this dip.

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:08.360
Like I can set

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:12.950
some specific properties
that its children can use.

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:15.710
So if I change the font
to something else,

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:18.155
Let's use this one for instance.

00:09:18.155 --> 00:09:21.050
And I increase the font size to,

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:23.270
let's say, 40 pixels.

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:24.424
Something dramatic.

00:09:24.424 --> 00:09:26.900
And also I changed
the color to red.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.985
You can see that nothing
happens here because

00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:31.610
there is no texts layer inside.

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:34.010
However, if I go
ahead and drag and

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:36.935
drop a heading
here, there we go.

00:09:36.935 --> 00:09:40.265
Now this heading is
getting the properties

00:09:40.265 --> 00:09:44.225
from the default properties
we said to its parent,

00:09:44.225 --> 00:09:46.565
which is this
topography diblock.

00:09:46.565 --> 00:09:48.800
Of course, we can override that.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:49.760
E.g. I.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:54.200
Can give a class to this
heading, like heading one,

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.035
and just modify the color
to whatever we want

00:09:57.035 --> 00:10:00.530
and font size or any
other properties here.

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:03.590
But you need to understand
that sometimes it makes

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:05.600
much more sense to add

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.130
the default properties to

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:09.365
the parents of our
elements first.

00:10:09.365 --> 00:10:12.695
And then we can just simply
drag and drop those elements.

00:10:12.695 --> 00:10:15.965
And we don't need to modify
everything from scratch.

00:10:15.965 --> 00:10:17.270
E.g. you can select

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:20.000
your section if your
section is going to have

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.370
some specific fonts and

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:25.205
let say some specific
font properties.

00:10:25.205 --> 00:10:28.715
You can just specify those
properties for the section.

00:10:28.715 --> 00:10:31.790
And then whatever you put
inside this section will

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:33.650
inherit from the properties

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:35.675
that you set for that section.

00:10:35.675 --> 00:10:39.065
So I personally, when I
want to start a project,

00:10:39.065 --> 00:10:42.875
I select my body and I
set the font here once.

00:10:42.875 --> 00:10:45.080
And then I don't need to change

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.135
the font again and
again and again.

00:10:47.135 --> 00:10:49.580
Of course I can override
these properties,

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:53.060
but it's going to save
me so much time if I can

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:56.630
set some default
properties. Are right guys.

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:58.250
That's all for this video.

00:10:58.250 --> 00:10:59.510
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:02.100
I'll see you in the next one.
