00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.300
What's a section?

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.240
In this video, we're going
to talk about sections.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.675
If we go to the
Add section here,

00:00:12.675 --> 00:00:14.400
under the layout, you

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.200
can see that we have
different elements.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.485
We have Section container,
grid and columns.

00:00:19.485 --> 00:00:22.185
And here I'm gonna
go ahead and add

00:00:22.185 --> 00:00:25.515
a section into my Canvas.

00:00:25.515 --> 00:00:28.935
Let me drag and drop a section
here, and there we go.

00:00:28.935 --> 00:00:30.465
The section has been added.

00:00:30.465 --> 00:00:32.700
Well, a section
actually takes up

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.895
the whole width of
the browser window,

00:00:35.895 --> 00:00:38.125
but wait, isn't it
like a div tag?

00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:41.315
Yes, it actually
acts as a def block.

00:00:41.315 --> 00:00:42.950
However, with one difference,

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.765
the only difference between
a section and a diblock is

00:00:47.765 --> 00:00:49.895
actually the meaning
of the content

00:00:49.895 --> 00:00:52.535
that you put inside
these elements.

00:00:52.535 --> 00:00:54.185
When we use a section,

00:00:54.185 --> 00:00:57.650
the content inside should
be logically connected.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.095
E.g. when we design a website,

00:01:00.095 --> 00:01:02.105
we may have different sections.

00:01:02.105 --> 00:01:03.770
The hero section, the

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.455
client section, the
testimonial section.

00:01:06.455 --> 00:01:11.030
And each section has
some content, e.g. a.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.210
Title, a subtitle, a button.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.925
When we group all
those contents,

00:01:16.925 --> 00:01:19.250
we put them inside a section,

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.030
so we group them using a
section, not a diblock.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.720
For anything else, we can
use a div block, e.g.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.075
when we want to
align some elements,

00:01:29.075 --> 00:01:32.090
when we group some elements
in order to style them.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.310
So this is basically
the main difference

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.695
between a DIF block
and a section.

00:01:36.695 --> 00:01:39.064
When you start
designing our projects,

00:01:39.064 --> 00:01:41.630
you will truly understand what's

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.495
the difference between a
section and a diblock.

00:01:44.495 --> 00:01:46.550
But for now, let me
tell you that we use

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.015
sections to structure
our websites.

00:01:50.015 --> 00:01:53.165
Basically, for any
website, for any project,

00:01:53.165 --> 00:01:55.355
what you need to do is add

00:01:55.355 --> 00:01:58.295
a section right after
the body element.

00:01:58.295 --> 00:01:59.780
So here we need to add

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.749
a section and we can
add our content,

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:05.555
our div blocks
inside this section.

00:02:05.555 --> 00:02:06.815
So let's give it a try.

00:02:06.815 --> 00:02:09.170
I'm going to take
this div block.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.950
And since this div blog
has a specific height,

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.690
let me set it to auto.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.850
I'm going to set
the height to auto.

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.100
And then I'm going to drag and

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.560
drop it inside the section.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.570
And there we go As section is

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.314
sized based on the
content inside.

00:02:26.314 --> 00:02:28.040
So to understand it better,

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.050
I'm going to select
this section and I'm

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.000
going to head over to
the style panel on

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.050
the right side and let me
modify the background's color.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.525
Okay, I'm gonna go to Background

00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:41.870
and by default it's
set to transparent.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.770
I'm going to set it to
something else, e.g.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.000
this purple.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.015
And now you can see that
the height of this section

00:02:50.015 --> 00:02:53.015
is determined by
the content inside.

00:02:53.015 --> 00:02:54.470
So if I select this div,

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.825
like this image and modify
its height to 200 pixels,

00:02:59.825 --> 00:03:01.310
you can see that the height of

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.490
this section has been
modified as well.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.100
So you should always keep
in mind that the height of

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.480
the section is determined
based on the content inside.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.785
As I mentioned before,

00:03:12.785 --> 00:03:15.050
a section by default takes

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.555
up the whole width
of the canvas,

00:03:17.555 --> 00:03:19.415
or let's say the browser window.

00:03:19.415 --> 00:03:21.875
However, we can modify that.

00:03:21.875 --> 00:03:26.555
We can override these preferences
and these properties.

00:03:26.555 --> 00:03:29.165
If you head over to the
size here, let me show you,

00:03:29.165 --> 00:03:32.750
I can set the width
to 500 pixels,

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.700
e.g. just like that.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.060
So you can easily override
all these properties.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.105
We will talk about these
properties later, but for now,

00:03:41.105 --> 00:03:43.460
you just need to know that we

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.045
structure our websites
always like this.

00:03:47.045 --> 00:03:50.570
After section, we usually
put a container and then we

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.990
will add our content
inside a container.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.140
We will talk about the container
in the upcoming video.
