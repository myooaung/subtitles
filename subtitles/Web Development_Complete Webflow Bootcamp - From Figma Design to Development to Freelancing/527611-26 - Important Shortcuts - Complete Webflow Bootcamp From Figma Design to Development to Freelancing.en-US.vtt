00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.260
Hey, in this video
we're going to talk

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.675
about web flows, shortcuts.

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:11.355
When we work on a project,

00:00:11.355 --> 00:00:12.645
we may need to use

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:16.125
some shortcuts to accelerate
our design process.

00:00:16.125 --> 00:00:18.270
And in this video, I'm
going to talk about

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.340
the most important
ones because there are

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.605
many different shortcuts
that you can use.

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:23.910
But we're not going
to talk about

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.230
all of them because most of

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.065
the time we won't use
all those shortcuts.

00:00:28.065 --> 00:00:29.700
So if you head
over to the bottom

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.830
left corner of Webflow here,

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.690
you can see these question mark.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.330
If you click on it here
on the Hill panel,

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.844
we have different options.

00:00:37.844 --> 00:00:40.394
The second option is
keyboard shortcuts.

00:00:40.394 --> 00:00:41.710
I'm going to click on it.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:42.800
And there it is.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.075
As I mentioned before,

00:00:44.075 --> 00:00:45.755
we may not need all of them,

00:00:45.755 --> 00:00:48.020
but some of them are
so important to know,

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.520
like copy and paste,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.834
undo, redo, find, etc.

00:00:52.834 --> 00:00:55.475
So whenever you want
to copy something,

00:00:55.475 --> 00:00:58.460
you can use Command
C or Control C.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.245
If you're using Windows.

00:01:00.245 --> 00:01:01.580
If you want to cut something,

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.415
you can use Command
X or Control X.

00:01:04.415 --> 00:01:06.290
And if you want
to pay something,

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.065
you can use Command
V or Control V.

00:01:09.065 --> 00:01:11.120
Basically, if you
are a Mac user,

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.650
you need to use command.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.240
If you are a Windows user,

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.695
you need to use control.

00:01:15.695 --> 00:01:17.240
So here for instance,

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.285
for duplicate, it says
Option plus drag.

00:01:20.285 --> 00:01:22.310
So if you hold the Option key on

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.950
your keyboard and
you click and drag,

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.870
you can duplicate an element

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.520
on windows instead of option,

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.205
you need to hold the Alt
key on your keyboard.

00:01:31.205 --> 00:01:33.290
And here as you
can see, for undo,

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.020
use Command Z or Control Z.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.110
And for redo we use
Command Shift and z,

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.924
the other important shortcuts

00:01:40.924 --> 00:01:43.115
or device views here
as you can see,

00:01:43.115 --> 00:01:46.040
if you want to go to
another breakpoint, e.g.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.500
if you want to go to
the tablet break point,

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.585
you can hit number
two on your keyboard.

00:01:50.585 --> 00:01:52.774
If you wanna go to
mobile portrait,

00:01:52.774 --> 00:01:56.675
you can hit number for using
these shortcuts is optional,

00:01:56.675 --> 00:01:58.190
but believe me,
it's going to make

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.305
your life much easier
if you learn them.

00:02:00.305 --> 00:02:02.120
The other important
shortcut that we

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.460
use almost all the time is fine.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.400
There is a very good
feature called QuickFind.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.410
When you want to open it up,

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.230
you can hit Command
E or Command K,

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.885
or Control E or Control K.

00:02:14.885 --> 00:02:17.000
We've been talking
about QuickFind later.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.680
But for now, you just need to

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.529
know how you can use
these shortcuts.

00:02:21.529 --> 00:02:24.650
So if you want to learn
more about these shortcuts,

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.170
you can head over to
the panel and click

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.870
on keyboard shortcuts
and just check them out.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.550
But for now, these are

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.390
the most important shortcuts
that you need to know about.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.835
Alright guys, that's
all for this video.

00:02:37.835 --> 00:02:42.060
I hope you enjoyed it and
I'll see you in the next one.
