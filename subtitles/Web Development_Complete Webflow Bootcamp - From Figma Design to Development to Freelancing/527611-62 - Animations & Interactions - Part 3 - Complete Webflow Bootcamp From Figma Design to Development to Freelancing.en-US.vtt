00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.120
Hey, in this video,

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.730
we're going to go ahead
and add animations

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.535
to other sections
of our website.

00:00:11.535 --> 00:00:13.830
For instance, as
you can see here,

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.570
these logos are black and

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.300
white and we're gonna
make them interactive.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.945
So when the user hovers
over each of these logos,

00:00:21.945 --> 00:00:23.790
they should become colorful.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.060
Here, for instance, we
have this drop shadow.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.940
So when the user
hovers over this card,

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.995
this drop shadows should appear

00:00:31.995 --> 00:00:34.035
and otherwise it
should disappear.

00:00:34.035 --> 00:00:36.240
But what about the
testimonial section?

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.535
So here when the section
comes into the viewport,

00:00:40.535 --> 00:00:42.515
we want to start animating

00:00:42.515 --> 00:00:45.935
these emojis and these
middle elements one by one,

00:00:45.935 --> 00:00:47.570
we just want them to fade in.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.085
Let me scroll down.

00:00:49.085 --> 00:00:50.644
What about this section?

00:00:50.644 --> 00:00:53.150
Well, what are we gonna
do for these cards?

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.300
For this card, when the
user hovers over it,

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.370
It's backgrounds
color is going to

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.425
be changed to our primary color,

00:01:00.425 --> 00:01:02.135
and then the color of

00:01:02.135 --> 00:01:05.600
these texts layers should
be changed as well.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.104
So let's go ahead and start

00:01:08.104 --> 00:01:10.775
working on our
clients section here.

00:01:10.775 --> 00:01:12.965
Okay, I'm gonna go to Webflow,

00:01:12.965 --> 00:01:15.515
and I'm gonna go to
the logo section here.

00:01:15.515 --> 00:01:18.110
Our logos are
colorful by default.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.555
How can we make them
black and white?

00:01:20.555 --> 00:01:23.255
Do you remember when we
talked about the filters?

00:01:23.255 --> 00:01:25.535
That's exactly what
we're going to use.

00:01:25.535 --> 00:01:27.425
I'm going to select
this image here.

00:01:27.425 --> 00:01:29.045
Let me go to the Styles panel.

00:01:29.045 --> 00:01:30.770
And as you can
see, we didn't add

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.885
any class to these logos.

00:01:32.885 --> 00:01:35.089
So while this image is selected,

00:01:35.089 --> 00:01:37.445
I'm gonna go ahead and
add a class to it.

00:01:37.445 --> 00:01:39.005
That's right, logo.

00:01:39.005 --> 00:01:40.715
Now I'm going to
add this class to

00:01:40.715 --> 00:01:43.010
every single one of these logos.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.715
So let me go ahead and quickly
add this class to them.

00:01:46.715 --> 00:01:47.990
Just like that.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.930
I'm going to add it to all
logos are right at me.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.415
Select this one as well.

00:01:52.415 --> 00:01:53.990
And I'm going to add it here.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.460
And finally, I'm going to select

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.965
the Amazon logo and
let me add it here.

00:01:57.965 --> 00:02:01.835
Perfect. Now, while one of
these logos is selected,

00:02:01.835 --> 00:02:03.485
I'm going to scroll down

00:02:03.485 --> 00:02:05.705
and I'm gonna go to
the Effects section.

00:02:05.705 --> 00:02:09.335
And from here, I'm gonna go
ahead and create a filter.

00:02:09.335 --> 00:02:12.185
So if I click on this
plus button or default,

00:02:12.185 --> 00:02:13.700
the filter is Blair,

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.800
I'm not going to
use a blur filter.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.815
I'm going to change the
filter to gray scale.

00:02:18.815 --> 00:02:22.025
And as you can see, the amount
is set to 100 per cent.

00:02:22.025 --> 00:02:23.495
That's totally fine.

00:02:23.495 --> 00:02:24.875
Now what should we do?

00:02:24.875 --> 00:02:27.635
If I go to the hover state here,

00:02:27.635 --> 00:02:30.110
I can select this
gray scale filter and

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.780
I can decrease this
amount to zero per cent.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.970
Okay, Just like that.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.010
Now let me go to the non-state.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.675
Let's preview it.

00:02:38.675 --> 00:02:42.680
There we go. It works
perfectly for all logos,

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.820
but here we don't have

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.865
a smooth transition
between these two states.

00:02:46.865 --> 00:02:50.015
So let's go ahead and
add a transition,

00:02:50.015 --> 00:02:52.235
but make sure that you
are in the non-state,

00:02:52.235 --> 00:02:53.315
not the hover state.

00:02:53.315 --> 00:02:55.115
Otherwise, it's
not going to work.

00:02:55.115 --> 00:02:55.715
Okay?

00:02:55.715 --> 00:02:59.555
Always add your transitions
to the non-state.

00:02:59.555 --> 00:03:02.075
So I'm going to add
a transition here.

00:03:02.075 --> 00:03:05.135
I'm going to change
the type to filter

00:03:05.135 --> 00:03:08.555
and the easing method is
gonna be ears, that's fine.

00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:11.270
Then the duration is gonna
be 200 milliseconds.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.580
Let's preview to once again.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.595
Now it looks much
better, doesn't it?

00:03:16.595 --> 00:03:17.825
What else should we do?

00:03:17.825 --> 00:03:20.975
Well here, when I
preview this project,

00:03:20.975 --> 00:03:23.900
you can see that our hero
section is animated.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.430
But what about this section?

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.395
What I wanna do is add

00:03:27.395 --> 00:03:30.575
an element trigger to the
container of these logos.

00:03:30.575 --> 00:03:33.365
And once it scrolls
into the viewport,

00:03:33.365 --> 00:03:35.870
this container should fading.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.210
So let me show you what I mean.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:39.980
I'm going to select
the container

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.770
here and then I'm gonna
give you the combo class.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.905
Okay, so let's write logos.

00:03:45.905 --> 00:03:48.095
Now, let me go to
the interactions.

00:03:48.095 --> 00:03:51.230
And from here I'm going to
add an element tree here.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.340
And here, as you can see,

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.290
we have scroll into view.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.550
That's what we need.

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.355
Then it says, When
scroll into view,

00:03:58.355 --> 00:03:59.990
when scroll out of you,

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.730
we're going to need
the first option

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.350
when scrolled into you.

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:04.400
And then I'm going to use

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.370
these quick Effect
Fade just like that.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.575
And here we have
fade-in, fade-out.

00:04:09.575 --> 00:04:12.920
We can modify the
delay or the offset.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.675
So it's going to be fading.

00:04:14.675 --> 00:04:16.205
Let me preview that.

00:04:16.205 --> 00:04:17.315
There we go.

00:04:17.315 --> 00:04:18.530
It's too quick.

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.495
So I'm going to add
some delay here.

00:04:20.495 --> 00:04:22.970
Let's add a
400-millisecond delay.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.425
I'm going to preview it.

00:04:24.425 --> 00:04:25.399
Nice.

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:27.515
Let me preview the project.

00:04:27.515 --> 00:04:30.650
Alright, we can see the
effect now because I'm using

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.355
a large screen and as soon
as this page is loaded,

00:04:34.355 --> 00:04:37.145
this section is
inside my viewports.

00:04:37.145 --> 00:04:39.020
But if I use a smaller screen,

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.275
it will come into view
when I start scrolling.

00:04:42.275 --> 00:04:44.240
For instance, if I go to

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.370
the tablet break
point here and I

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.590
just preview the
project once again,

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.354
you can see that our hero
sections elements are animated.

00:04:52.354 --> 00:04:54.065
I'm going to scroll down.

00:04:54.065 --> 00:04:56.270
And as soon as this section

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.105
scrolls into the
view, it fades in.

00:04:59.105 --> 00:05:01.100
Let me show it once again.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.815
Our right, I'm going
to scroll down.

00:05:03.815 --> 00:05:04.700
There we go.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.700
It fades in. That's
exactly what I needed.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.380
And keep in mind
that when we add

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.675
the animation to the
desktop breakpoint,

00:05:11.675 --> 00:05:14.060
the animation will be
added to all breakpoints.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.315
So if I go to mobile
portraits and I preview it,

00:05:17.315 --> 00:05:19.910
everything works as expected.

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.125
Okay, great.

00:05:21.125 --> 00:05:23.495
Now we can move on
to the next section.

00:05:23.495 --> 00:05:25.565
And that is recent projects.

00:05:25.565 --> 00:05:28.790
So I'm gonna do the same thing
here for this container.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.830
I'm going to select
this container

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.425
and I'm going to add an
element trigger here,

00:05:33.425 --> 00:05:36.530
scroll into view, and I'm
going to add an action here,

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.500
fading and a
400-millisecond delay.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:40.940
Just like that.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.575
Cool, since these containers
have some combo classes,

00:05:45.575 --> 00:05:47.090
the interaction will be added

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.830
to that particular container.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.469
But if I add the interaction
to the container,

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:53.045
to the base class,

00:05:53.045 --> 00:05:54.890
it will be added to
all the elements

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.050
using this container base class.

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.400
So keep that in mind.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.860
Let's go ahead and preview it.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.915
I'm going to scroll down.

00:06:02.915 --> 00:06:03.710
There we go.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.645
Let's check it out once again.

00:06:05.645 --> 00:06:07.280
I'm going to scroll down.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.080
It fades in. Great.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.475
So as I mentioned,

00:06:10.475 --> 00:06:13.099
when the user hovers
over these cards,

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:15.860
a soft drop shadow
should appear as well.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.485
So how can we achieve
this interaction?

00:06:18.485 --> 00:06:21.335
It's so simple, we
already talked about it.

00:06:21.335 --> 00:06:23.240
So first, I'm gonna go ahead

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.205
and select this project card.

00:06:25.205 --> 00:06:25.985
Let me see.

00:06:25.985 --> 00:06:28.250
You can find it in
the navigator easily.

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:32.315
And then I'm going to go to
the hover state from here.

00:06:32.315 --> 00:06:34.370
And finally, I'm
going to go ahead and

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.470
add some shadows to it.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.240
Alright, now let's modify

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.730
the properties of
these box-shadow.

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:44.075
I'm going to change
the angle to 180.

00:06:44.075 --> 00:06:46.190
I'm going to change the blur to

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.884
50 pixels and the
distance to 25 pixels.

00:06:50.884 --> 00:06:53.585
And finally, I'm going
to change the color

00:06:53.585 --> 00:06:56.749
from black to neutral medium.

00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:58.880
And let me decrease the opacity

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:04.265
100-10% to get this
soft drop shadow.

00:07:04.265 --> 00:07:06.005
Alright, it looks great.

00:07:06.005 --> 00:07:08.090
Now let's move back to

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.750
our non-state and
let's preview it.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:14.705
There we go. It works perfectly.

00:07:14.705 --> 00:07:15.770
Can you see that?

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.260
But we don't have a
smooth transition here.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.020
So let me go ahead
and add a transition.

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.525
Make sure that you
are in the non-state.

00:07:23.525 --> 00:07:25.430
I'm going to scroll down and

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.680
why this project
card is selected.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.570
I'm going to add a transition.

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:32.360
And the type is going
to be box-shadow

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.239
and the duration is going
to be 200 milliseconds.

00:07:35.239 --> 00:07:37.895
I'm not going to change
the easing method.

00:07:37.895 --> 00:07:40.205
Let's preview it once again.

00:07:40.205 --> 00:07:41.390
There we go.

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:42.980
Now looks much better.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.030
Okay, cool.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:46.505
Now we can move on
to the next section,

00:07:46.505 --> 00:07:48.875
which is the
testimonial section.

00:07:48.875 --> 00:07:50.420
So what should we do here?

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:52.070
Well, first, I'm going to select

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:53.720
this section and I'm going to

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.460
add an element trigger to it.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.920
Okay, so let me go
to the interactions.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.815
And from here I'm going to
add an element trigger.

00:08:00.815 --> 00:08:02.630
And we're going to use scroll

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:04.835
into view because we
want the elements

00:08:04.835 --> 00:08:09.365
to fade in once the section
scrolls into the view.

00:08:09.365 --> 00:08:12.800
So that's why we are
using scroll into view.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.115
And then I'm going to create
a custom animation here,

00:08:16.115 --> 00:08:19.535
because we're going to animate
these elements one by one.

00:08:19.535 --> 00:08:23.135
So I'm going to use
start an animation and

00:08:23.135 --> 00:08:26.720
let me hit this plus button
to go to our timeline.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.205
There we go. Here.

00:08:28.205 --> 00:08:30.740
Let's write testimonial.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.950
You can name it whatever
you want, Enter.

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:37.385
And then I'm going to
select one of our memo, Gs.

00:08:37.385 --> 00:08:39.515
And let's create an action here.

00:08:39.515 --> 00:08:41.330
It's gonna be opacity because

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:43.460
we are going to
make them fading.

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:45.365
And as usual, first,

00:08:45.365 --> 00:08:47.630
we need to create
the initial state.

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:50.720
Therefore, I am going to
decrease the opacity to

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.400
zero per cent and I'm going to

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.440
set it as the initial state.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.110
And then I'm going to
create a new keyframe here.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:59.060
I'm going to use opacity and let

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:02.045
me increase the opacity to 100%.

00:09:02.045 --> 00:09:03.800
Let me play the animation.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.455
Alright, nice, but there
is a problem here.

00:09:06.455 --> 00:09:08.960
As you can see, this
animation only works for

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.940
this first memo G. Should we go

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:13.475
ahead and select these
memo G is one by one.

00:09:13.475 --> 00:09:16.445
Of course not because there
is an alternative to it.

00:09:16.445 --> 00:09:19.175
Since we have the memo
G base class here,

00:09:19.175 --> 00:09:21.665
we can simply hit
over to this section,

00:09:21.665 --> 00:09:23.225
which is called class,

00:09:23.225 --> 00:09:26.270
and then we can remove
this one combo class here.

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:28.625
I just want to write my emoji.

00:09:28.625 --> 00:09:30.680
I'm going to choose my emoji and

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.199
make sure that this
option is selected.

00:09:33.199 --> 00:09:35.885
Only children with this class,

00:09:35.885 --> 00:09:38.075
I'm going to select
the initial state.

00:09:38.075 --> 00:09:39.725
And now if I play it,

00:09:39.725 --> 00:09:42.905
now the animation
works for all emojis.

00:09:42.905 --> 00:09:47.194
Why? Because now this animation
works for this class,

00:09:47.194 --> 00:09:50.360
the emoji class with
all its children.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.445
That's exactly what we wanted,

00:09:52.445 --> 00:09:54.125
but what about other elements?

00:09:54.125 --> 00:09:56.555
Well, we're gonna go
ahead and select them

00:09:56.555 --> 00:09:59.255
one by one and we are
going to animate them.

00:09:59.255 --> 00:10:01.445
So let's start
with this heading.

00:10:01.445 --> 00:10:02.690
I'm going to select it.

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:05.225
I'm going to create
an action opacity,

00:10:05.225 --> 00:10:08.360
and I'm going to set
its opacity to 0%.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.955
And let's set it as
the initial state.

00:10:10.955 --> 00:10:13.955
It will be grouped with
our memo G initial state.

00:10:13.955 --> 00:10:16.370
And I'm going to create
a new keyframe here.

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:17.900
I'm going to choose Opacity.

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:21.140
Let's turn its opacity to 100%.

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:21.995
Nice.

00:10:21.995 --> 00:10:23.900
Now, we're gonna go ahead and

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:26.210
select this testimonial text.

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:28.355
Let's create an action for it.

00:10:28.355 --> 00:10:32.330
Opacity. I'm going to
set the opacity to 0%.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:34.580
Let's set it as
the initial state,

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.190
and let's create a
new keyframe here and

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:40.745
choose opacity and
turn it back to 100%.

00:10:40.745 --> 00:10:44.480
And finally, I'm going to
select these client diblock,

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:47.075
create a new action opacity.

00:10:47.075 --> 00:10:49.925
Let's turn its opacity
to zero per cent,

00:10:49.925 --> 00:10:52.085
set it as the initial state,

00:10:52.085 --> 00:10:55.100
and create a new
keyframe opacity

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:58.625
and turn it back to
100%, just like that.

00:10:58.625 --> 00:11:00.605
Now let me save this animation

00:11:00.605 --> 00:11:02.795
and I'm gonna go
ahead and preview it.

00:11:02.795 --> 00:11:04.865
Let's see what we
are going to get.

00:11:04.865 --> 00:11:07.190
I'm going to scroll
down and as soon as

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:10.745
the testimonial section
scrolls into the viewport,

00:11:10.745 --> 00:11:12.440
the animation plays, but

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.440
these memorial is
faded in so quickly.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.255
So let's go ahead and fix that.

00:11:17.255 --> 00:11:19.520
I'm going to go to the
testimonial animation

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.080
here on the right side.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.455
And I'm going to select
this memo G opacity here,

00:11:24.455 --> 00:11:26.375
and I'm going to add
some delay to it.

00:11:26.375 --> 00:11:27.035
Okay?

00:11:27.035 --> 00:11:32.100
So let's add a one-second
delay and let's preview it.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.660
I'm going to save it.

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:38.615
And let's see if it
works properly or not.

00:11:38.615 --> 00:11:40.594
I'm going to scroll down.

00:11:40.594 --> 00:11:43.865
Nice, but 1 s looks too much.

00:11:43.865 --> 00:11:47.405
So I'm going to decrease
C2 maybe half a second.

00:11:47.405 --> 00:11:50.960
Let me select this memo
G opacity and just

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:55.280
decrease the delay
to 0.5 and save it.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.380
Let's preview it once again.

00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:59.180
I'm going to scroll down.

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:00.380
There we go.

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:01.490
Fantastic.

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:03.980
Let's check it out on
other breakpoints as well.

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:06.290
I'm gonna go ahead
and preview it.

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:08.850
Let me scroll down.

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:10.880
Pretty good.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.070
It looks great, doesn't it are

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:16.100
right now let's move on
to the Services section.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.575
So here, as I mentioned before,

00:12:18.575 --> 00:12:20.975
we are going to modify
the background's color,

00:12:20.975 --> 00:12:22.850
the color of these texts blocks,

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:24.965
and also this link button.

00:12:24.965 --> 00:12:27.860
So can we just select this
service card and go to

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:31.415
the hover state and modifying
our backgrounds color,

00:12:31.415 --> 00:12:35.120
just like what we did for
these recent projects section.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.520
Unfortunately not why?

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.100
The reason is for these cards,

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.365
we just modified one property.

00:12:42.365 --> 00:12:44.390
So we went to the
hover state and

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:46.460
we added the drop
shadow to discard.

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:50.195
However, here, when the
user hovers over this card,

00:12:50.195 --> 00:12:52.535
we want to modify
multiple elements.

00:12:52.535 --> 00:12:54.995
That's why it's not
possible to animate

00:12:54.995 --> 00:12:57.620
all those elements
here in the effects.

00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:00.110
Therefore, we're going to
need to go ahead and create

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:03.245
an interaction in the
Interactions section.

00:13:03.245 --> 00:13:04.565
So what should we do?

00:13:04.565 --> 00:13:07.535
First, I'm going to
select this service card,

00:13:07.535 --> 00:13:10.970
made sure that this service
card div block is selected,

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:13.940
as you can see inside
our services grid.

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:15.620
And then I'm gonna go ahead

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:17.495
and create an elementary year.

00:13:17.495 --> 00:13:21.065
And this time I'm going
to choose mouse hover,

00:13:21.065 --> 00:13:25.265
not mouse-click, not scroll
into view, mouse hover.

00:13:25.265 --> 00:13:26.870
I'm going to select it.

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:30.035
And here we have on
hover, on hover out.

00:13:30.035 --> 00:13:31.400
Therefore, we are going to

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:34.010
create two different
animations here.

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:34.715
Why?

00:13:34.715 --> 00:13:37.160
Because first, we want
to animate all of

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.850
these elements once the user
hovers over this current.

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:43.430
And then we want to turn
all those elements to

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:47.225
their original colors
when the user hovers out.

00:13:47.225 --> 00:13:49.610
So first, let's go
ahead and create

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:52.250
a custom animation
here on hover,

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:54.155
I'm going to create an animation

00:13:54.155 --> 00:13:56.450
and let's call it card hover.

00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:57.425
There we go.

00:13:57.425 --> 00:13:58.475
So what should we do?

00:13:58.475 --> 00:14:00.995
Do we need to create
an initial state?

00:14:00.995 --> 00:14:04.190
No, because we don't
need any initial state.

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:06.845
The initial state is
what we have here.

00:14:06.845 --> 00:14:09.575
We just need to change
the background scholar,

00:14:09.575 --> 00:14:11.330
and the color of these elements.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:13.910
So widely service
card is selected.

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:16.490
I'm going to create an
action because I want to

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:19.790
modify the background
color of the steel block.

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:22.340
And here under the style,

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:25.625
I'm going to choose BG
color, bank runs color.

00:14:25.625 --> 00:14:26.510
There we go.

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:30.185
And here I can choose a new
bank runs color for it.

00:14:30.185 --> 00:14:32.945
Let me choose primary
default, nice.

00:14:32.945 --> 00:14:34.940
And then I'm going
to modify the easing

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.520
from linear to easing out.

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.200
The next thing we need to modify

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.480
is the color of
this project title.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:42.740
So I'm going to select it.

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:44.645
I'm going to create
a new action,

00:14:44.645 --> 00:14:46.835
and it's going to be
text color this time.

00:14:46.835 --> 00:14:49.340
Let me go ahead and
change the color of

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:52.625
this text to white,
just like that.

00:14:52.625 --> 00:14:56.030
And then I'm going to select
this project description.

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:59.075
And let's add a new
action here, text color.

00:14:59.075 --> 00:15:00.830
And I'm going to choose white.

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:02.270
And then I'm going to decrease

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:06.350
the opacity from 100% to 60%,

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:09.515
just like that, to have a
good visual hierarchy here.

00:15:09.515 --> 00:15:11.900
And finally, I'm going
to select this link,

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.300
Martin, and I am going
to create a new action.

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.805
And it's going to be
text color again,

00:15:16.805 --> 00:15:18.545
but this time it's gonna be

00:15:18.545 --> 00:15:20.780
our secondary
color, this orange.

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:21.545
Nice.

00:15:21.545 --> 00:15:23.630
Let me play this animation and

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:26.090
see if everything
works perfectly well.

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:27.230
There is a problem.

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:29.570
These animations
should be grouped.

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:32.735
We want them to play at
the same time right now.

00:15:32.735 --> 00:15:34.355
They play one-by-one.

00:15:34.355 --> 00:15:35.885
That's not what we want.

00:15:35.885 --> 00:15:38.450
So I'm going to select
these texts color,

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:40.775
and I'm going to
drag it and drop it

00:15:40.775 --> 00:15:43.130
on top of our first action,

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:44.900
which is this service card.

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:46.610
I'm going to do
the same thing for

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:48.575
these two elements as well.

00:15:48.575 --> 00:15:50.555
Just drag it and drop it.

00:15:50.555 --> 00:15:52.100
And now that you're grouped,

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:55.340
so the animation occurs
at the same time,

00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:57.080
let me play it once again.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.475
Fantastic.

00:15:58.475 --> 00:15:59.765
All right, Cool.

00:15:59.765 --> 00:16:02.045
Let me save the
animation and see

00:16:02.045 --> 00:16:04.520
if it works perfectly.
I'm going to save it.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:05.945
I'm going to preview it,

00:16:05.945 --> 00:16:08.210
and I'm going to
hover over it. Cool.

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:09.305
It looks great.

00:16:09.305 --> 00:16:12.395
But does it work for all
cards? No, it doesn't.

00:16:12.395 --> 00:16:13.535
What should we do?

00:16:13.535 --> 00:16:16.865
Should we go ahead and animate
these cards one by one?

00:16:16.865 --> 00:16:18.965
Of course not because it's not

00:16:18.965 --> 00:16:21.544
an efficient way since
we are using classes,

00:16:21.544 --> 00:16:22.925
we don't need to do that.

00:16:22.925 --> 00:16:24.005
So what should we do?

00:16:24.005 --> 00:16:26.435
Well, I'm going to
select these card hover.

00:16:26.435 --> 00:16:27.875
And as you can see here,

00:16:27.875 --> 00:16:29.630
if I select this service car,

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:32.794
the first keyframe here
in the effects section,

00:16:32.794 --> 00:16:35.450
it says interaction
trigger and it says

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:38.380
You are now only affecting
the trigger elements.

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:40.280
I'm going to open up
the stroke menu and

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.140
I'm going to change it to class.

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:45.290
And then I'm going to
open up this drop menu.

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:46.595
And I'm going to change it to

00:16:46.595 --> 00:16:49.130
only children with this class.

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:50.645
Now let me save it.

00:16:50.645 --> 00:16:54.590
And now here, as you can see
under the trigger settings,

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:56.630
we have two different options.

00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:59.015
We have elements, we have class.

00:16:59.015 --> 00:17:01.970
By default, the element
is selected and it

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:05.645
says trigger only on
the selected elements.

00:17:05.645 --> 00:17:07.400
This is not what we want.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:10.580
We want this animation to
work for all these cars.

00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:13.624
So I'm going to change it
from element to class.

00:17:13.624 --> 00:17:15.785
And the class is going
to be service card.

00:17:15.785 --> 00:17:17.060
As you can see here,

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:20.570
all these cards have the
same class service card.

00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:24.035
And now if I preview it and
if I hover over these cards,

00:17:24.035 --> 00:17:27.155
you can see that the animation
works for all of them.

00:17:27.155 --> 00:17:29.765
But what if I hover
out, they don't change.

00:17:29.765 --> 00:17:33.215
That's because we didn't create
the hover out animation.

00:17:33.215 --> 00:17:35.855
So let me go ahead
and create one.

00:17:35.855 --> 00:17:36.665
What should we do?

00:17:36.665 --> 00:17:38.210
Well, here, as you can see,

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:39.755
we have on hover out,

00:17:39.755 --> 00:17:43.145
we're going to create a new
action, start an animation.

00:17:43.145 --> 00:17:46.355
This time, instead of creating
a new custom animation,

00:17:46.355 --> 00:17:48.335
I'm going to show you a
quick way to do that,

00:17:48.335 --> 00:17:49.820
since we just want to turn

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:52.610
the colors back to
their original colors,

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:55.760
I'm gonna go ahead and hover
over these card hover.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.110
And here as you can see,

00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:58.700
we have two icons.

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:01.340
If I click on these dots icon,

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:05.855
I can duplicate this animation
and I have card hover two.

00:18:05.855 --> 00:18:07.790
Then I'm going to rename it.

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:10.820
So I'm going to click
on these dots icon and

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:14.195
let me rename it to
card, hover out.

00:18:14.195 --> 00:18:17.525
Okay, now I'm going to
select it, click on it.

00:18:17.525 --> 00:18:20.855
And here I'm going to select
all of these elements,

00:18:20.855 --> 00:18:22.040
and I'm going to change

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.785
their color back to
their origin on colors.

00:18:24.785 --> 00:18:27.425
Alright, wireless service
card is selected.

00:18:27.425 --> 00:18:30.110
I'm gonna go ahead and
change the color to white.

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:33.500
Nice. Now I'm going to select
the project title and I'm

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:37.115
going to change its
color to neutral dark.

00:18:37.115 --> 00:18:40.040
Now I'm going to select
project description and I'm

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:42.995
going to change its
color to neutral medium.

00:18:42.995 --> 00:18:46.490
And finally, I'm going to
select this link button and I'm

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:50.105
going to change its color
to primary default.

00:18:50.105 --> 00:18:52.085
Just like that, I'm
going to hit Save.

00:18:52.085 --> 00:18:53.390
And now if I preview

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:56.555
my project and if I
hover over these cards,

00:18:56.555 --> 00:19:00.245
you can see that this
animation works both ways.

00:19:00.245 --> 00:19:02.015
Just like that.

00:19:02.015 --> 00:19:05.120
Can you see how easy it
is to create interactions

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:07.970
and animations on
Webflow are right guys,

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:09.665
that's all for this video.

00:19:09.665 --> 00:19:14.250
I hope you enjoyed it and I'll
see you in the next video.
