00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.010
Hey, I hope you
were able to solve

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.505
all the 28 Flexbox challenges.

00:00:11.505 --> 00:00:14.025
But if you couldn't,
that's totally fine.

00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:17.430
Because together you and I
are going to walk you through

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.980
all the 28 levels
and we're going

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.710
to solve every
single one of them.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.125
Are you ready?
Let's get started.

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:28.845
First of all, let's start
with the level one.

00:00:28.845 --> 00:00:31.345
Okay, So let's see
what we have here.

00:00:31.345 --> 00:00:33.830
It says move the
green circle into

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.305
the outline using
flex layout setting.

00:00:36.305 --> 00:00:39.170
Alright, so first we need
to select the parent.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.995
Remember, always select
the parent first grade,

00:00:42.995 --> 00:00:45.860
it says select this
white bikes and then

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.950
play with flex layout in
the right panel. Great.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.290
So here the only
thing we need to do

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.725
is change the justify to right?

00:00:54.725 --> 00:00:57.020
That's all. Level one is fixed.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.675
Let's move on to the
next one, less than two.

00:00:59.675 --> 00:01:03.455
So here we have two circles
with two placeholders.

00:01:03.455 --> 00:01:04.535
It's simple as well.

00:01:04.535 --> 00:01:06.140
I'm going to select
the parent which is

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.280
this playground and justify
to the center just like that.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.110
Let's move on to the next one.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.395
Here. We have 123 circles.

00:01:15.395 --> 00:01:17.210
As I can see, we
need to modify to

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.390
justify to space
around just like that.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.300
Now let's move on to
the level for Cool.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.580
So here the only
thing you need to do

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.325
is modify the
headline to bottom.

00:01:28.325 --> 00:01:30.155
Great, What about here?

00:01:30.155 --> 00:01:32.750
Well, we need to change
both the line and

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.125
justify here to align this
circle to the center.

00:01:36.125 --> 00:01:38.570
So I'm going to change
the line and to

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.360
justify number five is solved.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.745
Let's move on to
the next one here.

00:01:43.745 --> 00:01:46.640
First, I'm going to
align it, the center,

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.150
and then I'm going to choose
space around this one.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.750
Cool.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.085
The next one here,

00:01:52.085 --> 00:01:53.960
we just need to
change the direction

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.540
these circles should
stack vertically.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.010
I'm going to change
the direction to

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.930
vertical and it's solved.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.315
Let's move on to
number eight here.

00:02:02.315 --> 00:02:05.330
Again, we need to change
the direction to vertical.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.180
Also, I'm going to
change the justify.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.150
And finally I'm going to
align it to the right,

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.755
done the next one.

00:02:12.755 --> 00:02:15.500
Here we're going to use
the reverse option.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.195
We didn't talk about it before.

00:02:17.195 --> 00:02:19.300
But if you take a look
at the directions

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.830
section right next
to these tabs,

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.240
we have this icon,

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.710
okay, there are two arrows,

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.750
and this is the reverse option,

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.355
and let's click on that.

00:02:28.355 --> 00:02:30.770
So let's move on
to the next one.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.300
So here first, I'm going to

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.625
change the direction to vertical

00:02:34.625 --> 00:02:36.650
and then I'm going
to align it to

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.810
the right side and bottom.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.310
But we have a problem here.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.765
We have number one,

00:02:41.765 --> 00:02:44.945
but number one should be
placed here at the bottom.

00:02:44.945 --> 00:02:47.405
Therefore, I'm going
to select the child,

00:02:47.405 --> 00:02:48.440
which is this circle.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.640
I'll make sure to select

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.385
a child and I'm going
to modify the order.

00:02:52.385 --> 00:02:56.075
So here I'm going to change
the order to make last.

00:02:56.075 --> 00:02:58.160
And for this one,
the middle one,

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.740
I'm going to change the
order to first done.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.150
Can you see how easy it is to

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.220
work with Flexbox are right?

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.570
What about this one?

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.065
First, Let's make that
direction vertical.

00:03:09.065 --> 00:03:13.070
Then I'm going to change the
justify to space between.

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.665
And finally, I'm going
to modify the order.

00:03:15.665 --> 00:03:18.230
So I'm going to first
select the circle,

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.430
which is this child,

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.650
and change the order to last.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.780
And this one, the
second one should be

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.210
first, are right, great.

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.760
Now let's see what we have here.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.775
As you can see here, we have 123

00:03:31.775 --> 00:03:35.630
and the placeholders
are three-to-one.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.925
So we need to reverse
the layout first.

00:03:37.925 --> 00:03:39.560
Just like that, I'm going to

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.315
click on this reverse button.

00:03:41.315 --> 00:03:44.180
And then I'm going to
align it to the bottom.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.080
And finally, I'm going to
use space between done.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.745
Let's move on to the next one.

00:03:49.745 --> 00:03:52.205
Cool. Let's see
what we have here.

00:03:52.205 --> 00:03:54.890
As you can see,
these circles are

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.325
kinda shrinked and this
is not what we want.

00:03:58.325 --> 00:03:59.765
So what should we do?

00:03:59.765 --> 00:04:03.035
Do you remember the tag example
that I showed you before?

00:04:03.035 --> 00:04:05.540
We change the children to ramp.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.805
This is exactly what
we need to do here.

00:04:07.805 --> 00:04:10.250
So first select the
parent and change

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.875
the children to wrap and done.

00:04:12.875 --> 00:04:14.780
We don't need to
touch anything else.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.910
Let's move on to level 14.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.000
Again here, you just need
to change the children to

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.105
wrap and then we need to
modify the alignment.

00:04:23.105 --> 00:04:26.375
So first I'm going to align
it here to the center,

00:04:26.375 --> 00:04:30.455
and then I'm going to modify
the justify to center.

00:04:30.455 --> 00:04:31.250
Cool.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.544
Let's move on to level 15.

00:04:33.544 --> 00:04:37.370
Again, we need to change the
children to wrap and then

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.135
I'm going to change the
outline here to space between.

00:04:41.135 --> 00:04:43.010
And finally, I'm going to change

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.920
the justify to space between.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:46.550
Cool.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.590
Now let's move on
to the next one.

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:49.325
Here.

00:04:49.325 --> 00:04:52.355
Again, we need to change
the children to wrap.

00:04:52.355 --> 00:04:54.785
And let's see what we have here.

00:04:54.785 --> 00:04:56.135
Alright, right at the top,

00:04:56.135 --> 00:04:59.840
we have green placeholders
than orange placeholders.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.360
And finally, the
purple placeholders.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.700
So let's see what
happens if I change

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.759
the direction from
horizontal to vertical.

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:09.725
There we go, We're almost there.

00:05:09.725 --> 00:05:13.880
Now, what I'm gonna do is
change the justify to center.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.030
And also I'm going to change
the outline here to center.

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.695
Let's move on to the next one.

00:05:18.695 --> 00:05:21.455
Alright, let's see
what we have here.

00:05:21.455 --> 00:05:25.805
1245 are placed properly.

00:05:25.805 --> 00:05:27.830
The only thing we
need to do is change

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.320
the alignment of
these green circles.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.780
So I'm going to select this
circle and then I'm going to

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.795
change the alignment
to button done.

00:05:35.795 --> 00:05:38.420
Now we are in level 18.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.625
So let's see what we have here.

00:05:40.625 --> 00:05:43.205
We can always take a look
at the hint as well.

00:05:43.205 --> 00:05:44.870
It says reverse layout on

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.285
the flex container
and change alignment

00:05:47.285 --> 00:05:49.430
and two of the flakes children.

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.770
So first I'm going to
select the container,

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.194
which is this playground.

00:05:53.194 --> 00:05:55.280
And then I'm going
to reverse it.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.520
Now, let's select this
circle, this circle one,

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.080
align it to the center,

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.885
this circle three,
allowing it to the bottom.

00:06:02.885 --> 00:06:06.650
And finally, I'm going to
select again the parents and

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.790
change the justify to space
between just like that.

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.195
Now let's move on to the
next level, level 19.

00:06:14.195 --> 00:06:16.460
Alright, so first here,

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.310
I'm gonna select this circle
and I'm going to change

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.045
the sizing to grow if
possible, and it's done.

00:06:23.045 --> 00:06:26.135
Alright, Let's move
on to level 20.

00:06:26.135 --> 00:06:28.370
Number one is placed properly.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.460
Number 3.2 should be modified.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.910
Okay, so I'm going to select
number two and change

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.630
the sizing to grow if
possible, and it's done.

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.250
Let's move on to the next one.

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.890
Level 21 are right here.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:44.645
Let's take a look at the hint.

00:06:44.645 --> 00:06:46.550
It says the green circle should

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.740
have a width to 100 pixels.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:49.850
Yeah, that's right.

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:53.120
So I'm going to select circle
one and I'm going to change

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.065
the width from 100
pixels to 200 pixels.

00:06:57.065 --> 00:06:59.990
And I'm going to
select circle tool and

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.080
change the sizing to
grow if possible.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.850
All right, Let's go
to level 22 here.

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:10.325
Number one should be
here in the middle,

00:07:10.325 --> 00:07:13.175
and number three
should be placed here.

00:07:13.175 --> 00:07:14.600
So first, I'm going to

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.460
select number three
and I'm going to

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.760
change the order two
first, and it's done.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.815
Let's move on to
the next challenge.

00:07:21.815 --> 00:07:24.785
All right, let's see
what we have here.

00:07:24.785 --> 00:07:27.845
This number two should
be the last child.

00:07:27.845 --> 00:07:30.095
So I'm gonna change
the auditor to last

00:07:30.095 --> 00:07:32.690
number three should
be the first child.

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.100
So I'm going to
change the order to

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.830
fares and the rest is fine.

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:39.860
I'm going to move on to
the next one, level 24.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.455
Okay, so let's see
what we have here.

00:07:42.455 --> 00:07:44.510
First, I'm going to
select the playground,

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:46.265
which is the parents here.

00:07:46.265 --> 00:07:48.440
And I'm gonna I'm gonna change

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.110
the children from
Don Trump to wrap.

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.150
Nothing happens
yet. That's fine.

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.060
Then this number
three should take up

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:59.615
the whole width of
this container here.

00:07:59.615 --> 00:08:01.685
And as you can see
here, we have a hint.

00:08:01.685 --> 00:08:03.680
It says, guess what you need to

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.750
do if you want to flex child to

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:09.755
span across full width of
its parent container, right?

00:08:09.755 --> 00:08:13.115
Just set its width
to 100 per cent.

00:08:13.115 --> 00:08:15.260
And this is exactly
what we're gonna do.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.240
So I'm going to
select number three,

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:23.150
and I'm going to change
the width to 100%. Nice.

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:25.730
Then I'm going to change
the order to first.

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:27.740
Now what I need to do is select

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:31.685
the parents and change
the line option here.

00:08:31.685 --> 00:08:34.790
So I'm going to change
the deadline to align

00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:37.910
rows start, and it's done.

00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:39.740
Let's move on to the next one.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:42.710
There is no hint this
time, that's totally fine.

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:43.895
Let's see what we have.

00:08:43.895 --> 00:08:47.120
Alright, so first, the
second circle should be

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.345
placed here instead
of this green circle.

00:08:50.345 --> 00:08:52.760
Therefore, I'm going to
select this and I'm going to

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.835
change its order to
first are right.

00:08:55.835 --> 00:08:57.305
Then as you can see,

00:08:57.305 --> 00:08:58.940
number one should take up

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:02.420
the whole width of this
green placeholder.

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:07.160
Therefore, I'm going to
change its width to 100%.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.570
And as you can see,

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:12.620
since we didn't change
its children to wrap,

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.420
everything is messed up here.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:17.930
So I'm going to change the
children to wrap our right.

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:20.465
We're getting there and
let's see what we have.

00:09:20.465 --> 00:09:23.450
First, I'm going to select
this circle three and

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:26.960
change the sizing to
grow if possible. Nice.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.960
And the only thing
left is the alignment.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.450
So I'm going to select
the parent and change

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:36.170
the alignment here to space
between our right done,

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:37.880
Let's move on to the next one.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.400
Okay, hint the
alliance setting on

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.935
individual flakes
children will help you.

00:09:42.935 --> 00:09:43.970
Alright, cool.

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:47.540
First, this circle
one should be last,

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:49.775
since it's gonna be
placed at the bottom.

00:09:49.775 --> 00:09:52.415
So I'm going to change
its order to last.

00:09:52.415 --> 00:09:53.990
So the order is correct.

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:56.420
Now, then I'm going to
select circle one and

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:59.285
set its width to 100 per cent.

00:09:59.285 --> 00:10:01.220
Nice. Finally, I'm going to

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.875
select the parent and
change it to wrap.

00:10:03.875 --> 00:10:05.840
I'm going to select circle one,

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:09.260
this one, and change its
alignment to bottom.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.810
I'm going to select the
parents once again.

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:15.725
And let's see how can we
align these two circles.

00:10:15.725 --> 00:10:18.470
If I change the
justify to the right?

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:20.390
Number two, we'll
replace properly.

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:22.309
And now I need to change

00:10:22.309 --> 00:10:24.770
the alignment of this
particular circle.

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:27.065
Number three, I
need to select it,

00:10:27.065 --> 00:10:30.320
and let's change its
alignment to bottom.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.230
Nice, level 26 is done as well.

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:35.945
Let's move on to level 27.

00:10:35.945 --> 00:10:37.790
Let's see what we have here.

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:40.040
Alright, so number two should

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.679
take up the whole width
of this placeholder.

00:10:42.679 --> 00:10:44.090
I'm going to select that and

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:45.575
I'm going to change the width

00:10:45.575 --> 00:10:48.935
to 100% are right.

00:10:48.935 --> 00:10:50.345
Then as you know,

00:10:50.345 --> 00:10:54.095
we need to select the parent
and change it to wrap.

00:10:54.095 --> 00:10:57.875
Then let's select circle
too and make it first.

00:10:57.875 --> 00:10:59.660
What else do we have here?

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:03.680
If I select circle one and
change the sizing to grow,

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.735
if possible, it will grow,

00:11:05.735 --> 00:11:07.490
but the order is not correct.

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:09.380
So what I'm gonna do is select

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:13.310
the parent and reverse the
direction just like that.

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:15.710
And I'm going to select
this circle five and

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:18.365
set the sizing to
grow if possible.

00:11:18.365 --> 00:11:20.795
Finally, while it's selected,

00:11:20.795 --> 00:11:22.610
I'm going to align
it to the bottom.

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:26.675
Done and last but
not least, level 28.

00:11:26.675 --> 00:11:28.910
Alright, now combine
all the things

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:31.190
you learned today to solve this.

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:33.845
So let's see how we
can solve this one.

00:11:33.845 --> 00:11:35.195
Interesting, isn't it?

00:11:35.195 --> 00:11:37.505
Alright, let's see
what we have here.

00:11:37.505 --> 00:11:40.280
We have 145. So I'm going to

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.550
select the parent and
reverse the direction first,

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:46.235
just like that,
since one is here,

00:11:46.235 --> 00:11:47.615
then I'm going to select

00:11:47.615 --> 00:11:50.480
the second circle
and make it first.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.055
Since we reverse that,

00:11:52.055 --> 00:11:54.470
the order doesn't
work as expected.

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:57.410
So when I choose
fares, it means last.

00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:00.095
Now, if I choose
last, it means first.

00:12:00.095 --> 00:12:02.210
But for now let's choose first.

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:06.019
I'm going to select this green
circle and make it last.

00:12:06.019 --> 00:12:07.715
Then while it's selected,

00:12:07.715 --> 00:12:09.350
I'm going to set its width to

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:13.760
100% and select the
parent and choose Wrap.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.380
Nice. I'm going to select

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:19.295
this green circle and change
its alignment to bottom.

00:12:19.295 --> 00:12:21.169
I'm going to select this circle,

00:12:21.169 --> 00:12:24.050
this purple, and change
its order to last.

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:25.100
Let's select one of

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:28.355
these orange circles and
align them to the bottom.

00:12:28.355 --> 00:12:30.575
And finally, we need to select

00:12:30.575 --> 00:12:32.900
our second circle and change

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:35.614
its sizing to grow if possible.

00:12:35.614 --> 00:12:36.695
And there we go.

00:12:36.695 --> 00:12:38.795
We've successfully solved

00:12:38.795 --> 00:12:43.085
all the 28 challenges
of CSS Flexbox.

00:12:43.085 --> 00:12:44.435
Let me tell you something.

00:12:44.435 --> 00:12:47.480
If you couldn't solve
some of these challenges,

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:50.765
that's totally fine because
in real-world projects,

00:12:50.765 --> 00:12:54.020
we never use some
of these layouts.

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.660
But it's good for
you to see what's

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:59.930
possible and how you can
utilize the Flexbox.

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:01.010
Are right guys.

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:02.720
That's all for this video.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.040
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.690
I'll see you in the next one.
