00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.865
Almost all modern websites

00:00:06.865 --> 00:00:09.775
nowadays are created
using classes.

00:00:09.775 --> 00:00:10.630
Why?

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.430
Because classes let us store
our styling information and

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.010
then reuse them again and again

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.755
and again for as many
elements as we want.

00:00:20.755 --> 00:00:24.880
That's why classes are so
powerful and it's almost

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.305
impossible to create a modern
webpage without classes.

00:00:29.305 --> 00:00:31.600
Let me show you how
it works when you add

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.090
an element to your
Canvas, e.g. a.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.385
Diblock, just like this,

00:00:36.385 --> 00:00:39.580
you can head over to the style
panel on the right side.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.130
And at the top we have
the selectors section.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.720
Okay?

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.065
Here is where we
will add a class,

00:00:45.065 --> 00:00:47.150
or let's say select a class.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.390
By default, our elements
don't have any class.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.875
If we want to modify the CSS
properties of our elements,

00:00:54.875 --> 00:00:57.275
we need to add a
specific class to that.

00:00:57.275 --> 00:00:59.690
If we don't, Webflow
automatically

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.555
assigns a class to these
particular elements.

00:01:02.555 --> 00:01:04.145
Let's see how it works.

00:01:04.145 --> 00:01:06.650
First, I'm not going
to add any class here.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.650
I just want to modify
the background's color.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:10.625
And there we go.

00:01:10.625 --> 00:01:13.475
As soon as I changed one
of these properties,

00:01:13.475 --> 00:01:17.135
this div blood class has
been created automatically.

00:01:17.135 --> 00:01:19.100
If you want to rename our class,

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.295
we can just left-click on
it and simply rename it.

00:01:22.295 --> 00:01:23.735
I'm going to call it.

00:01:23.735 --> 00:01:24.800
Okay?

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.590
So this is basically how
you can create a class.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.455
The other way, which is
better, in my opinion,

00:01:30.455 --> 00:01:32.960
is to just create a class once

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.945
you've added your
element to your Canvas,

00:01:35.945 --> 00:01:38.960
instead of modifying the
properties of your elements,

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.820
first, add a class to it.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.560
This way you can make sure that

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.660
your classes are organized.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.910
Because later on
we're going to reuse

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.305
these classes and naming them
properly is so important.

00:01:51.305 --> 00:01:54.200
Now I'm going to select
this div block and

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.960
there is no class here
because I just remove that.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.105
Let me show you how you
can remove a class.

00:01:59.105 --> 00:02:00.740
I'm going to write div to

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.395
choose this class
that I created.

00:02:03.395 --> 00:02:06.110
To remove a class, you
can just click on this

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.440
down arrow and just
hit Remove class.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.840
Alternatively, you can
click somewhere here.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.660
And as you can see, this
cursor is blinking if you

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.600
hit the Delete or Backspace
key on your keyboard,

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.460
this class will be removed.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.575
Alright, so now we don't have

00:02:21.575 --> 00:02:23.930
any class apply to this element.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.120
I'm going to click here and I

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.310
can start creating a new class.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.575
So we need to name
our class here.

00:02:30.575 --> 00:02:36.545
I'm going to write new div
Enter, just like that.

00:02:36.545 --> 00:02:39.440
Our class has been created
and we didn't modify

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.605
the properties of
these elements yet.

00:02:42.605 --> 00:02:44.045
So if I scroll down,

00:02:44.045 --> 00:02:47.345
you can see that there
are some properties and

00:02:47.345 --> 00:02:51.035
there are highlighted
with this amber color.

00:02:51.035 --> 00:02:53.405
It means that this
particular property

00:02:53.405 --> 00:02:55.385
is inherited from another class.

00:02:55.385 --> 00:02:56.555
If I click on that,

00:02:56.555 --> 00:02:59.690
you can see that value
comes from body all pages.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.850
We will talk about
these tags later.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.320
But for now you just
need to know that

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.615
this amber color means that

00:03:05.615 --> 00:03:07.010
actually the property and

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.575
styling is coming
from somewhere else.

00:03:09.575 --> 00:03:11.390
Of course, we can override that.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.495
Once you override that,
see what happens.

00:03:14.495 --> 00:03:15.635
It turns blue.

00:03:15.635 --> 00:03:17.495
It means that this property

00:03:17.495 --> 00:03:19.430
is now coming from this class.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.530
If I click on it,
you can see that

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.690
we can reset this property

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.505
and resetting will inherit the
value from body oh, pages.

00:03:28.505 --> 00:03:32.390
Okay, So now let's go ahead
and modify the background.

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.745
I'm going to change it to white.

00:03:34.745 --> 00:03:36.635
Why do we need to use classes?

00:03:36.635 --> 00:03:38.180
Well, as I mentioned before,

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.554
classes store information
about our styling.

00:03:41.554 --> 00:03:43.010
So now that we modify

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.965
the background's color
and also the font,

00:03:45.965 --> 00:03:48.050
we can just reuse this class.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.685
How to reuse a class?

00:03:49.685 --> 00:03:53.195
First, let me go ahead and
add another block here,

00:03:53.195 --> 00:03:55.220
and I'm going to place
it right next to it.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.425
And now instead of
creating a new class,

00:03:57.425 --> 00:03:59.975
I can just apply
the new div class

00:03:59.975 --> 00:04:01.850
to this particular block.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.845
I'm going to write new.

00:04:03.845 --> 00:04:05.180
I can find it under

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.210
the existing classes
here and there we go.

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.550
One thing you need to
remember is that we

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.070
are making changes to the style.

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.785
We're not making changes
to the element itself.

00:04:15.785 --> 00:04:19.775
That's why we can apply
a class to any elements.

00:04:19.775 --> 00:04:22.745
We set the properties
for a specific class,

00:04:22.745 --> 00:04:25.640
and then we can apply
to any kind of element.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.350
So now I'm gonna go

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.690
ahead and change the
background color.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.655
And let's see what happens.

00:04:31.655 --> 00:04:32.660
There we go.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.370
As you can see the
change applied

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.350
to both these div blocks because

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.520
both these elements are
using this new div class.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.260
But what if I want to have

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.545
a unique class for the
second diblock to do so,

00:04:45.545 --> 00:04:47.375
we can duplicate a class.

00:04:47.375 --> 00:04:49.850
We can just click on this down

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.535
arrow and I'm going to
hit Duplicate class.

00:04:52.535 --> 00:04:56.495
And let's write second
div, just like that.

00:04:56.495 --> 00:05:01.460
Now, there is no connection
between this div block and

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.340
this block because
we just duplicated

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.390
the class and there is

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.345
no relationship between
these two classes.

00:05:08.345 --> 00:05:11.105
Decide to modify the color here.

00:05:11.105 --> 00:05:13.010
The background's
color, they change.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:17.165
I make here only applies to
this particular elements.

00:05:17.165 --> 00:05:19.115
But how can you rename a class?

00:05:19.115 --> 00:05:20.345
To rename a class,

00:05:20.345 --> 00:05:23.270
you can simply click on
it and just rename it.

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.000
I'm going to change it to demo.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.760
Now our class has been renamed.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.545
So let me show you
another example.

00:05:30.545 --> 00:05:32.255
I'm going to go to
the Add section.

00:05:32.255 --> 00:05:36.215
And from here I'm going to
bring a button into my Canvas.

00:05:36.215 --> 00:05:37.115
Just like that.

00:05:37.115 --> 00:05:40.010
Let me put it inside
my container and I'm

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.115
going to remove these
blocks. Alright, cool.

00:05:43.115 --> 00:05:45.740
So this button has no class.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.765
I'm going to add a class to it.

00:05:47.765 --> 00:05:52.325
I'm going to write
primary button.

00:05:52.325 --> 00:05:55.880
Cool. Now this
primary button has

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.890
some default stylings because

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.480
this is a pre-built elements.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.595
And I'm going to
override these elements.

00:06:01.595 --> 00:06:03.800
I'm going to start with
the spacing, okay,

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.170
here we have
different properties

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:07.835
and I can modify the padding.

00:06:07.835 --> 00:06:10.265
I'm going to hold down the
option key on my keyboard

00:06:10.265 --> 00:06:13.040
or Alt key and just
left-click and

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.020
drag to modify the padding from

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.500
both sides simultaneously,
just like that.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.810
And as you can see,
it turned blue.

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.360
And it means that these
properties are coming

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.165
from this class, this
particular class.

00:06:26.165 --> 00:06:29.495
Alright, now let's make
another change to this button.

00:06:29.495 --> 00:06:33.140
I'm going to modify its
color, something else.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.295
Okay, Cool.

00:06:34.295 --> 00:06:37.880
Now what I'm gonna do is
add another button here.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:38.675
There we go.

00:06:38.675 --> 00:06:41.930
And I'm going to apply the
same class to this new button.

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.770
So let's look for
primary button.

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.390
All the stylings have been

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.655
applied to this new
button as well.

00:06:49.655 --> 00:06:53.375
But what if I want to create
variations for my button?

00:06:53.375 --> 00:06:54.515
Well, in this case,

00:06:54.515 --> 00:06:58.325
we can use something very
useful, a combo class.

00:06:58.325 --> 00:07:00.710
A combo class is a
type of class that

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.050
is built upon your base class.

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.275
Right now, we have created
the base class, okay?

00:07:06.275 --> 00:07:08.495
And if I want to
create a combo class,

00:07:08.495 --> 00:07:10.250
I can just click somewhere here.

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:12.875
And as you can see, it
says new combo class.

00:07:12.875 --> 00:07:13.280
Why?

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.800
Because we already have
the base class and we can

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.310
create a combo class on
top of this base class.

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:22.040
So let's write light.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.825
But nothing happened.

00:07:23.825 --> 00:07:25.160
Of course nothing
happens because

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.750
we didn't change anything.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:29.225
Now that we created
this combo class,

00:07:29.225 --> 00:07:31.069
this element is inheriting

00:07:31.069 --> 00:07:34.070
the styling from two
different classes.

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:36.950
It first inherits
all the properties

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.050
from the primary button class,

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:40.310
and then it inherits

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:43.040
more properties from
the Light class.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.530
So first, all the properties of

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:48.845
the primary button class will
be applied to this button.

00:07:48.845 --> 00:07:51.950
And then if we modify
something here,

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:54.035
since we created a combo class,

00:07:54.035 --> 00:07:57.995
it overrides those properties
from the primary button.

00:07:57.995 --> 00:07:59.210
It's so powerful.

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:02.600
Let's suppose I want to
create a light button here.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.625
I'm going to modify
the color too,

00:08:04.625 --> 00:08:07.355
white, and as you can
see, it turns blue.

00:08:07.355 --> 00:08:08.705
And I'm going to modify

00:08:08.705 --> 00:08:12.470
the typography color here
to black, just like that.

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:14.990
So let me explain what happened.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.270
As you can see,
the spacing didn't

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:20.075
change and we have
this amber color here.

00:08:20.075 --> 00:08:22.220
It means that these
properties are

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.130
coming from our
primary button class.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:28.294
However, if we head over
to the background section,

00:08:28.294 --> 00:08:30.425
you can see that we
have this blue color

00:08:30.425 --> 00:08:32.630
and it means that this color,

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:34.610
this particular property comes

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:36.740
from the light combo class.

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.390
But to understand it better,

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:41.000
I'm going to select
the primary button.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.805
As you can see, there is
only one class applied.

00:08:43.805 --> 00:08:45.485
We don't have any combo class.

00:08:45.485 --> 00:08:49.565
And I'm going to modify
the padding 30-40,

00:08:49.565 --> 00:08:51.020
okay, just like that.

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.940
And as you can see,
the change I made

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:56.000
here automatically
applied to this button,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.680
although we had a combo class.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:58.175
Why?

00:08:58.175 --> 00:09:00.305
Because when we created
the combo class,

00:09:00.305 --> 00:09:02.495
we didn't touch the
spacing property.

00:09:02.495 --> 00:09:05.030
We only modify the
background's color.

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:07.010
That's how combo classes work.

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:09.590
They are built on top
of our base class.

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:11.929
Apart from these two classes,

00:09:11.929 --> 00:09:13.985
the base class and
the combo class,

00:09:13.985 --> 00:09:15.905
we have another type of class

00:09:15.905 --> 00:09:18.140
which is called a global class.

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:19.580
Let me show you how it works.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:21.440
I'm going to go ahead
and drag and drop

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.005
a div blog here
into my container.

00:09:24.005 --> 00:09:26.195
There we go. This is
an empty div block.

00:09:26.195 --> 00:09:28.445
I'm gonna go ahead and
assign a class to it.

00:09:28.445 --> 00:09:29.540
So I'm going to create

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:33.005
a new class and let's
call it shadow.

00:09:33.005 --> 00:09:34.760
I'm going to put it outside

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.860
my container that you
could see it better.

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:39.290
Okay, it's right
here at the top,

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:41.375
and I gave it this shadow class.

00:09:41.375 --> 00:09:44.585
Now I'm gonna go to the Effects
section, and from here,

00:09:44.585 --> 00:09:47.120
I'm going to click on
this plus button to add

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.360
some shadows to this
particular div block.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.255
As you can see, the shadow
has been added here.

00:09:53.255 --> 00:09:55.415
I'm going to modify
the properties,

00:09:55.415 --> 00:09:58.325
the blur amount and the size.

00:09:58.325 --> 00:10:00.965
And let me modify
the opacity as well.

00:10:00.965 --> 00:10:02.120
Okay, cool.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.175
Now we have a global class.

00:10:04.175 --> 00:10:06.020
What does it mean
whenever we want to

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.540
apply some specific stylings,

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:11.015
too many elements
on our webpage,

00:10:11.015 --> 00:10:14.240
we can use global classes, e.g.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.545
let's suppose we have

00:10:15.545 --> 00:10:18.560
different buttons and we
have different images.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.600
Let me go ahead
and drag and drop

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.510
an image here that you
could see it better.

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:25.460
I'm going to decrease
its width to

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:28.010
300 pixels are right, cool.

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:29.690
So let's suppose we want to have

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:33.035
a consistent drop shadow
for all our elements.

00:10:33.035 --> 00:10:36.185
In this case, I'm going to
select my primary button here,

00:10:36.185 --> 00:10:38.660
and I'm going to add
our global class to it.

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.445
So let's look for shadow.

00:10:40.445 --> 00:10:43.505
As you can see, it says
global combo classes.

00:10:43.505 --> 00:10:45.935
There we go. The shadow
has been added here.

00:10:45.935 --> 00:10:48.170
Now I'm going to select
this primary button,

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:50.675
and here I'm going
to write shadow.

00:10:50.675 --> 00:10:51.650
There we go.

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:53.210
The shadow has been applied.

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:55.925
And let's do the same
thing for this image.

00:10:55.925 --> 00:10:58.025
There is no class here.

00:10:58.025 --> 00:11:01.475
So first I'm going to
give it a class image,

00:11:01.475 --> 00:11:03.065
and then I'm going to add

00:11:03.065 --> 00:11:06.305
the shadow global class
to that, just like that.

00:11:06.305 --> 00:11:07.745
So as you can see, now,

00:11:07.745 --> 00:11:12.065
these three elements use
our shadow global class.

00:11:12.065 --> 00:11:14.210
But what if I want to modify

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:17.585
the properties of this
shadow global class?

00:11:17.585 --> 00:11:19.220
I can select this div blank.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.020
This is a temporary elements.

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:23.615
I can simply remove that
and nothing happens.

00:11:23.615 --> 00:11:24.890
But if I want to modify

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:27.455
the properties of
this global class,

00:11:27.455 --> 00:11:29.600
I'm going to need to
select this diblock.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.940
And let's suppose
I want to change,

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.055
let's say size, amount here.

00:11:34.055 --> 00:11:36.635
As you can see, the
changes applied to

00:11:36.635 --> 00:11:40.820
all those elements that are
using our global class.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:42.290
If you're familiar with

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:45.380
different design software
like Figma or sketch,

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:48.395
for sure you have
used styles in Figma.

00:11:48.395 --> 00:11:51.635
We can create color,
size, typography styles.

00:11:51.635 --> 00:11:54.125
This is the exact same concept.

00:11:54.125 --> 00:11:56.870
We create our styles
once and we apply them

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:59.615
to multiple elements again
and again and again.

00:11:59.615 --> 00:12:02.000
And this way when we want
to make some changes,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.395
we can do it once.

00:12:03.395 --> 00:12:06.320
The changes apply immediately to

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.955
all the elements that are using

00:12:07.955 --> 00:12:10.580
that specific class
are right guys,

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:12.185
that's all for this video.

00:12:12.185 --> 00:12:14.435
I hope you enjoyed
it and I hope now

00:12:14.435 --> 00:12:17.045
you have a better
understanding of classes.

00:12:17.045 --> 00:12:19.340
We will use classes
almost all the

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:22.265
time when we work
on our projects.

00:12:22.265 --> 00:12:25.130
So make sure to understand
the concept of classes

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:26.960
properly since we are going to

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.165
use them across our projects.

00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:31.980
I'll see you in the next video.
