00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.900
Any modern website nowadays,

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.900
users animations and
interactions in order

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.065
to improve the usability
and user experience,

00:00:13.065 --> 00:00:16.065
and eventually it can
improve the conversion rate.

00:00:16.065 --> 00:00:19.050
So let's take a look at
Apple's website as an example,

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.460
if I scroll down here,

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.265
you can see that these
elements fade-in.

00:00:23.265 --> 00:00:24.795
I'm going to scroll down.

00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:27.315
You can see that we have
this kind of interaction.

00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:29.265
This text block is animated.

00:00:29.265 --> 00:00:31.200
I'm going to scroll down here.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.350
When I scroll, you can see
that these textblock scales

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.594
now as I scroll down
these elements,

00:00:37.594 --> 00:00:40.295
this image and this
textblock fading.

00:00:40.295 --> 00:00:42.890
So these are the kinds
of animation that make

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.559
a difference when it
comes to web development,

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.260
building a responsive
website is one thing,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
but making it look more
interesting is another thing.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.574
By adding interactions and
animations to our website,

00:00:54.574 --> 00:00:56.810
we can improve the
user experience and

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.169
our users will enjoy
interacting with our product.

00:01:00.169 --> 00:01:02.945
So let me show you how
interactions work on Webflow.

00:01:02.945 --> 00:01:04.610
When it comes to interactions,

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.205
we have two main
components to work with,

00:01:07.205 --> 00:01:09.500
the trigger and the animation.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.120
So what's the trigger?

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.300
A trigger is something that
triggers the animation.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.925
In simple words, when
something happens,

00:01:16.925 --> 00:01:18.485
another thing should happen.

00:01:18.485 --> 00:01:22.265
So e.g. if a button is
clicked, it should grow.

00:01:22.265 --> 00:01:23.840
If the user hovers over

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.135
something and other
objects should move.

00:01:26.135 --> 00:01:28.925
In general, we have
two kinds of triggers.

00:01:28.925 --> 00:01:30.440
We have the element trickier,

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.465
and we have the page trigger.

00:01:32.465 --> 00:01:34.055
Let me show you how it works.

00:01:34.055 --> 00:01:36.485
If I head over to the
interactions panel

00:01:36.485 --> 00:01:37.895
on the right side here,

00:01:37.895 --> 00:01:40.595
as you can see there is
this thunderbolt icon.

00:01:40.595 --> 00:01:41.870
I'm going to click on that.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.135
Here is where we can
create a trigger.

00:01:44.135 --> 00:01:45.200
As I mentioned before,

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.850
we have the element trickier

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.530
and we have the page trigger.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.030
Well, what's the
difference between

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.220
the elementary year
and the page trigger?

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.705
We use the element trigger.

00:01:53.705 --> 00:01:56.030
When the trigger is
an element, e.g. a.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.485
Button, an image, a text
block heading, anything.

00:02:00.485 --> 00:02:02.360
We can select our elements and

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.550
then we can create
these elements trigger,

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.310
and when the user interacts
with that element,

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.110
it triggers our animation.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.910
But what about page trigger?

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.935
Well, the page trigger triggers

00:02:12.935 --> 00:02:17.240
our animation when our page
state is changed, e.g.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.655
if I click on this plus icon,

00:02:19.655 --> 00:02:22.805
you can see we have
mouse move in, viewport,

00:02:22.805 --> 00:02:26.645
wild pages scrolling,
page, load, page scrolled.

00:02:26.645 --> 00:02:28.700
In this case, we don't
need to click on something

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.785
or interact with any element.

00:02:30.785 --> 00:02:33.410
The trigger is our page itself,

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.575
so we can specify when the
page is loaded completely.

00:02:36.575 --> 00:02:39.290
Then play this
particular animation.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.105
Let me show you
some examples here.

00:02:41.105 --> 00:02:43.925
As you can see here, I
have some simple elements.

00:02:43.925 --> 00:02:46.265
I have a circle, I have
a square root here.

00:02:46.265 --> 00:02:48.650
I'm going to preview this
and I'm going to show you

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.485
some examples of the
element trigger.

00:02:51.485 --> 00:02:55.145
Here. This circle
is our trigger.

00:02:55.145 --> 00:02:57.575
I already created an
interaction for that.

00:02:57.575 --> 00:03:00.035
And when I click on it,
something should happen.

00:03:00.035 --> 00:03:02.195
You need to keep in
mind that the trigger

00:03:02.195 --> 00:03:04.609
shouldn't always animate itself.

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:06.815
So if I click on this circle,

00:03:06.815 --> 00:03:10.519
the animation shouldn't
necessarily occur on this object.

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.875
I can set a trigger
on this object,

00:03:12.875 --> 00:03:15.350
and I can make other
elements animate,

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.395
like in this case, if I
click on this circle,

00:03:18.395 --> 00:03:19.790
this square should move to

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.830
the right side. Let me show you.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.540
There we go. So in this case,

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.789
this circle is our trigger.

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:29.105
And once it's triggered,
this square moves.

00:03:29.105 --> 00:03:31.910
But what if I want to
animate the trigger itself?

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.215
We can do that as well.

00:03:33.215 --> 00:03:36.095
E.g. we can set an
element trickier.

00:03:36.095 --> 00:03:39.635
And we can say, if the user
hovers over these elements,

00:03:39.635 --> 00:03:41.840
these elements
should change, e.g.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.090
it should grow, it should move,

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.270
it should fade out
anything you can imagine,

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.984
if I hover over
this orange circle,

00:03:49.984 --> 00:03:51.904
we get this bounce animation.

00:03:51.904 --> 00:03:53.075
So in this case,

00:03:53.075 --> 00:03:55.655
the trigger itself is animated.

00:03:55.655 --> 00:03:57.335
I'm going to show
you another example.

00:03:57.335 --> 00:04:00.035
If I click on this square
on the right side,

00:04:00.035 --> 00:04:02.015
it will animate as well.

00:04:02.015 --> 00:04:03.605
Just like that.

00:04:03.605 --> 00:04:04.610
Let's recap.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.055
In order to understand
how the animation work,

00:04:07.055 --> 00:04:09.665
you need to understand how
the interaction works.

00:04:09.665 --> 00:04:12.890
So in general, we have
two main components.

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.154
We have the trigger
and the animation.

00:04:15.154 --> 00:04:17.255
If our trigger is triggered,

00:04:17.255 --> 00:04:18.965
then the animation should occur.

00:04:18.965 --> 00:04:22.235
So let me show you how I
created these animations.

00:04:22.235 --> 00:04:23.945
I'm gonna go to my designer.

00:04:23.945 --> 00:04:26.600
If I go to the interactions
here, as you can see,

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.340
I don't have any trigger,

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.650
so I'm gonna go ahead
and select this circle.

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:31.880
And once I select it,

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.830
you can see that the
element tree here

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.885
that I already created is there.

00:04:35.885 --> 00:04:38.000
I'm going to remove
that for a second

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.580
because I'm going to show
you how I created it.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.455
If I click on this icon,

00:04:42.455 --> 00:04:43.580
I can remove that.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.755
Now I don't have any
element trigger.

00:04:45.755 --> 00:04:48.950
So since this circle is
going to be our trigger,

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.255
I'm going to select it,

00:04:50.255 --> 00:04:52.970
and then I'm going to hit
this plus button here.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.370
And here, I can choose
from different options.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.735
Let's see what we have.

00:04:56.735 --> 00:04:58.955
We have mouse-click tap,

00:04:58.955 --> 00:05:00.815
we have mouse hover,

00:05:00.815 --> 00:05:03.095
we have mouse move over element.

00:05:03.095 --> 00:05:05.180
We have scroll into view,

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.505
and we have wild
scrolling in view.

00:05:07.505 --> 00:05:11.180
We have other options that
are not available now, e.g.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.510
nav bar opens only
works for navbars or

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.990
drop-down opens only works
for drop-down menus.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.705
But in this case, we're
going to use mouse click.

00:05:20.705 --> 00:05:22.955
When the user clicks
on the circle,

00:05:22.955 --> 00:05:24.575
the animation should play.

00:05:24.575 --> 00:05:26.540
I'm going to choose
mouse-click tap.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:27.275
There we go.

00:05:27.275 --> 00:05:30.380
And here is where we
can specify our action.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.575
So it says on first
click, on second click,

00:05:33.575 --> 00:05:36.035
it means I can specify
one animation for

00:05:36.035 --> 00:05:37.940
the first clique and specify

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.950
another animation for
the second click.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.904
For this example, we
only want one animation.

00:05:42.904 --> 00:05:45.260
So I'm gonna go to
unfairness clique.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.045
If I open up this drop menu,

00:05:47.045 --> 00:05:48.350
I can select an action.

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.930
I can either create a
custom animation by

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.630
using these stars and
animation option,

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.270
or I can use quick effects, e.g.

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:01.130
fade, slide, flip,
grow, grow, big, etc.

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:02.825
We're going to talk about it.

00:06:02.825 --> 00:06:04.730
But for now, I'm
going to show you how

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:06.770
you can create a
custom animation.

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.665
So I'm going to click
on Start Animation.

00:06:09.665 --> 00:06:12.844
And here is the animation
that we already created.

00:06:12.844 --> 00:06:14.000
I can either choose

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.835
this animation or I can
create a new animation.

00:06:16.835 --> 00:06:20.015
So I'm gonna go ahead and
remove this for a second.

00:06:20.015 --> 00:06:22.115
So here we don't
have any animations,

00:06:22.115 --> 00:06:24.335
and I'm going to create
a new animation here,

00:06:24.335 --> 00:06:25.805
and I need to name that.

00:06:25.805 --> 00:06:28.955
Let's write move square.

00:06:28.955 --> 00:06:30.530
Why did I name it like this?

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:34.250
Because this trigger is going
to make this square move.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.765
I'm going to press Enter.

00:06:35.765 --> 00:06:38.194
Now, I need to
create some actions.

00:06:38.194 --> 00:06:40.130
Here is our timeline.

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.425
If I click on this plus button,

00:06:42.425 --> 00:06:44.435
I can choose between
different options.

00:06:44.435 --> 00:06:46.655
Move, scale, rotate, skew,

00:06:46.655 --> 00:06:49.040
opacity filter, BG color,

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.425
border color, text color, etc.

00:06:51.425 --> 00:06:54.095
These are the properties
that I can animate.

00:06:54.095 --> 00:06:57.365
But first, let's see how we
should animate our elements.

00:06:57.365 --> 00:06:59.150
This circle is our trigger,

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.535
and so far we
created our trigger.

00:07:01.535 --> 00:07:04.025
Now we want to
animate this square.

00:07:04.025 --> 00:07:06.635
Therefore, once we
are in the timeline,

00:07:06.635 --> 00:07:09.245
you need to select the element
that you want to animate.

00:07:09.245 --> 00:07:11.345
In this case, it's r-squared.

00:07:11.345 --> 00:07:12.710
I'm going to select it.

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.480
And once it's selected,

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.505
I'm going to click
on this plus button.

00:07:16.505 --> 00:07:18.290
And since I'm going to move it,

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:20.645
I just want to
change its location.

00:07:20.645 --> 00:07:22.010
I'm going to select Move.

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:25.054
We created a point or
let's say a keyframe.

00:07:25.054 --> 00:07:27.890
Here I've got a
warning and it says

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:30.800
this move action doesn't
have a value applied.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.060
That's fine because we didn't

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.340
modify anything here
in the timeline.

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.170
Here we have the
time and we have

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:38.750
the starting point
and the end point.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.540
So far we created
the first keyframe.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.880
Now I'm going to go to
the end point and I'm

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.415
going to click to create
another keyframe.

00:07:46.415 --> 00:07:47.630
It's going to be moved.

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:49.160
We've got this warning as well

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.780
because we didn't
change anything.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:52.445
So let's see what we wanna do

00:07:52.445 --> 00:07:54.635
when the user clicks
on this circle,

00:07:54.635 --> 00:07:57.185
this square should move
to the right side.

00:07:57.185 --> 00:08:00.665
Therefore, we created
our first keyframe here,

00:08:00.665 --> 00:08:01.970
and we don't need to modify

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:03.965
its position because
the animation

00:08:03.965 --> 00:08:05.540
should start from here and

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.580
then it should move
to the right side.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:08.990
So I'm going to select this

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:11.254
second keyframe that we created.

00:08:11.254 --> 00:08:13.610
And then if I scroll down here,

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:16.025
you can see that I
have this Move option.

00:08:16.025 --> 00:08:17.389
We have many properties

00:08:17.389 --> 00:08:18.965
here that we're
going to talk about.

00:08:18.965 --> 00:08:21.665
But now let's modify
the move properties.

00:08:21.665 --> 00:08:24.335
I can change the
x, y, and z axis.

00:08:24.335 --> 00:08:26.270
I'm going to change the x axis.

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:28.190
So let's use this slider.

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:31.384
I'm going to move
it by 100 pixels.

00:08:31.384 --> 00:08:34.160
That's right, 100 pixels, nice.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.244
Now I'm going to hit Save

00:08:36.244 --> 00:08:38.720
and our animation
has been created,

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.805
as you can see, it
says move square.

00:08:40.805 --> 00:08:43.910
And if you want to make any
changes to your animation,

00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:45.740
you can just click
on it and you will

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.810
go inside your timeline.

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:50.000
You can select these keyframes

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.595
and you can make any
changes you want.

00:08:52.595 --> 00:08:54.620
But for now, it looks fine.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.090
Let me preview that.

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:58.834
And now this circle
is our trigger.

00:08:58.834 --> 00:09:00.080
I'm going to click on it.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.660
There we go. This
square has been moved.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.940
So this is generally
how the interaction

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.205
and animations work on Webflow,

00:09:07.205 --> 00:09:10.160
you can simply create
complex animations

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.860
visually without
writing a single line

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.005
of code that's so powerful.

00:09:15.005 --> 00:09:16.775
I'm going to show
you another example.

00:09:16.775 --> 00:09:20.164
Let's suppose this circle
is going to be the trigger,

00:09:20.164 --> 00:09:21.935
but it's going to
animate itself.

00:09:21.935 --> 00:09:24.635
So I'm going to show
you how it's possible.

00:09:24.635 --> 00:09:27.215
If the user clicks on
it, it's going to move.

00:09:27.215 --> 00:09:29.749
So the element
trigger is created,

00:09:29.749 --> 00:09:32.315
as you can see, we
already created that.

00:09:32.315 --> 00:09:33.695
I'm going to click on it.

00:09:33.695 --> 00:09:36.680
And inside, I don't
want to use this move

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.480
Square animation
because I'm going

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.460
to animate this circle itself.

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.385
I'm going to create another
time the animation here,

00:09:43.385 --> 00:09:46.834
and I'm going to
write move circle.

00:09:46.834 --> 00:09:51.650
Then let's create an action
and I'm going to choose move.

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:54.110
I'm going to create
another keyframe here.

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:55.370
And let's choose Move.

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:57.170
And here I'm going to move it to

00:09:57.170 --> 00:10:00.050
the right side again.
Let me save it.

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:03.560
And here makes sure to choose
the Move circle animation,

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:04.715
not the move square.

00:10:04.715 --> 00:10:07.355
I can click on Preview
to preview that.

00:10:07.355 --> 00:10:09.215
And also I can go here.

00:10:09.215 --> 00:10:10.550
And if I click on it,

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:14.015
now this circle is
animated, not the square.

00:10:14.015 --> 00:10:15.740
So you need to understand
the difference

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:18.815
between a trigger
and the animation.

00:10:18.815 --> 00:10:21.380
You should always create a
trigger and then you need

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:24.170
to decide which elements
should be animated.

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.435
And remember, when you
create a tree here,

00:10:26.435 --> 00:10:29.480
you are not limited to
animate only one element.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.670
You can animate
multiple elements.

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:33.200
Let me show you how it works.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.570
Let's suppose when I
click on this circle,

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:37.760
I want these two squares

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.190
and how can you do
that? It's so simple.

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:43.655
First, I'm gonna go ahead
and create a trigger.

00:10:43.655 --> 00:10:46.040
The trigger is created already.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.200
I'm gonna go to the
Animation section

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.865
on first click here.

00:10:49.865 --> 00:10:51.665
I'm going to choose Move square

00:10:51.665 --> 00:10:53.600
because we're going to
move this square here.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.890
And if I go inside,

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:56.945
I created two keyframes here.

00:10:56.945 --> 00:10:58.250
But for these square,

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:00.575
if I go ahead and
select square root two,

00:11:00.575 --> 00:11:02.900
and I create another
keyframe here,

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.175
and I say move,

00:11:04.175 --> 00:11:06.605
then I can move it to
the right side as well.

00:11:06.605 --> 00:11:10.190
Let's move it by 100
pixels, just like that.

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:11.810
And let me save it.

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:13.805
Now, if I click on this circle,

00:11:13.805 --> 00:11:17.255
these two squares should
move simultaneously.

00:11:17.255 --> 00:11:18.770
Let's see what happens.

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:20.599
But did you see what happened?

00:11:20.599 --> 00:11:24.410
First the square moved and
then this square moved.

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:27.290
Why can't we just move
them at the same time?

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:30.095
We can, if I head
over to my timeline,

00:11:30.095 --> 00:11:32.615
if I select this move
Square animation here,

00:11:32.615 --> 00:11:34.730
as you can see, these square two

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:37.010
elements has a
separate keyframe.

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:40.715
If I want these two elements
to animate at the same time,

00:11:40.715 --> 00:11:44.360
I need to select this square
root two and I need to drag

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:47.930
it and group it with my first
square, just like that.

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:50.555
Now at the animation
occurs at the same time,

00:11:50.555 --> 00:11:51.845
I'm going to hit save.

00:11:51.845 --> 00:11:53.450
And let's see what happens.

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:54.380
There we go.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:55.790
But they are too slow.

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:57.455
Can I modify their speed?

00:11:57.455 --> 00:11:58.580
Of course you can.

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:00.305
Let's go to our timeline.

00:12:00.305 --> 00:12:03.155
And here, if I select
my two squares,

00:12:03.155 --> 00:12:04.580
I can hold down the Shift key on

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:07.130
my keyboard and click
on them one way, one.

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:08.360
Here in the timing,

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.830
I have different options.

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:11.570
I have the delay option,

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:14.045
I have easing and duration.

00:12:14.045 --> 00:12:16.325
The duration is set
to half a second.

00:12:16.325 --> 00:12:19.670
I'm going to decrease it to 0.2.

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:22.670
And if I save now I'm
going to preview it,

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:24.215
It's much quicker now,

00:12:24.215 --> 00:12:26.180
our rights so far
you learned how

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:28.985
the interactions and
animations work in Webflow.

00:12:28.985 --> 00:12:31.250
In the next video, we're
going to start creating

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.995
some animations for
our circle project.

00:12:33.995 --> 00:12:35.030
And we will talk about

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:38.540
the page trigger and some
advanced animations.

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:41.250
So see you in the next video.
