00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.885
Hey, in this video,

00:00:06.885 --> 00:00:09.975
we're going to create
this CTA section.

00:00:09.975 --> 00:00:12.255
Ctas stands who are
called to action,

00:00:12.255 --> 00:00:13.440
and it usually grabs

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.550
the user's e-mail address
or name and email address

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.120
to send him or her hair
some files or let say,

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.800
some news or any

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.815
information that the
user is looking for.

00:00:25.815 --> 00:00:28.740
This call to action
section has a form.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.270
As you can see, this form has

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.930
a text field and also
the subscribe button.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.430
So let's see how we
should structure that.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.225
First, we have a section,

00:00:38.225 --> 00:00:42.154
I need to modify its
name to CTA section.

00:00:42.154 --> 00:00:45.439
And this section, just like
our testimonial section,

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:46.850
has a specific width.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.320
So it doesn't take up

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.735
the whole width of
our view port window.

00:00:50.735 --> 00:00:52.940
Therefore, we're going
to set a specific width

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.130
for that 13, 20 pixels.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.235
As you can see here, it
requires a background color.

00:00:58.235 --> 00:00:59.675
So we're going to use

00:00:59.675 --> 00:01:02.630
the secondary color for
the background here.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.449
And then once our
section is created,

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.000
we need a container as usual.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.639
And finally, inside
this container,

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:12.800
we're going to have one heading,

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.310
one takes blog, and
also a form block.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.620
This form block is going to have

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.140
a TextField wrapper
and a button.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.675
Okay, So nothing complicated.

00:01:23.675 --> 00:01:26.540
We just need to stick to the
rules and we just need to

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.050
use flexbox in order to
align these elements.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.890
Are you ready?

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:31.985
Let's begin.

00:01:31.985 --> 00:01:32.780
First.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.375
I'm gonna go ahead and
select my buddy here.

00:01:35.375 --> 00:01:38.390
And then I'm going
to look for section.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.570
Just like that. Let
me give it a class.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.420
I'm gonna give it the
section class here.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.135
And also I'm gonna give
you the combo class.

00:01:47.135 --> 00:01:49.025
Let's call it CTA.

00:01:49.025 --> 00:01:50.840
As you can see, we can see

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.780
the section because there is
nothing inside our section.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.640
So first, I'm going to go ahead

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.815
and give it a maximum width of

00:01:57.815 --> 00:02:04.834
1,320 pixels and also a
specific height of 500 pixels.

00:02:04.834 --> 00:02:05.540
Okay?

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.790
So if I take a
look at my design,

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.345
you can see that its
height is 500 pixels.

00:02:11.345 --> 00:02:13.280
I could set it to auto as well,

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.280
but I prefer to have a
specific height here.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.530
So now we need to
center our section.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.760
How can we do that?

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.630
You're right.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.840
I can head over to the spacing
section and I can click on

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.220
this button to center

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.740
the element horizontally,
just like that.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.420
The next thing we need to do is

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.175
change the background scholar.

00:02:31.175 --> 00:02:32.450
So if I head over to

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.870
the background section and
I click on this color here,

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.550
using this color picker,

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.010
I can use one of my swatches.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.960
I'm going to use
the secondary or

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.180
write our section is ready.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.879
Now inside, as usual,

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:48.604
we're going to need a container.

00:02:48.604 --> 00:02:50.705
So wildly section is selected.

00:02:50.705 --> 00:02:53.435
I'm gonna hit Command
key or Control K.

00:02:53.435 --> 00:02:55.505
And let's look for a def block.

00:02:55.505 --> 00:02:57.530
This block doesn't
have any class.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.830
So let's go ahead and give
it the container class.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.405
Okay, Nice.

00:03:02.405 --> 00:03:05.060
Our container is ready as well.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.745
So what do we need in
scientists container?

00:03:07.745 --> 00:03:09.680
We're going to need a heading.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.570
It takes block and a form block.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.250
So first I'm going to give this

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.250
container a combo class CTA,

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.020
and then I'm gonna
hit Command key or

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.345
Control K and look for heading.

00:03:20.345 --> 00:03:23.435
Let's change the heading
time to age three.

00:03:23.435 --> 00:03:25.370
And also I'm going
to give it a class.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.880
So here I'm going to
write CTA underscore,

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.430
underscore heading, and let's

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.580
modify some of its
topography properties.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.545
Alright, the weight
is going to be bold.

00:03:36.545 --> 00:03:39.829
However, the size is
going to be 40 pixels.

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:42.665
The color is going to be
neutral dark as well.

00:03:42.665 --> 00:03:45.860
Now, I'm gonna go ahead
and copy this text from

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.055
here and paste it
right over there.

00:03:49.055 --> 00:03:50.885
Okay, our heading is ready.

00:03:50.885 --> 00:03:52.955
Now we need a textblock.

00:03:52.955 --> 00:03:56.570
So let's select our container
using the QuickFind.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.155
I'm gonna go ahead and
look for a textblock,

00:04:00.155 --> 00:04:01.865
and I'm going to
give it a class.

00:04:01.865 --> 00:04:07.280
Let's write CTA underscore,
underscore, subtitle.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.110
And I'm going to modify some

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.570
of its topography properties.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.895
So the only thing we
need to do here is

00:04:13.895 --> 00:04:17.240
change the size
here to 17 pixels.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.295
We don't need to
touch anything else.

00:04:19.295 --> 00:04:20.495
Alright, great.

00:04:20.495 --> 00:04:24.065
Now let me go ahead
and copy this text.

00:04:24.065 --> 00:04:25.865
Let us help you.

00:04:25.865 --> 00:04:27.020
Just like that.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.630
Our right, our texts
layers are ready.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.505
Now we need a form block.

00:04:31.505 --> 00:04:33.590
So let me select this container.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.110
You can either go
to the Add section

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.960
and just drag and drop
a form block here,

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.840
or wireless container
is selected,

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.600
you can hit Command key
or Control K to open up

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.465
the quick find and
look for a form luck,

00:04:47.465 --> 00:04:49.100
we've got our form blank.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.260
However, we have
two text fields.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.520
We have two text fields,

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.845
labels, and also we
have a button here.

00:04:54.845 --> 00:04:58.025
But for this section we
just need one takes filled.

00:04:58.025 --> 00:05:00.080
We don't need any label and

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.345
we need to modify the
button a little bit.

00:05:02.345 --> 00:05:04.460
So let's go ahead and select

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.045
the field label from the
navigator and remove that,

00:05:08.045 --> 00:05:11.389
hit the backspace or delete
key on your keyboard.

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:13.760
I'm going to remove the
text field as well.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.490
Now I'm going to remove
this field label.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.365
We don't need any field label.

00:05:18.365 --> 00:05:20.840
So right now I have one takes

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.540
thrilled and one Submit button.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.315
First, I'm going to
select this form diblock.

00:05:26.315 --> 00:05:30.095
And as you can see, it's display
setting is set to block.

00:05:30.095 --> 00:05:32.270
I'm going to change
it to Flexbox.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.000
Now the direction is
set to horizontal.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.920
That's exactly what we need.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.990
So we've got the layout
we're looking for.

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.690
However, if you take a
look at the design file,

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:42.830
you can see that we have

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.490
this placeholder text
and also this icon.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.540
So let's go ahead and modify
our TextField a little bit.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.525
This text field has a
specific width and height.

00:05:53.525 --> 00:05:58.760
The width is 393 pixels and
the height is 80 pixels.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.140
Therefore, I'm going to select

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.230
this text field and I'm
going to change its width to

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:08.270
a 393 pixels and its
height to ADP cells.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.370
But as you can see,
this text field by

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.830
default has some bottom margins.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.975
I'm going to go ahead
and remove that.

00:06:14.975 --> 00:06:17.975
Let's set the bottom
margin to zero.

00:06:17.975 --> 00:06:21.755
Now, this text field is
aligned with this pattern.

00:06:21.755 --> 00:06:24.335
But what about the
placeholder text?

00:06:24.335 --> 00:06:25.475
Well, if you remember,

00:06:25.475 --> 00:06:27.920
if I double-click on
this text field here,

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.275
I can specify the
placeholder text.

00:06:30.275 --> 00:06:34.025
So let me write,
enter your email.

00:06:34.025 --> 00:06:35.915
And the text type is going to be

00:06:35.915 --> 00:06:38.090
email and it's going
to be required.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.070
The name is going to
be e-mail as well.

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.985
Alright, cool.

00:06:40.985 --> 00:06:43.175
But how can we add an icon here?

00:06:43.175 --> 00:06:46.175
Well, since we are using
a text field elements,

00:06:46.175 --> 00:06:49.025
we can just simply go
ahead and add an icon.

00:06:49.025 --> 00:06:52.610
Therefore, we need to be
creative and we need to use what

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.135
we learned so far in order
to add an icon here.

00:06:56.135 --> 00:06:57.920
So what I propose is this.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.260
First, I'm gonna
go ahead and add

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.230
some more left padding
to this text field.

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:07.204
So I'm going to change
its padding to 70 pixels,

00:07:07.204 --> 00:07:09.635
and then I'm going
to modify its color.

00:07:09.635 --> 00:07:11.045
As you can see here,

00:07:11.045 --> 00:07:14.810
the color of this text
layer is neutral dark.

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:18.440
So do you remember how we can
modify the CSS properties?

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.365
This placeholder sex?
Yes, you're right.

00:07:21.365 --> 00:07:23.465
We need to select
our text field.

00:07:23.465 --> 00:07:26.045
And then if we head
over to the selector,

00:07:26.045 --> 00:07:29.240
we can go to the
place holder state.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.880
From here, I can just
adjust the color.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.125
As you can see, it says the
text color is set to neutral,

00:07:36.125 --> 00:07:37.805
dark already, but it's not.

00:07:37.805 --> 00:07:39.605
It's just an annoying bark.

00:07:39.605 --> 00:07:41.720
So if I just click
on it and I choose

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.970
this color once
again, There we go.

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:46.685
Now the color has been
applied properly.

00:07:46.685 --> 00:07:48.350
Alright, the color is fine now,

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:49.700
but we need an icon.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.325
Therefore, I'm going
to create a div block,

00:07:52.325 --> 00:07:54.980
and I'm going to put
these texts field and

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:56.840
a new div blank insight

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.705
that in order to align
everything perfectly.

00:07:59.705 --> 00:08:02.645
So first, why in this
form is selected?

00:08:02.645 --> 00:08:04.655
I'm gonna hit Command
key or Control

00:08:04.655 --> 00:08:07.054
K. And let's look for a diblock.

00:08:07.054 --> 00:08:08.945
Then I'm going to
give it a class.

00:08:08.945 --> 00:08:11.390
Let's call it CTA, underscore,

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:15.985
underscore, TextField,
underscore underscore wrapper.

00:08:15.985 --> 00:08:20.210
Then I'm going to drag this
text field and drop it

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:24.665
inside this CTA takes field
wrapper that we just created.

00:08:24.665 --> 00:08:26.885
And I'm going to move
this wrapper up,

00:08:26.885 --> 00:08:29.045
just reorder rate
in the navigator.

00:08:29.045 --> 00:08:31.280
Now while these new div block,

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.050
this wrapper is selected,

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:36.950
I'm gonna go ahead and add a
new div block for our icon.

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:39.350
So let's look for the if block.

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:43.580
Great, and this diblock
is inside this wrapper.

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.515
So let me select this def block

00:08:45.515 --> 00:08:47.030
and I'm gonna give
you the class.

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:51.859
I'm going to write TextField
underscore, underscore icon.

00:08:51.859 --> 00:08:55.565
And this icon should have a
specific width and height.

00:08:55.565 --> 00:08:59.390
So if I go to my design file
and I select this icon,

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:01.130
you can see that its
width and height

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:03.080
are set to 30 pixels.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.945
So I'm going to give you the
specific width and height.

00:09:05.945 --> 00:09:08.105
I'm going to write 30 pixels.

00:09:08.105 --> 00:09:08.840
There we go.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.460
And as you know, we
need to head over to

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:14.150
the background section and we
need to add our icon here.

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:17.149
So let me look for
the mail icon.

00:09:17.149 --> 00:09:19.595
Alright, nice, or icon is here.

00:09:19.595 --> 00:09:22.535
Everything looks great
except its position.

00:09:22.535 --> 00:09:25.460
So how can we position
this icon right here?

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:27.320
Well, do you remember
when we talked

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.495
about the position
property here,

00:09:29.495 --> 00:09:31.010
I'm going to set the position of

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:34.625
this block to apps to
do it just like that.

00:09:34.625 --> 00:09:37.445
And then I'm going to
select its parent,

00:09:37.445 --> 00:09:40.835
which is this CTA
TextField rapper.

00:09:40.835 --> 00:09:44.465
And I'm going to set its
position to relative.

00:09:44.465 --> 00:09:48.080
Okay? Now the position
of these TextField icon,

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.699
the block is relative.

00:09:49.699 --> 00:09:51.470
Tweets parents, as
you can see here,

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:54.170
we have CTA TextField wrapper

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:56.570
and I can just reposition
it to top left.

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:58.580
So I'm going to just increase

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:02.255
the top position to around 30%.

00:10:02.255 --> 00:10:03.875
We just need to eyeball that.

00:10:03.875 --> 00:10:05.120
And then I'm going to modify

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.990
the left position to around 8%.

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:12.620
Okay, Nice. I can just
move it a little bit down.

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:17.960
I can increase the top
margin to, let's say, 32%.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.005
Our rights, our TextField
is almost ready,

00:10:21.005 --> 00:10:23.885
but what about its color
right now by default,

00:10:23.885 --> 00:10:26.330
it's background's
color is white,

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.745
but our text field is not white,

00:10:28.745 --> 00:10:31.970
are textfield is using
the neutral light color.

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:34.730
So I'm going to select this
text field and I'm going to

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:37.790
modify its color
to neutral light.

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:41.150
And now we can move on to the
next part, which is button.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:42.980
It's gonna be so
simple because we

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.410
already created our
primary button,

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:46.430
if you remember, for

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:49.055
the hero section and
for the navigation bar.

00:10:49.055 --> 00:10:53.180
So what I'm gonna do is select
this button right here,

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:56.885
and I'm gonna give it a
class primary button.

00:10:56.885 --> 00:10:57.995
There we go.

00:10:57.995 --> 00:10:59.285
We've got our sales.

00:10:59.285 --> 00:11:01.355
The only thing we need to do is

00:11:01.355 --> 00:11:03.875
adjust its padding a little bit.

00:11:03.875 --> 00:11:07.700
Okay, so first, I'm going
to give it a combo class.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.730
This way I can make sure
that the changes I make

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:14.250
here won't be applied
to other buttons here.

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:17.530
And then I'm going to
adjust its padding.

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:18.895
So let me scroll up.

00:11:18.895 --> 00:11:20.080
As you can see by default,

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.990
it has a 30 pixel left
and right padding.

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:25.030
Let's take a look
at our design file.

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:28.240
If I select this
subscribe texts layer,

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.400
you can see that
it's left and right

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:33.460
padding are roughly 60 pixels.

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:35.200
So I'm going to give it a six

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.390
the pixel left and
right padding.

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:40.495
If I hold down the Option key
or Alt key on my keyboard,

00:11:40.495 --> 00:11:41.920
I can just modify the left

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.305
and right padding
simultaneously,

00:11:44.305 --> 00:11:47.620
just like that, the top and
bottom padding look fine.

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.035
Now I need some left
margin as well.

00:11:50.035 --> 00:11:54.355
Here I'm going to need
a 20 pixel left margin.

00:11:54.355 --> 00:11:56.715
So wireless button is selected.

00:11:56.715 --> 00:12:00.515
I'm gonna give it a
20 pixel left margin.

00:12:00.515 --> 00:12:02.465
Alright, I'm going
to select this form.

00:12:02.465 --> 00:12:03.560
And as you can see,

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:06.425
this form takes up the
whole width of its parent,

00:12:06.425 --> 00:12:07.820
which is this form block.

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:10.880
First, I'm going to select
this form and I'm going to

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.895
change the justification
to center.

00:12:13.895 --> 00:12:16.565
And then I'm going to
select this form block and

00:12:16.565 --> 00:12:20.340
I'm going to give it
a class form block.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:25.520
And let me change its
display setting to Flexbox.

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:28.145
And I'm going to change
the justify to center.

00:12:28.145 --> 00:12:30.830
And now I'm going to
select my container.

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:33.830
As you can see, the display
setting is set to block.

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:36.485
I'm going to change
it to Flexbox

00:12:36.485 --> 00:12:39.184
and let me change the
direction to vertical.

00:12:39.184 --> 00:12:42.965
I'm going to change the
justification to center as well.

00:12:42.965 --> 00:12:44.900
But as you can see,
it doesn't take up

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:46.985
the whole height
of this section.

00:12:46.985 --> 00:12:47.525
Why?

00:12:47.525 --> 00:12:49.745
Because its height
is set to auto.

00:12:49.745 --> 00:12:51.200
Therefore, its height is

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.020
determined based on the
height of its children.

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.675
They don't take up so
much space inside.

00:12:56.675 --> 00:12:59.000
So what I'm gonna do is select

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.785
this container and set
its height to 100%.

00:13:03.785 --> 00:13:07.069
Now it takes up the whole
height of this section,

00:13:07.069 --> 00:13:08.480
and then I'm going to change

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.550
the alignment to center as well.

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:12.890
Alright, now I'm going
to select my heading.

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:16.685
And this heading requires
some bottom margin.

00:13:16.685 --> 00:13:19.040
So let me go to
my InDesign file.

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.555
If I select this heading,

00:13:20.555 --> 00:13:24.980
I can see that I need to get
20 pixels bottom margin.

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:26.885
So while it's selected,

00:13:26.885 --> 00:13:29.375
I'm going to
override its margin,

00:13:29.375 --> 00:13:31.880
its bottom margin to 20 pixels.

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:33.650
And also I'm going
to do the same thing

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:35.525
for these foreign block.

00:13:35.525 --> 00:13:37.715
If I select this form block,

00:13:37.715 --> 00:13:40.610
we can see that I don't
have any top margin.

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:42.905
I'm gonna go to my design file

00:13:42.905 --> 00:13:44.960
and I'm going to select
this text field.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:48.545
You can see that I need to
get a 50 pixel top margin.

00:13:48.545 --> 00:13:52.265
So I'm gonna give it 50
pixels here are right.

00:13:52.265 --> 00:13:54.845
Now let me change the
text of this button

00:13:54.845 --> 00:13:58.695
from Submit to subscribe.

00:13:58.695 --> 00:14:02.770
And there we go. Our CTA
section is ready as well.

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:04.300
But now I'd like you to

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.325
pay attention to
the other elements

00:14:06.325 --> 00:14:08.335
inside this form block because

00:14:08.335 --> 00:14:10.690
apart from this
TextField land button,

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:12.745
we have two more blocks.

00:14:12.745 --> 00:14:15.670
We already talked about them
in our previous videos,

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:17.470
but I just want to
mention them once

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:19.270
again in case you forgot them.

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:21.580
So here we have a
success message,

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:23.440
the black that is not visible.

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.210
The reason is by default,

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:27.610
it's display setting
is set to none.

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:29.935
We have this error
message as well.

00:14:29.935 --> 00:14:31.840
By default, it's
display setting is

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.075
set to none and we
can't modify that.

00:14:34.075 --> 00:14:34.555
Why?

00:14:34.555 --> 00:14:37.780
Because once the user hits
this Subscribe button,

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:39.265
he or she will get

00:14:39.265 --> 00:14:42.395
either a success message
or an error message.

00:14:42.395 --> 00:14:43.790
If everything goes well,

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:46.085
there is no internet
connection problem.

00:14:46.085 --> 00:14:48.650
He or she will see
the success message.

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:51.455
If not, they will see
the error message,

00:14:51.455 --> 00:14:54.635
but can be just change the
design of these messages.

00:14:54.635 --> 00:14:56.825
Of course we can,
well in that case,

00:14:56.825 --> 00:14:58.700
we need to select
our form block.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:02.105
Then if I click on the
Settings icon here,

00:15:02.105 --> 00:15:06.245
you can see it says Show
State, Normal success error.

00:15:06.245 --> 00:15:08.825
If I go to success here,

00:15:08.825 --> 00:15:12.155
I can start modifying
its appearance.

00:15:12.155 --> 00:15:13.685
If I go to error,

00:15:13.685 --> 00:15:16.070
I can change its
appearance as well.

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:17.705
So for instance here,

00:15:17.705 --> 00:15:18.965
when I go to error,

00:15:18.965 --> 00:15:21.575
you can see that it's
alignment is wrong.

00:15:21.575 --> 00:15:24.080
So let's go ahead and fix that.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.105
While we are in the error state,

00:15:26.105 --> 00:15:28.625
I'm gonna go ahead and
select this form block.

00:15:28.625 --> 00:15:31.580
This form blog holds
this form, the block,

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:33.140
the success message and

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:35.510
the error message and
its layout direction.

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:36.710
As you can see, it's set to

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:39.335
horizontal when we are
in the normal state,

00:15:39.335 --> 00:15:41.060
it doesn't make any difference.

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:42.950
But when we are in
the error state,

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:44.270
it makes a difference.

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:46.670
I'm going to change the
duration to vertical,

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:48.770
and now it looks much better.

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:51.215
So if I just go to
the normal state,

00:15:51.215 --> 00:15:52.565
it looks just fine.

00:15:52.565 --> 00:15:55.970
If I go to success,
it looks great.

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:58.250
If I go to error, that's fine.

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:01.205
Of course, you can go ahead
and modify the content here,

00:16:01.205 --> 00:16:03.005
but this is not our goal now,

00:16:03.005 --> 00:16:05.870
are right guys, that's
all for this video.

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:07.295
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:16:07.295 --> 00:16:10.380
I'll see you in the next video.
