00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.110
Hey, welcome back.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.910
In this video we're
going to talk about

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.135
custom code and third
party integration.

00:00:12.135 --> 00:00:14.130
I know that I told you
that we're not going to

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.415
code and that's 100% true.

00:00:17.415 --> 00:00:19.440
But sometimes if you want to add

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.840
some functionalities
to your project

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.045
that Webflow doesn't offer.

00:00:24.045 --> 00:00:27.780
You can integrate some
third-party services into

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.750
your Webflow project by just

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.925
copying and pasting some code.

00:00:31.925 --> 00:00:33.875
You don't need to know
how to write code,

00:00:33.875 --> 00:00:36.230
you just need to know
how to use that.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.340
As I mentioned before,

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.240
the custom code feature is
only available for paid plans.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.890
So if you're using
the free plan,

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.005
unfortunately, you
cannot use that.

00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:47.360
However, I wanted
to show you how it

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.740
works in case you want to

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.525
upgrade your plan in the future.

00:00:50.525 --> 00:00:52.565
So if you're ready, let's begin.

00:00:52.565 --> 00:00:55.700
First of all, here we
have this empty canvas.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.855
This is a new project.

00:00:56.855 --> 00:00:58.775
And if I want to use
some custom code,

00:00:58.775 --> 00:01:00.050
I have different options.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.650
If we want to add the custom
code to the whole project,

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.140
to all pages, to
the whole website.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.900
I can head over to the
project settings and I

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.615
can go to the custom
code tab here.

00:01:11.615 --> 00:01:14.585
And I have head code
and I have footer code.

00:01:14.585 --> 00:01:16.850
But if I want to add
some custom code to

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.115
a specific page of my project,

00:01:19.115 --> 00:01:21.665
I can do that right
in the designer.

00:01:21.665 --> 00:01:22.655
Let me show you how.

00:01:22.655 --> 00:01:24.635
So here is our empty canvas.

00:01:24.635 --> 00:01:26.930
I'm going to go to the Add
panel and I'm going to

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.270
scroll down here
under the components,

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.235
you can see that I
have this Embed.

00:01:31.235 --> 00:01:33.275
It's not available
for free plan.

00:01:33.275 --> 00:01:34.580
Therefore, if you
want to use that,

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.975
you need to upgrade your plan.

00:01:35.975 --> 00:01:39.020
So I'm going to drag and
drop it here. There we go.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.530
Now we have this HTML
embed components.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.930
Here we can paste
in our custom code.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.700
It works like any
other elements.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.640
You just need to pay some
custom code here and

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.820
save and close and make sure
to publish your project.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.485
So let me show you how it works.

00:01:54.485 --> 00:01:56.960
Let's suppose you want
to create a survey or

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.640
a form that gets

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.250
the user's information
for a specific reason.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.650
So you can use a service
called type form.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.420
It's a very popular service.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.250
Let me show you how it works.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.125
Here is they're landing page.

00:02:09.125 --> 00:02:10.970
It actually allows you to create

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.405
some surveys or forums
easily and conveniently.

00:02:14.405 --> 00:02:17.855
And you can modify the design
of your form, the settings,

00:02:17.855 --> 00:02:20.179
everything you can
possibly imagine,

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:21.920
and it has a free plan as well,

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.255
so you can use it for free.

00:02:23.255 --> 00:02:25.325
So first you need to
go ahead and sign up,

00:02:25.325 --> 00:02:26.885
create a free account.

00:02:26.885 --> 00:02:29.330
Then you can simply
create a form.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.730
We are not going to dive into
the details because it's

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.055
so simple to create a tie forum.

00:02:34.055 --> 00:02:35.450
I just want to show
you how you can

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.370
embed this form
into your project.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.890
So here is the form
that I created before.

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.950
Let me show you if I
go to my dashboard,

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.765
I have this RSVP.

00:02:44.765 --> 00:02:47.735
I can click on it. I can
modify the questions.

00:02:47.735 --> 00:02:51.275
I can modify the choices
or answers here,

00:02:51.275 --> 00:02:53.105
and then I can publish it.

00:02:53.105 --> 00:02:55.400
Once it's published,
I can head over to

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.370
the Share tab at the top here,

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.715
I can head over to the embed
in a web page section.

00:03:01.715 --> 00:03:03.785
You can choose whatever
option you want.

00:03:03.785 --> 00:03:05.255
If you need a pop-over,

00:03:05.255 --> 00:03:06.710
you can use this option.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.150
If you need the slide tab,

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.335
you can use this option.

00:03:09.335 --> 00:03:10.895
I'm going to use the standard.

00:03:10.895 --> 00:03:14.240
And here I'm gonna get
the code just like that.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.740
I'm going to copy the code.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.215
And if I head over to
my Webflow project

00:03:18.215 --> 00:03:19.475
and I paste it here,

00:03:19.475 --> 00:03:21.935
you can see that the
code is in one line.

00:03:21.935 --> 00:03:23.675
Therefore, if you
want to check it out,

00:03:23.675 --> 00:03:26.720
you can simply scroll
horizontally just like that.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.560
Now I'm going to save and
close and make sure to publish

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.615
your website because
it doesn't work

00:03:32.615 --> 00:03:34.760
if you just preview
your website here,

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.935
okay, so you need to publish it.

00:03:36.935 --> 00:03:39.335
Then you need to open it up.

00:03:39.335 --> 00:03:40.745
And let's see what we have.

00:03:40.745 --> 00:03:42.590
There we go. Here is our type

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.275
for imbedded here
into our project.

00:03:45.275 --> 00:03:49.940
So if I just write our
ash and then lastName,

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.160
Ok, here Let's
writetest@gmail.com.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.255
And then I can choose from
one of these options.

00:03:59.255 --> 00:04:01.535
Let's write UK.

00:04:01.535 --> 00:04:05.780
And then I'm going to choose
one of these options, e.g.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.180
Figma and submit. There we go.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.700
Done your information
was sent perfectly.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.535
And if I head over to the
type form website here,

00:04:13.535 --> 00:04:17.405
if I go to the Results
tab right here,

00:04:17.405 --> 00:04:20.329
I can see the form
that they just sent.

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.070
If I go to the responses,

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.175
here it is, I can simply
see all the answers here.

00:04:25.175 --> 00:04:28.100
It's a very useful service
that you can integrate to

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.410
your Webflow project
and you can use it

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.155
for your future clients
projects as well.

00:04:33.155 --> 00:04:35.870
So can you see how simple it
is to just copy and paste

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.250
some custom code and

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.620
improve the usability
of your website.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.270
Now let me show you
another example.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.030
Let's suppose your
client wants you to

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.000
create a booking
system for him or her.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.215
How can you do that?

00:04:48.215 --> 00:04:50.090
Well, you can use
another service.

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.710
There are actually many services

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.090
out there that you can use.

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.965
However, I'm going to show you

00:04:54.965 --> 00:04:57.665
a very popular service
called Calendly.

00:04:57.665 --> 00:04:59.030
If you just go ahead and

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.130
create an account
on their website,

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:02.930
here is they're landing page.

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.940
You can use it for free as well.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.910
I'm going to just go ahead
and show you how it works.

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.150
So first you need to just
create an event by default,

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.995
you will have this demo event.

00:05:12.995 --> 00:05:14.600
You can also go ahead and create

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.480
your own events or a
one-off meeting here.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.580
Once your meeting is created,

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.950
you need to click on
this Share button.

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.595
And then you need to go to
the Add to website tab.

00:05:25.595 --> 00:05:28.865
And here I'm going to
use embed in line.

00:05:28.865 --> 00:05:33.080
Just like that, continue and
here we will get the code.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.585
You can modify the
design simply here,

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:38.510
you can just modify
the settings as well.

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.630
Then if you just copy the
code and head over to

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.005
your Webflow project and
you just paste it here.

00:05:45.005 --> 00:05:46.070
I'm going to remove

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.475
the previous custom
code that we added.

00:05:48.475 --> 00:05:50.270
I'm going to paste it here.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:55.625
Save code, publish, and we
are done. Let me open it up.

00:05:55.625 --> 00:05:56.525
Here it is.

00:05:56.525 --> 00:05:59.090
Our booking system
is ready for us and

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.465
our users can simply
book a meeting with us.

00:06:02.465 --> 00:06:04.280
Let me choose a date, e.g.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.725
this one, then the time.

00:06:06.725 --> 00:06:09.320
Confirm here I'm going to just

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:14.675
write our ash andtest@gmail.com.

00:06:14.675 --> 00:06:18.065
And finally, I'm going
to write a message.

00:06:18.065 --> 00:06:24.110
We are talking
about custom code.

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.465
Then I'm going to
schedule the event.

00:06:26.465 --> 00:06:27.770
And there it is,

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.095
the confirmation you
are scheduled with

00:06:30.095 --> 00:06:32.599
our ash and here is
the information.

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:34.670
And if you go to Calendly and

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:37.340
here under the
Scheduled Events tab,

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.150
you can find all the upcoming
events here just like this.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.210
If you want to modify
or rescheduled event,

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:45.650
you can simply do that.

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.125
You can just cancel
the event as well.

00:06:48.125 --> 00:06:49.445
Here is the message.

00:06:49.445 --> 00:06:51.950
There are tons of options
you can use here, alright,

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.010
if you want to get a list
of all the services that

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:58.295
you can integrate into
your Webflow project.

00:06:58.295 --> 00:07:00.860
You can head over to
this URL university,

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.205
that webflow.com
slash integrations.

00:07:04.205 --> 00:07:06.650
And then here there is a list of

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:08.960
all the services that you can

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.554
integrate into your
Webflow project.

00:07:11.554 --> 00:07:14.165
Just like that, we
have Shopify, Zap.

00:07:14.165 --> 00:07:16.730
Zap here is so useful as well.

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:18.290
If you want to just connect

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:21.710
different services and integrate
them with your project,

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:22.835
you can use the app here,

00:07:22.835 --> 00:07:24.380
definitely check that out.

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.885
You can use other
services as well.

00:07:26.885 --> 00:07:30.695
You can eat this next button
to see, are there services?

00:07:30.695 --> 00:07:32.600
There are many different
services you can

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.805
use and they are so handy.

00:07:34.805 --> 00:07:37.415
So that's why I
wanted to show you

00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:40.310
how you can use custom
code in your project,

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:43.490
because you can simply just
copy and paste one line of

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:44.915
code and easily add

00:07:44.915 --> 00:07:47.495
an advanced functionality
to your website.

00:07:47.495 --> 00:07:50.840
Alright, the last example I
want to show you is this.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.995
There is a very cool website
called CodePen, CodePen.io.

00:07:54.995 --> 00:07:57.740
And if you go ahead and
create a free account here,

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.155
you can just use
some cool effects.

00:08:00.155 --> 00:08:02.975
There are many different
effects here that you can use.

00:08:02.975 --> 00:08:05.045
As you can see, for each effect,

00:08:05.045 --> 00:08:08.150
you will have the HTML
code on the left side,

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:12.335
the CSS here, right at the
middle, and the JavaScript.

00:08:12.335 --> 00:08:15.035
Okay, so let me show you
how you can use that.

00:08:15.035 --> 00:08:17.300
Here is the fact that I
chose, as you can see,

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.865
it's so cool, but
how can I use that?

00:08:19.865 --> 00:08:20.720
It's so simple.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.470
First, you need to grab the
HTML code on the left side.

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:25.820
I'm going to copy it.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.700
And if I head over to
my custom code here,

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.680
I'm going to paste
it right here.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.700
So I'm going to remove

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.340
the previous custom
code that V paste it.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.505
And I'm going to paste it
right here, save and close.

00:08:37.505 --> 00:08:39.095
The first step is done,

00:08:39.095 --> 00:08:40.535
but we're not done yet.

00:08:40.535 --> 00:08:40.895
Why?

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:44.090
Because this effect
requires the CSS

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:47.705
or styling and also it
uses the JavaScript.

00:08:47.705 --> 00:08:49.970
We need to add the CSS and

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:52.610
the script into
our page as well.

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:53.675
How can we do that?

00:08:53.675 --> 00:08:56.450
If you go to your
page settings here,

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:58.670
and if you scroll down here,

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:01.805
we have the head
and the body tag.

00:09:01.805 --> 00:09:05.525
We need to paste the CSS
code here in the head tag,

00:09:05.525 --> 00:09:07.039
and we need to paste

00:09:07.039 --> 00:09:09.770
the JavaScript code
here in the body tag.

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:12.530
So let me go ahead and
copy the CSS code.

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:14.720
And I'm going to
paste it right here.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.970
But as you can see,
workflow doesn't

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:19.340
recognize this CSS code. Why?

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:21.035
Because everything is white.

00:09:21.035 --> 00:09:23.390
So first, I'm going to remove

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:26.030
these additional lines
of code at the top.

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:29.345
We don't need that. We
need to have the body

00:09:29.345 --> 00:09:31.010
in order to make Webflow

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:33.710
understand that
this is a CSS code,

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:35.885
we need to use the style tag.

00:09:35.885 --> 00:09:38.615
Why? Because CSS is
actually for styling.

00:09:38.615 --> 00:09:39.980
So I'm going to create

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.740
this title tag just like
that. And there we go.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.810
Now we've got all these colors.

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:46.340
And it means that Webflow

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:49.205
understands that
this is a CSS code.

00:09:49.205 --> 00:09:51.395
But once you create
the style tag,

00:09:51.395 --> 00:09:53.555
you need to go ahead
and close that.

00:09:53.555 --> 00:09:55.295
So it's so simple.

00:09:55.295 --> 00:09:56.510
You just need to write

00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:00.050
a forward slash and
just write style.

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:02.570
There we go. The
first part is done.

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:05.810
Now we need to go ahead and
copy our JavaScript code.

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:07.805
Alright, now I'm
going to copy it.

00:10:07.805 --> 00:10:09.050
Let me go to Webflow.

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:11.135
And here right in the body tag,

00:10:11.135 --> 00:10:12.875
I'm going to pay what again,

00:10:12.875 --> 00:10:15.125
Webflow doesn't
recognize that as

00:10:15.125 --> 00:10:18.410
a JavaScript code because
everything is white.

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:20.420
So first, I'm going to go ahead

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.490
and remove these
comments at the top.

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:25.190
As you can see, this is a
comment that's not a code.

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:26.540
I'm going to remove that.

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:29.075
And here we need to
create another tag.

00:10:29.075 --> 00:10:30.065
What kind of tag?

00:10:30.065 --> 00:10:32.315
Since this is a
Java Script code,

00:10:32.315 --> 00:10:34.490
we need to create a script tag.

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:36.260
So let's write script.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:37.850
Whoops, script.

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:38.735
There we go.

00:10:38.735 --> 00:10:40.655
Now we've got all these colors.

00:10:40.655 --> 00:10:43.790
I'm going to go ahead
and close this tag,

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:47.360
a forward slash script
R, right, cool.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.860
Now let me save it.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.945
And if I publish my project,

00:10:50.945 --> 00:10:53.600
and if I open it
up, There it is.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.400
Here is our cool effect.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.095
It's amazing, isn't it?

00:10:57.095 --> 00:10:59.705
But how can we
change these words?

00:10:59.705 --> 00:11:01.610
It's so simple. You need to head

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:03.830
over to your page settings here.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.930
If I scroll down right in

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:09.590
the JavaScript code here
we have this text cons,

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:11.675
and we have all the words,

00:11:11.675 --> 00:11:14.615
and each word is between
two quotation mark.

00:11:14.615 --> 00:11:16.700
You can simply go
ahead and modify it.

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.939
I'm going to just modify
one of these words, e.g.

00:11:19.939 --> 00:11:23.150
why is this so
satisfying to design?

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:26.315
Okay, I'm going to save it
and I'm going to publish it.

00:11:26.315 --> 00:11:29.180
Remember to publish your
website whenever you are

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:32.465
using custom code and
let me open it up.

00:11:32.465 --> 00:11:38.630
Why is this so
satisfying to design?

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:39.665
There it is.

00:11:39.665 --> 00:11:40.790
How cool is that?

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:43.190
Alright guys, can you
see how simple it

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:45.620
is to use custom
code in Webflow?

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.600
I hope you enjoyed
this video and

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.610
make sure to go
ahead and check out

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:52.280
the Webflow integrations
list because there are

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.960
many different
services that you can

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.465
integrate into your
Webflow projects.

00:11:56.465 --> 00:11:58.040
I just copying and pasting

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.335
some custom code are right guys.

00:12:00.335 --> 00:12:02.135
I hope you enjoyed this video

00:12:02.135 --> 00:12:04.830
and I'll see you
in the next one.
