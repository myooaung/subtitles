00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:09.135
Hey, in this video we're going
to talk about backgrounds.

00:00:09.135 --> 00:00:11.295
If you head over
to the style panel

00:00:11.295 --> 00:00:13.860
right under the
typography section,

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.675
we have the background section.

00:00:15.675 --> 00:00:17.670
And it's very useful because

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.115
we're going to use it
almost all the time.

00:00:20.115 --> 00:00:21.690
So here as you can see,

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.915
I have two different
sections, one empty section.

00:00:24.915 --> 00:00:26.940
This is for the next
part of this video,

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.320
but for the first part,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.420
we're going to work
with this section

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.850
inside I have a
container as usual,

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.625
and then I have a
heading and a paragraph.

00:00:35.625 --> 00:00:39.405
Let's suppose we want to add
a background to our section.

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:41.799
I'm going to select my section.

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:43.925
And I can go to the background,

00:00:43.925 --> 00:00:47.705
and I can click on
this plus button here.

00:00:47.705 --> 00:00:49.895
And now I can choose Image.

00:00:49.895 --> 00:00:52.400
I already showed
you this section,

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.700
but we didn't actually dive
into all the details here.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.200
Okay, now I'm going to choose

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.885
this image from my
assets. And there we go.

00:00:59.885 --> 00:01:02.555
By default, it's
always set to time.

00:01:02.555 --> 00:01:05.600
As you can see here, we have
the tie an option and we

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.230
can just set it to none because
we don't want it to time.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.570
Then we have the
position options

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.205
and all these options here.

00:01:13.205 --> 00:01:14.855
So let's start with the time.

00:01:14.855 --> 00:01:16.820
Here, we have different types.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.205
We have image, we
have linear gradient,

00:01:19.205 --> 00:01:21.170
we have radial gradient,

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.835
and we have the color overlay.

00:01:22.835 --> 00:01:25.190
So let's first talk about image.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.194
Here.

00:01:26.194 --> 00:01:27.635
I can set the size,

00:01:27.635 --> 00:01:31.445
I can set a custom size if
the custom tab is selected,

00:01:31.445 --> 00:01:33.710
we rarely use this custom size

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.480
here because we usually size

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.875
our images using the size
property in the side panel.

00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:41.750
Then we have the cover,

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.294
which is so useful

00:01:43.294 --> 00:01:45.875
almost all the time
we use this option.

00:01:45.875 --> 00:01:47.615
And we have the contain.

00:01:47.615 --> 00:01:51.275
The contain actually
scales down the image

00:01:51.275 --> 00:01:55.700
until it's contained in our
section or our container,

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.770
or whatever element it's in,

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.145
then I can modify the
position here to center.

00:02:01.145 --> 00:02:03.590
Now I'm going to set
it to cover for now.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.055
Alright, our background
image looks great.

00:02:07.055 --> 00:02:10.040
We can also set the
left and top position

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.690
based on percentage.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:12.890
As you can see by default,

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.930
it's set to 50 per cent.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.345
If I set it to top-left,

00:02:17.345 --> 00:02:20.180
you can see that left
and top are set to zero.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.295
If I want to manually
modify them,

00:02:22.295 --> 00:02:23.480
I can do that as well.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.525
I can set it to
48 per cent, e.g.

00:02:26.525 --> 00:02:30.695
or maybe, let's say 35 per cent.

00:02:30.695 --> 00:02:32.450
Nothing changes here because

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.430
our image is too large actually.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.405
So let me modify the top
as well to 20 per cent.

00:02:38.405 --> 00:02:40.850
As you can see, it moves down.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.010
Alright, I'm going
to undo the process.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.870
If we want our image to tile,

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.640
we can use the tile option

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.040
and we can just set
a custom width.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.865
Let me set a custom width that
you can see how it works.

00:02:52.865 --> 00:02:56.330
I'm going to set the
width to 100 pixels.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.620
And as you can see, since

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.495
the tile option
has been selected,

00:02:59.495 --> 00:03:00.995
our image is titled.

00:03:00.995 --> 00:03:03.590
I can set it to horizontally and

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.260
also vertically tile are right.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.970
Now we're going to
set it to downtown,

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.505
and let's set it to cover.

00:03:10.505 --> 00:03:12.455
We have the fixed option here.

00:03:12.455 --> 00:03:15.275
By default, all images
are set to not fixed.

00:03:15.275 --> 00:03:17.765
We're going to talk about
the difference between fixed

00:03:17.765 --> 00:03:20.420
and not fixed in a few seconds.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.950
But for now, let's move on to

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.910
the next feature of this
image and gradients section.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.330
As you can see, our texts
layers are not reliable.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.435
Why? Because we don't have
enough contrast here.

00:03:32.435 --> 00:03:36.110
So what if I change
their color to white?

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.080
Let's see if it
makes a difference.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.930
Of course, it makes a
difference, but still,

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.895
since we have a small font size,

00:03:43.895 --> 00:03:47.300
sometimes it could be
hard to read this text.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.515
How can we fix that?

00:03:48.515 --> 00:03:50.645
Well, a very well-known solution

00:03:50.645 --> 00:03:53.090
is to just add an overlay.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.505
If I select this section here,

00:03:55.505 --> 00:03:57.590
and then I go to
the backgrounds.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.185
If I click on this
plus button here,

00:04:00.185 --> 00:04:03.470
I can set the time to
overlay like this,

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.320
and it creates an
overlay, a dark overlay.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.750
And we can just
control the opacity of

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.600
this overlay from
here, just like that.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.615
Now it's much more visible.

00:04:14.615 --> 00:04:17.389
But what about linear
and radial gradients?

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.250
Let's talk about them as well.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.275
I'm going to start
with linear gradient.

00:04:21.275 --> 00:04:23.210
Well, as you know, a gradient is

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.555
a smooth transition from
one color to another color.

00:04:26.555 --> 00:04:27.860
And by default, we have

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.335
two different stops
or points here.

00:04:30.335 --> 00:04:32.675
We have the black
and white points.

00:04:32.675 --> 00:04:34.670
I'm going to select this point,

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.410
and from this color,

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.920
I'm going to change the
color to something else.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.385
Let me change it to e.g.

00:04:43.385 --> 00:04:45.605
this orange and the next one,

00:04:45.605 --> 00:04:47.375
I'm going to select
the next point.

00:04:47.375 --> 00:04:50.300
And I'm going to change
it to the Scholar.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.110
Alright?

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.430
And then I can modify the
angle of this gradient.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.525
Here.

00:04:56.525 --> 00:04:58.970
As you can see, I can

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.925
simply modify the
angle, the degree.

00:05:01.925 --> 00:05:03.860
But what about this
repeat option?

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.585
If I check this checkbox?

00:05:05.585 --> 00:05:06.995
Well, nothing happens.

00:05:06.995 --> 00:05:09.995
That's because in order
for this option to work,

00:05:09.995 --> 00:05:12.875
we need some space
here in the slider.

00:05:12.875 --> 00:05:14.330
If I just take one of

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.910
these points and move
it to the left side,

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.870
you can see that now
we have more space.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.295
As you can see,

00:05:22.295 --> 00:05:25.310
it's repeats again
and again and again.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.840
Just like that.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.955
I can change the angle as well.

00:05:31.955 --> 00:05:33.590
Cool.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.490
Alright, let me just
uncheck this repeat option.

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:38.960
We're not going to need that.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.800
We can also control the
opacity of these colors, e.g.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.645
to create a custom overlay,

00:05:44.645 --> 00:05:48.875
if I modify the alpha
amount here to 50 per cent,

00:05:48.875 --> 00:05:52.325
as you can see, now we
have a gradient overlay.

00:05:52.325 --> 00:05:55.475
I can do the same thing
for my orange color.

00:05:55.475 --> 00:05:56.915
50 per cent.

00:05:56.915 --> 00:05:58.730
There we go. It looks great.

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.575
But what about radial gradient?

00:06:00.575 --> 00:06:02.360
If I click on that and if I

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.465
set the opacity to 100 per cent,

00:06:05.465 --> 00:06:09.050
again, you could simply
see the difference

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.370
between a linear gradient
and a radial gradient.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.455
Alright? As you can see here,

00:06:15.455 --> 00:06:17.015
we have a focal point.

00:06:17.015 --> 00:06:19.339
We can change the
size here, e.g.

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:21.440
this one, I can
set it, this one.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.450
I can change the size easily,

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.395
and also I can change the
focal point like this.

00:06:27.395 --> 00:06:31.385
From which direction this
transition should start.

00:06:31.385 --> 00:06:32.990
Like that.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.090
Are right, nice.

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:38.900
If you want to hide one of
these images or gradients,

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.980
you can simply click on this
icon or you can just click

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.930
on this remove
button if you want

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.285
to reorder your elements here,

00:06:47.285 --> 00:06:49.490
you can simply hover over

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.570
these vertical lines that is
next to this tiny thumbnail.

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.405
Click and drag just like that.

00:06:56.405 --> 00:06:59.075
Alright, let me remove this
radial gradient for now.

00:06:59.075 --> 00:07:00.770
But sometimes we just need to

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:02.780
have a solid background color.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.280
We can do that as well.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.080
We can always select

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.450
an element no matter
if it's a diblock,

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:10.055
a heading, a paragraph,

00:07:10.055 --> 00:07:13.175
any box can have a
background color.

00:07:13.175 --> 00:07:15.695
By default, it's
set to transparent.

00:07:15.695 --> 00:07:19.310
If I select it, I can
set it to white, e.g.

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:20.840
but since we have an image here,

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.090
you can see that I can change

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:27.170
the background color to black
to whatever color I want.

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:29.465
Okay, there is also
a good trick here.

00:07:29.465 --> 00:07:32.195
If you want to use
some famous colours,

00:07:32.195 --> 00:07:34.130
like white or black,

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.564
you can simply write
its name here, e.g.

00:07:37.564 --> 00:07:39.485
I'm going to write white here.

00:07:39.485 --> 00:07:40.805
And there we go.

00:07:40.805 --> 00:07:42.170
I have a white background.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:45.575
If I change it to
black, it works.

00:07:45.575 --> 00:07:48.605
If I change it to
read, it works also.

00:07:48.605 --> 00:07:51.950
But most of the time we
usually manually set

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.780
the background color or we

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:56.045
copy and paste the
hex color code here.

00:07:56.045 --> 00:07:58.730
Okay, now I'm going to
talk about clipping.

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:01.475
It works like masking
InDesign software.

00:08:01.475 --> 00:08:03.575
So let's suppose I want to add

00:08:03.575 --> 00:08:06.050
a gradient to this heading.

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:07.144
Is it possible?

00:08:07.144 --> 00:08:08.720
No, except it is,

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.115
if I go to color,

00:08:10.115 --> 00:08:12.215
I can set a gradient.

00:08:12.215 --> 00:08:14.285
However, there is
a good trick here.

00:08:14.285 --> 00:08:16.490
If I go to backgrounds here,

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:18.650
I can create a
gradient here and I

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:20.930
can change the time to linear.

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:24.155
And from here, I'm going
to change the gradient to,

00:08:24.155 --> 00:08:26.884
let's say this color.

00:08:26.884 --> 00:08:30.035
Alright, right, let me
create a cool gradient.

00:08:30.035 --> 00:08:31.340
Are right, nice.

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.125
Now I'm going to
change the angle.

00:08:33.125 --> 00:08:34.550
However, as you can see,

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:37.220
this box doesn't feel this text.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.380
It doesn't cover its height.

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:41.180
Therefore, I need to increase

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:43.445
the height size to
something else.

00:08:43.445 --> 00:08:46.940
Let me increase it to
100 pixels for now.

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.580
Alright, but does it look good?

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.755
It's not exactly what I want.

00:08:51.755 --> 00:08:53.105
Well, wait a second.

00:08:53.105 --> 00:08:54.995
I'm gonna go to the backgrounds,

00:08:54.995 --> 00:08:57.320
and from here I'm
gonna go to Clipping.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.555
And by default it's set to none.

00:08:59.555 --> 00:09:03.830
If I change this to clip
background to text, there we go.

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:08.885
Now we have the gradient
clipped inside our text.

00:09:08.885 --> 00:09:10.310
How cool is that?

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:13.610
This is the exact same
method that's most popular

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:18.230
websites use in order to
create such an effect, e.g.

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.705
Apple uses this
technique as well.

00:09:20.705 --> 00:09:24.005
So I can simply
modify the gradients

00:09:24.005 --> 00:09:27.545
and the changes apply to
this text in real time.

00:09:27.545 --> 00:09:29.135
Let's see if it works.

00:09:29.135 --> 00:09:30.740
Yes, Dance.

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:32.630
I'm going to change
the background color

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:33.890
of this section to

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:37.595
black that you could see the
effect much, much better.

00:09:37.595 --> 00:09:40.640
Alright, now let's talk
about the other feature.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.380
As you remember, I mentioned

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.375
that there is another
section here.

00:09:44.375 --> 00:09:46.790
Let me change the
background color to white.

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:48.875
And here inside this container,

00:09:48.875 --> 00:09:51.125
I'm going to drag
and drop a diblock.

00:09:51.125 --> 00:09:52.325
For this, the Blog.

00:09:52.325 --> 00:09:53.645
I'm going to create a class,

00:09:53.645 --> 00:09:56.825
let's call it Image fix.

00:09:56.825 --> 00:09:58.940
Then I'm going to
set its width to

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:00.830
100 per cent so that it

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:03.275
takes up the whole
width of its parent,

00:10:03.275 --> 00:10:04.505
which is the container.

00:10:04.505 --> 00:10:06.890
And the height is going
to be 50 per cent.

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:07.880
Like that.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.620
I'm going to go to backgrounds.

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.890
And from here I'm going to
add an image or gradient.

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:15.230
And I'm going to
choose an image here.

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:16.040
There we go.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.170
And finally, I'm going to change

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:21.245
the size to cover and
the position to center,

00:10:21.245 --> 00:10:24.050
and let's set the time to none.

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:26.015
As you remember, I told you that

00:10:26.015 --> 00:10:27.995
we're going to talk
about the fixed option.

00:10:27.995 --> 00:10:30.905
So let's see by default
how it functions.

00:10:30.905 --> 00:10:32.794
If I preview this webpage,

00:10:32.794 --> 00:10:36.875
it works like that,
okay, as expected.

00:10:36.875 --> 00:10:39.905
But what if I want this
background to be fixed?

00:10:39.905 --> 00:10:42.500
And we create a
parallax effect here.

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.395
In that case, I can
select this image and

00:10:45.395 --> 00:10:48.500
I can just go to the
image settings here.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:52.295
And instead of setting the
fixed option to not fixed,

00:10:52.295 --> 00:10:54.170
I'm going to choose fixed.

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:58.295
Once again, I can reposition
it however I want,

00:10:58.295 --> 00:11:00.800
and then let's preview that.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.385
There we go. Can you see
how cool this effect this.

00:11:04.385 --> 00:11:06.500
So when we set the image to fix,

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.870
it actually creates a new layer

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:10.850
behind our browser window.

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:12.170
And that new layer is

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:14.585
our background image,
which is fixed.

00:11:14.585 --> 00:11:18.050
And we can simply scroll
through our page.

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:20.480
We can do the same thing
with texts as well.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.680
Let me prove that to you.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.050
Let me remove this image
and I'm going to select

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:27.125
this container and
add a heading here.

00:11:27.125 --> 00:11:30.575
Then I'm going to increase
the font size dramatically.

00:11:30.575 --> 00:11:32.645
Let's increase it to 80 pixels,

00:11:32.645 --> 00:11:35.330
or maybe 120 pixels

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.655
that you could see
the effect clearly.

00:11:37.655 --> 00:11:41.765
Then I'm going to increase
the height to 100 pixels,

00:11:41.765 --> 00:11:45.755
or maybe even more,
maybe 140 pixels.

00:11:45.755 --> 00:11:47.840
I'm going to go to
Image and gradient,

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.625
and let's add an image here.

00:11:49.625 --> 00:11:52.610
I'm going to choose,
let's say this one,

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:54.935
and let's reposition that.

00:11:54.935 --> 00:11:56.795
Do not tile and cover.

00:11:56.795 --> 00:11:58.955
Alright, How can I do that?

00:11:58.955 --> 00:12:02.930
Well, first, I need to
set the image to fixed.

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:05.600
And then I need to go to

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.340
Clipping and I'm
going to change it

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:09.185
to clip background to text.

00:12:09.185 --> 00:12:11.645
And let's see what happens.

00:12:11.645 --> 00:12:14.990
Can you see that?
Now we have that

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:18.710
fixed backgrounds sitting
behind our text layer.

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:19.865
It's very cool.

00:12:19.865 --> 00:12:23.270
You can create some cool
effects with this technique.

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:25.865
Now I'm going to talk about
something very interesting.

00:12:25.865 --> 00:12:27.755
So far you learn that you can

00:12:27.755 --> 00:12:29.765
add a background image here.

00:12:29.765 --> 00:12:31.445
If you select your section,

00:12:31.445 --> 00:12:33.365
you can just add a
background image

00:12:33.365 --> 00:12:35.225
and everything looks perfect.

00:12:35.225 --> 00:12:36.980
But what if you want to actually

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:39.050
add a video to your background?

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:40.114
Is it possible?

00:12:40.114 --> 00:12:41.165
Of course it is.

00:12:41.165 --> 00:12:43.744
However, we can do it
in the backgrounds.

00:12:43.744 --> 00:12:45.545
We need to use a component

00:12:45.545 --> 00:12:47.420
which is called
background video.

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:49.205
If I go to the Add section,

00:12:49.205 --> 00:12:50.480
now you scroll down,

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.475
you can see that
under the components,

00:12:52.475 --> 00:12:55.490
I have the background
video component.

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:57.995
Drag and drop it
and put it right

00:12:57.995 --> 00:13:00.695
above my first
section. There we go.

00:13:00.695 --> 00:13:03.560
This is just an element
like any other elements,

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:06.755
and you can simply modify
everything you want.

00:13:06.755 --> 00:13:11.585
I can give it a specific
height, like 100 vh.

00:13:11.585 --> 00:13:12.710
And then I can use

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:15.140
this Upload Video button
to upload a video.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:17.375
So let me go ahead and
quickly upload a video.

00:13:17.375 --> 00:13:18.470
You need to keep in mind that

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:21.830
your video should
be less than 30 mb.

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:24.035
And as you can see,
nothing happens.

00:13:24.035 --> 00:13:26.465
That's because the
background video components

00:13:26.465 --> 00:13:29.705
only works when you
preview your webpage.

00:13:29.705 --> 00:13:32.060
It doesn't work in the Designer.

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:34.940
I'm going to preview
it and there it is.

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:36.725
Can you see how cool it is?

00:13:36.725 --> 00:13:39.080
But wait, can we add

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.065
some contents on top
of this background?

00:13:42.065 --> 00:13:43.145
Yes, We can.

00:13:43.145 --> 00:13:45.020
Just like any other elements,

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:48.305
I can just select my
container here, e.g.

00:13:48.305 --> 00:13:52.040
and bring it and put it
inside this background video.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.170
But as you can see,
it's not centered.

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:57.170
So I can select my
background video and I can

00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:00.965
change the display setting
from block to flex.

00:14:00.965 --> 00:14:03.110
Now, let's check it out.

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:05.360
Can you see how
easy it is to work

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.730
with these components
are right guys,

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:09.185
that's all for this video.

00:14:09.185 --> 00:14:13.350
I hope you enjoyed it and I'll
see you in the next video.
