00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.900
As you remember, we talked about

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.485
HTML elements or
let's say HTML tags.

00:00:10.485 --> 00:00:14.835
And in Webflow, you can find
them in the Add section.

00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:18.540
On the left side, if you
click on this plus icon,

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.505
you can go to the Add section.

00:00:20.505 --> 00:00:22.800
And here we have
two different tabs,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.869
elements and layouts.

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.040
The layouts tab actually
includes some pre-built layouts.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.920
You're not going to work with
these pre-built layouts in

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.550
our projects since we are going
to create our own layout.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.575
But you just need to
know that they exist.

00:00:37.575 --> 00:00:39.880
If you go to the
Elements tab, however,

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.620
you can find all
the HTML elements

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.664
here we have different
sections like layout,

00:00:45.664 --> 00:00:53.210
basic topography, CMS, media,
forums, and components.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.250
We're going to
talk about each of

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.760
these elements specifically
in the upcoming videos.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.500
But for now, I'm
going to show you

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.330
how you can use these elements,

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.940
how you can add these
elements to your Canvas?

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.925
Well, in order to add an
element to your Canvas,

00:01:07.925 --> 00:01:09.650
you can simply drag and drop

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.650
that particular element
here, just like that.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.515
And as you can see, now we
have the section element.

00:01:15.515 --> 00:01:18.980
We can see all our elements
right, in the Navigator.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.900
If you want to find
the navigator,

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.105
you can click on this icon.

00:01:23.105 --> 00:01:25.490
So if I go to the Add and try

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.160
to drag and drop
another element, e.g.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.765
a. Container. There we go.

00:01:29.765 --> 00:01:31.835
You can see that the
container has been

00:01:31.835 --> 00:01:34.474
added right below the section.

00:01:34.474 --> 00:01:35.690
You need to understand that in

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.445
web design and web development,

00:01:37.445 --> 00:01:40.985
the hierarchy of
our layers matters.

00:01:40.985 --> 00:01:44.180
So e.g. here, when
we have a section,

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.485
as you can see, this section
is placed right at the top.

00:01:48.485 --> 00:01:51.110
That's why when you take
a look at the canvas,

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.090
you can see that the section has

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.265
been placed above the container.

00:01:55.265 --> 00:01:58.160
If we want to put the
container above this section,

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.950
I can simply drag it and drop

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.190
it right above this
section. There we go.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.020
It's place has been changed.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.715
Each element has, it's

00:02:07.715 --> 00:02:11.315
a specific icon right
next to its name.

00:02:11.315 --> 00:02:13.400
So e.g. here, as you can see,

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.445
the container has a unique icon

00:02:16.445 --> 00:02:19.685
and a section has
its own unique icon.

00:02:19.685 --> 00:02:21.395
It's a very good way to find out

00:02:21.395 --> 00:02:23.420
what kind of elements
you are using.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.525
As you remember, when we
talked about the box model,

00:02:26.525 --> 00:02:31.310
I mentioned that you can put
boxes inside other boxes.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.080
So let's take a
look at an example.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.000
If I select this container,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.489
I can drag it and drop it and
put it inside the section.

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.860
There we go. Now, this container

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.530
is nested inside this section.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.900
You can see it has
been indented.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.880
I can add another
element, e.g. a.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.400
Diblock inside my container.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.150
Here.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.750
There we go, and it has
been nested as well.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.045
So the container is now

00:03:05.045 --> 00:03:07.925
the parents of these
D-block element.

00:03:07.925 --> 00:03:10.879
And D-block is the child
of this container.

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:13.520
The container is the
child of section,

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.790
and the section is the
parent of the container.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.595
So I can easily
collapse and expand

00:03:19.595 --> 00:03:21.560
these elements if you have

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.515
multiple sections and
multiple elements,

00:03:24.515 --> 00:03:26.300
just like this, and you want to

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.940
collapse all at the same time.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.970
You can click on this
icon right at the top.

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.070
And if I click on
it, once again,

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.960
I can expand them all.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.790
You can expand the Navigator as

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.130
well by clicking on this icon.

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.245
And you can pin the navigator

00:03:42.245 --> 00:03:44.795
just like that in
the upcoming videos,

00:03:44.795 --> 00:03:48.079
we're going to dive
into Webflow elements.

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.070
So see you then.
