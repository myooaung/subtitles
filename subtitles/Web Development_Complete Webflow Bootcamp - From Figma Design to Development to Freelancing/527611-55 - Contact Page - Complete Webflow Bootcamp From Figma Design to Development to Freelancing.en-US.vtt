00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.960
Hey, in this video
we're going to

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.300
create the Contact
Us page together.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.280
This is going to
be a static page.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.335
Therefore, we're not
going to work with

00:00:13.335 --> 00:00:16.185
our CMS and any dynamic content.

00:00:16.185 --> 00:00:19.080
So we just need to create
this form and that's all.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.595
Let me go ahead and analyze

00:00:20.595 --> 00:00:22.185
all the elements on this page.

00:00:22.185 --> 00:00:25.770
At the top, we need to have
the navigation bar as usual.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.260
Then we need to have
this Contact Us section

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.850
and finally the future.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.100
So for the nav bar
and the footer,

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.305
we can use our symbols.

00:00:34.305 --> 00:00:37.410
And then we need to create
this Contact Us section.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.540
And inside we need to put
a container as usual.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.120
And then we need to have a
heading and a form block.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.955
This form block is going to
have different text fields,

00:00:46.955 --> 00:00:49.880
like full name, email, phone.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.490
And here, instead of
using a TextField,

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.515
we're going to use a text area.

00:00:54.515 --> 00:00:54.920
Why?

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.200
Because the user's message might

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.555
be learned and therefore
it takes will,

00:00:59.555 --> 00:01:02.885
would be too small for
collecting that data.

00:01:02.885 --> 00:01:06.575
And finally, we will have
this large submit button.

00:01:06.575 --> 00:01:08.105
Nothing complicated.

00:01:08.105 --> 00:01:09.980
So let's get started.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.055
First of all, I'm going
to go to Webflow and

00:01:13.055 --> 00:01:16.265
I'm gonna go ahead and
create a new static page.

00:01:16.265 --> 00:01:17.824
If I go to pages,

00:01:17.824 --> 00:01:19.340
I can hit this create

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.145
new page button and then
I'm going to call it

00:01:22.145 --> 00:01:27.050
contact us and hit the Create
button, just like that.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.165
Alright, now it's time to add

00:01:29.165 --> 00:01:31.385
our navbar and our footer here.

00:01:31.385 --> 00:01:34.180
So I'm gonna go to the
Symbol section and

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.175
I'm going to drag and drop
our navbar right at the top.

00:01:37.175 --> 00:01:39.950
And then let me drag and
drop our footer right below

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.145
that in-between we're
going to create a section.

00:01:43.145 --> 00:01:45.140
So I'm going to select my body

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.495
and let's hit Command
key or Control K.

00:01:47.495 --> 00:01:49.144
And let me create a section.

00:01:49.144 --> 00:01:53.030
Then I'm going to give it
a class, Section class.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.235
And finally, I'm
going to move it

00:01:55.235 --> 00:01:58.025
up and put it between
these two symbols.

00:01:58.025 --> 00:02:00.649
And inside, we're going
to need a container.

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.130
So first, I'm going to give
this section a combo class.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.795
I'm going to call it contact.

00:02:05.795 --> 00:02:07.744
And then while it's selected,

00:02:07.744 --> 00:02:09.140
let's see the Command key or

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.915
Control K and look
for a div block.

00:02:11.915 --> 00:02:13.985
And then I'm gonna
give this the block,

00:02:13.985 --> 00:02:16.880
the container class,
and we're good to go.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.515
So inside this container,

00:02:18.515 --> 00:02:20.060
we're going to need a heading.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.545
So while it's selected,

00:02:21.545 --> 00:02:23.120
let's use the Quick find.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.025
And I am going to write heading,

00:02:25.025 --> 00:02:27.095
and it's going to be H1.

00:02:27.095 --> 00:02:28.880
Then let's give it a class.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.135
I'm going to write
contact underscore,

00:02:32.135 --> 00:02:34.190
underscore heading.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.560
Finally, we need to modify some

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.525
of its topography properties.

00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:40.595
I'm going to start
with its font size.

00:02:40.595 --> 00:02:42.620
It's 38 pixels.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.230
I'm going to write
60 pixels because we

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.800
used 60 pixels for our
H1 headings before.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.565
And then I'm going to change
its color to neutral dark.

00:02:52.565 --> 00:02:54.725
Let me modify its
line-height as well.

00:02:54.725 --> 00:02:59.330
I'm going to change it to
100 and maybe ten per cent.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.945
And finally, we're gonna give
it some pattern margins.

00:03:02.945 --> 00:03:06.740
Okay, I'm gonna go to my design
file and if I select it,

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.190
I can see that it has an
AD pixel bottom margin.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.755
So first, while it's selected,

00:03:12.755 --> 00:03:15.470
I'm going to remove its
default top margin.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.045
I'm going to set it to zero.

00:03:17.045 --> 00:03:18.575
Then I'm going to change

00:03:18.575 --> 00:03:22.565
its default bottom margin
to 80 pixels are right.

00:03:22.565 --> 00:03:23.735
What else do I need?

00:03:23.735 --> 00:03:26.810
Right below that, I'm going
to need a form block.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.970
So I'm going to
select this container

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.370
and I'm going to hit
Command key or Control K.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.335
And let's look for a form block.

00:03:33.335 --> 00:03:35.765
There it is, are
formed block is ready.

00:03:35.765 --> 00:03:38.120
Now inside this form
block, as usual,

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.995
we have two different
text fields

00:03:39.995 --> 00:03:41.855
and two labels and one Martin,

00:03:41.855 --> 00:03:43.355
and we're going to modify that.

00:03:43.355 --> 00:03:45.005
I'm gonna go ahead and remove

00:03:45.005 --> 00:03:46.970
one of these text
fields and one of

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.905
these labels until I get

00:03:48.905 --> 00:03:51.155
only one takes fail
than one label.

00:03:51.155 --> 00:03:51.905
Okay?

00:03:51.905 --> 00:03:55.235
I'm going to start by
creating the name text field.

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:57.080
I'm gonna go to my design file.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.990
And here, if I select
this full name,

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.520
you can see that it's using

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.890
the neutral medium
color and it's

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.365
using the body
regular text style.

00:04:06.365 --> 00:04:09.610
And it's fun size is 20
pixels or 20 points.

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.630
I'm going to hit over
to Webflow and I'm

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.760
going to give it a
class That's right,

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.074
contact underscore,
underscore title.

00:04:17.074 --> 00:04:18.800
Then I'm going to modify some

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.170
of its topography properties.

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.630
So let's start with its weight.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.790
It's going to be normal and

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.565
its size is going
to be 20 pixels.

00:04:28.565 --> 00:04:31.925
And finally, the color
is going to be neutral.

00:04:31.925 --> 00:04:33.590
Medium are right, cool.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.450
So our label is ready.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.720
Now I'm going to go ahead
and copy the text here,

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.730
full name with this asterisk

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.235
because this field is
going to be required.

00:04:43.235 --> 00:04:45.080
There we go, our label is ready,

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.475
I'm going to select it.

00:04:46.475 --> 00:04:49.580
Let me give it some
more button margins.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.875
If I select this label here,

00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:53.660
and I checked the bottom margin,

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.960
if I hold down the option key
on my keyboard or Alt key,

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.185
you can see that it has a
ten big cell bottom margin.

00:05:00.185 --> 00:05:02.570
So I'm going to increase
its bottom margin

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.894
here as well to ten pixels.

00:05:04.894 --> 00:05:06.485
But what about the TextField?

00:05:06.485 --> 00:05:07.820
So I'm going to select this

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.290
text field and I'm
gonna give you

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.990
the class because I'm going
to change its styling.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.510
Let's write contact underscore,

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.710
underscore Form, underscore,
underscore, TextField.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.105
Just like that.

00:05:20.105 --> 00:05:24.005
Then I'm going to change
its width to 100 per cent,

00:05:24.005 --> 00:05:28.565
that it always takes up
100% of its parent width.

00:05:28.565 --> 00:05:30.680
And also I am going
to change its height.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.880
Let me go ahead and check

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.370
the height data used
for this text field.

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.910
As you can see, its height
is set to 70 pixels.

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.825
So I'm going to set its height
here to 70 pixels as well.

00:05:41.825 --> 00:05:43.310
And then I'm gonna go ahead and

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.050
modify its background color.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.075
So let me go to my design file.

00:05:47.075 --> 00:05:48.680
And here, as you can see,

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.505
I'm using this color
code with a 10% opacity.

00:05:52.505 --> 00:05:55.265
So I'm going to copy
this hex color code.

00:05:55.265 --> 00:05:58.835
It's 6708d.

00:05:58.835 --> 00:06:00.260
Then I'm going to paste it

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.870
here in this background's
color field.

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:03.965
It's too dark.

00:06:03.965 --> 00:06:06.635
Finally, I'm going to
decrease its opacity.

00:06:06.635 --> 00:06:10.340
It's all fair, amount to ten
per cent, and there it is.

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.114
But as you can see, it
kinda has a border.

00:06:13.114 --> 00:06:14.195
If I select it,

00:06:14.195 --> 00:06:16.250
you can see that there
is no border here.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.385
That's because takes wheels
by default have borders.

00:06:19.385 --> 00:06:20.735
So how can we fix that?

00:06:20.735 --> 00:06:23.480
We can simply change the
style of this border

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.215
here to solid and
turn it back to none.

00:06:27.215 --> 00:06:29.465
But what about the
placeholder text?

00:06:29.465 --> 00:06:30.575
Well, if you remember,

00:06:30.575 --> 00:06:33.230
if you just double-click
on your TextField here,

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.525
you can enter your
placeholder text.

00:06:35.525 --> 00:06:39.425
I'm going to write enter
your full name. There we go.

00:06:39.425 --> 00:06:42.020
The text type is going to
be playing because it's

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.305
just the name and surname and
it's going to be required.

00:06:45.305 --> 00:06:48.080
So I'm going to check
this Required checkbox.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.485
Alright, cool. But what about
the placeholders styling?

00:06:51.485 --> 00:06:53.090
Well, I'm gonna go to

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.820
the place holder
state just like that,

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.950
and I'm going to
modify its color.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.765
So let's see what we have here.

00:06:59.765 --> 00:07:01.235
If I select this text,

00:07:01.235 --> 00:07:03.155
it's using neutral medium.

00:07:03.155 --> 00:07:05.030
So let me go ahead and change

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:06.995
its color to neutral medium.

00:07:06.995 --> 00:07:08.300
And I'm going to increase

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.050
its font size to 17
pixels are right,

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.375
cool, our TextField is ready.

00:07:14.375 --> 00:07:15.830
Now I'm gonna go
ahead and create

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.395
other text fields like
e-mail and phone.

00:07:18.395 --> 00:07:21.740
Okay, so first I'm going
to select this form,

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.440
the block, and I'm going
to give it a class.

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.535
So let's try it.

00:07:25.535 --> 00:07:27.290
Contact underscore,

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:31.340
underscore, underscore,
underscore wrapper.

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.319
And then while it's selected,

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:35.810
I'm going to create
a new div block.

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.735
So let's hit Command
key or Control K.

00:07:38.735 --> 00:07:40.580
I'm going to look
for a div block.

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.725
And this block is going to hold

00:07:42.725 --> 00:07:45.410
this text field and this label.

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:49.805
So I'm going to drag this
label inside this the block.

00:07:49.805 --> 00:07:52.025
And I'm going to
drag this text field

00:07:52.025 --> 00:07:53.945
inside this div block as well,

00:07:53.945 --> 00:07:56.794
make sure that they are
nested inside properly.

00:07:56.794 --> 00:07:58.880
Then I'm going to select
this new div block

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.290
and I'm going to
give it a class.

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:01.250
Let's try it.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:05.720
Contact underscore, underscore,
TextField are right,

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.840
and I'm gonna put it
above my Submit button.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.600
Our first text field is
ready. All right, cool.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.680
Now I'm going to select this

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.420
contact text field div black,

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:17.750
and I'm going to duplicate
it two times r, right?

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:18.860
Just like that.

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.570
And then I'm going to modify

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:23.360
the label of the
second one to e-mail.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.900
As you can see here, we have
email and it's not required,

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.730
so we don't need that asterisk.

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:30.665
And the next one is
going to be fun.

00:08:30.665 --> 00:08:33.815
And also we need to change
the placeholder here.

00:08:33.815 --> 00:08:35.900
So I'm going to double-click
on it and I'm going to

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.300
change the placeholder
to something else.

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:44.105
Let's write, enter
your email address.

00:08:44.105 --> 00:08:46.805
And I'm going to change
the text type to

00:08:46.805 --> 00:08:49.820
email and it's not
gonna be required here.

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:53.510
Let's change the name
of this input to email.

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:56.165
Let's double-click
on this text field.

00:08:56.165 --> 00:08:57.980
And I'm going to
change the placeholder

00:08:57.980 --> 00:08:59.840
to enter your phone number.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.660
And also I'm going to change
the text type from plane

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:06.080
to phone and it's not going
to be required as well.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.455
Let's change the
name here to phone.

00:09:09.455 --> 00:09:10.880
Alright, cool.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.740
Our text fields are ready.

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.900
Now we need one more
field and we're

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.075
going to use a text
area for that.

00:09:17.075 --> 00:09:20.165
So let me go ahead and select
one of these div blocks,

00:09:20.165 --> 00:09:21.845
this contact text field.

00:09:21.845 --> 00:09:23.795
I'm going to duplicate
it once again.

00:09:23.795 --> 00:09:26.495
There it is. Here is the one
that I just duplicate it.

00:09:26.495 --> 00:09:28.670
I'm going to modify the label to

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:31.595
message with an asterisk.

00:09:31.595 --> 00:09:35.645
However, this text field is
too small for our message.

00:09:35.645 --> 00:09:37.160
If I take a look at the design,

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.895
you can see here we have a
text area, not a TextField.

00:09:40.895 --> 00:09:44.150
Therefore, I am going to
remove this TextField,

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:46.640
hit Backspace or Delete
on your keyboard.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.880
And I'm going to select this
contact TextField div block,

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.635
which is the parent
element here.

00:09:51.635 --> 00:09:53.390
And let's hit Command key or

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:56.435
Control K and look
for text area.

00:09:56.435 --> 00:09:58.160
There it is, since
I'm going to use

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:02.165
the same styling that are
used for other text fields.

00:10:02.165 --> 00:10:03.890
I'm just going to
use the same class

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:05.570
that are used for
these text fields.

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:09.140
Okay? So it's contact
form text field.

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.150
Let me give it the same class.

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:14.149
Contact for TextField.

00:10:14.149 --> 00:10:16.475
Let me double-click
on this text area.

00:10:16.475 --> 00:10:20.180
I'm going to change
its name to message.

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:23.375
And the placeholder is
going to be, right,

00:10:23.375 --> 00:10:28.130
your message here and some dots,

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:29.870
and it's going to be required.

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:32.540
Now it's time to modify
our submit button.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:35.405
Let me head over back
to my design file.

00:10:35.405 --> 00:10:38.090
As you can see, the submit
button is going to have

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:41.360
the same styling that we
use for our primary button,

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:45.500
the Contact Us, and also
this getting touch button,

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.780
its height is going
to be AD pixels.

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:50.990
So let's go ahead and
select the Spartan.

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:52.505
I'm gonna give it a class.

00:10:52.505 --> 00:10:54.470
It's going to be primary button,

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:56.600
and then I'm going to
give it a combo class.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.005
Let's try contact and
the texts looks great.

00:11:00.005 --> 00:11:02.900
Now we need to modify
the layout of this form.

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.310
So here as you can see,

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:06.350
this full name text
field takes up

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:09.154
the whole width of its
parents or container.

00:11:09.154 --> 00:11:12.125
And here on the second line
we have two text fields.

00:11:12.125 --> 00:11:15.050
And finally, this message
is going to take up

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:18.650
the whole width of its
parent elements are right.

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:20.330
And this button is
going to take up

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.805
the whole width of its
container as well.

00:11:22.805 --> 00:11:24.935
So how can we
create this layout?

00:11:24.935 --> 00:11:27.065
Well, we can do
that using Flexbox,

00:11:27.065 --> 00:11:28.745
but it would be much easier

00:11:28.745 --> 00:11:30.650
if we could create
it using a grid,

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:34.535
because later on, we want to
make our website responsive.

00:11:34.535 --> 00:11:36.515
It's gonna be much
easier to modify

00:11:36.515 --> 00:11:38.855
our grid rather than a flexbox.

00:11:38.855 --> 00:11:40.955
So I'm gonna go ahead
and create a wrapper.

00:11:40.955 --> 00:11:42.725
I'm going to select
this form block

00:11:42.725 --> 00:11:44.405
and I'm going to
give it a class.

00:11:44.405 --> 00:11:48.215
Let's write contact
underscore, underscore form.

00:11:48.215 --> 00:11:51.380
So what we need to do
is just go ahead and

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:54.845
select this Contact Form
Wrapper that we created before.

00:11:54.845 --> 00:11:56.435
And then I'm going to change

00:11:56.435 --> 00:11:59.300
its display setting
from black to grid.

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:00.185
There we go.

00:12:00.185 --> 00:12:02.285
For this grid, I'm going to need

00:12:02.285 --> 00:12:05.150
six columns and six rows.

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:07.670
Okay, so let me go ahead and add

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:09.590
four more columns using

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:12.950
this plus button
and for more rows.

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:16.985
And also I'm going to change
the gap to 40 pixels.

00:12:16.985 --> 00:12:18.680
And here as well,

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.750
there we go, but they
don't look good.

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:22.010
That's totally fine.

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:23.255
I'm going to hit Done.

00:12:23.255 --> 00:12:25.490
And if I select this block,

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:26.630
and if I hover over

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:29.990
this little circle
and I click and drag,

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:34.235
I can take up all these
six cells just like that.

00:12:34.235 --> 00:12:35.840
Then I'm gonna do the same thing

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.760
for the email text field.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.290
I'm going to select it and I'm

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:40.789
going to click on this circle

00:12:40.789 --> 00:12:43.940
and just drag to
take up three cells.

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.910
Let's do the same thing
for the phone text field.

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:49.700
It's going to take up
the next three cells.

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.770
The message text
field is going to

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:53.765
take up so many different cells.

00:12:53.765 --> 00:12:57.485
Actually it's going to take
up three rows entirely.

00:12:57.485 --> 00:13:00.770
And then I'm going to
select this primary button

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:04.220
and it's going to take
up all these six cells.

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.480
So far, so good.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.099
Let me preview my project.

00:13:07.099 --> 00:13:09.170
As you can see, it looks fine.

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:12.695
However, this takes area looks
like a simple textfield.

00:13:12.695 --> 00:13:14.015
It's not what we want.

00:13:14.015 --> 00:13:15.950
So let's go ahead and fix that.

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:17.765
If I select this text area,

00:13:17.765 --> 00:13:20.855
you can see that its height
is set to 70 pixels.

00:13:20.855 --> 00:13:24.620
Why? Because we gave it this
contact form TextField.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:27.290
Now I'm going to go ahead
and give it a combo class.

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:28.940
That's right message.

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:32.360
So I'm going to overwrite
this default height amount to

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:35.420
200 pixels are right
now it looks much

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.615
better in preview that nice.

00:13:38.615 --> 00:13:40.205
But what about our button?

00:13:40.205 --> 00:13:41.900
I'm going to select it and I'm

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.895
going to give it a
specific height.

00:13:43.895 --> 00:13:47.120
It's going to be a two
pixels, just like that.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.490
Now, let's preview our project.

00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:52.070
Okay, it looks nice
as you can see,

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:53.870
as soon as I preview my project,

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:56.030
this button moved
up a little bit.

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:57.170
That's because we use

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:59.900
this text area and
it's totally fine.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.270
It's not going to break
our website since

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:04.130
this text area doesn't fill up

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:06.485
the whole height
of its container,

00:14:06.485 --> 00:14:09.005
which is this contact
text field div block.

00:14:09.005 --> 00:14:11.885
This button moves up a
little bit, are right.

00:14:11.885 --> 00:14:14.000
Now I'm going to select
this heading and

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.295
I'm going to change
it to Contact Us.

00:14:16.295 --> 00:14:18.525
Now let's preview our project.

00:14:18.525 --> 00:14:20.455
So here we have the navbar,

00:14:20.455 --> 00:14:22.045
we have the Contact Us,

00:14:22.045 --> 00:14:24.310
the for the submit button

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:27.325
and the footer at the
bottom are right,

00:14:27.325 --> 00:14:29.710
everything looks fine
except one thing,

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:32.890
that padding of these
placeholder text.

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:35.245
So let's go ahead and
quickly fix that.

00:14:35.245 --> 00:14:37.465
If I go to my design file here,

00:14:37.465 --> 00:14:41.320
you can see that this
takes, has more padding.

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:46.090
It has a 22 pixels top and
a 20 pixel left padding.

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:47.410
In fact, I'm going to change

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:49.330
the padding of all
these text fields.

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:51.430
Because if you take a
look at the design here,

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:53.500
you can see that all
these text fields

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:54.730
have different padding.

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:59.050
As you can see, 22 pixels
top and 20 pixels left.

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:00.840
So what should I do?

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.810
Instead of changing the padding

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:05.810
here for this
message combo class,

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:08.735
I'm going to select my
contact form text field.

00:15:08.735 --> 00:15:11.134
This is our main base TextField.

00:15:11.134 --> 00:15:13.295
And I'm going to change
the padding here.

00:15:13.295 --> 00:15:15.050
And the change I
make here will be

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:16.985
applied to this message as well.

00:15:16.985 --> 00:15:19.820
Okay, so let me select
this text field and I'm

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:22.655
going to change its top
padding to 20 pixels.

00:15:22.655 --> 00:15:24.935
It's bottom padding
to 20 as well,

00:15:24.935 --> 00:15:27.560
and it's left padding to 20.

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.105
Now it looks much better,

00:15:29.105 --> 00:15:30.890
doesn't it? Are right guys.

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:32.435
That's all for this video.

00:15:32.435 --> 00:15:36.660
I hope you enjoyed it and
I'll see you in the next one.
