00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.380
Once you find your
potential client,

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.215
they will ask you to
send them a proposal.

00:00:10.215 --> 00:00:14.070
And it's one of the most
important stages of freelancing.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.555
If you do it right,

00:00:15.555 --> 00:00:17.400
you will dramatically increase

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.305
the chance of
getting the project.

00:00:19.305 --> 00:00:21.210
Many beginners struggle with

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.580
this stage because they
prefer to spend time

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.680
on designing and
building a project

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.184
rather than preparing
a great proposal.

00:00:28.184 --> 00:00:30.075
But let me remind you something.

00:00:30.075 --> 00:00:31.860
If you can't get the client,

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.570
there is no project to do.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.125
So it's worth focusing more
on this stage as well.

00:00:37.125 --> 00:00:40.155
Now let's talk about
the proposal itself.

00:00:40.155 --> 00:00:42.310
How should it be structured?

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.854
What information
should be included?

00:00:44.854 --> 00:00:47.315
When it comes to
preparing proposals,

00:00:47.315 --> 00:00:49.655
there is no right or wrong way.

00:00:49.655 --> 00:00:51.859
You can choose between
different styles,

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:54.080
different layouts, and so on.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.900
Here is how I structure
my proposals.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.304
Each proposal should have
seven main elements.

00:01:00.304 --> 00:01:02.585
Number one, introduction.

00:01:02.585 --> 00:01:05.120
This section is mainly
written based on

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.240
the previous conversations
you had with the client.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.034
You can include the client's
name, the project's title,

00:01:12.034 --> 00:01:14.165
the name of your
point of contract,

00:01:14.165 --> 00:01:15.845
your name and title,

00:01:15.845 --> 00:01:18.275
and finally, the
submission date.

00:01:18.275 --> 00:01:21.545
Here is an example of
a good introduction.

00:01:21.545 --> 00:01:24.335
Number two, problem overview.

00:01:24.335 --> 00:01:27.125
Once you introduce
yourself to the client,

00:01:27.125 --> 00:01:29.150
the next important section that

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.655
follows is the problem overview.

00:01:31.655 --> 00:01:33.410
In this section,
you should clearly

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.750
define the problem
and the client should

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.730
understand that there
is an issue with

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.170
their website that has

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.570
a negative impact
on their business,

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:42.920
the client should also

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.010
understand that you have a
profound understanding of

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.170
their problems and
you can clarify

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.320
your responsibilities and
the project scope here.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.710
Remember, the main goal
of a project proposal is

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.280
to make your client believe
you can solve their problems.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.954
So always focus on the
client's needs and issues.

00:02:01.954 --> 00:02:05.420
Here is an example of
a problem overview.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.880
Number three, solution overview.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.310
After defining the
company's problems

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.770
by conducting different
pieces of research,

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.290
it's time to convince
them that you can solve

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.665
the problems by providing
a detailed solution.

00:02:18.665 --> 00:02:21.890
In this section, you should
explain how they can

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.760
benefit from using your
services to solve the problems.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.755
And most importantly, what

00:02:27.755 --> 00:02:30.259
you're gonna do to
solve their problems.

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:31.580
As you can see here,

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.635
we have a very good solution.

00:02:33.635 --> 00:02:36.770
Overview, number
four, deliverables.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.680
This section should clearly
define what you will

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.235
deliver as part of the
project and most importantly,

00:02:43.235 --> 00:02:44.960
what you will not deliver.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.670
You may think it's strange to

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.800
exclude once we do nuts deliver,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.280
but believe me, when you work
with inexperienced clients,

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.805
sometimes they expect you
to prepare their content,

00:02:55.805 --> 00:02:57.815
logo, images, and even

00:02:57.815 --> 00:03:00.350
optimizes their website
for search engines.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.900
It's your responsibility
to clarify

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.200
what is and is not part
of the project scope.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.690
Number five, process overview.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.780
After defining the
problems, solutions,

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.460
and deliverables, you should

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.160
explain what your
process looks like.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.715
This section can outline
different steps of your process,

00:03:19.715 --> 00:03:21.350
like the initial meetings,

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.805
preparing the assets,
designing a wireframe, etc.

00:03:25.805 --> 00:03:29.195
You can also indicate
how long each step takes

00:03:29.195 --> 00:03:33.140
and what you expect from the
client during this process.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.225
Number six, the cast.

00:03:35.225 --> 00:03:38.375
Now it's time to outline
the cost of your services.

00:03:38.375 --> 00:03:40.670
If you don't know
your clients budget,

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.045
make sure to ask them before
preparing the proposal.

00:03:44.045 --> 00:03:46.370
Because otherwise,
you might ask for

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.835
a very high price
or a meagre price.

00:03:49.835 --> 00:03:51.890
Remember, it's
totally fine to ask

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.365
the client about their
budget in advance.

00:03:54.365 --> 00:03:56.660
So don't be afraid
of doing that.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.885
If you don't know how to
price your work, don't worry.

00:03:59.885 --> 00:04:01.445
In the following lesson,

00:04:01.445 --> 00:04:03.320
we will talk about it deeply.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.545
Number seven, CTA
or call to action.

00:04:06.545 --> 00:04:08.480
In this section,
you should prompt

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.970
the client to proceed
to the next step,

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.165
accepting the proposal
and signing the contract.

00:04:14.165 --> 00:04:17.690
If you send your proposal
as a PDF or Word file,

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.310
you can ask them to send you

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.875
an email and let you know
about their decision.

00:04:21.875 --> 00:04:24.425
I don't really recommend
this way. Why?

00:04:24.425 --> 00:04:28.385
Because of many reasons such
as PDFs or not responsive.

00:04:28.385 --> 00:04:31.655
Therefore, if the client wants
to read it on their phone,

00:04:31.655 --> 00:04:33.140
it would be problematic.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.750
The second reason
is PDF's wants let

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.520
the client accept
the project and

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.380
sign the contract immediately.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.060
So instead, you can use

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.520
an online proposal
tool that lets you

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.500
design and prepare the proposal

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.960
professionally and conveniently.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.610
This way, we can send

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.685
the proposal as a webpage
that is responsive,

00:04:52.685 --> 00:04:55.310
password protected,
and editable.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.860
In addition, your client
can simply click on

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.460
the Accept Martin and
immediately signed the contract.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.290
How convenient is that?

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.450
I personally use this website

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.745
to prepare this
proposal for free.

00:05:07.745 --> 00:05:09.890
There are many tools
like this that you can

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.050
use for this purpose are right,

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.315
that's all about
proposal preparation.

00:05:14.315 --> 00:05:17.880
I hope you liked this video
and I'll see you then.
