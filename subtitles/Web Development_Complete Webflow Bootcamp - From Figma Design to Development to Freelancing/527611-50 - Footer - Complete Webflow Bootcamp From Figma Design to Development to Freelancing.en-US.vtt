00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.125
All right, In this video,

00:00:07.125 --> 00:00:08.730
we're going to create

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.640
this footer at the
bottom of our homepage.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.455
This filter is
going to be placed

00:00:13.455 --> 00:00:15.645
on all pages on our website.

00:00:15.645 --> 00:00:18.270
As you can see here
on the project page,

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.100
we have the footer as well,

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.380
on the contact page as well.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.885
So how are we going
to build that?

00:00:24.885 --> 00:00:28.245
Let's analyze it and see
how it's structured.

00:00:28.245 --> 00:00:30.480
As you can see, we have a
section that's going to

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.730
take up the whole
width of our report.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.360
Okay?

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.465
So as usual, we need
to create a section

00:00:36.465 --> 00:00:39.660
and then inside we're
going to need a container.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.185
There we go. And
inside this container,

00:00:42.185 --> 00:00:44.600
we will have two
different IP blocks.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.390
One for the content
on the left side that

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.330
is going to contain the
logo and the address,

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.685
and one for the links
on the right side.

00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:54.305
In fact, for the links,

00:00:54.305 --> 00:00:56.900
I think it would be
much better to create

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.230
a grid because here we have
a two-dimensional layout.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.380
It would make much more
sense to create a grid

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.860
for these links without further
ado, let's get started.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.315
First, I'm going to select

00:01:08.315 --> 00:01:12.035
my body and I'm going to hit
Command key or Control K.

00:01:12.035 --> 00:01:14.224
And let's look for section.

00:01:14.224 --> 00:01:14.735
Then.

00:01:14.735 --> 00:01:18.635
I'm going to give this section
a class as usual Section.

00:01:18.635 --> 00:01:19.235
Nice.

00:01:19.235 --> 00:01:22.280
And we can see anything because
there is nothing inside.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.860
Then why in this
section is selected?

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.630
Let's look for a div block.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.580
I'm going to add a div inside.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.340
And let's give it
the container class,

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.320
because it's going
to be our container.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.720
Alright, nice. Our
section is ready,

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.190
or container inside is

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.310
ready and wireless
container is selected.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.920
I'm gonna give it the
footer combo class

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.315
as well. There we go.

00:01:44.315 --> 00:01:47.075
So as I mentioned
before, for this footer,

00:01:47.075 --> 00:01:49.310
we're going to create
one div black on

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.755
the left side and one
grid on the right side.

00:01:51.755 --> 00:01:55.355
So in total, we're going to
create two div blog spheres.

00:01:55.355 --> 00:01:57.140
Wireless container is selected.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.940
Let's look for the block.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.895
Okay, I'm going to add
another div block,

00:02:01.895 --> 00:02:04.610
so make sure that your
container is selected.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.545
And then using the Quick find,

00:02:06.545 --> 00:02:08.405
you can add a div block.

00:02:08.405 --> 00:02:10.940
There we go. So now we
have two deep blacks.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.050
I'm going to select the top

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.955
one and I'm going to
give you the class.

00:02:13.955 --> 00:02:18.575
Let's write filter, underscore,
underscore content.

00:02:18.575 --> 00:02:20.870
And I'm going to
select the second one.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.654
And I'm gonna give it a class.

00:02:22.654 --> 00:02:27.514
Let's write filter
underscore, underscore links.

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:31.040
Okay, cool. Then I'm going
to select this container and

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.780
I'm going to change
the display setting

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.535
from black to flex Mike's.

00:02:34.535 --> 00:02:36.140
Why? Because I'm going to align

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.390
these two deep
blacks horizontally.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.555
Vertically. Therefore, I'm
going to change it to Flexbox.

00:02:41.555 --> 00:02:44.360
There we go, that direction
is set to horizontal.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.820
And the only thing I need
to do here is change

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.105
the justify to space
between just like that.

00:02:50.105 --> 00:02:51.980
Because we want
these deep blacks to

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.065
touch the edges of
this container.

00:02:54.065 --> 00:02:56.510
Alright, let's take a
look at our design file.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.930
And if I select this group
here on the left side,

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.960
you can see that this
content bikes, this,

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.865
the block is going to have

00:03:04.865 --> 00:03:08.540
a specific width of 260 pixels.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.240
So what I'm gonna do is select

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.555
this particular div
block footer content,

00:03:14.555 --> 00:03:18.620
and I'm going to give it a
maximum width of 260 pixels.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.470
And then inside I'm going to
add one more div blank for

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.025
our logo and a one
textblock for the address.

00:03:25.025 --> 00:03:26.705
So while it's selected,

00:03:26.705 --> 00:03:28.130
let's hit Command key or

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.620
Control K and look
for div block.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.780
And I'm going to give
this the blocker class.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.750
Let's write footer, underscore,

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.624
underscore content,
underscore, underscore logo.

00:03:40.624 --> 00:03:43.625
And then if I head over to
the background section here,

00:03:43.625 --> 00:03:44.960
I can add an image.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.355
And from the assets,

00:03:46.355 --> 00:03:47.480
I'm going to choose

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.460
this circle logo and I'm going

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.695
to change the size to contain.

00:03:51.695 --> 00:03:55.790
Let me reposition that to
center and don't tie them.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.515
Let me take a look at my design.

00:03:57.515 --> 00:03:59.075
If I select this logo,

00:03:59.075 --> 00:04:02.104
it's width is roughly 100 pixels

00:04:02.104 --> 00:04:04.685
and its height is 30 pixels.

00:04:04.685 --> 00:04:09.050
So while this footer content
logo div black is selected,

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.240
I'm going to set
a specific width,

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.965
100 pixels, and its height
is going to be 30 pixels.

00:04:15.965 --> 00:04:18.455
Alright, but what
about the address?

00:04:18.455 --> 00:04:20.930
I'm going to select this
footer content div.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.755
And I'm going to add a text
block here just like that.

00:04:24.755 --> 00:04:27.620
Then I'm going to need
to give it a class.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.200
So let's name it
footer, underscore,

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.705
underscore content, underscore,
underscore address.

00:04:35.705 --> 00:04:39.215
And let's go ahead
and modify some of

00:04:39.215 --> 00:04:42.815
its topography properties
the way it looks fine.

00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:45.755
I'm going to change
the size to 17 pixels.

00:04:45.755 --> 00:04:49.010
Then I'm going to
change the color to

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.570
neutral medium and the line
height to 150 per cent.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.340
And finally, I'm going to copy

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.580
this address and let's
paste it right here.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:59.840
Let's see what we have here.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.014
If I select this footer content,

00:05:02.014 --> 00:05:04.460
you can see that the
display setting is set

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.965
to block and it looks fine now,

00:05:06.965 --> 00:05:08.420
however, later when we want to

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.400
make our website responsive.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.084
It would be problematic
because e.g.

00:05:13.084 --> 00:05:15.725
in mobile portrait or landscape,

00:05:15.725 --> 00:05:16.910
we might need to change

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.415
the alignment of these
two elements here.

00:05:19.415 --> 00:05:22.055
Therefore, now I'm
going to change it to

00:05:22.055 --> 00:05:23.510
Flexbox and I'm going to

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.595
change the direction
to vertical.

00:05:25.595 --> 00:05:27.559
And I'm going to
select this logo

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:29.990
and we need to give it
some bottom margins.

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.555
So let me select this logo here,

00:05:32.555 --> 00:05:35.615
and its bottom margin is
going to be 30 pixels.

00:05:35.615 --> 00:05:37.220
Therefore here, I'm
going to give it

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.140
a 30 pixels bottom margin.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.824
Nice. Alright, our
footer content

00:05:41.824 --> 00:05:44.765
is ready now it's time to
move on to the next part,

00:05:44.765 --> 00:05:46.100
which is footer links.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.244
If I select this footer links

00:05:48.244 --> 00:05:50.630
and I hit Command
K or control K,

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.580
I can look for text link.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.875
Then I can give it a class.

00:05:54.875 --> 00:05:59.255
So let's write footer,
underscore, underscore link.

00:05:59.255 --> 00:06:02.915
And I'm going to modify
its topography properties.

00:06:02.915 --> 00:06:06.230
First of all, let me
increase its font size to

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:10.865
17 pixels and its color is
going to be neutral medium.

00:06:10.865 --> 00:06:13.895
And finally, I'm going to
set the declaration to none.

00:06:13.895 --> 00:06:17.435
Okay, So this is basically
our styling here.

00:06:17.435 --> 00:06:21.425
Then I'm gonna go ahead
and copy this text here.

00:06:21.425 --> 00:06:25.010
The first one is going
to be team. Nice.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.930
Now I'm going to
duplicate it five

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.240
times to get six
different links.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.635
So I can just copy it,

00:06:30.635 --> 00:06:33.365
Command C or Control
C and paste it

00:06:33.365 --> 00:06:36.515
five times using
Command V or Control V,

00:06:36.515 --> 00:06:39.455
just like that are right,

00:06:39.455 --> 00:06:42.155
I've got six
different links here.

00:06:42.155 --> 00:06:44.690
And now I'm just gonna
go ahead and copy

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.375
and paste these
names one by one.

00:06:47.375 --> 00:06:50.015
Alright, are six
links are ready.

00:06:50.015 --> 00:06:51.740
But since the display setting of

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.650
this footer links
is set to block,

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.540
we can see that they
are sitting next to

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.520
each other and this
is not what we want.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:59.570
As I mentioned before,

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:01.910
we're going to
change it to a grid.

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:03.485
Let's hit the grid.

00:07:03.485 --> 00:07:05.825
We're going to have three
columns and two rows.

00:07:05.825 --> 00:07:08.465
Therefore, I'm going to
add one more column here.

00:07:08.465 --> 00:07:09.185
Nice.

00:07:09.185 --> 00:07:10.730
Now I'm going to hit Done.

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.520
Alright, our grid
is ready as well.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.780
However, as you can see,

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.670
we don't have any bottom margin.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:18.470
And now our container is

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.200
touching the bottom
edge of our screen.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.520
It's not what we want.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.260
So let's go ahead and select

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.705
this container here
in our design file.

00:07:26.705 --> 00:07:28.745
And I'm going to check
the bottom margin.

00:07:28.745 --> 00:07:30.905
It's set to 100 pixels.

00:07:30.905 --> 00:07:32.120
So what should we do?

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.030
If I go ahead and select
this container and try

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:37.970
to add some bottom
margins, it doesn't work.

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:39.725
Therefore, I'm going to select

00:07:39.725 --> 00:07:41.570
our section and I'm going to

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:44.000
give it a bottom
padding instead.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.740
So here I'm going to set

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.485
the bottom padding
to 100 pixels.

00:07:48.485 --> 00:07:51.080
And there we go. We've
got what we wanted.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.030
Oops, but look what happens.

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:54.650
As you can see, as soon as I

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:56.735
added some padding
to this section,

00:07:56.735 --> 00:08:00.500
the padding of this section
has been changed as well.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:01.940
So why is that?

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.485
The reason is we didn't

00:08:03.485 --> 00:08:05.705
add a combo class
to this section.

00:08:05.705 --> 00:08:08.000
As you can see, we don't
have any combo class and

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.865
that's bottom padding has
been added to all sections.

00:08:10.865 --> 00:08:13.745
All sections have this
extra bottom padding

00:08:13.745 --> 00:08:15.275
and it's not what we want.

00:08:15.275 --> 00:08:17.225
So how can we fix that?

00:08:17.225 --> 00:08:20.330
Well, I'm gonna hit
Command Z or Control Z to

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:23.855
remove this padding wildly
section is selected,

00:08:23.855 --> 00:08:25.985
wine, our footer
section is selected.

00:08:25.985 --> 00:08:29.660
I'm going to give it a
combo class called footer.

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.250
Now I can easily add

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:34.759
that extra padding without
affecting other sections.

00:08:34.759 --> 00:08:37.760
So I'm going to set
it to 100 pixels.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:38.495
There we go.

00:08:38.495 --> 00:08:39.935
Now it looks amazing.

00:08:39.935 --> 00:08:42.485
All right guys, that's
all for this video.

00:08:42.485 --> 00:08:46.470
I hope you enjoyed it and
I'll see you in the next one.
