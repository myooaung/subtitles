00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.770
If you want your images
or your videos to be

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.475
displayed in a full-screen
view on any device,

00:00:11.475 --> 00:00:13.650
you can use a light box.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.680
If you head over to
the components section

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.735
on the ad panel,

00:00:18.735 --> 00:00:21.765
you can find a
lightbox components.

00:00:21.765 --> 00:00:24.990
I'm going to drag and drop
it into my container.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.545
There we go.

00:00:25.545 --> 00:00:28.965
This is a lightbox link and
in order to work with that,

00:00:28.965 --> 00:00:30.495
we need a thumbnail.

00:00:30.495 --> 00:00:32.100
So if I double-click on that,

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.320
I can choose the
image inside because

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.955
by default it has an image.

00:00:36.955 --> 00:00:38.750
And from my assets,

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.080
I'm going to choose this
image and I'm going to

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.860
decrease the width and
height to 300 pixels.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.775
And the height is going to be
400 pixels, just like that.

00:00:49.775 --> 00:00:52.700
Alright, so this is
a lightbox link.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.070
Let's preview and
see what happens.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.255
If I click on that.

00:00:56.255 --> 00:00:59.795
Nothing happens because in
order for a lightbox to work,

00:00:59.795 --> 00:01:02.420
we need to specify
a media for that.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.810
We need to go ahead and
select our light bikes link.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.640
And then we need to head over to

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.955
the elements settings right
next to the side panel.

00:01:10.955 --> 00:01:15.050
And from here we can find
light bikes settings.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.330
And there is this media section.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.315
We can either choose and
an image or a video.

00:01:20.315 --> 00:01:21.965
Let's start with an image.

00:01:21.965 --> 00:01:23.930
I'm going to select an image,

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.500
the same image from my assets.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.415
There we go.

00:01:28.415 --> 00:01:30.200
There is this caption here.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.640
We're not going to add a caption

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.990
for now because
I'm going to show

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.140
you the difference between
these two options.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.445
I'm going to save.

00:01:37.445 --> 00:01:39.575
Then let's preview it.

00:01:39.575 --> 00:01:40.580
There we go.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.040
If I click on my lightbox link,

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.570
we can preview this image in

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.675
a full screen view
on any device.

00:01:47.675 --> 00:01:49.415
It works perfectly on

00:01:49.415 --> 00:01:53.750
mobile and tablet or any
screens just like that.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.125
But what if I want to have
multiple lightbox links?

00:01:57.125 --> 00:01:58.790
Well, that's very simple.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.465
I can simply drag and
drop more light boxes.

00:02:02.465 --> 00:02:04.850
Or I can simply copy

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.410
this light box and paste it
again and again and again.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.605
So let me remove this
new lightbox link.

00:02:12.605 --> 00:02:15.140
And I'm going to copy
this light box link,

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.930
command C or control C and

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.005
Command V or Control
V. Once again,

00:02:21.005 --> 00:02:24.245
to get three different
lightbox links,

00:02:24.245 --> 00:02:27.755
alright, by default, there
is no padding between them.

00:02:27.755 --> 00:02:31.070
I'm going to select this light
bugs link, the first one.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.385
And I'm going to go to
the spacing and just add

00:02:34.385 --> 00:02:38.419
some right padding, ten pixels.

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:40.205
As you can see, immediately,

00:02:40.205 --> 00:02:41.959
a class has been created.

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.895
We didn't talk
about classes yet,

00:02:43.895 --> 00:02:46.985
but for now we just need
this name lightbox link.

00:02:46.985 --> 00:02:49.054
Later we will dive into classes.

00:02:49.054 --> 00:02:51.485
I'm going to select
the second lightbox.

00:02:51.485 --> 00:02:53.570
And from here I'm
going to look for

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.675
light bugs linked
class, just like that.

00:02:56.675 --> 00:03:01.010
And once I apply this class
to the second lightbox link,

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.130
these elements can use
all this tilings that

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.490
they already defined for
this particular class.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:08.195
Alright, cool.

00:03:08.195 --> 00:03:10.370
Now I'm going to
change the thumbnail

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.355
of these two live vaccines.

00:03:13.355 --> 00:03:15.320
So let me double-click on it and

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.510
replace the image to this one.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.680
And for the third one,

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.405
I'm gonna do the same thing.

00:03:20.405 --> 00:03:21.245
There we go.

00:03:21.245 --> 00:03:23.495
Our Tom nails are ready.

00:03:23.495 --> 00:03:24.830
Now let's preview.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.780
The first one looks fine.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.540
The second one shows
the same image

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.525
because we just
copied and pasted it,

00:03:32.525 --> 00:03:33.980
the third one the same.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.530
So what we need to do is we need

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.530
to select our second
lightbox link,

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.095
then head over to the
elements settings.

00:03:42.095 --> 00:03:45.785
And from here, we need
to remove that media

00:03:45.785 --> 00:03:50.180
and add another image that
corresponds to this thumbnail.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.820
Cool, I'm going to save
it for the third one.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.395
I'm going to do the same thing.

00:03:54.395 --> 00:03:56.480
I'm going to remove
this media and

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.405
choose the proper
image and save.

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:01.385
Now, it should work perfectly.

00:04:01.385 --> 00:04:02.630
So let's give it a try.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.060
I'm going to click
on the first image.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.795
The second one, and a third one.

00:04:08.795 --> 00:04:10.400
But here as you can see,

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.020
there is no caption.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.080
So what happens if I add
a caption to our media?

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.180
Let's go and check it out.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.060
I'm going to select the
first line box link.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.250
And from here I'm
going to click on

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.654
this first image and
let's add a caption.

00:04:25.654 --> 00:04:29.600
This is a nice image.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.265
Cool. Save.

00:04:31.265 --> 00:04:34.205
Now let's see what
happens if I click on it.

00:04:34.205 --> 00:04:36.170
As you can see, a
caption has been

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.585
added to the bottom
of this image.

00:04:38.585 --> 00:04:39.695
That's very handy.

00:04:39.695 --> 00:04:41.420
But what if I want to connect

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.765
my light boxes together
so we can do that.

00:04:44.765 --> 00:04:45.980
That's very simple.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.840
First, we need to select

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.135
this light bikes
link, the first one.

00:04:50.135 --> 00:04:52.880
And under the media
There is a checkbox

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.565
that says link with
other light boxes.

00:04:55.565 --> 00:04:57.710
If I check this here,

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.435
I can specify a group name.

00:04:59.435 --> 00:05:01.820
It's very important
because if you

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.135
have multiple light
boxes on a page,

00:05:05.135 --> 00:05:08.435
this is how we can
connect them properly.

00:05:08.435 --> 00:05:09.905
So let's give it a name.

00:05:09.905 --> 00:05:11.900
I'm going to write main.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.610
I'm going to copy it.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.640
Let me select my
second lightbox link.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.595
And I'm going to
paste that name here.

00:05:19.595 --> 00:05:21.125
For the third one,

00:05:21.125 --> 00:05:22.745
I'm going to do the same thing.

00:05:22.745 --> 00:05:25.744
And now our lightbox
links are connected.

00:05:25.744 --> 00:05:27.095
Let's give it a try.

00:05:27.095 --> 00:05:31.025
I'm going to click on this
first link. And there we go.

00:05:31.025 --> 00:05:35.270
Now we have this kind
of slider interaction.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.480
I can click on this
right arrow button and I

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.200
can simply move
through these items.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.805
That's very useful.

00:05:43.805 --> 00:05:47.135
E.g. if you want to create
an e-commerce website

00:05:47.135 --> 00:05:48.500
and you need to show

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.290
different images of a
particular product.

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.135
You can use a light box.

00:05:53.135 --> 00:05:54.410
So let's recap.

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:57.275
In order to work with
light boxes, first,

00:05:57.275 --> 00:05:58.910
you need to drag and drop

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.475
a lightbox link
into your Canvas.

00:06:01.475 --> 00:06:04.685
Second, you need to
choose your thumbnail,

00:06:04.685 --> 00:06:06.005
which is this image.

00:06:06.005 --> 00:06:08.014
And third, which
is so important,

00:06:08.014 --> 00:06:09.575
you need to add

00:06:09.575 --> 00:06:12.545
a media for that particular
light bikes link.

00:06:12.545 --> 00:06:14.870
If you want to connect
your lightbox links,

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.940
you need to check this link with

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.775
other light boxes and
specify a group name.

00:06:19.775 --> 00:06:22.160
Alright guys, I hope
you enjoyed this video.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.660
I'll see you in the next one.
