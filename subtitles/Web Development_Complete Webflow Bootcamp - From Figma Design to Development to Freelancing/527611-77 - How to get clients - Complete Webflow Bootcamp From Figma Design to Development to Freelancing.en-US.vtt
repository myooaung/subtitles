00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.305
No matter how good
your design is,

00:00:07.305 --> 00:00:09.450
if you can sell your services,

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.460
I'm afraid to say
you will be out

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.575
of this business
sooner or later,

00:00:13.575 --> 00:00:15.645
but we are not going
to let that happen.

00:00:15.645 --> 00:00:18.780
So let's assume you have
no prior web design and

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.730
web development experience and

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.815
you want to start from scratch.

00:00:22.815 --> 00:00:26.265
What do we need to do to
get your very first client?

00:00:26.265 --> 00:00:27.960
That's a simple question,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.135
but the answer is
not that simple.

00:00:30.135 --> 00:00:30.975
Why?

00:00:30.975 --> 00:00:33.030
Because there is a set
of things you need to

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.220
do to get your first client.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.155
To get a client first,

00:00:37.155 --> 00:00:39.765
you should understand
how clients think,

00:00:39.765 --> 00:00:43.025
what matters to them and
what they want to achieve.

00:00:43.025 --> 00:00:45.530
A client always
needs to trust you

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.560
first before signing
the contract with you.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.155
So how can you gain
the client's trust?

00:00:51.155 --> 00:00:53.210
Well, you need to
show them that you're

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.490
capable of doing what
you're offering,

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.025
how, by presenting
your portfolio.

00:00:58.025 --> 00:01:00.634
But wait, you didn't
have any clients.

00:01:00.634 --> 00:01:02.180
What should you show them?

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.990
The answer is, you need to
create some sample projects.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.470
To do so, you can look for
some local businesses around

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.595
you and see if their websites
require some improvements.

00:01:13.595 --> 00:01:15.544
You can redesign their websites

00:01:15.544 --> 00:01:17.915
and build them in
Webflow quickly.

00:01:17.915 --> 00:01:20.105
Remember, it
shouldn't be perfect.

00:01:20.105 --> 00:01:21.560
Then you can reach out to them

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.330
and show them what you've done.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.010
You can simply say, Hey,

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.990
I'm a web designer and I thought

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.435
maybe your website
needs to be updated.

00:01:29.435 --> 00:01:32.150
Here is the before and
after of your website,

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.850
and I would be glad to
offer my services to you.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.590
This is the easiest way to get

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.855
started and get
your first client.

00:01:38.855 --> 00:01:41.270
Additionally, you
can post your sample

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.895
works on social
media like LinkedIn,

00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:46.925
instagram, Facebook, et cetera.

00:01:46.925 --> 00:01:50.000
This Way, more and
more potential clients

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.775
will see your work and
they may reach out to you.

00:01:52.775 --> 00:01:53.900
You can also post

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.900
your sample projects on
Behance and dribble.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.180
These platforms are
a great place to

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.910
show off your design and
web development skills.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.100
The next thing you
need to do is create

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.695
an account on a
freelance marketplace.

00:02:06.695 --> 00:02:08.840
There are many marketplaces that

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.330
help you get clients
conveniently,

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.635
like fiber, freelancer,
Upwork, et cetera.

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:20.090
I suggest freelancer.com, but
you can be on any of them.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.495
Create your profile and add
your sample works to it.

00:02:23.495 --> 00:02:25.640
In the beginning,
it's harder to get

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.830
clients because you
didn't get any reviews.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:28.910
But once you complete

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.670
a few projects and
get good reviews,

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.910
it becomes much easier
to acquire new clients.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.130
I'd like you to know
that freelancing is

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.980
all about connections
and relationships.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.260
So if you type two
different clients,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.425
but they didn't give you
the project, that's fine.

00:02:45.425 --> 00:02:47.195
It's part of the process.

00:02:47.195 --> 00:02:49.370
They may reach out to
you after one year

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.499
or so and give you
another project.

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:54.680
So it's so important to create
great relationships with

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.780
everyone because who knows

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.790
they may be your future clients.
