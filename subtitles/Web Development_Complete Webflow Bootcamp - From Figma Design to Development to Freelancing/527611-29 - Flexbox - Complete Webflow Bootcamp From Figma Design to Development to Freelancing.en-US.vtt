00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.190
In the previous video,

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.860
we talked about all
the display settings

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.485
that you can use
for your layouts.

00:00:11.485 --> 00:00:13.780
And in this video, we're
going to dive into

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.645
the details of using Flexbox.

00:00:16.645 --> 00:00:17.710
As I mentioned before,

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.954
flexbox is very useful for
one-dimensional layouts.

00:00:21.954 --> 00:00:24.430
And I'm going to show
you some useful examples

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.470
that you could truly
understand how you

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.810
can use different features and

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.195
different properties
of a flex max.

00:00:31.195 --> 00:00:32.350
Here as you can see,

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.900
I created some simple cards.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.775
If I go to this wrapper,

00:00:36.775 --> 00:00:38.785
I have three different cards.

00:00:38.785 --> 00:00:43.065
As you can see, each card
has one image, one heading,

00:00:43.065 --> 00:00:45.875
one textblock, nothing fancy,

00:00:45.875 --> 00:00:48.770
but their alignment is not
what I want. Actually.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.605
I want them to sit
next to each other.

00:00:51.605 --> 00:00:54.455
And for this, what
we can do is use

00:00:54.455 --> 00:00:58.055
a flexbox whenever you want
to align some elements,

00:00:58.055 --> 00:01:00.575
you need to make sure not to set

00:01:00.575 --> 00:01:04.265
the display setting of
those elements to Flexbox.

00:01:04.265 --> 00:01:05.585
That's wrong.

00:01:05.585 --> 00:01:09.500
Let me show you what happens
if I select this card, e.g.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.925
the first one, and I turn the
display setting to Flexbox.

00:01:13.925 --> 00:01:16.445
This is what happens and
it's not our intent.

00:01:16.445 --> 00:01:18.740
So you need to
always make sure to

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.215
choose the parents
of those elements.

00:01:21.215 --> 00:01:22.820
In this case, the parents of

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.910
these cards is this
wrapper, okay?

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.640
I'm going to select the
wrapper which is the parent,

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.240
and I'm going to turn it
into a flexbox. There we go.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.610
Now this cards sit next to each

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.385
other and if I want them
to stack vertically,

00:01:37.385 --> 00:01:39.530
I can change the direction from

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.025
horizontal to vertical,
just like that.

00:01:43.025 --> 00:01:45.515
For now, I'm going to
keep it horizontal.

00:01:45.515 --> 00:01:49.085
And let's talk about the
alignment and the justification.

00:01:49.085 --> 00:01:51.304
When I turn anything
to a flexbox,

00:01:51.304 --> 00:01:54.815
I can control the
alignment of its children.

00:01:54.815 --> 00:01:58.925
Right now. The children of
this Flexbox are these cards.

00:01:58.925 --> 00:02:00.155
So what I'm gonna do,

00:02:00.155 --> 00:02:02.930
I'm gonna show you how
the alignment works.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.415
If I change the alignment.

00:02:04.415 --> 00:02:06.590
Now you can see what's going on.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.265
Why?

00:02:07.265 --> 00:02:10.925
Because the height of this
wrapper is set to auto.

00:02:10.925 --> 00:02:13.969
Let me set a specific
height for this wrapper.

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:16.595
I'm going to set
it to 500 pixels.

00:02:16.595 --> 00:02:17.660
And now as you can see,

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.460
these cards are
stretched because

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.355
the headline option
is set to stretch.

00:02:22.355 --> 00:02:25.070
But what if I want them to
be aligned to the center,

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.095
both horizontally
and vertically?

00:02:27.095 --> 00:02:30.244
The justification
is set to center.

00:02:30.244 --> 00:02:34.010
If I change the line
option to center as well,

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.375
this is what happens.

00:02:35.375 --> 00:02:38.330
And as you can see, these
first card is smaller.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.790
The reason is if I
click on this card,

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.940
you can see that the
height is set to auto.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.880
And here on these two cards,

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.740
we have four lines of texts.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.215
Here we have only
three lines of text.

00:02:51.215 --> 00:02:54.845
So if I just go ahead and
add some dummy words here,

00:02:54.845 --> 00:02:58.310
you can see that we will get
the same height here now.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.530
Alright, now let's talk
about the alignment.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.285
I can align it to the top,

00:03:02.285 --> 00:03:04.400
to the bottom, to the center.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.215
I can set it to stretch.

00:03:06.215 --> 00:03:09.095
I can change the
justification to the left,

00:03:09.095 --> 00:03:11.000
to the middle, to the right.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.825
And these two justifications
are so important.

00:03:14.825 --> 00:03:17.045
This one says space between,

00:03:17.045 --> 00:03:20.270
okay, so let's see what
happens if I click on that.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.735
It distributes and even
spacing between these cards.

00:03:23.735 --> 00:03:25.760
However, the first
card will stick

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.965
to the left side
of the boundary,

00:03:27.965 --> 00:03:29.390
which is this wrapper.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.100
And the right card will stick to

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.934
the right side of this boundary.

00:03:33.934 --> 00:03:36.590
But if I change the
justification to

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.065
the last option space around,

00:03:39.065 --> 00:03:42.035
we can see that we have an
even spacing between cards for

00:03:42.035 --> 00:03:44.225
the first and last cards are not

00:03:44.225 --> 00:03:47.330
attached to the edges
of this wrapper.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.550
This is the main
difference between them.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.175
Most of the time we
use space between,

00:03:52.175 --> 00:03:55.205
it's much safer to
work with this option,

00:03:55.205 --> 00:03:57.080
but you just need to understand

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.675
the difference between
these options.

00:03:59.675 --> 00:04:01.730
Alright, so far we
have been working

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.130
with the parent elements, okay?

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:09.170
But when we turn the parent
element to a flexbox,

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.305
the child itself has
some properties as well.

00:04:12.305 --> 00:04:14.360
The child here is this card.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.250
Okay. I'm going to
select the card.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.530
And on the right side
you can see that we have

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.500
the flex child and we have
different options here.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.550
We have sizing and then we
have alignment and order.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.615
If I click on this,

00:04:26.615 --> 00:04:29.405
you can see we will get
some options as well.

00:04:29.405 --> 00:04:31.340
So let's see what's going to

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.905
happen if I change
the sizing option.

00:04:33.905 --> 00:04:36.410
We have three different
sizing options here.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.915
The first one says
shrink if needed,

00:04:38.915 --> 00:04:41.435
and by default it's
set to this option.

00:04:41.435 --> 00:04:44.480
And it means if we go to
other breakpoints, e.g.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.505
smaller devices like this,

00:04:46.505 --> 00:04:50.150
it shrinks since it's needed,

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.355
since we don't have
that much space.

00:04:52.355 --> 00:04:54.350
But let's check out
the next option

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.525
which says grow if possible.

00:04:56.525 --> 00:04:58.490
If I click on that,
as you can see,

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.950
there is no space in
between and it fills up

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.665
the whole space
within a wrapper.

00:05:03.665 --> 00:05:05.855
So this is the
difference between them.

00:05:05.855 --> 00:05:08.810
Then we have don't
shrink or grow.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.330
So now if I go to the
tablet break point,

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.610
you can see that they
don't shrink and it's

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.175
not good actually in
terms of responsiveness.

00:05:16.175 --> 00:05:18.290
And you can also use
the manual option,

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:19.820
but I've never used that.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.085
And it's better
to avoid it since

00:05:22.085 --> 00:05:24.605
it's going to make your
life much complicated.

00:05:24.605 --> 00:05:27.785
So I'm going to change
it to shrink if needed.

00:05:27.785 --> 00:05:31.160
Now let's talk about
alignment and order.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.995
So here we have a line
and we have order.

00:05:33.995 --> 00:05:37.895
Sometimes we might need to
change the order of our cards.

00:05:37.895 --> 00:05:41.255
Of course we can do that within
the navigator like this,

00:05:41.255 --> 00:05:43.100
but we can also do that here

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.605
using the flex child options.

00:05:45.605 --> 00:05:47.315
If I select this card,

00:05:47.315 --> 00:05:50.390
I add a combo class, e.g.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.219
let's call it summer.

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:54.590
And I want it to always be

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:57.575
the last card I can
set it to last.

00:05:57.575 --> 00:05:58.325
And there we go.

00:05:58.325 --> 00:06:00.350
They are placement
has been changed.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.210
I can change it to first and I

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.175
can set it to don't change.

00:06:04.175 --> 00:06:07.220
Again, I can use the
customized order as well,

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.235
but most of the time
we use first and last,

00:06:10.235 --> 00:06:13.025
just like that, Let's
talk about the alignment.

00:06:13.025 --> 00:06:14.840
So let's suppose I want to align

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.925
these first card differently.

00:06:16.925 --> 00:06:18.995
I can do that. I can
select this card.

00:06:18.995 --> 00:06:22.070
Since a combo class has
been added to this child,

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.860
I can change the
alignment to top, center,

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.475
bottom, or again
stretch or baseline.

00:06:28.475 --> 00:06:30.110
I'm gonna go with oto.

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.780
The auto takes the
alignment that we

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.915
set to the parents
element here, stretch.

00:06:35.915 --> 00:06:37.895
But sometimes for some reasons,

00:06:37.895 --> 00:06:41.150
we might need to override
those preferences,

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.945
those properties that we
set for the parent element.

00:06:44.945 --> 00:06:47.885
Alright, now let's take a
look at another example.

00:06:47.885 --> 00:06:49.445
Here at the bottom,

00:06:49.445 --> 00:06:51.440
I created some link blocks.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.765
These are some
simple link blocks

00:06:53.765 --> 00:06:56.135
and I created some tags here.

00:06:56.135 --> 00:06:59.435
As you can see, there is
a wrapper called tags,

00:06:59.435 --> 00:07:02.345
and all these tags are
inside these wrapper.

00:07:02.345 --> 00:07:04.880
If I select this
tag is rapper and I

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.060
turn it into a flexbox,
look what happens.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.515
As you can see, nothing is

00:07:09.515 --> 00:07:12.110
organized and our
tags are destroyed.

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:13.805
So how can we fix that?

00:07:13.805 --> 00:07:15.110
It's very simple.

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.240
Can you see these
children option

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.850
here which says don't
wrap by default,

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:21.500
if I set it to wrap,

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.810
it wraps all our children.

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:28.100
These tags are the children
of this tags wrapper.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.605
And now I have access
to these advance

00:07:30.605 --> 00:07:33.875
a line option here I
can set it to a line.

00:07:33.875 --> 00:07:35.210
Roads start.

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:40.460
Now, this tags wrapper wraps
all the children inside.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.470
If I go ahead and copy and

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:44.840
paste these tags
again and again,

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.845
you can see that they are
aligned perfectly as expected.

00:07:48.845 --> 00:07:52.445
So can you see how powerful
it is to work with Flexbox?

00:07:52.445 --> 00:07:55.175
So let's take a look at
the order once again.

00:07:55.175 --> 00:07:56.420
So here if I want

00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:01.415
this UI UX design tag to
always be our last element,

00:08:01.415 --> 00:08:05.120
I can give it a specific
combo class, e.g.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.039
I'm going to write UI UX,

00:08:07.039 --> 00:08:10.295
and then I'm going to
change the order to last,

00:08:10.295 --> 00:08:12.380
just like that. Are right guys.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:13.760
That's all for this video.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:14.960
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.520
I'll see you in the next one.
