00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.864
Can you imagine design a
website without images?

00:00:08.864 --> 00:00:10.005
I can't.

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:11.280
So in this video,

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.209
we're going to
talk about images.

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:15.439
I'm going to hit over
to the Add section.

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:17.300
And from the media category,

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.360
I'm going to drag this
image elements and

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.600
drop it right inside
my container.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.360
In the navigator,
just like that,

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.665
here is an image element and
it has different settings.

00:00:30.665 --> 00:00:33.050
We can use this image
element to upload

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.050
popular file formats like PNG,

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.945
JPG, SVG, and so on.

00:00:38.945 --> 00:00:41.389
Well, images are our assets.

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:43.355
Therefore, in order to use

00:00:43.355 --> 00:00:45.665
an image in your project first,

00:00:45.665 --> 00:00:46.880
you need to upload them.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.085
The best practice
is to just upload

00:00:49.085 --> 00:00:52.865
all your assets in the
Assets panel first,

00:00:52.865 --> 00:00:55.595
when you start
creating your project,

00:00:55.595 --> 00:00:59.404
then start working on the
layout and the content.

00:00:59.404 --> 00:01:01.730
This way, you can
easily get access

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.040
to your assets
whenever you want.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.240
Alternatively,

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.210
you can just drag and
drop an image element.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.265
And from here you can hit

00:01:10.265 --> 00:01:13.550
this choose image and then
upload your image here.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.580
So for now, I'm going
to select this image.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:17.630
There we go.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.405
This image has some settings.

00:01:20.405 --> 00:01:22.490
As you can see, it's too big,

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.100
so I'm going to change
it to this one.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.050
Alright, it's much better.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.715
As you can see. It has the
width and height set to auto.

00:01:31.715 --> 00:01:35.675
It means Webflow determines
the width and height here.

00:01:35.675 --> 00:01:38.435
There is the high DPI
checkbox as well.

00:01:38.435 --> 00:01:39.755
And when it's checked,

00:01:39.755 --> 00:01:43.580
the width of our image will
be divided by two in order to

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.900
be displayed perfectly on
the retina displays. So e.g.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.340
here, since the width of
our image is 640 pixels,

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.735
when I check that Webflow
sets it to a 320 pixels,

00:01:56.735 --> 00:01:59.360
this way we can make sure
that our image will be

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.870
displayed amazingly
on different devices.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.180
It's optional to use high DPI,

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.430
but most of the time,
if you check that,

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.310
you can make sure
that everything looks

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.130
great on all kinds of devices.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.750
You can specify the width and

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.835
height of your
images right here,

00:02:16.835 --> 00:02:18.650
or you can style it in

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.280
the style panel here
under the size section,

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.025
we will talk about styling
later, but for now,

00:02:25.025 --> 00:02:26.720
you just need to know that it is

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.000
possible to specify
the dimension of

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.110
your images right here
in the image settings.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.045
You can also replace
your images.

00:02:35.045 --> 00:02:39.425
If you hit this replace image
and from the assets panel,

00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:42.440
you can choose different
images like that.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.780
One important thing
about images is that you

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.720
can upload images up to 4 mb,

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.580
anything larger than that,

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.020
you cannot upload it.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.605
Why?

00:02:51.605 --> 00:02:55.310
Because it's not practical
to use images that are so

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.135
large since they slow down
the web page load speed.

00:02:59.135 --> 00:03:03.515
So that's why you can
upload images up to 4 mb.

00:03:03.515 --> 00:03:05.720
There are some
advanced options here,

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.655
like all texts and load.

00:03:07.655 --> 00:03:09.410
We're not going to touch upon

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.375
them right now because these are

00:03:11.375 --> 00:03:13.310
advanced topics and we will talk

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.875
about them later in this course,

00:03:15.875 --> 00:03:18.770
you can use an image
element for icons as well.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.600
Since an icon is an image,

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.465
basically, you can just
go to your assets.

00:03:23.465 --> 00:03:25.070
And if you upload it an icon,

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.610
you can simply drag and drop
it here, just like that.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.000
Or you could just drag and
drop an image elements and

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.630
then choose your image
from the image settings.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.580
It's totally up to you.
