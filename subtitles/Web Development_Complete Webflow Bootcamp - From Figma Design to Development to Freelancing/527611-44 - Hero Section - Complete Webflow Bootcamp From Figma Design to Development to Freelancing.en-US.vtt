00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.945
Hey, in this video,

00:00:06.945 --> 00:00:10.635
we're going to start creating
our hero section together.

00:00:10.635 --> 00:00:13.935
So as you can see in
this Figma project,

00:00:13.935 --> 00:00:17.115
our hero section
has a container.

00:00:17.115 --> 00:00:19.275
Just like all other sections.

00:00:19.275 --> 00:00:21.240
We always have a section and

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.415
inside we will have a container.

00:00:23.415 --> 00:00:26.070
This is the best
structure that you can

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.650
have for your
projects, uh, section,

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.570
and then a container inside,

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.195
and then you can have your
content inside this container.

00:00:35.195 --> 00:00:36.980
We have two other frames here.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.095
These are going to
be our div blocks.

00:00:39.095 --> 00:00:41.615
As you can see, they
look like boxes here.

00:00:41.615 --> 00:00:43.970
So here, inside
this container we

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.400
will have two boxes
to div blocks.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.090
One is going to contain
our content, the left one.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.130
The second one is
going to contain

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.935
our images inside the content,

00:00:54.935 --> 00:00:56.435
we will have a heading,

00:00:56.435 --> 00:00:58.190
we will have a text block,

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.750
which is our description,

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.180
and then two different buttons,

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.340
a primary button,
just like the one

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.755
that we created for our navbar.

00:01:06.755 --> 00:01:09.185
Then this is a text button.

00:01:09.185 --> 00:01:11.420
And finally for this
right container

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.265
or let's say image the block,

00:01:13.265 --> 00:01:15.170
we will have two
different cards,

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.820
card one, card two.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.515
And finally the hero image,

00:01:18.515 --> 00:01:20.600
which is this main image.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.525
So you may ask, why
can't we export

00:01:23.525 --> 00:01:27.350
these three different
elements as the one image?

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.850
That's a great question.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:29.990
We could do that.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.600
It would be much simpler
if I would do that.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.565
However, when we start

00:01:34.565 --> 00:01:37.310
working with animations
and interactions,

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.509
we're going to animate

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.435
all these elements
together one by one.

00:01:41.435 --> 00:01:44.705
If I export them as
one single image,

00:01:44.705 --> 00:01:46.055
it would be impossible.

00:01:46.055 --> 00:01:49.145
Therefore, I exported
these elements separately,

00:01:49.145 --> 00:01:51.350
but we could have more
flexibility when it

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.675
comes to interactions
and animations.

00:01:53.675 --> 00:01:57.304
Alright, so let's go to
our web flows project.

00:01:57.304 --> 00:02:00.455
And the first thing we need
to create is a section.

00:02:00.455 --> 00:02:01.820
So I'm gonna go to

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.310
the Add section and
let me drag and drop

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.735
a section here and place
it right below my nav bar.

00:02:08.735 --> 00:02:09.635
Just like that.

00:02:09.635 --> 00:02:12.590
I'm going to give it a
class called section.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.390
And this is the class
that we're going to

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.565
use for all our sections.

00:02:16.565 --> 00:02:19.520
Therefore, it's very
important to specify

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.440
the properties that are gonna be

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.350
used globally for
all our sections,

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.260
we're not going to modify
the sides properties here.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.900
However, I'm going to change
the padding of this section,

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.505
the left and right padding.

00:02:31.505 --> 00:02:31.880
Why?

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.620
Because all our
sessions are going to

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.795
have some left and
right padding.

00:02:35.795 --> 00:02:38.030
If I hold down the Alt
key or Option key on

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.550
my keyboard and just
click and drag.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.300
I can add a 30 pixel
left and right padding.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.610
We can see anything
happening here.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.800
But when we go to
other breakpoints,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.710
this padding that we
added here will prevent

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.755
the content from going
outside the viewport.

00:02:54.755 --> 00:02:57.320
So this padding is
so important when

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.825
we start talking
about responsiveness,

00:02:59.825 --> 00:03:03.425
you will see the impact of the
padding that I added here.

00:03:03.425 --> 00:03:04.160
Now, right?

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.620
And one more thing I'm going
to mention here is that

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.140
right now I'm working
with a large screen.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.055
That's why here.

00:03:10.055 --> 00:03:14.885
It says 1,600 pixels
and it says 100%.

00:03:14.885 --> 00:03:17.300
If you're working with
a smaller device,

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.620
like a 13 inch laptop
or even larger laptops,

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.165
chances are you won't see the
exact canvas as I see here,

00:03:26.165 --> 00:03:29.900
because of the available
pixels of your screen size.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.580
However, I'm going to show you

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.500
a very good trick
if you're working,

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.210
let's say with a small device
like a 13 inch laptop,

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.180
you can just click here
and then you can scale

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.200
your project down in order
to see what I see here.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.930
It's just for the
previewing purposes,

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.370
so it doesn't affect

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.085
your main project and the
size of your elements.

00:03:52.085 --> 00:03:54.290
However, if you want to see how

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.665
your project looks
on larger devices,

00:03:57.665 --> 00:03:59.135
you can scale it down.

00:03:59.135 --> 00:04:02.555
For instance, you can
set the scale to 70%.

00:04:02.555 --> 00:04:03.365
Alright, cool.

00:04:03.365 --> 00:04:04.745
What else do we need to do?

00:04:04.745 --> 00:04:05.780
Welfare's?

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.030
I'm going to go ahead
and add a combo class to

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.345
this section because it's
going to be our hero section.

00:04:11.345 --> 00:04:13.069
I'm going to write hero.

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.910
There we go.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.815
And then inside this section,

00:04:15.815 --> 00:04:17.615
I'm going to need a container.

00:04:17.615 --> 00:04:19.685
So if I just go ahead
and drag and drop

00:04:19.685 --> 00:04:22.790
a div block here and put
it inside this section,

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.205
make sure that it's
nested inside.

00:04:25.205 --> 00:04:27.605
I can give it a class container.

00:04:27.605 --> 00:04:28.430
And there we go.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.550
We've got our 1,100
pixel maximum width that

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.865
we set for the container
that we used for our navbar.

00:04:34.865 --> 00:04:37.190
One important thing I'm
going to mention here is

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.920
that if you want to add
the elements much quicker,

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.960
you can simply use
the Command key or

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.345
Control key shortcuts
on your keyboard.

00:04:44.345 --> 00:04:46.340
And here using these QuickFind,

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.635
you can look for any
elements you want.

00:04:48.635 --> 00:04:50.930
Let's say I'm going to
look for a diblock.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.955
I can write Div,
and there we go.

00:04:52.955 --> 00:04:54.365
If I press Enter,

00:04:54.365 --> 00:04:57.590
this def block will be added
in scientists container.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:58.745
Let me remove that.

00:04:58.745 --> 00:05:01.025
I'm going to remove
this container as well.

00:05:01.025 --> 00:05:03.515
And I'm going to show you
once again how it works.

00:05:03.515 --> 00:05:05.660
First, I'm going to
select my section

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.675
because inside I'm going
to add a container.

00:05:08.675 --> 00:05:12.125
Then I'm gonna hit
Command key or Control K.

00:05:12.125 --> 00:05:15.890
And here, let's write the
block enter. This div.

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.780
Luck has been added
to my section,

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.975
and then I'm going to give
it a class container.

00:05:20.975 --> 00:05:22.550
And we are done.

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.485
Alright, our container is ready,

00:05:24.485 --> 00:05:25.805
our section is ready.

00:05:25.805 --> 00:05:27.860
However, we don't
have enough spacing

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.920
between our navigation
bar and this section.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.855
So let's go to our design file.

00:05:32.855 --> 00:05:35.435
And if I select this
hero section and I

00:05:35.435 --> 00:05:38.525
hold down the Option key
or Alt key on my keyboard.

00:05:38.525 --> 00:05:39.740
You can see that we have

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.795
a 100 pixel top margin set
for this hero section.

00:05:44.795 --> 00:05:47.330
So I'm going to
select this section.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.795
And since we added
this hero combo class,

00:05:50.795 --> 00:05:53.090
when I add some margin to this,

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.675
it will not affect the
properties of our section.

00:05:56.675 --> 00:05:58.670
It will just affect
the properties

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.010
of this hero combo class.

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.149
So I'm going to set the
top margin to 100 pixels.

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:06.110
And there we go.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.550
It has been pushed down.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.595
So what do we need
inside this container?

00:06:10.595 --> 00:06:14.915
Well, this container should
have two other div blocks.

00:06:14.915 --> 00:06:17.870
So let's go ahead and
add to the blocks.

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.065
I'm going to hit Command
K to use the Quick find,

00:06:21.065 --> 00:06:23.585
and I'm going to write div.

00:06:23.585 --> 00:06:24.620
There we go.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.314
There is a div block inside

00:06:26.314 --> 00:06:28.400
and I need one more div blocks.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.715
I'm going to select this
container again and hit

00:06:31.715 --> 00:06:35.390
Command K or control
K and write def.

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:36.950
Alright, now I have

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:40.085
two different IP blocks
inside this container.

00:06:40.085 --> 00:06:41.435
However, as you can see,

00:06:41.435 --> 00:06:43.460
each of these blocks takes

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.590
up the whole width
of its parent,

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:46.865
which is this container.

00:06:46.865 --> 00:06:48.470
It's not what we want.

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.770
So I'm going to select the
container and then I'm going

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:55.295
to change its display
setting to Flexbox. Why?

00:06:55.295 --> 00:06:58.250
Let's take a look at
our design file here.

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.080
As you can see inside
this container,

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.235
we have two div blocks.

00:07:01.235 --> 00:07:03.410
We've created them,
but they are sitting

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.915
next to each other that's
on top of each other.

00:07:05.915 --> 00:07:07.445
So if you remember,

00:07:07.445 --> 00:07:10.115
when we have a
one-dimensional layout,

00:07:10.115 --> 00:07:14.195
we can use the flexbox to
align our div blocks easily.

00:07:14.195 --> 00:07:15.470
That's what I'm gonna do.

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.195
I need to select the parent

00:07:17.195 --> 00:07:18.650
element and I'm going to change

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:22.190
its display setting
from black Flexbox.

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.415
All right, now we have a
horizontal direction, good,

00:07:25.415 --> 00:07:28.790
then the alignment is set
to stretch and I'm going

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:32.330
to change the
justification to center.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:33.560
All right, cool.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.390
They look too small.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.040
That's totally fine because

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.109
we're going to give
them some classes.

00:07:39.109 --> 00:07:41.465
Alright, but let's see
what we've done here.

00:07:41.465 --> 00:07:43.910
We've selected the
container and we've

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:47.045
changed its display
setting to flex Mike's.

00:07:47.045 --> 00:07:49.790
However, there is
one mistake here.

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:53.165
We didn't add a combo
class to this main class.

00:07:53.165 --> 00:07:54.440
And that's wrong.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:54.785
Why?

00:07:54.785 --> 00:07:58.280
Because later on, if you want
to use the same container

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:02.239
and we don't want to use a
flexbox with these properties.

00:08:02.239 --> 00:08:05.720
We need to override these
properties using a combo class.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.690
So I intentionally did
this mistake to show you

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.885
why it's important to
use combo classes.

00:08:11.885 --> 00:08:13.910
Now I'm going to
undo the operation

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:17.120
Command Z or Control
Z again and again.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.460
And here we have our container.

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:23.915
And now before changing its
display setting to flexbox,

00:08:23.915 --> 00:08:26.150
I'm going to give
it a combo class.

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.445
I'm going to write hero.

00:08:28.445 --> 00:08:30.140
And then I'm going to change

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:32.330
its display setting
to flake spikes.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:36.275
And I'm going to change its
justification to center.

00:08:36.275 --> 00:08:38.540
Now, everything looks great.

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:40.790
I'm going to select
the first div black,

00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:42.830
and let's give it a class.

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:46.040
I'm going to write
hero underscore,

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.745
underscore contents
because this div block

00:08:49.745 --> 00:08:51.965
is going to contain
our contents.

00:08:51.965 --> 00:08:53.345
And for the second one,

00:08:53.345 --> 00:08:56.690
I'm going to select it and
let's give it a new class.

00:08:56.690 --> 00:09:00.875
I'm going to write hero
underscore, underscore image.

00:09:00.875 --> 00:09:03.875
Just like what we have
in our Figma project,

00:09:03.875 --> 00:09:05.855
we have content and image.

00:09:05.855 --> 00:09:08.015
So let's start with content.

00:09:08.015 --> 00:09:09.305
What do we need here?

00:09:09.305 --> 00:09:12.410
We need a tidal, a heading,

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:14.210
then we have a description

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:16.355
right under that
and two buttons.

00:09:16.355 --> 00:09:18.950
It contained button
and the text button.

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:20.900
I'm going to start
with the heading.

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:24.185
Let me go ahead and drag
and drop a heading here,

00:09:24.185 --> 00:09:27.620
just like that, make sure
that it's nested inside.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.330
And for this heading,

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:30.995
I'm going to choose H1.

00:09:30.995 --> 00:09:33.875
It's very important
for the hero section.

00:09:33.875 --> 00:09:36.905
You need to always use the H1.

00:09:36.905 --> 00:09:40.355
It's important when it
comes to SEO optimization.

00:09:40.355 --> 00:09:42.650
We will talk about
these details later.

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:44.060
But for now, you
just need to know

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:45.785
that for your hero section,

00:09:45.785 --> 00:09:49.235
you should always,
always use H1,

00:09:49.235 --> 00:09:51.605
H2, or any other headings.

00:09:51.605 --> 00:09:52.880
Okay, cool.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.070
Now, for this heading,

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:57.185
I'm going to give it a class.

00:09:57.185 --> 00:09:59.420
That's right, hero underscore,

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.675
underscore heading our right.

00:10:02.675 --> 00:10:05.375
And we need to modify
its properties,

00:10:05.375 --> 00:10:07.250
like the topography properties,

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:10.500
the color, the font size, etc.

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:14.360
So did you notice that

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:18.050
did you notice that
for each text layer,

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:20.330
we're repeating
the same process.

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.760
We are changing the
font to Roboto.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.070
Can we omit this step somehow?

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:26.075
Yes, We Can.

00:10:26.075 --> 00:10:28.295
Do you remember when
I talked about body,

00:10:28.295 --> 00:10:31.655
all pages tag, we set the
background color there.

00:10:31.655 --> 00:10:35.525
We can also set the default
typography properties there,

00:10:35.525 --> 00:10:37.250
and then we can overwrite them

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:39.110
if we need to modify something.

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:41.375
Since I know that
for this project,

00:10:41.375 --> 00:10:43.400
I'm going to use only one font.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.110
Roberto, I can simply go

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.015
ahead and select my
body element here.

00:10:47.015 --> 00:10:49.295
And then I'm gonna
go to the selector,

00:10:49.295 --> 00:10:51.335
and I'm going to
choose body pages.

00:10:51.335 --> 00:10:53.315
And if I head over
to the topography,

00:10:53.315 --> 00:10:55.925
you can see that the
font is set to Arial.

00:10:55.925 --> 00:10:58.400
So let me go ahead and
change it to Roboto.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.650
And as soon as I change
it here you can see that

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:03.485
this headings font has
been changed as well.

00:11:03.485 --> 00:11:06.035
Why? Because
headings, paragraphs,

00:11:06.035 --> 00:11:09.110
and textbox by default look for

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:12.665
their parents and their
parents right now as the body.

00:11:12.665 --> 00:11:16.805
So they inherit whatever
properties we set for the body.

00:11:16.805 --> 00:11:19.895
All pages tag unless
we overwrite them.

00:11:19.895 --> 00:11:22.400
Alright, we're not going to
change the font size because

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.325
most of the time we need
to override the font size.

00:11:25.325 --> 00:11:28.745
And also I am going to
change its color to our,

00:11:28.745 --> 00:11:31.475
let's say neutral dark.

00:11:31.475 --> 00:11:33.995
Because for most of our texts,

00:11:33.995 --> 00:11:36.425
we need to use our
neutral dark color.

00:11:36.425 --> 00:11:40.220
So it's good to set the
typography default here as well.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:42.170
Alright, so now I can head over

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:44.405
to my hero content div black.

00:11:44.405 --> 00:11:47.135
And I don't need to
change the fonts anymore.

00:11:47.135 --> 00:11:49.580
I can overwrite them
whenever I want.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:52.280
But if I click on
this font word here,

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:55.370
you can see that the
value comes from body all

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:58.865
pages because we set some
default properties there.

00:11:58.865 --> 00:12:02.225
Alright, so let's see what
font size do we need here.

00:12:02.225 --> 00:12:04.265
I'm gonna go to
my Figma project.

00:12:04.265 --> 00:12:08.360
I'm going to select
this text. It says H1.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:12.455
H1 is 60 points, okay?

00:12:12.455 --> 00:12:16.985
So I'm going to set it to 60
pixels here, just like that.

00:12:16.985 --> 00:12:18.545
And what about the line height?

00:12:18.545 --> 00:12:23.810
I usually set it to 130 or 150
per cent for this heading,

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:25.865
since we have a large font size,

00:12:25.865 --> 00:12:30.500
I'm going to set it to
130%, just like that.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.360
Then I'm going to go ahead and

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.744
copy this text from my design.

00:12:34.744 --> 00:12:37.805
If you just double-click
on these layers,

00:12:37.805 --> 00:12:41.540
you can select them and
copy it, paste it here.

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:42.245
There we go.

00:12:42.245 --> 00:12:44.180
Alright, but as you can see,

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:48.500
this hero content div blog
picks up too much space here.

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:51.560
If I head over to my
design file and I select

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:54.575
this contents bikes,
this content group.

00:12:54.575 --> 00:12:59.105
You can see that the width
is set to 530 pixels.

00:12:59.105 --> 00:13:01.520
Therefore, I'm
gonna go ahead and

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:04.475
select this hero
contents div block,

00:13:04.475 --> 00:13:06.815
and I'm going to give
it a maximum width.

00:13:06.815 --> 00:13:10.864
It shouldn't be larger
than 530 pixels.

00:13:10.864 --> 00:13:14.840
So I'm going to set it to
530 pixels. And there we go.

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.070
What else do we need?

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:17.870
Right under this heading,

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:19.865
we're going to need
a description.

00:13:19.865 --> 00:13:21.305
As you can see.

00:13:21.305 --> 00:13:25.055
I can drag and drop a
paragraph or a textblock.

00:13:25.055 --> 00:13:27.005
I'm gonna go with a text block.

00:13:27.005 --> 00:13:28.895
I'm going to drag
and drop it here.

00:13:28.895 --> 00:13:31.205
And this textbox,
as you can see,

00:13:31.205 --> 00:13:34.085
it's using the
default Roboto font

00:13:34.085 --> 00:13:37.085
that we set for our
body, all pages stack.

00:13:37.085 --> 00:13:39.695
So it's going to accelerate
our design process.

00:13:39.695 --> 00:13:40.970
What about the size?

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:44.255
I'm going to change
its size to 20 pixels.

00:13:44.255 --> 00:13:47.015
If I go to my design file here,

00:13:47.015 --> 00:13:50.630
you can see it's using
body irregular and body

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:54.995
irregular is 20
pixels are right.

00:13:54.995 --> 00:13:57.140
I'm going to set it to 20.

00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:00.545
Let me go ahead and copy
and paste this text here.

00:14:00.545 --> 00:14:01.265
Cool.

00:14:01.265 --> 00:14:02.825
But as you can see,

00:14:02.825 --> 00:14:05.225
the line height is not enough.

00:14:05.225 --> 00:14:08.945
I'm going to change the
height to 150 per cent

00:14:08.945 --> 00:14:13.505
since the font size is not
that large and it's two lying.

00:14:13.505 --> 00:14:15.650
If I head over to
my design project

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:18.110
here and I select this text,

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:23.405
you can see that its width
is set to 435 pixels.

00:14:23.405 --> 00:14:27.500
So I need to do the same thing
for this textbook as well.

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:31.880
I'm going to set a maximum
width of 435 pixels,

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.530
and now it looks great.

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:36.125
And finally, I'm going
to change its color.

00:14:36.125 --> 00:14:37.475
For this text.

00:14:37.475 --> 00:14:39.470
I used neutral medium.

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:41.180
I'm going to use the
same thing here.

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:43.565
I'm going to use one
of the swatches here.

00:14:43.565 --> 00:14:44.840
Mutual medium.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:45.830
There we go.

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:48.065
Alright, cool. What
else do we need?

00:14:48.065 --> 00:14:49.640
We need two buttons.

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.070
So in order to organize
these two buttons,

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.885
we need to create a div block.

00:14:53.885 --> 00:14:56.885
And inside that div block
we can put our buttons.

00:14:56.885 --> 00:15:00.515
So let me go ahead and select
this hero content if block,

00:15:00.515 --> 00:15:03.230
and I'm going to create a
new div block Command key

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:06.215
or Control K. And
let me write div.

00:15:06.215 --> 00:15:07.205
There we go.

00:15:07.205 --> 00:15:09.875
Here is our div block
and I'm going to name it

00:15:09.875 --> 00:15:13.790
hero underscore,
underscore buttons.

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:15.500
Okay, cool.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:19.400
And inside this, I'm gonna go
ahead and add two buttons.

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.960
One contained button or

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:23.585
this primary button
in one text button.

00:15:23.585 --> 00:15:25.715
So let me select
this primary button

00:15:25.715 --> 00:15:26.975
in the navigation bar.

00:15:26.975 --> 00:15:29.690
I'm going to hit
Command C or Control C.

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:33.260
And I'm going to select these
hero buttons, div block.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:37.190
And I'm going to hit Command
V or Control V to paste it.

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:38.255
Here. There we go.

00:15:38.255 --> 00:15:40.520
We've got our Contact Us button

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.545
here and it says primary button.

00:15:42.545 --> 00:15:44.210
Cool. I'm going to go ahead and

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:46.385
change this text
to get in touch.

00:15:46.385 --> 00:15:50.255
Let me write getting
touch, nice.

00:15:50.255 --> 00:15:52.235
And also I'm gonna
need a text button.

00:15:52.235 --> 00:15:54.860
So let me go ahead and
look for text link.

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:56.960
I'm going to drag
and drop it here

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.135
inside the hero buttons,

00:15:59.135 --> 00:16:00.890
the block, just like that.

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:03.485
And by default, since
it's a text link,

00:16:03.485 --> 00:16:06.650
you can see that it has a
some styling and decoration.

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:08.195
So we're going to
overwrite them.

00:16:08.195 --> 00:16:09.530
I'm going to give it a class.

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:14.810
Let's write hero underscore,
underscore, text button.

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:16.340
There we go.

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:17.750
Let me scroll down here.

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:19.430
The font looks fine.

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:22.550
The weight is going
to be 500 or medium.

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:25.895
The font size is going
to be 17 pixels.

00:16:25.895 --> 00:16:28.580
If I go to my design file here,

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:31.174
It's using headline medium.

00:16:31.174 --> 00:16:35.405
And headline medium has
a 17 point font size.

00:16:35.405 --> 00:16:36.860
Are right, what about the color?

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:39.335
The color is going
to be neutral,

00:16:39.335 --> 00:16:43.145
medium, and a declaration by
default is set to underline.

00:16:43.145 --> 00:16:44.570
I'm going to set it to none.

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:48.620
And finally, let me change
this text to see our work.

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:49.550
Alright, cool.

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:51.500
So now I have two options.

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:55.205
I can either select this
hero buttons diblock,

00:16:55.205 --> 00:16:58.340
and change the display
setting to Flexbox.

00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:01.895
Just align it and add some
margin to this button.

00:17:01.895 --> 00:17:05.105
Or I can just keep the block
display setting and just

00:17:05.105 --> 00:17:08.555
add some right margins to
this getting touch button.

00:17:08.555 --> 00:17:10.220
Since these two buttons are

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:12.185
gonna be placed
next to each other,

00:17:12.185 --> 00:17:13.910
I don't need a flakes minds.

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:16.100
I can just select
this button and add

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:19.490
some margins so the left
side is almost ready.

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:22.670
The only thing left
is add some spacing.

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:24.980
So I'm going to select
this heading here.

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:27.530
I'm going to hold down the
Option key or Alt key.

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:29.780
And if I hover over
this description,

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:33.245
you can see that I have a
30 pixel bottom margin.

00:17:33.245 --> 00:17:35.840
If I select this description
here, as you can see,

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.090
I have a 40 pixel bottom margin,

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:39.305
and for this button,

00:17:39.305 --> 00:17:42.275
I have afford the
pixel right margin.

00:17:42.275 --> 00:17:45.275
So let's go ahead and
change their margins.

00:17:45.275 --> 00:17:46.865
I'm going to select
this heading.

00:17:46.865 --> 00:17:48.530
If I click on that,
you can see that

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:51.065
the value comes from
all H1 headings.

00:17:51.065 --> 00:17:52.760
We didn't talk about this tag,

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:55.310
but it works like the
body all pages tag.

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:57.515
I'm going to remove
the top margin.

00:17:57.515 --> 00:17:59.090
I'm going to set it to zero,

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:02.735
and I'm going to modify the
bottom margin to 30 pixels.

00:18:02.735 --> 00:18:05.075
Now, let me select
this description.

00:18:05.075 --> 00:18:06.710
We didn't change the class name,

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:08.510
so I'm going to
modify the class name

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:11.060
here to hero description.

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:15.965
Hero underscore,
underscore description.

00:18:15.965 --> 00:18:18.815
Alright, now I can add

00:18:18.815 --> 00:18:22.145
a 40 pixel bottom
padding just like that.

00:18:22.145 --> 00:18:24.695
And here I'm going to
select this button,

00:18:24.695 --> 00:18:27.665
but I can't modify
its margin right now.

00:18:27.665 --> 00:18:29.600
Why? Because right now I'm

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.850
using the primary button class.

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:34.130
If I add some margin here,

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:36.560
it will affect the
Contact Us button

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:37.775
in the nav bar as well.

00:18:37.775 --> 00:18:38.720
Let me show you.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.404
If I just add some
right margins.

00:18:41.404 --> 00:18:42.380
There we go.

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:43.565
Can you see that?

00:18:43.565 --> 00:18:44.990
It's not what we want.

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:46.280
So what should I do?

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:47.420
Yes, you are right.

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:49.835
I need a combo class here.

00:18:49.835 --> 00:18:51.560
I'm going to add a combo class,

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:53.510
and I'm going to write hero.

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:57.290
Now I can add a 40
pixel right margin

00:18:57.290 --> 00:19:01.145
without affecting the
Contact Us button are right.

00:19:01.145 --> 00:19:04.100
Now it's time to work on
the second div block,

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:06.485
which is the hero
image, the black.

00:19:06.485 --> 00:19:07.880
As you can see here,

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.280
we're going to need a
three different images.

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:12.770
So let me select
this hero image and

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:15.620
then I'm going to add a
three different images here.

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:17.690
Let me hit Command
K and I'm going to

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:19.820
look for image, Enter.

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:21.245
I'm going to choose the image.

00:19:21.245 --> 00:19:24.620
And from here, I'm going
to look for hero image.

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:25.370
There we go.

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:26.780
Okay, it looks fine.

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:29.975
Now I'm going to need two
more images for my cards.

00:19:29.975 --> 00:19:32.690
So let me select this
hero image diblock.

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:34.550
I'm going to hit
Command key or Control

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:36.605
K. And let me write image.

00:19:36.605 --> 00:19:38.105
Great, It's here.

00:19:38.105 --> 00:19:39.965
I'm going to choose card one.

00:19:39.965 --> 00:19:42.154
Let me look for card one.

00:19:42.154 --> 00:19:43.235
There we go.

00:19:43.235 --> 00:19:44.435
It's right here.

00:19:44.435 --> 00:19:45.575
It's too big.

00:19:45.575 --> 00:19:47.150
We're going to fix that and I'm

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:49.010
going to need one
more card as well.

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:50.870
Let me select this image and I'm

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:52.955
going to give it a
class. That's right.

00:19:52.955 --> 00:19:57.260
Hero underscore,
underscore, card one.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:00.965
And I can simply scale
it down just like that.

00:20:00.965 --> 00:20:05.285
Or alternatively, I can
click on this settings here.

00:20:05.285 --> 00:20:07.969
I'm going to set
its width to 300,

00:20:07.969 --> 00:20:12.904
then maybe 80 or 375 pixels.

00:20:12.904 --> 00:20:14.015
It looks good.

00:20:14.015 --> 00:20:16.715
But why this box looks too big,

00:20:16.715 --> 00:20:18.485
but the element is not that big.

00:20:18.485 --> 00:20:20.930
It's because I used
some drop shadows

00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:23.510
for this card and
I exported that.

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:26.420
That's why we have
this large boundary.

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:29.585
Now I'm going to select
this hero image div block,

00:20:29.585 --> 00:20:31.745
once again, hit Command K

00:20:31.745 --> 00:20:34.265
or control K and look for image.

00:20:34.265 --> 00:20:37.205
There we go. And I'm
going to choose car to,

00:20:37.205 --> 00:20:39.800
from my assets. Here it is.

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.545
Okay, I'm gonna give
it another class.

00:20:42.545 --> 00:20:47.899
Let's write hero underscore,
underscore card too.

00:20:47.899 --> 00:20:51.680
Now I'm going to scale
it down just like that.

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:56.810
Let's give it a specific
width of 375 pixels.

00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:58.535
Alright, amazing.

00:20:58.535 --> 00:21:01.535
But can you see how they are
placed on top of each other?

00:21:01.535 --> 00:21:02.735
It's not what we want.

00:21:02.735 --> 00:21:04.325
How can we fix that?

00:21:04.325 --> 00:21:06.200
Well, do you remember
when we talked about

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:09.170
different positioning
options like static,

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:11.900
relative, absolute,
fixed, and sticky.

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:13.700
I told you that if
we want to create

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:16.040
some modern layouts,
we're going to need them.

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:18.455
And this is exactly
what we're gonna do.

00:21:18.455 --> 00:21:20.405
We're gonna change
the position option

00:21:20.405 --> 00:21:22.130
in order to get what we want.

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:23.420
So here, as you can see,

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:26.960
these two cards are
kind of floating.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:32.270
Therefore, I'm going to set
their position to absolute.

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:34.115
But as you remember,

00:21:34.115 --> 00:21:37.235
in order to set the position
to absolute, first,

00:21:37.235 --> 00:21:40.910
we need to set its parent
position to relative.

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:44.165
So the parents is this
hero image div block,

00:21:44.165 --> 00:21:47.480
and I'm going to change
its position to relative.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.115
Alright, nothing happens.

00:21:49.115 --> 00:21:50.420
But if I select this here,

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:52.280
acquired one and I change

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:55.100
its position to
absolute, There we go.

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:58.489
Now it's relative to
hero image diblock.

00:21:58.489 --> 00:22:00.710
I'm gonna do the same
thing for this card.

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:03.980
I'm going to change its
position to absolute, nice.

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:08.195
And now I can simply control
their position right here.

00:22:08.195 --> 00:22:10.100
So let's start with card one.

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:11.630
I'm going to select card one,

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:13.880
and it should be
placed around here.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.934
So I'm going to select top left,

00:22:15.934 --> 00:22:17.720
and then I'm going to modify

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:20.480
the left margin just like this.

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:23.900
I can set it to -19%.

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:28.610
And for the top, I'm going
to set it to, let's say -2%.

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:30.020
Okay, it looks great.

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:31.025
What about this one?

00:22:31.025 --> 00:22:33.335
I'm going to select
Hero Card too.

00:22:33.335 --> 00:22:36.590
I'm going to change it to
position two, bottom right.

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:40.025
And then let me move it
down just like this.

00:22:40.025 --> 00:22:43.970
Let's set the bottom
position to -22 per

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:46.250
cent and I can modify the right

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:48.905
or left margin here,
it doesn't matter.

00:22:48.905 --> 00:22:49.790
Let me show you.

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:51.020
It's just like this.

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:52.520
If I use the right one,

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.484
I need negative values.

00:22:54.484 --> 00:22:56.195
If I use the left one,

00:22:56.195 --> 00:22:58.820
I will need positive
values like this.

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:00.830
I prefer to use the right one.

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:04.280
I'm going to put it
right around here.

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.005
Alright, It looks good.

00:23:06.005 --> 00:23:08.330
Let's compare it
with our design.

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:09.515
It looks fine.

00:23:09.515 --> 00:23:12.365
However, this content div block

00:23:12.365 --> 00:23:14.465
is not aligned with these,

00:23:14.465 --> 00:23:16.850
right div, like this
image div black.

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:18.275
So how can I fix that?

00:23:18.275 --> 00:23:19.310
Well, I can select

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:22.925
this hero content and I can
give it some top margins.

00:23:22.925 --> 00:23:24.545
Let me show you how it works.

00:23:24.545 --> 00:23:25.625
Just like that.

00:23:25.625 --> 00:23:28.505
If I move it down like this,

00:23:28.505 --> 00:23:34.085
I can set its top margin to
114 pixels. It looks fine.

00:23:34.085 --> 00:23:36.545
I think now they are
perfectly aligned,

00:23:36.545 --> 00:23:38.885
right guys, that's
all for this video.

00:23:38.885 --> 00:23:40.085
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:23:40.085 --> 00:23:41.690
If you have any questions,

00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:43.025
please let me know.

00:23:43.025 --> 00:23:45.600
See you in the next one.
