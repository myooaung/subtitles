00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.320
Hey, in this video
we're going to

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.795
talk about custom attributes,

00:00:09.795 --> 00:00:11.715
one or custom attributes.

00:00:11.715 --> 00:00:13.245
Well, according to Webflow,

00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:15.420
you can use custom attributes to

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.480
define characteristics
of HTML elements.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.730
Does it make sense
if it doesn't,

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.695
let me show you how it works.

00:00:22.695 --> 00:00:24.525
For each HTML element,

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:27.930
we can specify some custom
attributes to modify

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.115
their behaviors or add some
custom characteristics.

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:36.730
So e.g. here, if I select any
HTML elements like heading,

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:37.910
and if I head over to

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.100
the elements settings
on the right side,

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.940
you can see here we have the
custom attributes section.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.115
And using this plus button,

00:00:46.115 --> 00:00:48.410
you can create a
custom attribute.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.980
Any attribute has a
name and a value.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.870
Sometimes they are quite useful,

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.495
but most of the time
you won't need them.

00:00:56.495 --> 00:00:58.175
So let me show you how it works.

00:00:58.175 --> 00:01:00.230
If I preview my project and if I

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.840
hover over these get
in touch button,

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.465
you can see that nothing
appears and it's fine.

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:07.445
But sometimes we
might need to get

00:01:07.445 --> 00:01:11.075
a tool tip indicating
what it actually does.

00:01:11.075 --> 00:01:14.045
E.g. when the user
hovers over this button,

00:01:14.045 --> 00:01:16.910
the tooltip should display
a word or a sentence

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.150
like click me or contact
us anything this way,

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.519
search engines can
also understand

00:01:22.519 --> 00:01:25.550
what this button does
or what a link does.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.335
So let me show you how it works.

00:01:27.335 --> 00:01:29.375
First, I'm going to
select this Martin.

00:01:29.375 --> 00:01:32.015
And if I head over to the
custom attributes section,

00:01:32.015 --> 00:01:34.669
I can create a new
custom attribute.

00:01:34.669 --> 00:01:36.215
And here for name,

00:01:36.215 --> 00:01:38.270
I'm going to write tidal.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.485
And for the value,

00:01:39.485 --> 00:01:41.450
I'm going to Right Click Me,

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.370
Save, and we're done.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.755
Now, let's publish our website.

00:01:45.755 --> 00:01:47.270
I'm going to open it up.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.610
Now if I hover over this button,

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.850
I should see a tool tip
that says click me.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.440
Let's see what happens.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.010
There we go.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.960
Can you see that tiny Tooltip?

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.015
That's exactly what
we were looking for.

00:01:59.015 --> 00:02:00.695
But let me show you
another example.

00:02:00.695 --> 00:02:02.825
If I go to the Contact Us page

00:02:02.825 --> 00:02:05.165
and here in the full
name text field,

00:02:05.165 --> 00:02:08.060
I'm going to write something
random just like that.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.400
And as you can see,
checks the spelling.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.310
Can you see this red line
under this weird name?

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.930
My browser is actually

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.405
checking the spelling
of this name.

00:02:17.405 --> 00:02:20.255
It's not what we want for
the full length TextField.

00:02:20.255 --> 00:02:22.115
So how can we disable it?

00:02:22.115 --> 00:02:24.440
We can use a custom attribute.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.920
So let me head over
to the pages panel.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.085
If I go to the
Contact Us page here,

00:02:31.085 --> 00:02:33.500
I can select this text field.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.245
And if I go to the custom
attributes on the right side,

00:02:36.245 --> 00:02:38.300
I can create a new attribute.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.860
And here I'm going to write

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.965
spell check without any space.

00:02:42.965 --> 00:02:44.330
And for the value,

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.115
I'm going to write false.

00:02:46.115 --> 00:02:48.379
Should the browser
check the spelling,

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:52.730
know that's why we set the
value to false and save it.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.650
Then publish your website.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.630
I'm going to go to
the Contact Us page,

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.655
make sure to refresh your page.

00:02:58.655 --> 00:03:01.144
And now if I write
something weird,

00:03:01.144 --> 00:03:03.755
my browser doesn't
check the spelling.

00:03:03.755 --> 00:03:06.275
So that's one of the
most popular use cases

00:03:06.275 --> 00:03:07.595
of custom attributes.

00:03:07.595 --> 00:03:08.720
In fact, there are many

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.760
different HTML
attributes that you

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.940
can use and you can get
the full list here.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.730
If you go to W3 schools.com,

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.000
you can find the HTML
attributes reference here.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.370
There is a list of
all attributes,

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.935
but most of the time
we don't use them.

00:03:24.935 --> 00:03:27.590
But if you wish, you can
go ahead and take a look.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.290
Alright guys, that's
all for this video.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.230
I hope you enjoyed it and
I'll see you in the next one.
