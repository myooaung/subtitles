00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.185
Have you ever wondered
how you can use

00:00:07.185 --> 00:00:09.555
an animation in your project?

00:00:09.555 --> 00:00:12.030
The answer is
lighting animation.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.310
If you head over to
the Media section

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.230
here in the ad panel,

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.760
you can see that
there is an element

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.499
called launching animation.

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:22.665
Let me drag and drop these
elements into my container.

00:00:22.665 --> 00:00:26.460
Well, latae is a file type
for animation and it's so

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.540
powerful because it lets us
use high-quality animations.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.610
And most importantly, it lets us

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.625
control different properties
of that animation.

00:00:35.625 --> 00:00:37.960
E.g. we can make it interactive.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.795
We can make it play in
reverse and other things.

00:00:41.795 --> 00:00:45.380
We will talk about latae
animations in detail later,

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.510
but for now, let's
give it a try in

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.970
the assets while I
have a JSON file,

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.965
which is basically what we need

00:00:51.965 --> 00:00:54.245
if we want to use a
Latina animation,

00:00:54.245 --> 00:00:57.440
if I just click on this
replace latae sequence Martin,

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.290
I can simply choose
this animation.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.175
And there we go.

00:01:01.175 --> 00:01:03.215
Now we have the animation,

00:01:03.215 --> 00:01:04.775
but let me preview that.

00:01:04.775 --> 00:01:07.400
If I click on this
preview animation,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.170
the animation plays 0-100%.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.000
How cool is that?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.175
I can check the loop option.

00:01:16.175 --> 00:01:18.360
Let's preview it.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.220
There we go.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.130
It plays again and
again and again.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.800
I can choose the play
in reverse option.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.910
Just like that.
