00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.780
Hey, in this video we're going

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.715
to talk about the
project setting.

00:00:08.715 --> 00:00:10.665
We already talked
about it before.

00:00:10.665 --> 00:00:12.420
But in this video,
I'm gonna show you

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.195
some other features of
the project setting.

00:00:15.195 --> 00:00:16.335
So as you remember,

00:00:16.335 --> 00:00:18.555
in order to go to the
project settings,

00:00:18.555 --> 00:00:19.980
you need to head over to

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.440
the top left corner and you need

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.305
to click on this W icon here.

00:00:25.305 --> 00:00:29.085
And then from here you can
go to your project settings.

00:00:29.085 --> 00:00:30.825
And here we have
different options.

00:00:30.825 --> 00:00:33.600
We have general hosting,
editor, et cetera.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.690
We're not going to dive into
all of them because e.g.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.925
we have a dedicated video about

00:00:38.925 --> 00:00:41.740
SEO and also hosting plans.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.595
I'm going to walk you through

00:00:43.595 --> 00:00:46.385
the most important
tabs and fields here.

00:00:46.385 --> 00:00:47.885
On the General tab,

00:00:47.885 --> 00:00:49.175
we have this name,

00:00:49.175 --> 00:00:50.600
this is our project name.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.205
As you can see here
we have a hint.

00:00:52.205 --> 00:00:55.760
It says this is the project's
title within Webflow,

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.170
then we have the SOP domain.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.515
This is a staging domain that
workflow provides us with.

00:01:00.515 --> 00:01:02.240
It's totally free and you can

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.175
publish your website
on this domain.

00:01:04.175 --> 00:01:07.325
At the moment, this project
is not published yet,

00:01:07.325 --> 00:01:09.110
you can go ahead
and modify that.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.570
And if that sub-domain
is available,

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.205
you can use that domain.

00:01:13.205 --> 00:01:15.800
Here we can select a
folder and it says

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.535
projects can be moved into
and out of folders here,

00:01:19.535 --> 00:01:22.205
we don't need to move our
project to any folder.

00:01:22.205 --> 00:01:24.470
Then we have these icons here.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.240
You can upload a favicon.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.925
A favicon is this little icon

00:01:28.925 --> 00:01:31.535
that you can see on
each browsers tab.

00:01:31.535 --> 00:01:34.880
It should be a 32
by 32 pixel icon.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.695
You can see all the supported
formats here, PNG or JPEG.

00:01:39.695 --> 00:01:41.645
You can also upload a web clip.

00:01:41.645 --> 00:01:43.790
This is just an icon
that shows up when

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.135
your website link is saved
to an iPhone home screen.

00:01:47.135 --> 00:01:49.385
These are optional,
but make sure to

00:01:49.385 --> 00:01:52.519
upload a favicon always
for your website.

00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:54.560
Then we have the
localization here.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.425
You can choose the time
zone from this list.

00:01:57.425 --> 00:01:59.585
Then you can specify
a language code.

00:01:59.585 --> 00:02:03.050
It says set your science
language Go to allow browsers,

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.520
translation apps,

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.685
other tools to perform
language sensitive tasks.

00:02:07.685 --> 00:02:09.275
It's optional as well.

00:02:09.275 --> 00:02:10.970
You can get access
to the least of

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.415
language codes if you
click on this link.

00:02:13.415 --> 00:02:15.665
But for English
you can write EN,

00:02:15.665 --> 00:02:18.500
for instance, then we
have website password.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.025
Some of these options are
locked for the free plan.

00:02:22.025 --> 00:02:23.570
So if you want to use them,

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.330
you need to go ahead and
upgrade your account or

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.015
you need to add a hosting
plan to your project.

00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:31.940
We will talk about the account
plans and hosting plans.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.290
But for now you
just need to know

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.940
that some features are only

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.040
available in pro plans or

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.290
for projects with
a hosting plan.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.005
For instance, if you want
to showcase your project,

00:02:42.005 --> 00:02:44.375
you need to have a paid plan.

00:02:44.375 --> 00:02:47.885
One more important thing
is the Webflow branding.

00:02:47.885 --> 00:02:50.360
It says to hide
Webflow branding from

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.415
the public site at hosting or

00:02:52.415 --> 00:02:54.515
upgrade your account to prove.

00:02:54.515 --> 00:02:56.420
So what's the Webflow branding?

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.150
Let me go to the designer
for a second and

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.075
I'm going to show you
what it is exactly.

00:03:02.075 --> 00:03:04.100
If you publish your website,

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.335
if you click on this
Publish button,

00:03:06.335 --> 00:03:09.035
this is our staging domain
that I just showed you.

00:03:09.035 --> 00:03:11.840
If you click on publish
to select the domains,

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.489
you can publish your website,

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:14.915
and now it's published.

00:03:14.915 --> 00:03:17.645
And if I click on this
little icon, there we go.

00:03:17.645 --> 00:03:18.905
Here is our project.

00:03:18.905 --> 00:03:21.215
You can see that on the
bottom right corner

00:03:21.215 --> 00:03:23.585
there is this made
in Webflow badge

00:03:23.585 --> 00:03:26.000
and it will appear on
your websites if you are

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.415
using the free staging domain.

00:03:28.415 --> 00:03:31.160
And if your website is
published on this domain,

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.414
if you go ahead and add a
hosting plan to your project,

00:03:34.414 --> 00:03:36.650
you can simply disable that.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.395
Alright, let me go back
to the project settings.

00:03:39.395 --> 00:03:41.405
Let's see if we
have anything else.

00:03:41.405 --> 00:03:43.700
Here we have the
overview of our project,

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.835
the total asset size
last published,

00:03:46.835 --> 00:03:51.200
last updated, the number
of pages form submissions.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.745
These are statistics.

00:03:52.745 --> 00:03:54.695
Here we have the site activity.

00:03:54.695 --> 00:03:55.850
I'm going to scroll up.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.125
If you go to hosting,

00:03:57.125 --> 00:03:59.360
you can add a hosting
to your project.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.054
We will talk about it later.

00:04:01.054 --> 00:04:02.780
Then we have the editor here.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.450
You can add collaborators
to your projects so

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.600
someone else can edit the
contents of your project,

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.965
but it's only available.

00:04:09.965 --> 00:04:12.980
If you have the CMS or
business site plan,

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.380
then we have a feeling we're
not going to talk about it

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.470
now because we have a
dedicated video for that.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.080
Then we have SEO, the same case.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.805
We're going to talk
about it later.

00:04:22.805 --> 00:04:23.780
Then we have forums.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.780
We went through all
these fields before.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.720
We have fonts here you can
add your custom fonts.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.975
We already talked about it
and then we have backups.

00:04:32.975 --> 00:04:34.715
This tab is so useful,

00:04:34.715 --> 00:04:38.210
you need to know that Webflow
backs up your project when

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.810
you press Command Shift S or
Control Shift S on Windows.

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.145
So why does it matter?

00:04:43.145 --> 00:04:46.730
Because sometimes you might
change something and you want

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.675
to revert back to the previous
version of your project.

00:04:50.675 --> 00:04:53.675
In this case, you can simply
hit over to the backups

00:04:53.675 --> 00:04:57.155
and you can find the
appropriate version here, e.g.

00:04:57.155 --> 00:04:59.210
this one says two days ago,

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:04.264
automatic backup three
pages, 102 styles, etc.

00:05:04.264 --> 00:05:05.360
You can also preview

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.685
this version and then
you can restore it.

00:05:07.685 --> 00:05:08.990
But keep in mind.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.914
If you want to restore
some old backups,

00:05:11.914 --> 00:05:15.170
you need a hosting plan or
a paid account so that you

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:18.635
can restore these
recent backups easily.

00:05:18.635 --> 00:05:20.345
Then we have integrations.

00:05:20.345 --> 00:05:21.590
So on this tab,

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.035
you can actually
connect your project

00:05:24.035 --> 00:05:27.395
with third party services, e.g.

00:05:27.395 --> 00:05:29.870
Google Analytics, Google Maps,

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.025
Facebook Pixel, and also you
can generate an API token.

00:05:34.025 --> 00:05:37.190
We will talk about the
integrations in a separate video,

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.020
but for now you just
need to know that it

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.390
exist in the project settings.

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.295
Finally, we have custom code,

00:05:43.295 --> 00:05:46.115
which is also available
for paid plans.

00:05:46.115 --> 00:05:47.870
Using this section, you can add

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.485
some custom code to your
website if you need to.

00:05:51.485 --> 00:05:52.880
But most of the time,

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.795
for most websites, you don't
need to add any custom code.

00:05:56.795 --> 00:06:00.215
But if you need to extend web
flows, native capabilities,

00:06:00.215 --> 00:06:02.780
you can simply
upgrade your plan and

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.465
take advantage of
these useful features.

00:06:05.465 --> 00:06:08.060
Alright, what do we have
here in the toolbar?

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.545
Here we have some icons.

00:06:09.545 --> 00:06:11.825
The first one is
the transfer icon.

00:06:11.825 --> 00:06:13.100
If I click on that,

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.480
it says to a user,

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.460
to a team using this button,

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.410
you can transfer your project

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.315
to another web flows account.

00:06:20.315 --> 00:06:21.530
But to do that, again,

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.380
you need to upgrade your
plan to a paid account.

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.480
You can also transfer
your project to

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.715
a team if you head
over to this tab,

00:06:28.715 --> 00:06:30.680
it's a useful option
if you want to

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.750
transfer the client's project

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.000
to their own account
and you don't

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.550
want to host their project
on your own account.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.955
We will talk about the
benefits of this option later.

00:06:40.955 --> 00:06:43.040
The next option here is delete.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.675
If you want to
delete your project,

00:06:44.675 --> 00:06:47.810
you need to simply
enter these red code

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.020
here and then delete
your project forever.

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.404
Remember, once you
delete your project,

00:06:53.404 --> 00:06:55.340
it's deleted permanently and

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.604
you can reverse this operation.

00:06:57.604 --> 00:06:59.480
Make sure to think twice before

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.415
you delete your project forever,

00:07:01.415 --> 00:07:03.245
then we have the
duplicate option.

00:07:03.245 --> 00:07:05.420
Sometimes you might
need to duplicate

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.775
a project for a specific reason.

00:07:07.775 --> 00:07:10.640
No matter if you just want
to archive the project

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.440
or you just want to make

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.780
some changes to the
duplicated version.

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:17.435
You can simply click on
this duplicate button.

00:07:17.435 --> 00:07:21.080
And here you can simply
duplicate your project.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.185
And the last option
here is Unpublish.

00:07:24.185 --> 00:07:25.445
If you click on it,

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:26.660
your website will be

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.525
unpublished and you need
to publish it again.

00:07:29.525 --> 00:07:31.520
Here we have other
options as well.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.680
We have shared. Sometimes you

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.915
might need to share
your project with

00:07:35.915 --> 00:07:38.090
other designers or let's say

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:41.030
other collaborators
or even the client.

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:43.400
If you click on this
Share button here,

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.850
you can simply turn this
switch on and then Webflow

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:50.614
generates a unique shared
link for your project.

00:07:50.614 --> 00:07:53.060
If you just copy
this link and share

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.775
it with your client
or anyone else,

00:07:55.775 --> 00:07:59.285
he or she can easily get
access to the project,

00:07:59.285 --> 00:08:01.355
but we'd read only access.

00:08:01.355 --> 00:08:02.390
What does it mean?

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:05.705
It means that they can make
some changes on the website,

00:08:05.705 --> 00:08:08.314
but those changes
won't be saved.

00:08:08.314 --> 00:08:10.685
That's why it's
called read-only.

00:08:10.685 --> 00:08:13.370
So you can be 100% sure that

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:16.445
they can't break your
website are right.

00:08:16.445 --> 00:08:19.850
I'm going to turn it off and
then we have the designer.

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:22.820
If you click on it, you will
be taken to the designer.

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.380
Then we have editor.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.225
It says publish your project

00:08:26.225 --> 00:08:27.965
in order to access the editor.

00:08:27.965 --> 00:08:30.725
We will talk about the
editor in the next video.

00:08:30.725 --> 00:08:33.965
All right guys, that's all
for the project settings.

00:08:33.965 --> 00:08:36.155
There are many things that
we didn't talk about,

00:08:36.155 --> 00:08:38.585
like the SEO section or editor,

00:08:38.585 --> 00:08:40.700
but we will definitely
dive into them.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.500
I hope you enjoyed this video

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:45.270
and I'll see you
in the next one.
