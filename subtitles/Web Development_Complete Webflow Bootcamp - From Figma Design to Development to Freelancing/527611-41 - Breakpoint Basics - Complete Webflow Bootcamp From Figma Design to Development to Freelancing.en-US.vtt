00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.175
When we want to design
a webpage responsively,

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:10.455
we need to use breakpoints.

00:00:10.455 --> 00:00:11.655
Wants a break point?

00:00:11.655 --> 00:00:14.070
Well, a breakpoint
is nothing but

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.830
a specific size that applies.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.165
Some style changes to
specific screen's width.

00:00:21.165 --> 00:00:22.710
You need to remember that we

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.680
define our style
changes for different

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.830
screen sizes only
based on the width of

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.190
the browser or the width
of the device itself,

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.465
no matter if it's an iPad,

00:00:34.465 --> 00:00:37.640
iPhone, or any other devices.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.559
So by default, Webflow has
four preset breakpoints.

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.065
If you take a look
at the top bar here,

00:00:45.065 --> 00:00:47.420
you can see that we
have the desktop,

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.950
which is our base point.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.645
Then we have the tablet,

00:00:50.645 --> 00:00:52.715
then we have more by landscape,

00:00:52.715 --> 00:00:55.010
and finally mobile portrait.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.335
One important principle
that you should learn

00:00:57.335 --> 00:00:59.900
about breakpoints
is this changes we

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.680
make to our styles
will cascade down to

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.075
smaller devices and cascade
up to larger devices.

00:01:08.075 --> 00:01:12.005
This is the main principle
of responsive web pages.

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:13.880
So if you learn it correctly,

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.715
you can create responsive
websites easily.

00:01:16.715 --> 00:01:18.965
Let's start with the
desktop break point.

00:01:18.965 --> 00:01:21.515
If I hover over this icon,

00:01:21.515 --> 00:01:24.680
I will get the information of
this particular breakpoint,

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.380
and this is called
our base breakpoint.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.330
The next one is tablet.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.625
And as you can see, we
will get the pixel range.

00:01:31.625 --> 00:01:35.255
It says 991 pixels and down,

00:01:35.255 --> 00:01:37.760
then we have mobile landscape.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.075
It says 767 pixels and down.

00:01:41.075 --> 00:01:43.985
And finally we have
mobile portrait.

00:01:43.985 --> 00:01:46.100
If you want to add
larger breakpoints

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.215
to your project,
you can do that.

00:01:48.215 --> 00:01:51.320
If you click on this
icon right here,

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.005
you can start adding
larger breakpoints.

00:01:54.005 --> 00:01:56.315
However, keep in mind
that at the moment,

00:01:56.315 --> 00:01:59.645
once you add a large
breakpoint to your project,

00:01:59.645 --> 00:02:03.335
you can not remove that before
adding larger breakpoints.

00:02:03.335 --> 00:02:06.275
Let me show you how
breakpoints work.

00:02:06.275 --> 00:02:10.100
I'm going to start by
selecting this tidal. Okay?

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.440
So this tidal looks great.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.965
The font size looks fine
on this screen's width,

00:02:15.965 --> 00:02:18.080
but what if I go to tablets?

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.555
On tablet, it looks
great as well.

00:02:20.555 --> 00:02:22.490
What about mobile landscape?

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.470
Well, here it looks fine,

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.585
but I can make it
smaller as well.

00:02:26.585 --> 00:02:28.129
While this is selected,

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:29.780
I'm going to head over to

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.260
the typography section
here on the style panel.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.540
And I can override
these properties.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.335
As you can see, all these
properties have amber color.

00:02:40.335 --> 00:02:44.435
It means that the value comes
from our base breakpoint.

00:02:44.435 --> 00:02:46.475
As soon as I override this,

00:02:46.475 --> 00:02:48.260
you will see that it turns blue.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.070
So let me modify the
font size to 14 pixels.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.820
There we go.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:53.870
It turned blue.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.300
And now this specific property

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.445
comes from this breakpoint.

00:02:58.445 --> 00:03:00.320
And all the changes I make in

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.540
this particular breakpoint will

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.705
cascade down to mobile portrait,

00:03:05.705 --> 00:03:08.885
but it doesn't affect
larger breakpoints here.

00:03:08.885 --> 00:03:10.385
So let me prove that to you.

00:03:10.385 --> 00:03:12.935
If I go to mobile
Porsche rate now,

00:03:12.935 --> 00:03:16.670
you can see that the font
size is set to 40 pixels and

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.690
it comes from our mobile
landscape are right.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.270
However, if I go to tablet,

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.870
can see that the font size
is a seal, 60 pixels.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.450
This is how breakpoints work,

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.750
changes cascade
downwards and upwards.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.955
If you learn this
simple principle,

00:03:34.955 --> 00:03:38.345
You already know how to
design responsive web pages.

00:03:38.345 --> 00:03:42.320
1 important thing about
breakpoints is that it only

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.400
works when we modify the
styles on the side panel.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.265
If we try to modify e.g.

00:03:49.265 --> 00:03:52.085
the order of these
elements in the navigator,

00:03:52.085 --> 00:03:54.770
it will affect all other
breakpoints as well.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.670
So let me go to mobile portrait
and I'm going to change

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.560
the order of these elements in

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.585
the navigator, okay, like this.

00:04:02.585 --> 00:04:05.150
Now if I go to mobile landscape,

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.594
the order has been
changed to tablet,

00:04:07.594 --> 00:04:10.415
the same, desktop
breakpoint, the same.

00:04:10.415 --> 00:04:12.650
So you need to keep in
mind that when we want

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.095
to modify the order
of our elements,

00:04:15.095 --> 00:04:18.080
we need to do that
using Flexbox in

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.215
the style panel and all
other properties here,

00:04:21.215 --> 00:04:22.925
you can use a grid as well,

00:04:22.925 --> 00:04:25.490
and you can modify the
children of your grid.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.600
You can modify the order
of your Flexbox children,

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.264
as we discussed before,

00:04:31.264 --> 00:04:33.904
but you can change the
order of your elements

00:04:33.904 --> 00:04:36.815
in the navigator or
on the canvas here,

00:04:36.815 --> 00:04:39.785
because the changes are
applied to all breakpoints.

00:04:39.785 --> 00:04:43.445
So let's suppose I want to
change the color of this text.

00:04:43.445 --> 00:04:44.600
I can do that as well.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.424
However, if I change it here
on the base breakpoint,

00:04:48.424 --> 00:04:51.245
it will cascade down and up.

00:04:51.245 --> 00:04:54.860
Therefore it will affect all
other breakpoints as well.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.260
Let me scroll down
here and I'm going to

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.440
change the color to
something else, e.g.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.600
something lighter. Let's see

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.490
what happens on other devices.

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:05.330
There we go.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.135
That changes applied
to this breakpoint,

00:05:08.135 --> 00:05:09.920
to this one and to this one.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.350
However, if I
override the color of

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.085
this text here or on
any other breakpoints,

00:05:16.085 --> 00:05:18.500
let me show you
what happens if I

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.230
override it here, e.g. to read.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:22.115
Okay.

00:05:22.115 --> 00:05:24.980
If I go to desktop
breakpoint and

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.859
I try to change this
color to black,

00:05:27.859 --> 00:05:29.120
it doesn't affect

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.535
the mobile porch rate
breakpoint anymore.

00:05:31.535 --> 00:05:32.105
Why?

00:05:32.105 --> 00:05:34.115
Because we've
already overwritten

00:05:34.115 --> 00:05:37.279
that property for that
particular breakpoint.

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:38.060
There we go.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.095
It didn't change.

00:05:39.095 --> 00:05:42.410
So this is generally
how breakpoints work

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.840
unless there is a
specific property set

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.595
to that particular breakpoint,

00:05:46.595 --> 00:05:49.190
changes always cascade down.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.605
If I remove this styling here,

00:05:51.605 --> 00:05:53.735
if I hold down the Option key or

00:05:53.735 --> 00:05:56.180
Alt key on my keyboard
and I click here,

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.010
click on this color text.

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.730
Now this tiling comes from
the desktop break point.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:03.145
Let me go to desktop.

00:06:03.145 --> 00:06:05.870
I'm going to show you
other things as well.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.519
So let me go to tablet.

00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:10.250
And as you can see,
these images look great,

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.340
although we have a
narrower screen size.

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.175
But what if I go to
mobile landscape?

00:06:16.175 --> 00:06:18.620
Will they are to shrinked.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.720
So I'm going to change that.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.760
We can select our image wrapper,

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.080
which is a flexbox.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.205
And we can modify the
properties of our flexbox.

00:06:27.205 --> 00:06:30.005
Instead of setting the
direction to horizontal,

00:06:30.005 --> 00:06:31.910
I'm going to change
it to vertical.

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.200
Okay, great.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.710
Then I'm going to align
them to the center.

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.885
Finally, I'm going to select

00:06:38.885 --> 00:06:41.555
the children of
this wrapper image.

00:06:41.555 --> 00:06:43.460
Here the width is set to

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:48.035
31% because it comes from
the desktop breakpoint.

00:06:48.035 --> 00:06:51.110
I'm going to change the
width to 100 per cent.

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.305
And remember any changes
I make to this breakpoint

00:06:54.305 --> 00:06:57.770
will cascade down to
mobile portrayed as well.

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.575
Now I'm going to add some
bottom margin to these images.

00:07:00.575 --> 00:07:03.650
I think maybe ten
pixels would be fine.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.040
And let's see what happens
if I go to mobile portrait.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.030
There we go.

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:09.905
Now they look great.

00:07:09.905 --> 00:07:13.055
But if I go to
tablets, it's intact.

00:07:13.055 --> 00:07:14.495
If I go to desktop,

00:07:14.495 --> 00:07:17.975
can see we have steel,
the horizontal direction.

00:07:17.975 --> 00:07:20.795
And if I select one
of these children,

00:07:20.795 --> 00:07:22.950
the width is set to 30,

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:25.205
1%, and it didn't change.

00:07:25.205 --> 00:07:27.950
So using breakpoints, we
can create any kind of

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:31.355
responsive pages easily
and conveniently.

00:07:31.355 --> 00:07:34.625
However, there are some
points that I should mention.

00:07:34.625 --> 00:07:36.935
Let's suppose I want to change

00:07:36.935 --> 00:07:40.489
this image on
another breakpoint.

00:07:40.489 --> 00:07:42.650
Let's see what
happens if I select

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:46.340
this image and if I change
it to something else, e.g.

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.370
this one, this change
applies to all breakpoints.

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:51.620
If I go to desktop, there we go.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:53.165
That's how images work.

00:07:53.165 --> 00:07:55.114
We're not changing the style.

00:07:55.114 --> 00:07:59.015
If I use the background image
here in the style panel,

00:07:59.015 --> 00:08:02.315
we could set it for each
specific break-point,

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:05.180
but with images,
it's not possible.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:07.085
You need to keep that in mind.

00:08:07.085 --> 00:08:09.275
One other important
point is that

00:08:09.275 --> 00:08:11.705
if you modify the
text somewhere,

00:08:11.705 --> 00:08:14.090
even on mobile and portrayed,

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:17.585
it will affect all other
breakpoints because again,

00:08:17.585 --> 00:08:19.820
we are not changing
this tines if

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.070
I just remove this design here,

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:23.210
let's see what happens.

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:23.960
There we go.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.660
It has been removed
from all breakpoints.

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:29.825
So you need to be aware
of these limitations.

00:08:29.825 --> 00:08:32.030
But what if you want to
remove some elements?

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:34.355
Well, let me show
you how it works.

00:08:34.355 --> 00:08:37.055
If I decide to remove
this paragraph here,

00:08:37.055 --> 00:08:38.420
and I select it,

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:40.024
and I hit Delete,

00:08:40.024 --> 00:08:43.235
or I can right-click on
that and just delete it.

00:08:43.235 --> 00:08:46.325
It will be removed from
the document itself.

00:08:46.325 --> 00:08:49.460
So it will affect all
other breakpoints just

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.745
like that because it doesn't
exist in our code anymore.

00:08:52.745 --> 00:08:55.174
However, let me
undo the operation.

00:08:55.174 --> 00:08:57.350
If I decide to remove

00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:00.155
this element from this
particular breakpoint,

00:09:00.155 --> 00:09:01.310
I can select it.

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:04.310
I can head over to the
display settings here,

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:07.445
and I can set the
display setting to None.

00:09:07.445 --> 00:09:09.245
And now it's hidden.

00:09:09.245 --> 00:09:12.305
It's hidden only on
mobile portrait.

00:09:12.305 --> 00:09:16.370
Why? Because we have modified
the CSS properties here.

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:18.005
Let me go to desktop.

00:09:18.005 --> 00:09:20.435
Here, you can see that
it's still there.

00:09:20.435 --> 00:09:22.715
I'm gonna go to tablet

00:09:22.715 --> 00:09:25.535
and mobile landscape,
it's still there.

00:09:25.535 --> 00:09:28.580
So this is a good trick
for hiding elements.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.545
However, you need to
keep in mind that

00:09:30.545 --> 00:09:33.095
although you hit
the element here,

00:09:33.095 --> 00:09:34.835
It's still in your code,

00:09:34.835 --> 00:09:36.830
but it's not visible
because we just

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:39.095
said it's displaced
setting to none.

00:09:39.095 --> 00:09:41.645
But it doesn't mean
that it doesn't exist.

00:09:41.645 --> 00:09:44.825
Alright, if I want to
reset any properties here,

00:09:44.825 --> 00:09:46.205
as I mentioned before,

00:09:46.205 --> 00:09:47.930
I'm gonna hold down Alt key or

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:50.390
Option key on my keyboard and
I'm going to click on that.

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:52.010
Alternatively, you can click on

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:56.915
this blue label and you can
hit Reset just like that.

00:09:56.915 --> 00:09:59.165
But what about
larger breakpoints?

00:09:59.165 --> 00:10:01.820
Well, larger breakpoints
are optional.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:05.465
That's why they don't appear
at the top here by default.

00:10:05.465 --> 00:10:08.180
But sometimes it
makes sense to add

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:11.510
larger breakpoints
and specify some,

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:15.245
let's say specific styles
for those breakpoints.

00:10:15.245 --> 00:10:16.805
I'm going to show
you how it works.

00:10:16.805 --> 00:10:19.985
I'm going to add this 12,
80 pixels breakpoint.

00:10:19.985 --> 00:10:23.105
It says create this
breakpoint and up,

00:10:23.105 --> 00:10:25.280
you cannot remove
the breakpoint from

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:28.685
the project once it's created
our right create one.

00:10:28.685 --> 00:10:32.060
Okay, I'm going to create
the next breakpoint as well.

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:33.365
I'm going to create it.

00:10:33.365 --> 00:10:37.355
And finally the 1920
pixel breakpoint.

00:10:37.355 --> 00:10:39.095
Create, alright, cool.

00:10:39.095 --> 00:10:42.005
Now we have all the seven
available breakpoints.

00:10:42.005 --> 00:10:44.270
And just like smaller devices,

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:47.030
changes we make to the
base breakpoint will

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:50.525
cascade up to larger devices.

00:10:50.525 --> 00:10:54.380
So if I go to this break
point and if I decide

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:58.400
to modify the maximum width
of my container here,

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.925
as you can see, the maximum
width is set to 1,100.

00:11:01.925 --> 00:11:04.370
If I decide to increase it to,

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:06.935
let's say 1,200, like that,

00:11:06.935 --> 00:11:10.400
this change applies to
all larger devices,

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.485
but it doesn't cascade down.

00:11:12.485 --> 00:11:16.625
Let me show you if I go to
this 14, 40 pixel breakpoint.

00:11:16.625 --> 00:11:19.730
You can see the max
width is set to 1,200.

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:23.240
If I go to 1920 pixel
breakpoint, there we go.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.595
Again, 1,200. For
this breakpoint,

00:11:25.595 --> 00:11:26.960
I can modify that.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.360
I can override this
property, e.g.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.495
to 1,700, it looks
much better now,

00:11:32.495 --> 00:11:33.980
however, this change doesn't

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:36.245
apply to smaller breakpoints.

00:11:36.245 --> 00:11:39.185
Alright, that was a lot
to process. Let's recap.

00:11:39.185 --> 00:11:40.969
First, you need to understand

00:11:40.969 --> 00:11:44.555
the main principle of
responsiveness and breakpoints,

00:11:44.555 --> 00:11:46.415
also known as media queries,

00:11:46.415 --> 00:11:48.935
in order to make
responsive design,

00:11:48.935 --> 00:11:51.410
this principle
says that changes,

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:53.390
we apply it to our
base breakpoint,

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:55.550
will cascade down to

00:11:55.550 --> 00:12:00.365
smaller devices and will
cascade up to larger devices.

00:12:00.365 --> 00:12:02.795
So this is the main
thing you need to learn.

00:12:02.795 --> 00:12:05.105
Then you need to understand
that breakpoints

00:12:05.105 --> 00:12:07.895
only respond to style changes.

00:12:07.895 --> 00:12:09.710
So whatever you change on

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:11.900
this tile panel on
the right side,

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:13.520
we respect the breakpoints.

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.020
But if you change something in

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:16.670
the navigator or if you change

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:18.110
the order of your elements in

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:20.195
the navigator or on the Canvas,

00:12:20.195 --> 00:12:22.835
it will not affect
different breakpoints.

00:12:22.835 --> 00:12:25.190
The other point was
that if you replace

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:28.070
your images using
an image element,

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:30.185
it will affect all breakpoints.

00:12:30.185 --> 00:12:31.730
And last but not least,

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:33.995
when you modify
your texts layers,

00:12:33.995 --> 00:12:35.645
if you change your texts,

00:12:35.645 --> 00:12:39.620
it will also affect all your
breakpoints are right guys,

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:42.875
that's all about breakpoints
and responsiveness.

00:12:42.875 --> 00:12:45.080
Of course, we will talk
about responsiveness in

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:48.965
detail once we start
creating our projects.

00:12:48.965 --> 00:12:50.615
I hope you enjoyed this video

00:12:50.615 --> 00:12:53.370
and I'll see you
in the next one.
