00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.220
Now that you've learned
how to work with Flexbox,

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.545
it's starting to
challenge your skills.

00:00:10.545 --> 00:00:14.865
Workflow has created a
very cool Flexbox game

00:00:14.865 --> 00:00:17.640
in order for you to
practice what you learned.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.940
So if you go to
Flexbox game.com,

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.785
you can preview this game

00:00:22.785 --> 00:00:24.855
and you can actually
play this game.

00:00:24.855 --> 00:00:26.685
You can do some exercises.

00:00:26.685 --> 00:00:30.570
There are 28 different
CSS Flexbox challenges

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.665
that you can solve

00:00:31.665 --> 00:00:33.570
in order to see
whether you truly

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.925
understand how the
Flexbox works or not,

00:00:36.925 --> 00:00:40.445
what I want you to do
is go ahead and solve

00:00:40.445 --> 00:00:43.160
these challenges one-by-one from

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.985
level one all the
way through 28.

00:00:46.985 --> 00:00:50.885
As you move on from
level one to level 28,

00:00:50.885 --> 00:00:54.350
it gets harder and harder
to solve these challenges.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.800
But don't worry, I'm pretty
sure that you can solve them.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.905
And what matters is that
you try to solve them.

00:01:00.905 --> 00:01:03.815
It doesn't matter how much
time it takes to solve them.

00:01:03.815 --> 00:01:05.660
What matters is to try.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.980
In the next video, we will

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.260
solve all these
challenges together.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.910
So see you in the next one.
