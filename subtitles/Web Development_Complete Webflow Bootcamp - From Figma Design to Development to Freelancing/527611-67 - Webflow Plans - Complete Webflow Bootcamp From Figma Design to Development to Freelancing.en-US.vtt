00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.860
Are right now, that's
our website is ready,

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.205
it's time to talk about
Webflow, those plans.

00:00:11.205 --> 00:00:13.065
Webflow has different plans.

00:00:13.065 --> 00:00:16.215
It has account plans
and site plans.

00:00:16.215 --> 00:00:17.670
So in this video, we're going

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.170
to talk about different plans.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.760
You are going to learn what's

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.065
the difference between them,

00:00:22.065 --> 00:00:25.230
and you can decide which
plan suits your needs.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.540
So if you're ready, let's begin.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.615
If you go to webflow.com
slash pricing,

00:00:30.615 --> 00:00:32.925
you can open up this
page and here is

00:00:32.925 --> 00:00:35.880
all the information you
need about different plans.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.440
If I scroll down,

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.780
you can see that workflow
has two types of plans,

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.860
site plans and account plans.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.570
So what's the difference
between them?

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.100
Well, whenever you
want to connect

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.229
your custom domain
to your project,

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:50.974
you need to add a site
plan to your project.

00:00:50.974 --> 00:00:53.675
Right now we are using
the staging plan.

00:00:53.675 --> 00:00:57.275
All projects by default
have the staging plan.

00:00:57.275 --> 00:00:59.735
But if you want to get
access to more features

00:00:59.735 --> 00:01:02.735
and connect your custom
domain to your project,

00:01:02.735 --> 00:01:04.520
you need to add a site plan.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.290
This is basically
a hosting plan.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.110
So if I click on this
site plan section,

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.835
I will be taken to this section.

00:01:10.835 --> 00:01:12.110
Let's see what we have.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.690
As you can see, we have
four different options.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.185
We have basic CMS,
business and enterprise.

00:01:18.185 --> 00:01:19.955
So let's start with basic.

00:01:19.955 --> 00:01:21.575
You can see the cost here.

00:01:21.575 --> 00:01:22.925
It's the monthly cost.

00:01:22.925 --> 00:01:26.465
It says best for a simple
site that doesn't need a CMS.

00:01:26.465 --> 00:01:30.365
So basically these plan
doesn't support CMS.

00:01:30.365 --> 00:01:32.435
So if you want to
publish a website that

00:01:32.435 --> 00:01:34.655
only has static pages,

00:01:34.655 --> 00:01:36.545
this plan works best for you.

00:01:36.545 --> 00:01:38.990
You can see all the
available features here.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.634
You can create up to 100
different static pages.

00:01:42.634 --> 00:01:46.115
You can get up to
25,000 monthly visits.

00:01:46.115 --> 00:01:48.770
You will get 100
form submissions per

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.710
month and other
different features.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.255
Then we have CMS,

00:01:53.255 --> 00:01:55.280
which is good for websites
that need to have

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.995
dynamic pages and work with CMS.

00:01:57.995 --> 00:02:01.295
Again, you can create up
to 100s static pages.

00:02:01.295 --> 00:02:05.195
You can get up to
100,000 monthly visits.

00:02:05.195 --> 00:02:07.280
Using this plan, you can create

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.030
up to 2000 collection
items in our project,

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.730
the collection items where
the projects that we

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.580
created for our
projects collection,

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.200
if you remember, we created

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.384
different projects like
simplify, crypto Pi, etc.

00:02:22.384 --> 00:02:25.220
Here the number of forms
submissions is much higher.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.800
You can go ahead and read
all these information.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.255
We're not going to
dive into them.

00:02:29.255 --> 00:02:31.265
I'm not going to read
them one by one,

00:02:31.265 --> 00:02:32.900
but you need to understand
that if you want to

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.194
connect a custom domain
to your project,

00:02:35.194 --> 00:02:38.165
you need to add a site
plan to your project.

00:02:38.165 --> 00:02:41.765
Remember, site plans will
be added to projects,

00:02:41.765 --> 00:02:44.720
not to your account because
we have account plans as

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.810
well and we're going to talk
about it in a few minutes.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.580
But the next thing
I'm going to mention

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.710
here is the e-commerce plans.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.280
These site plans are
good for personal sites,

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.350
blogs, and business websites.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.535
If you want to create

00:02:58.535 --> 00:03:00.950
an e-commerce website
using Webflow,

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.380
you need to add an e-commerce
plan to your project.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.395
Here we have standard
plus an advanced.

00:03:06.395 --> 00:03:08.960
You can go ahead and
read the information

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.870
here and learn more about
different plants here.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.195
I'm gonna go back to site plans.

00:03:14.195 --> 00:03:16.205
And now I'm going to talk about

00:03:16.205 --> 00:03:18.380
Account Plans when you
work with Webflow,

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.750
most features are free to use,

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.030
but there are features
that are paid as well.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.000
These are some additional
features that you may need

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.119
to use in order to
create amazing projects.

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:32.450
So now I'm going to click
on this account plans.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:33.800
And there we go.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.740
Here we have individual
plans and team plans.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.245
If you're a freelancer
and you work alone,

00:03:39.245 --> 00:03:40.925
you don't need to
get a team plan.

00:03:40.925 --> 00:03:42.290
But if you want to
collaborate with

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.584
other developers and
other designers,

00:03:44.584 --> 00:03:47.825
you may need to go ahead
and get a team plan.

00:03:47.825 --> 00:03:50.270
But let's talk about
individual plans.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.015
When you create an account
on Webflow, by default,

00:03:53.015 --> 00:03:55.925
the starter plan will be
assigned to your account.

00:03:55.925 --> 00:03:57.905
So here as you can see, it says,

00:03:57.905 --> 00:03:59.840
everything you need
to get started

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.495
building with Webflow
and it's free forever.

00:04:02.495 --> 00:04:05.945
You can create up to two
projects using the starter plan.

00:04:05.945 --> 00:04:08.180
If I click on this, you
can see projects are

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.880
on hosted sites you
build in Webflow.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.310
So if you create two
projects and if you

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.605
add a site plan to
those projects,

00:04:15.605 --> 00:04:16.820
you can still create

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.550
two more projects using
the starter plan.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:21.410
Here it says you
can publish them to

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.630
a Webflow dot io
sub domain to share

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.220
as prototypes or add

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.860
a site plan to go live
on a custom domain,

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.450
then you have client billing.

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.435
We will talk about this
option later and staging.

00:04:32.435 --> 00:04:33.350
It says free.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.485
If I click on it, we will
see the information here.

00:04:36.485 --> 00:04:40.655
It says up to two static
pages and 50 CMS items.

00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:42.200
So it means you can create

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.625
more than two static pages
and more than 50 CMS items.

00:04:46.625 --> 00:04:49.370
Remember, you can create
more dynamic pages,

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.055
but you can create more
than two static pages.

00:04:52.055 --> 00:04:54.950
In our project, we had
only two static pages,

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.990
our homepage and our
Contact Us page.

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.580
Let me go ahead
and show you if I

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.800
go to the pages panel here

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.540
you can see under
static pages we

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.775
have home and contact us.

00:05:04.775 --> 00:05:07.685
And if I try to add
a new page here,

00:05:07.685 --> 00:05:09.740
it doesn't allow me to do that.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:10.460
Let me show you.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.575
It says you've
created all the pages

00:05:12.575 --> 00:05:15.065
allowed by your free
plan to add more,

00:05:15.065 --> 00:05:16.820
upgrade your site plan.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.075
This is the limitation when
it comes to Starter plan.

00:05:20.075 --> 00:05:22.400
You can transfer your project,

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.725
you can export
your code as well.

00:05:24.725 --> 00:05:26.270
One of the great features of

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.270
Webflow is that you can
export your project.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.535
If I click on this code export,

00:05:31.535 --> 00:05:36.185
it says Export clean and
semantic HTML and CSS files

00:05:36.185 --> 00:05:37.910
to hand off to your dev team.

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:39.590
Sometimes you might need to host

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.270
your project somewhere else,

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.000
not using workflows
hosting in that case,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.055
you can head over to
the toolbar here.

00:05:46.055 --> 00:05:47.525
And right at the top,

00:05:47.525 --> 00:05:50.585
you can see this
export code option

00:05:50.585 --> 00:05:52.115
using the starter plan.

00:05:52.115 --> 00:05:54.380
It's not possible to
export your code.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.365
As you can see, it shows
the HTML preview here.

00:05:57.365 --> 00:05:59.735
It's not all the code
of your website.

00:05:59.735 --> 00:06:02.360
If you go to CSS, you
can see your code as

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.150
well, JavaScript and assets.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.800
And if you have a paid account,

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.010
you can simply export
your project and hosted

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.175
somewhere else or make any
modifications you want.

00:06:13.175 --> 00:06:14.495
That's totally up to you.

00:06:14.495 --> 00:06:16.205
This is something to consider.

00:06:16.205 --> 00:06:18.560
Then you don't have
any project transfers

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.715
using a starter.

00:06:19.715 --> 00:06:22.640
Let me show you you can
transfer projects to Teams or

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.275
anyone with a Webflow account

00:06:24.275 --> 00:06:26.180
and you can use white labeling.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.980
It says add your own logo to

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.545
the CMS and client
billing payment forums

00:06:30.545 --> 00:06:32.270
and remove Webflow branding

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.195
from form emails
and staging sites.

00:06:35.195 --> 00:06:38.120
You don't have side password
protection as well.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.820
So if you want to work as
a freelancer and you get

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.564
more and more projects
as a web developer,

00:06:43.564 --> 00:06:46.850
Probably you can go with a
light plan that allows you to

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:50.930
have ten on hosted projects
within hence staging,

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.885
hosting and also
project transfers.

00:06:53.885 --> 00:06:56.915
But still you don t have
the white labeling option.

00:06:56.915 --> 00:07:00.410
If you have many clients and
many projects to work on,

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.065
you can go and get
a pro account.

00:07:03.065 --> 00:07:04.355
Using the pro account,

00:07:04.355 --> 00:07:06.754
you are free to use
all these features.

00:07:06.754 --> 00:07:09.275
One more thing I'm going
to mention about free plan

00:07:09.275 --> 00:07:12.395
and paid plans is that
using the free plan,

00:07:12.395 --> 00:07:15.484
you can add custom
code to your project.

00:07:15.484 --> 00:07:18.440
So if I go to this
circle project,

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.830
if I just head over
to static pages here,

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.065
and if I click on
the Settings icon,

00:07:24.065 --> 00:07:26.690
I'm going to scroll down
here at the bottom you

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:29.330
can see we have this
option custom code.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.535
However, it's not available.

00:07:31.535 --> 00:07:32.765
If you want to add some

00:07:32.765 --> 00:07:35.105
advanced custom code
to your project,

00:07:35.105 --> 00:07:37.415
you can simply upgrade
to a paid plan

00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:39.995
and then this option
will be available.

00:07:39.995 --> 00:07:42.784
You can also add a hosting
plan to your project.

00:07:42.784 --> 00:07:46.280
And again, this option will
be available if I go to

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:50.180
the project settings and if
I go to the custom code tab,

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:51.860
you can see that this option is

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:53.810
not available here as well.

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:57.380
Again, we need a paid
site plan or we need to

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.300
upgrade our account plan to

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.265
add custom code to our website.

00:08:01.265 --> 00:08:04.490
We will talk about custom
code in our future lessons.

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:06.410
But for now you just
need to know that

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:08.480
using the free Starter plan,

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.020
you can't use custom code and
it's totally fine because

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:15.545
the starter plan is useful
for people who are learning.

00:08:15.545 --> 00:08:17.660
So if you just want
to experiment with

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.825
different options and
learn how Webflow works,

00:08:20.825 --> 00:08:22.700
this is the best
plan you can use.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:26.374
There is no trial period and
no credit card is required.

00:08:26.374 --> 00:08:29.615
But if you get clients and
you work on paid projects,

00:08:29.615 --> 00:08:33.110
you can definitely upgrade
to paid plans in order to

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:37.265
use those additional options
are right, so let's recap.

00:08:37.265 --> 00:08:40.370
Remember, when we talk
about plans on Webflow,

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.215
we have two types of plans,

00:08:42.215 --> 00:08:44.270
site plans and Account Plans.

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:46.460
If you upgrade your
account plans,

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.635
new features will
be available for

00:08:48.635 --> 00:08:50.975
all your projects
within your account.

00:08:50.975 --> 00:08:54.125
But if you add a site
plan to a project,

00:08:54.125 --> 00:08:56.360
only that project will be able

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.045
to use these
additional features.

00:08:59.045 --> 00:09:00.860
Keep in mind that if
you want to connect

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.855
the custom domain
to your project,

00:09:02.855 --> 00:09:05.885
you need to add a site
plan to your project,

00:09:05.885 --> 00:09:09.200
are right, but how can we add
a site plan to our project?

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.205
It's so simple.

00:09:10.205 --> 00:09:13.204
If you head over to the project
settings of your project,

00:09:13.204 --> 00:09:15.650
you can see that we
have this hosting tab.

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:17.300
Under this hosting tab,

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.400
we have different
site plans. Here.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.650
As you can see, we
have basic CMS,

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:23.720
business and enterprise,
and you can see

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.285
all the available
options for each plan.

00:09:26.285 --> 00:09:29.645
You can simply add one of
these plants to your account.

00:09:29.645 --> 00:09:32.450
Make sure to check the billing
type here because you have

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:36.290
the annual or monthly billing
options are right guys.

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:37.655
That's all for this video.

00:09:37.655 --> 00:09:41.700
I hope you enjoyed it and
I'll see you in the next one.
