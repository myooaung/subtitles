00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.450
Hey, in this video,

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.005
we're going to start creating
our project page together.

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:11.670
This page, as I
mentioned before,

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.500
is gonna be a dynamic page.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.425
Therefore, its content is
going to be dynamic as well.

00:00:16.425 --> 00:00:18.645
So how can we work
with dynamic pages?

00:00:18.645 --> 00:00:20.580
Well, in the same
way that we work

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.830
with static pages,
nothing changes.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.005
The only difference here is that

00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:27.585
this page is going
to be a template for

00:00:27.585 --> 00:00:29.970
our project page and
its content could be

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.910
changed according to
our collections items.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.620
Alright, so first of all,

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.335
I'm going to go to Webflow
and here is our homepage.

00:00:37.335 --> 00:00:39.180
If I go to these pages

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.220
here under the CMS
collection pages,

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.030
as you can see, these projects

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.790
template had been created
by Webflow for us.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.755
Okay, So I'm going
to click on that.

00:00:48.755 --> 00:00:50.360
What do we need for this page?

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.075
As you can see, we need
the nav bar at the top.

00:00:53.075 --> 00:00:56.795
At the bottom, we need the
CTA section and the footer.

00:00:56.795 --> 00:00:59.810
So we already created
these sections.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.540
Should we go ahead and
copy and paste them here?

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.890
Well, we can do that,

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.330
but it's not a good way.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.655
Do you remember when we
talked about symbols,

00:01:07.655 --> 00:01:09.470
I mentioned that
it could be very

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.360
beneficial if you could create

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.280
a symbol and reuse that

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.100
symbol again and again
and again and later.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.695
If you want to make some
changes to your symbols,

00:01:18.695 --> 00:01:20.930
you make them once
and it will affect

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.430
all the instances of that
particular symbol instantly.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.785
So this is exactly
what we're gonna do.

00:01:27.785 --> 00:01:28.235
Now.

00:01:28.235 --> 00:01:32.090
We're gonna go ahead and create
a symbol for our navbar,

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.615
for our CTA section
and for our footer.

00:01:35.615 --> 00:01:37.250
So let me go to workflow.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.435
But before doing that,

00:01:38.435 --> 00:01:39.710
let me show you something.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.325
Can you see the background's
color is exactly the same as

00:01:43.325 --> 00:01:46.985
our backgrounds color here on
our homepage. Why is that?

00:01:46.985 --> 00:01:48.980
We didn't change the
background color

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.200
of this projects template.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.640
Do you remember when we change

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.950
the background
color of the body,

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.155
all pages tag in our homepage.

00:01:57.155 --> 00:02:00.800
That's why here we also get
the background's color.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.350
In fact, if I create
even more pages,

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.605
all those pages will have the
same backgrounds calendar,

00:02:06.605 --> 00:02:08.465
and that's exactly what we want.

00:02:08.465 --> 00:02:09.800
Of course, you can go ahead and

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.465
override that if you want.

00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:14.420
But in this case,
it's totally fine.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.540
Now I'm going to go
to my homepage and

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.525
from here I'm going to
select my navbar fairs.

00:02:20.525 --> 00:02:23.585
Okay, so do you remember how
we could create a symbol?

00:02:23.585 --> 00:02:24.530
Yes, you're right.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.105
We had two different options.

00:02:26.105 --> 00:02:28.115
We could either
right-click on it and

00:02:28.115 --> 00:02:30.215
hit Create Symbol button here.

00:02:30.215 --> 00:02:33.200
Or we could go to the
symbols right here

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.445
and just hit Create New
Symbol button right here.

00:02:36.445 --> 00:02:38.240
I'm going to hit this button and

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.790
I'm going to name it nav bar.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.000
There we go. Our
symbol is ready.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.400
Now we're inside
the master symbol.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.799
I'm going to click on
this back to instance.

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:51.199
Let me head over to
the CTA section.

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:53.555
I'm going to select
this section as well.

00:02:53.555 --> 00:02:55.160
I'm gonna do the same thing.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.530
Let me create a symbol
and I'm going to

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.535
name it CTA section.

00:03:01.535 --> 00:03:06.275
Our right, our CTAs section's
symbol is ready as well.

00:03:06.275 --> 00:03:08.030
Finally, I'm going to select

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.720
my footer and let me do
the same thing here.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.765
I'm going to create a
symbol and let me name it.

00:03:14.765 --> 00:03:16.969
Filter are right,
we successfully

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:19.355
created three different symbols,

00:03:19.355 --> 00:03:22.400
but now it's time to go
ahead and reuse them.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.560
So let me go to pages and I'm

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.630
gonna go to projects
template here.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.810
And then I'm going to go
to the Symbol section.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.850
And from here, I can simply drag

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.130
and drop them into my Canvas.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.825
There is an alternative as well.

00:03:35.825 --> 00:03:37.460
You can also use the Quick

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.740
find in order to
find your symbols.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.920
Let me show you how if
I select this body and

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.009
if I hit Command key or
Control key on my keyboard,

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:47.480
I can look for footer,

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.635
and as you can see here,

00:03:48.635 --> 00:03:50.690
it found our footer symbol.

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.385
If I look for navbar,

00:03:52.385 --> 00:03:54.095
there we go, navbar symbol.

00:03:54.095 --> 00:03:55.460
I can just click on that.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.665
And there it is. Our
nav bar is here.

00:03:57.665 --> 00:03:59.300
But what about other sections?

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.835
Well, we're gonna do the
same thing here. This time.

00:04:01.835 --> 00:04:03.290
I'm going to show
you how you can drag

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.940
and drop them into your canvas.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.775
So I'm gonna go to
the Symbol section.

00:04:07.775 --> 00:04:10.280
And from here I'm
going to drag and drop

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.650
the CTA section
into my Canvas and

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.155
put it right below the nav bar.

00:04:15.155 --> 00:04:15.980
There we go.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.185
Our CTA section
is ready as well.

00:04:18.185 --> 00:04:19.595
And last but not least,

00:04:19.595 --> 00:04:22.265
let me go ahead and drag
and drop this footer.

00:04:22.265 --> 00:04:25.085
I'm going to put it right
below my CTA section.

00:04:25.085 --> 00:04:26.780
Our right our navbar is ready,

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.370
our CTA section is ready,

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.670
and also the footer has
been added successfully.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.880
So the first part of this
page has been created.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.260
As you can see here,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.655
we had the Navbar,

00:04:37.655 --> 00:04:39.935
the CTA section, and the footer.

00:04:39.935 --> 00:04:41.450
But now it's time
to go ahead and

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.190
create this project section.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.710
But we're gonna do that
in our next lesson.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.200
Alright guys, that's
all for this video.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.445
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:04:49.445 --> 00:04:52.050
I'll see you in the next one.
