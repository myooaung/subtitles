00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.344
Pricing plays an important
role in any kind of business.

00:00:09.344 --> 00:00:11.400
And you, as a freelancer,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.780
should know how to price

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.300
your work to succeed
in this business.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.010
Many of you expect me to give

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.735
you a magical number right now.

00:00:18.735 --> 00:00:22.035
But there is no magical number
when it comes to pricing.

00:00:22.035 --> 00:00:24.930
There is no standard
formula that gives you

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.520
the exact price point you

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.500
should choose for your services.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.210
So how can you decide

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.320
how much you should
charge your clients?

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.655
Especially when
you're just starting.

00:00:34.655 --> 00:00:37.490
Well, there are many factors
that you should take into

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.430
consideration when
it comes to pricing.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.730
First, let's talk about
the pricing models.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.580
There are generally
three pricing models

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.810
that you can choose from.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.070
Hourly rate, flat rate,
and recurring rate.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.155
Let's start with
the hourly rate.

00:00:54.155 --> 00:00:57.290
If you charged $60 an
hour and the project

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.670
takes 60 h, you charge $3,600.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.030
This model is pretty
straightforward because the client

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.570
can easily understand how
much time each step takes.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.385
But there is a downside to that.

00:01:10.385 --> 00:01:11.540
You need to keep track of

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.340
the hours you spend
on the project.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.770
Because sometimes the
client might change

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.600
the project scope and it may

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.910
take much longer to deliver it.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.070
Now let's talk about flat rate.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.785
It's an effective way of
charging your client.

00:01:24.785 --> 00:01:25.415
Why?

00:01:25.415 --> 00:01:28.220
Because you set the
expectations once and

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.130
you charge a fixed
price for that project.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.040
Let's suppose you
charge for $1,000 for

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.250
a project that takes
you 6 h to build.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.635
It's a 66 dollar hourly rate.

00:01:39.635 --> 00:01:40.835
But here's the point.

00:01:40.835 --> 00:01:42.785
When you choose
this pricing model.

00:01:42.785 --> 00:01:45.410
You need to keep in mind that
you still need to charge

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.390
a fixed price no matter how

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.625
long it takes to
complete the project.

00:01:49.625 --> 00:01:53.465
So if it takes you
80 h instead of 60,

00:01:53.465 --> 00:01:55.550
it's a 50 dollar hourly rate.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.530
On the other hand,
if you manage to

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.155
complete the project in 50 h,

00:02:00.155 --> 00:02:02.450
it's an 80 dollar hourly rate.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.630
The last pricing model
is the recurring rate.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.055
It works like this.

00:02:07.055 --> 00:02:08.780
You charge the client a fixed

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.715
amount for a period of time,

00:02:10.715 --> 00:02:14.600
let's say $600 monthly
for 12 months.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.165
It has some advantages
and disadvantages.

00:02:17.165 --> 00:02:19.145
When you charge the
clients monthly,

00:02:19.145 --> 00:02:21.889
they don't need to pay
the whole price upfront.

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:23.930
Additionally, you
may provide them

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.105
with a recurring
support service,

00:02:26.105 --> 00:02:27.275
but here's the catch.

00:02:27.275 --> 00:02:29.105
When you choose to
charge the clients

00:02:29.105 --> 00:02:31.265
over a long period of time,

00:02:31.265 --> 00:02:32.990
you need to clearly define

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.925
what you are going to
provide them with.

00:02:34.925 --> 00:02:38.030
Because otherwise, they
may expect you to do lots

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.405
of work since you're charging
them over and over again,

00:02:41.405 --> 00:02:43.940
if you're looking for a
steady source of income,

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.785
it would be a good
choice for you.

00:02:45.785 --> 00:02:47.510
But I personally don't

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.280
use this revenue
model because there

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.730
are so many different variables
that are hard to manage.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.175
Now let's talk about
the price itself.

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:57.230
The price you set for your work

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.495
depends on the
value you provide.

00:02:59.495 --> 00:03:02.870
Remember, there is a correlation
between price and value,

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.630
and you should always
price your work based

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.675
on the value you provide
to the client's business.

00:03:08.675 --> 00:03:11.090
There is always a
market value for

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.495
everything from gold to
real estate to cars.

00:03:14.495 --> 00:03:16.055
But you need to understand that

00:03:16.055 --> 00:03:18.095
you define your own value.

00:03:18.095 --> 00:03:20.345
If you price your work very low,

00:03:20.345 --> 00:03:23.135
you automatically
diminish your own value.

00:03:23.135 --> 00:03:25.340
On the other hand, if
you price your work,

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.290
you're very unreasonably high.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.660
You will be out of this
business because you can

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.435
hardly find someone who
agrees on your value.

00:03:32.435 --> 00:03:34.820
But anyway, that's the
decision that you should

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.235
make and you should
set your own value.

00:03:37.235 --> 00:03:39.935
Of course, when you value
your work very high,

00:03:39.935 --> 00:03:42.770
you should deliver a
top-notch project as well.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.960
Sometimes a client
approaches you

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.150
and asks you to do
something for free.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.340
And they say that you
can add this project to

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.760
your portfolio and it's good
for your future career.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.140
Let me tell you something.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.170
Never, ever do a project
for free because

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.910
your work has value and

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.010
no one should
undervalue your work.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.005
So even when you're
just starting out,

00:04:03.005 --> 00:04:04.805
don't do free projects.

00:04:04.805 --> 00:04:07.070
You can start with a
lower price point,

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.615
but not totally free.

00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:11.104
If you go to different
freelance websites,

00:04:11.104 --> 00:04:13.940
you can easily find the
average price point for

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.645
the services you offer and
set prices accordingly.

00:04:17.645 --> 00:04:20.870
You can also adjust them
based on your experience and

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.700
the value you provide when you

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.920
set your numbers, stick to them.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.165
If a client says,

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:27.890
I found someone else that does

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.885
the same thing for
a lower price,

00:04:29.885 --> 00:04:31.610
you could politely reply.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.260
I understand, But based on

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.825
the value I provide to
you and your business,

00:04:35.825 --> 00:04:37.805
I think my price is reasonable.

00:04:37.805 --> 00:04:41.135
So which pricing model
do I suggest you use?

00:04:41.135 --> 00:04:44.165
I personally prefer the
flat rate revenue model.

00:04:44.165 --> 00:04:44.840
Why?

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.540
Because as you become more
and more confidence and you

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.584
gain experience in web
design and web development,

00:04:50.584 --> 00:04:53.059
you can complete the
projects faster.

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:56.000
Therefore, it would be more
beneficial to you to use

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.130
the flat rate revenue
model because

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.530
you don't charge
per hour this way,

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.705
your hourly rate will increase

00:05:02.705 --> 00:05:05.360
as you manage to complete
projects faster.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.135
Remember, when you
complete a project faster,

00:05:08.135 --> 00:05:10.880
it doesn't mean you should
undervalue your work.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.000
The reason you're able to
complete projects faster is

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.230
the fact that you are more

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.945
experienced and
you practice more.

00:05:17.945 --> 00:05:19.624
Let me give you an example.

00:05:19.624 --> 00:05:22.880
Let's suppose a web developer
can develop a website and

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.125
60 h and his or her
hourly rate is $50.

00:05:27.125 --> 00:05:29.000
We call him or her developer

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.310
one another developer
can develop

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.010
the same website in 30 h and

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.085
he or she charges $100 per hour.

00:05:37.085 --> 00:05:38.600
We call him or her developer

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.855
to which one is more
beneficial to the client?

00:05:41.855 --> 00:05:43.130
Yes, you are right.

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.070
Developer to because
he or she charges

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.400
the same amount of money
as the developer one does,

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.219
but delivers the
project much faster.

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:54.680
The second developer
could charge even more

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.470
like $200 per hour and still be

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.915
beneficial to the clients
because he or she

00:05:59.915 --> 00:06:02.885
delivers the project faster
than the first developer.

00:06:02.885 --> 00:06:04.280
Remember, you can modify

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.380
your price points
whenever you want.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.060
So for instance,
if you have done

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.410
some projects and feel you

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.315
didn't charge the
clients enough,

00:06:11.315 --> 00:06:14.930
you can increase your prices
for your future projects.

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.865
There is no limit
in this regard,

00:06:16.865 --> 00:06:18.380
but always keep track of

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.170
your price points and
the changes you make in

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.330
order to come up with
the best price for

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.970
your services in the
future, are right guys.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.805
That's all about revenue
models and pricing.

00:06:28.805 --> 00:06:33.330
I hope you enjoyed it and I'll
see you in the next video.
