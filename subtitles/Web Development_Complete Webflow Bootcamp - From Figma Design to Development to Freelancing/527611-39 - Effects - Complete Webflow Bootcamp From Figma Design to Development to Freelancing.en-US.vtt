00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.270
In this video,
we're going to talk

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.024
about the effects section.

00:00:08.024 --> 00:00:11.205
If I just scroll down
here in the style panel,

00:00:11.205 --> 00:00:12.750
we can see that at the bottom we

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.475
have the Effects section.

00:00:14.475 --> 00:00:16.545
There are so many
different options here,

00:00:16.545 --> 00:00:18.915
and we're going to talk
about each of them.

00:00:18.915 --> 00:00:21.435
So first, I'm gonna go ahead

00:00:21.435 --> 00:00:23.820
and select one of these images.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:24.420
Okay?

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.670
Let me select this block.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.770
The image div blocks
the first one.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.110
And now I can actually modify
different options here.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.875
Let me start with opacity.

00:00:33.875 --> 00:00:36.260
The opacity is so
simple because it

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.750
just lets us have transparency.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:39.845
If I decrease it,

00:00:39.845 --> 00:00:41.825
my element will be transparent.

00:00:41.825 --> 00:00:43.445
If I increase it,

00:00:43.445 --> 00:00:46.295
you can see that there
is no transparency.

00:00:46.295 --> 00:00:48.020
So when you have an element and

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.984
your element has some children,

00:00:49.984 --> 00:00:53.030
you can simply select
your parent element.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.745
In this case, it's
this image live blog,

00:00:55.745 --> 00:00:58.715
and just adjust
the opacity here.

00:00:58.715 --> 00:01:00.575
Then we have box shadows.

00:01:00.575 --> 00:01:03.215
Well, as you can
guess from its name,

00:01:03.215 --> 00:01:07.805
it lets us add some shadows
to our box elements.

00:01:07.805 --> 00:01:10.415
So if I hit this plus button,

00:01:10.415 --> 00:01:14.225
I can add some shadows to
this particular element.

00:01:14.225 --> 00:01:16.295
And here we have
different properties.

00:01:16.295 --> 00:01:17.960
We have two different types of

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.239
shadow, outside and inside.

00:01:20.239 --> 00:01:22.145
Well, if it's set to outside,

00:01:22.145 --> 00:01:23.435
the shadow will appear

00:01:23.435 --> 00:01:26.570
outside the boundary
of this element.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.795
If I just modify the distance,
you can see it better.

00:01:29.795 --> 00:01:33.409
But the insight type lets
us add inner shadows.

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.245
I can modify the angle
here, just like that.

00:01:36.245 --> 00:01:37.820
I can control the degree or

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.785
let's say the direction
of my shadow.

00:01:39.785 --> 00:01:41.660
I can modify the distance,

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.135
how close these shadows
to the element.

00:01:44.135 --> 00:01:45.710
I can modify the Blair,

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.750
so it determines how

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.334
focused the shadows I
can change the size.

00:01:51.334 --> 00:01:55.295
It determines how much
it spreads like this,

00:01:55.295 --> 00:01:57.080
and the color actually lets us

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.960
control the color of our shadow.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.870
I can set it to
whatever color I want.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.940
Most of the time
when we use shadows,

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.530
we want to make sure to decrease

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.560
the opacity to have
some soft shadows,

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.210
okay, just like that.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.165
So this is all about shadows.

00:02:14.165 --> 00:02:16.700
One thing you should
remember is that you can

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.295
actually add multiple
shadows to your elements.

00:02:19.295 --> 00:02:21.275
If I click on this plus button,

00:02:21.275 --> 00:02:22.775
once again, There we go,

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:24.665
I could add another shadow.

00:02:24.665 --> 00:02:27.155
I can add even more shadows.

00:02:27.155 --> 00:02:31.700
I can move them around and
I can hide and unhide them,

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.815
and I can remove them simply.

00:02:33.815 --> 00:02:37.940
Alright, now let's talk
about 2D and 3D transforms.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.145
Well, sometimes we might need to

00:02:40.145 --> 00:02:42.470
have some simple interactions,

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.455
some 2D and 3D transformations.

00:02:45.455 --> 00:02:46.730
And in that case,

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.860
we need to use this option.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.830
We can also use the
interactions which is more

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.385
advanced and we will talk
about it later in detail.

00:02:55.385 --> 00:02:57.980
But for now, let me
show you how it works.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.110
While my element is selected,

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.450
I can hit this plus
button and we have

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.970
different types of
transformation.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.570
We have move, scale,
rotate, and skew.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:09.920
Let me start with move.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.080
Well, then move type lets us

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.050
move our elements and
we can control the x,

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.850
y, and z axis.

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.835
Just like that. If I
change the type to scale,

00:03:19.835 --> 00:03:22.280
I can scale this
element like this.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.930
If I change it to rotate,

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.715
I can rotate it like that
using different axes.

00:03:28.715 --> 00:03:30.155
There we go.

00:03:30.155 --> 00:03:32.225
And if I set it to skew,

00:03:32.225 --> 00:03:33.904
Let's see what happens.

00:03:33.904 --> 00:03:35.735
Depending on our needs.

00:03:35.735 --> 00:03:40.325
We may or may not use every
single one of these types,

00:03:40.325 --> 00:03:42.080
but it's good to know that they

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.470
exist and the possibilities
are limitless here.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.060
Now I'm going to show
you something else.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.910
Let me remove this 2D
and 3D transforms.

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.335
I'm going to just create

00:03:51.335 --> 00:03:52.940
a new transform layer

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.815
and I'm going to move
it around, okay?

00:03:54.815 --> 00:03:56.570
But what if I want to move

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.495
my element and scale
it at the same time?

00:03:59.495 --> 00:04:02.585
If I go to scale now
and I come back,

00:04:02.585 --> 00:04:04.730
you can see that
everything is lost here.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.970
All the modifications
that I did here are gone

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.720
because we can't use all
the types at the same time.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.930
We need to actually
move our elements.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.095
Then we need to
create another layer.

00:04:18.095 --> 00:04:21.425
Just like that. Now, I
can scale it as well.

00:04:21.425 --> 00:04:23.930
So you need to keep this in mind

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.780
when working with 2D
and 3D transforms.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.000
Then we have transitions.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.785
If I click on this plus button,

00:04:30.785 --> 00:04:32.840
you can see that we
have different types

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.310
of transitions and

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.600
we're not going to talk about

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.925
transitions now because first,

00:04:37.925 --> 00:04:39.664
you need to learn about states,

00:04:39.664 --> 00:04:42.215
which is the topic
of our next lesson.

00:04:42.215 --> 00:04:43.385
In the next lesson,

00:04:43.385 --> 00:04:45.905
we will touch upon
transitions as well.

00:04:45.905 --> 00:04:47.930
Alright, let me
remove transitions.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.165
Now I'm going to
talk about filters.

00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:52.205
Why in this element is selected,

00:04:52.205 --> 00:04:54.515
I'm going to add a
filter to this element.

00:04:54.515 --> 00:04:56.750
And here we have
different filters.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:57.905
We have clearer.

00:04:57.905 --> 00:05:00.845
We can make this element blurry.

00:05:00.845 --> 00:05:02.225
Just like that.

00:05:02.225 --> 00:05:05.525
We have color adjustment
filters like brightness.

00:05:05.525 --> 00:05:08.120
You can control the
brightness of your element.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.325
You can modify the contrast,

00:05:10.325 --> 00:05:14.225
the hue, saturation, e.g.

00:05:14.225 --> 00:05:15.890
you can decrease or increase

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.630
the saturation of your element.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.160
We have grayscale.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.320
If we want black
and white images

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.850
or black and white elements,

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.510
we can use this filter and
other effects are right.

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:27.590
Now let's move on to

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.510
the last property of

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.865
the effects section,
which is cursor.

00:05:31.865 --> 00:05:33.680
Well, every element by default

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.590
has a specific cursor, e.g.

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.350
when I add a button,
let me show you.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.500
When I go ahead and
add a button here,

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.865
and I preview that.

00:05:43.865 --> 00:05:45.275
If I hover over,

00:05:45.275 --> 00:05:47.840
you can see that the
cursor change to

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.350
this pointer and it's expected
because this is clickable.

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.995
And the same thing happens
if I add a link blog.

00:05:54.995 --> 00:05:58.175
So if I just go ahead and
add a link blog here,

00:05:58.175 --> 00:06:00.260
of course I need
to add something

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.545
inside or let me just
change its color,

00:06:03.545 --> 00:06:06.215
background color to something
that you could see.

00:06:06.215 --> 00:06:08.990
And also I need to
specify the width and

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.795
height because otherwise
It's invisible.

00:06:11.795 --> 00:06:13.550
So let me specify the width

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.464
50 pixels and the
height 100 pixels.

00:06:17.464 --> 00:06:20.540
And now let's check
it out again.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.910
We've got a pointer, e.g.

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.760
the text has its own cursor.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.610
These cursors are
the default Cursors

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.605
of our browser, okay?

00:06:30.605 --> 00:06:34.070
But sometimes for some
specific purposes,

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:37.639
we might need to override
these properties.

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:38.105
Okay?

00:06:38.105 --> 00:06:41.465
So e.g. if I want to change
the cursor of this button,

00:06:41.465 --> 00:06:42.905
I can select that.

00:06:42.905 --> 00:06:46.370
Here. If I open up
this drop menu,

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.335
by default, it's set to auto.

00:06:48.335 --> 00:06:49.970
And most of the
time it's better to

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:51.890
use the auto option because

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:53.210
this way the browser

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.895
determines which care
sir It should use.

00:06:55.895 --> 00:06:58.280
However, if you want
to intentionally

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.115
override these preferences,
we can do that.

00:07:01.115 --> 00:07:03.905
So e.g. let me change
it to something else.

00:07:03.905 --> 00:07:07.580
I'm going to choose this graph
and let's see if it works.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.095
Yes, it does.

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:11.870
So this is how the cursor works.

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:12.935
Most of the time.

00:07:12.935 --> 00:07:15.380
We don't need to
change it unless we

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:18.170
have to change it for
specific reasons.

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:19.145
Are right, guys.

00:07:19.145 --> 00:07:21.095
That's all for this video.

00:07:21.095 --> 00:07:22.490
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.500
I'll see you in the next video.
