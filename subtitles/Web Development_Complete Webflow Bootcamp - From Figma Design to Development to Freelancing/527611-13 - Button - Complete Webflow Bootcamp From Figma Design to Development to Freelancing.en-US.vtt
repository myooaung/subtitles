00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.545
Almost all websites use buttons.

00:00:07.545 --> 00:00:11.070
Buttons are so important when
it comes to web design and

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.255
web development because they
let users take actions.

00:00:15.255 --> 00:00:18.045
They are generally used
for our call to action.

00:00:18.045 --> 00:00:20.235
If you go to the Add section,

00:00:20.235 --> 00:00:24.025
we can see that we have the
button under the basic.

00:00:24.025 --> 00:00:27.665
Actually, a button is
nothing but a link block.

00:00:27.665 --> 00:00:31.670
It's just a clickable box
with a text block inside.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.640
If I drag and drop this
button into my card,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.940
you can see that it has
some default stylings

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.405
and I can give it a
URL just like a link.

00:00:41.405 --> 00:00:43.310
Like we have all these settings

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.110
that we already discussed.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.485
But for now, let's go
ahead and preview that.

00:00:48.485 --> 00:00:51.395
As you can see, the
cursor has been changed

00:00:51.395 --> 00:00:54.440
because it is indeed
a link block.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.405
We can modify all the properties

00:00:56.405 --> 00:00:59.089
of this Watson elements, e.g.

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:03.350
we can modify its color
here in the style panel.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.655
If you double-click on that,

00:01:04.655 --> 00:01:06.350
you can modify the text.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.530
Let's write signing,
Just like that.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.570
But sometimes we might need to

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.630
create a custom button, e.g.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.245
if we want to add an
icon to this button,

00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:20.360
we can't use the
button elements.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.025
We need to use a link block,

00:01:22.025 --> 00:01:24.290
and then we need to
add a text block

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.705
inside and also an image.

00:01:26.705 --> 00:01:29.300
Okay, so this is
how you can create

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.615
a custom button and we
will talk about it later.

00:01:32.615 --> 00:01:35.825
The button element
has different states.

00:01:35.825 --> 00:01:38.660
We will talk about
states in detail,

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.505
but for now you just
need to know that

00:01:40.505 --> 00:01:43.085
each button has some states.

00:01:43.085 --> 00:01:45.470
It has none hover,

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.155
pressed, focused and visited.

00:01:48.155 --> 00:01:50.600
So if you head over to
the selectors section,

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.765
here is where we
specify our classes,

00:01:53.765 --> 00:01:56.645
our CSS classes that we
will talk about later.

00:01:56.645 --> 00:01:59.750
And if you click on
this down arrow,

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.945
you can see all the
states of your button.

00:02:02.945 --> 00:02:04.714
If I go to the hover,

00:02:04.714 --> 00:02:08.225
I can modify the styling
simply, just like that.

00:02:08.225 --> 00:02:11.240
And now if I go to the
non-state and preview

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.385
this button and I hover over.

00:02:13.385 --> 00:02:17.120
You can see that the hover
state has a different styling.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.345
When we dive into the
styling and CSS properties,

00:02:20.345 --> 00:02:23.850
we will talk about
all these details.
