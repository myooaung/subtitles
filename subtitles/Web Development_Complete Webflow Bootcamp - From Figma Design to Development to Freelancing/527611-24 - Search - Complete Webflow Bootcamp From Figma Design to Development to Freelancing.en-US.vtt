00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.050
If you want to add the
search functionality

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.204
to your website,

00:00:08.204 --> 00:00:10.620
you can use the search element,

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.570
actually this search component

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.255
here under the
components section.

00:00:15.255 --> 00:00:17.580
This is a very
powerful component

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.780
because you don't need to worry

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.565
about indexing your pages

00:00:20.565 --> 00:00:22.650
and prepare your search results.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.270
What you need to do is

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.375
just drag and drop
it into your Canvas.

00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:30.255
I'm going to put it
inside my section,

00:00:30.255 --> 00:00:31.710
as you can see here.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.670
Let me add a container here
that you could see it easily.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.520
I'm going to put it
inside my container.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.315
Alright, now it looks better.

00:00:40.315 --> 00:00:42.845
And also I am going
to modify the color

00:00:42.845 --> 00:00:46.145
of the search word to white.

00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:48.095
Alright, now it's quite visible.

00:00:48.095 --> 00:00:49.715
So this is just a text field,

00:00:49.715 --> 00:00:51.035
and if you double-click on it,

00:00:51.035 --> 00:00:53.450
you can find this
place holder property

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.934
here that you can modify,

00:00:54.934 --> 00:00:58.850
you can enable or disable
the autofocus as well.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.680
That's totally up to you.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.365
One thing to mention
is that when you

00:01:03.365 --> 00:01:06.365
add a search element
to your Canvas,

00:01:06.365 --> 00:01:09.485
a new page, a new utility page,

00:01:09.485 --> 00:01:11.630
is created
automatically for you.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.630
So if you go to the pages here,

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.465
you can see that
under utility pages,

00:01:17.465 --> 00:01:20.180
we have this new
search results page.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.220
If I click on that, there we go.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.235
You can see that we've got
some sample results here.

00:01:25.235 --> 00:01:30.020
Okay, So let me modify the
color of these texts as well,

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.515
wide and this one
to white as well.

00:01:33.515 --> 00:01:34.685
Okay, Cool.

00:01:34.685 --> 00:01:37.550
So this is basically
what the user sees.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.275
You can easily style it,

00:01:39.275 --> 00:01:41.570
but you need to understand
that it doesn't work

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.925
for all websites and all plants.

00:01:43.925 --> 00:01:44.540
Why?

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.365
If you go to the settings
here and you go to search,

00:01:48.365 --> 00:01:50.000
you can see that it says,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.524
once you've set up CMS
or business hosting,

00:01:53.524 --> 00:01:56.570
web flow automatically
indexes the content of

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.885
your Published site to create
an up-to-date search index.

00:01:59.885 --> 00:02:03.065
So without the CMS
or business hosting,

00:02:03.065 --> 00:02:06.260
you cannot use this search
functionality if you want to

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.880
work on a client project and

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.860
they need this search
functionality,

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.570
you need to make sure to add

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.000
either the CMS hosting

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.745
or the business hosting
to your project.

00:02:16.745 --> 00:02:18.920
We will talk about
these plans later.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.300
But for now you
just need to know

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.595
that this functionality exists.

00:02:22.595 --> 00:02:26.070
And if you need a search
bar, you can use that.
