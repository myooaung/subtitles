00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.645
If you're gonna be
live website that has

00:00:06.645 --> 00:00:10.800
a contact us page or even
a newsletter section.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.200
For sure, you need
to use forums.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.030
Well, a form can have

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.925
different elements
like label, inputs,

00:00:17.925 --> 00:00:23.565
takes area, checkboxes, radio
buttons, form button, etc.

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:28.000
If you head over to the forums
section on the ad panel,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.870
you can see that we
have different elements

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:31.940
here we have formed
block that groups

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.095
different form elements like
label, inputs, form button.

00:00:36.095 --> 00:00:40.400
We have label, which is
just a simple text block.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.430
We have input, It's a TextField.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.170
We have the text area for

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.810
long sentences and long content.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.595
We have checkboxes, we have
radio buttons for selections.

00:00:52.595 --> 00:00:54.185
We have the select element.

00:00:54.185 --> 00:00:55.400
If you want to let the

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.220
user select from
different options.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.850
We have recapture and we
have the form button.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.505
We also have the file
upload element here,

00:01:04.505 --> 00:01:06.815
but it's only
available when you add

00:01:06.815 --> 00:01:09.440
a site plan to your website.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.065
Alright, when we want
to create a form,

00:01:12.065 --> 00:01:14.255
first, we need a forum block.

00:01:14.255 --> 00:01:15.485
As I mentioned before,

00:01:15.485 --> 00:01:19.595
it gathers together all
these form elements,

00:01:19.595 --> 00:01:20.810
the necessary ones.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.030
So I'm going to drag
and drop it into

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.580
my container on the canvas.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.660
There we go.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.235
As you can see, this form block

00:01:28.235 --> 00:01:30.155
already has some elements,

00:01:30.155 --> 00:01:33.515
like two labels to text
fields and one button.

00:01:33.515 --> 00:01:36.995
You can see the texts layers
because of its color.

00:01:36.995 --> 00:01:38.884
I'm gonna go ahead and modify

00:01:38.884 --> 00:01:41.165
the color in this tiling here.

00:01:41.165 --> 00:01:42.770
Right now it's better.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.165
So when you drag and drop
a form into your Canvas,

00:01:47.165 --> 00:01:49.415
the forum settings pops up.

00:01:49.415 --> 00:01:51.920
A foreign block, has
different properties,

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.615
it has different states,

00:01:53.615 --> 00:01:55.460
and it has a form name.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.285
So here let me show you different
states of a form block.

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:00.410
When we work with forums,

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.340
we have the normal
success and error states.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.065
So what's the difference
between them?

00:02:06.065 --> 00:02:09.470
The normal state is the one
that you are looking at.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.100
It's just a normal for
the success state,

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.665
actually shows a
message to the user.

00:02:15.665 --> 00:02:18.740
Once the form has been
submitted successfully,

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.414
we can easily customize
each of these states.

00:02:22.414 --> 00:02:24.200
And the error stage shows

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.800
an error to the user when
something goes wrong.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.470
For now, you can see the
texts because we already

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.050
change the styling of
these texts layers.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.750
But if I select this text block,

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.725
I can go ahead and modify
the color to black.

00:02:39.725 --> 00:02:42.230
Now you can see it
better when you want to

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.170
design different
states of your form,

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.180
you need to make sure to first

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.075
select your foreign
block in the navigator,

00:02:50.075 --> 00:02:51.575
not the form elements.

00:02:51.575 --> 00:02:53.345
First select your form block

00:02:53.345 --> 00:02:55.475
and then you can
double-click somewhere.

00:02:55.475 --> 00:02:58.790
Or you can just select
your form luck and

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.180
click on this settings
icon, just like that.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.830
Now let's talk about
the form name.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.060
Well, you might need to use

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.820
different forms on your
website and it's important to

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.800
name them properly because later

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.125
when we receive
form submissions,

00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:14.390
we can easily
recognize that which

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.465
information is associated
with which form.

00:03:17.465 --> 00:03:21.020
So I'm going to name
this form demo.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.555
Okay, I'm gonna go to normal.

00:03:23.555 --> 00:03:25.790
And these elements have

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.135
some styling by default
that we can override.

00:03:29.135 --> 00:03:31.250
We're not going to talk
about styling now,

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.010
but I'm going to show you
that this is a text field,

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.715
and a TextField has some
properties as well.

00:03:37.715 --> 00:03:39.305
If I select the text field,

00:03:39.305 --> 00:03:40.670
if I double-click on it,

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.955
you can see that the
input settings pops up.

00:03:43.955 --> 00:03:47.345
Each TextField has different
settings like name,

00:03:47.345 --> 00:03:49.880
placeholder, text type, and here

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.595
we have the require
than autofocus options.

00:03:52.595 --> 00:03:56.195
You can easily name
these text fields, e.g.

00:03:56.195 --> 00:04:00.994
if this TextField is associated
with this name label,

00:04:00.994 --> 00:04:03.215
you can simply call it name.

00:04:03.215 --> 00:04:06.395
If it's going to be surname,

00:04:06.395 --> 00:04:11.435
you can simply name
it surname. Here.

00:04:11.435 --> 00:04:13.895
We have the placeholder as well.

00:04:13.895 --> 00:04:15.950
So if I want to present

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.025
a placeholder right
on the text field,

00:04:19.025 --> 00:04:20.690
I can write it here.

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.910
Let's write enter your surname.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.335
Just like that.

00:04:27.335 --> 00:04:29.390
We have the text type as well.

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.280
By default, it's
set to plane and

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.680
it means the texts
could be anything.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.690
We could set it to e-mail,

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.520
we could set it to password,

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.309
we can set it to
phone or number.

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:41.465
Why does it matter?

00:04:41.465 --> 00:04:44.705
Because here for the
email text field

00:04:44.705 --> 00:04:47.330
that takes type is
already set to email.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:48.035
Why?

00:04:48.035 --> 00:04:50.360
Because when the user tries to

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.730
fill in these texts fields,

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.575
hit the submit button,

00:04:54.575 --> 00:04:57.290
then this TextField
checks whether

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.080
there is a valid
email address or not.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.470
E.g. if we have
something like test at,

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.855
it will give the user an error.

00:05:05.855 --> 00:05:08.600
There should be a
valid email address.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.595
It doesn't check whether
that e-mail address

00:05:10.595 --> 00:05:13.205
exists or not because
it's not possible,

00:05:13.205 --> 00:05:16.970
but it just checks the format
of that email address.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.245
The same thing happens with
password, phone, or number.

00:05:21.245 --> 00:05:23.315
Now let's talk about
these two options.

00:05:23.315 --> 00:05:25.070
We have the required option.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.214
If I check this checkbox,

00:05:27.214 --> 00:05:31.670
it means that the user has
to feel these TextField.

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:32.990
If I uncheck that,

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.895
it's an optional text field.

00:05:34.895 --> 00:05:36.725
If I check the autofocus,

00:05:36.725 --> 00:05:39.530
it means whenever
the page loads up,

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:40.970
this text field is

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.420
autofocus and the cursor
is already blinking.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.340
I'm going to set it to required,

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.130
and I'm going to
uncheck the autofocus.

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.235
And then let's select
this submit button.

00:05:52.235 --> 00:05:53.540
If I double-click on that,

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.970
I can simply modify
these properties.

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.470
There are two properties.

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.630
When it comes to form buttons,

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.985
button texts and waiting texts,

00:06:01.985 --> 00:06:05.510
I can set it to anything
like send for instance.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.055
Then the weighting text,

00:06:07.055 --> 00:06:10.250
this text appears when
the user clicks on

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.080
this button and he or she is

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.554
waiting for the form submission.

00:06:14.554 --> 00:06:19.969
So here let me modify
that to wait a moment.

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:23.135
Not the best weighting
texts, by the way, alright,

00:06:23.135 --> 00:06:25.745
now let's give it a
try to try a forum.

00:06:25.745 --> 00:06:27.170
You can not just go to

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.825
the preview mode because
it doesn't work like that.

00:06:29.825 --> 00:06:31.985
You need to first
publisher website.

00:06:31.985 --> 00:06:34.295
We didn't talk about
the publish option,

00:06:34.295 --> 00:06:35.660
but it's so simple.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.130
First, I'm going to click on

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.205
this Publish button on
the top right corner.

00:06:40.205 --> 00:06:41.810
We don't need to
change anything.

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.930
Just click on publish
to select the domains.

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:46.355
Okay, Just like that,

00:06:46.355 --> 00:06:48.350
this is a unique domain

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:50.810
created by Webflow
for our project.

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.450
And then once this
button turns green,

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:56.300
it means that our
website is published.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.890
And if I click on this button,

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:00.755
this little icon right
next to this link,

00:07:00.755 --> 00:07:02.615
I can check my website.

00:07:02.615 --> 00:07:04.265
Okay, let me zoom in.

00:07:04.265 --> 00:07:05.780
So here is our form.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.910
Let me go ahead and
check the type of

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.250
this text field
because I change it

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:12.290
to number mistakenly
it should be

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:14.839
playing since it's
just a surname.

00:07:14.839 --> 00:07:17.840
I'm going to publish
my website once again,

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.985
and I'm going to
refresh this page.

00:07:19.985 --> 00:07:20.750
There we go.

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:24.035
Now, this is a plain
text field here,

00:07:24.035 --> 00:07:25.805
let me write test.

00:07:25.805 --> 00:07:30.230
And for the email address
I'm going to write test at,

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:32.630
this is not a right
e-mail address.

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:35.600
This is not a correct format
for that e-mail address.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.810
If I hit the send button,
look what happens.

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.600
Please enter a part
following at, okay,

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.575
so this is what happens
when you choose the e-mail,

00:07:45.575 --> 00:07:50.705
takes fuel type, and then
let's write gmail.com.

00:07:50.705 --> 00:07:53.404
Now everything should
work perfectly.

00:07:53.404 --> 00:07:55.295
I'm going to hit
the send button.

00:07:55.295 --> 00:07:58.985
Wait a moment, and we will
get the success message.

00:07:58.985 --> 00:08:00.995
Of course, the
styling is not good

00:08:00.995 --> 00:08:03.350
because we already
changed the color.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.225
But you just got the idea.

00:08:05.225 --> 00:08:07.505
If something is wrong with
the Internet connection,

00:08:07.505 --> 00:08:09.110
we will get the error.

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:11.735
So let me refresh the page
and I'm just going to

00:08:11.735 --> 00:08:14.405
disconnect my internet
connection for a second.

00:08:14.405 --> 00:08:15.020
Here.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.540
Let's write test2 and I'm

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:23.750
goingtowriteanotheremailaddressheadlow@gmail.com.

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:27.770
If I hit the send button,
look what happens.

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:31.370
Oops, something went wrong
while submitting the form.

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:33.200
So this is the
difference between

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.510
different states of a four.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:37.100
Now let's see how we can get

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.380
access to the form submissions.

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.320
Well, we need to go to
the project settings.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.595
As I showed you before.

00:08:43.595 --> 00:08:47.840
If you head over to this W
icon on the top left corner,

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.385
and if you hover over it,

00:08:49.385 --> 00:08:51.515
you will see this
hamburger menu icon.

00:08:51.515 --> 00:08:52.865
I'm going to click on that.

00:08:52.865 --> 00:08:56.765
And I'm gonna go to project
settings are right from here.

00:08:56.765 --> 00:08:59.045
I'm going to go to
the forums tab.

00:08:59.045 --> 00:09:02.165
And here we have different
settings of a form.

00:09:02.165 --> 00:09:04.700
We can specify the
form name here,

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.920
we can send a form submissions

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.080
to a specific e-mail address.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.525
We can write the subject line.

00:09:11.525 --> 00:09:13.580
We can specify an
e-mail address for

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:16.565
replies and also
the email template.

00:09:16.565 --> 00:09:19.309
We will talk about
these options later.

00:09:19.309 --> 00:09:21.290
But for now, you just
need to know that if

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:23.390
you scroll down here,

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:26.255
you can find a form
submission data.

00:09:26.255 --> 00:09:27.470
And as you can see,

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:29.600
we submitted one form.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:34.805
It says surname test, e-mail
addresstest@gmail.com.

00:09:34.805 --> 00:09:36.995
You can simply delete
this submission.

00:09:36.995 --> 00:09:39.890
You can download all the
submission data using

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:44.000
this download CSV
button as a CSV file.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.610
And one thing you need
to keep in mind is that

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:49.280
there is a limit for
receiving submissions.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.680
If you don't add hosting
to your project,

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.905
you can get up to 50
submissions per month.

00:09:54.905 --> 00:09:57.980
We will dive into these
advanced settings of

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:01.595
forms later when we start
creating our projects.

00:10:01.595 --> 00:10:05.255
But this is basically
all about forums.

00:10:05.255 --> 00:10:06.980
Let's go back to the designer.

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:09.545
I'm going to hit the
designer button.

00:10:09.545 --> 00:10:13.190
I'm going to select my
form block just like that.

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:16.445
And let me check out
other elements here.

00:10:16.445 --> 00:10:20.390
So here we have a
label input text area.

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:24.260
We can simply drag and drop
any of these elements into

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.255
our form black and

00:10:26.255 --> 00:10:29.795
all these elements have
their own properties.

00:10:29.795 --> 00:10:35.030
So let me go ahead and drag
and drop a checkbox here.

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:38.090
Just like that, it has
different properties.

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:40.880
We can drag and drop a
select element here.

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.985
If I want to specify
the selection options,

00:10:43.985 --> 00:10:46.325
I can select this select field

00:10:46.325 --> 00:10:48.050
and go to the elements settings.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:51.500
From here, you can see
that we have the choices,

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.030
we have select one,

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:56.030
first choice, second
choice, third choice.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:57.815
We can simply modify them,

00:10:57.815 --> 00:10:59.525
but let's preview it.

00:10:59.525 --> 00:11:01.220
Okay, there we go.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:02.645
This is how it looks.

00:11:02.645 --> 00:11:05.779
The check bikes could be
checked and unchecked.

00:11:05.779 --> 00:11:08.810
The text area could be enlarged,

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:12.690
and everything
works as expected.
