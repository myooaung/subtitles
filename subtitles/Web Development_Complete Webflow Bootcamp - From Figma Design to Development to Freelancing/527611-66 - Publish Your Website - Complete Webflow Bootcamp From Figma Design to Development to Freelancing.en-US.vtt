00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.455
Hey, now that our
website is ready,

00:00:07.455 --> 00:00:09.465
it's time to publish
our website.

00:00:09.465 --> 00:00:11.310
But before that,
you might need to

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.205
connect your custom
domain to your projects.

00:00:14.205 --> 00:00:16.110
I already showed you
that if you head

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.415
over to this Publish
section here,

00:00:18.415 --> 00:00:20.555
if I click on this
Publish button,

00:00:20.555 --> 00:00:22.205
you can see that Webflow

00:00:22.205 --> 00:00:25.294
creates a staging domain
for your project.

00:00:25.294 --> 00:00:27.500
It's totally free and
you can go ahead and

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.425
modify this URL in
the project settings.

00:00:30.425 --> 00:00:33.485
However, if you're building
a project for a client,

00:00:33.485 --> 00:00:35.420
you don't want to use
the staging domain

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.295
because it doesn't
look professional.

00:00:37.295 --> 00:00:38.510
Therefore, you need to connect

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.490
the custom domain
to your project.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:41.555
How can you do that?

00:00:41.555 --> 00:00:43.985
Well, you can simply click
on this button here,

00:00:43.985 --> 00:00:45.530
or you can directly go to

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.890
the Project Settings and
go to the hosting tab.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.290
I'm going to click on it
and I will be taken to

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.185
the hosting tab of
the project settings.

00:00:54.185 --> 00:00:57.680
Here is where we can add a
site plan for our project.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.155
All projects on
your starter plan,

00:01:00.155 --> 00:01:01.640
complete free staging, as you

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.515
can see it's indicated here.

00:01:03.515 --> 00:01:04.610
And if you want to connect the

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.440
custom domain to your project,

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.930
you need to upgrade
to a paid site plans.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.435
So you need to add
a site plan here,

00:01:11.435 --> 00:01:13.400
you can choose between
different options,

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.785
like basic CMS business.

00:01:15.785 --> 00:01:18.005
We will talk about the
differences later,

00:01:18.005 --> 00:01:19.955
but the process looks like this.

00:01:19.955 --> 00:01:22.775
First, you will go ahead
and add a hosting plan,

00:01:22.775 --> 00:01:24.725
a site plan to your project,

00:01:24.725 --> 00:01:27.965
then the custom domain
option will be available.

00:01:27.965 --> 00:01:29.675
So if you have a domain already,

00:01:29.675 --> 00:01:32.000
you can simply write
it down here and

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.015
then you need to go ahead
and update your DNS.

00:01:35.015 --> 00:01:36.140
We're not going to dive into

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.600
the technical matters
now because connecting

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.710
a custom domain to

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.755
your project depends
on your DNS provider.

00:01:42.755 --> 00:01:45.575
If you bought your domain
from Google domain,

00:01:45.575 --> 00:01:48.095
your DNS provider
is Google domain,

00:01:48.095 --> 00:01:51.290
and each provider has
its own setup process.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.880
Therefore, it's
not possible to go

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.545
ahead and explain the process

00:01:54.545 --> 00:01:58.175
of connecting custom domain
from all domain providers.

00:01:58.175 --> 00:02:01.595
And this setup process
might change frequently.

00:02:01.595 --> 00:02:04.670
So the best way to learn
about it is to just head

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.170
over to these custom domain

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.880
section and you click on this,

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.460
learn how to set up
custom domain hosting.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.270
If you click on it, you will
be taken to another page.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.090
And here there is a very good
video that you can watch

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.860
explaining how you can connect

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.005
a custom domain to your project.

00:02:21.005 --> 00:02:22.730
You can also go ahead and read

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.620
this article because Webflow

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.275
updates these
articles frequently

00:02:27.275 --> 00:02:29.855
if they decide to
change something.

00:02:29.855 --> 00:02:31.655
It's a simple process.

00:02:31.655 --> 00:02:33.770
However, since the process looks

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.915
different for each provider,

00:02:35.915 --> 00:02:38.840
we are not going to dive
into the technical issues,

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.890
but the process is so easy
and it's not time consuming.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.395
Once you've connected
your custom domain,

00:02:45.395 --> 00:02:47.000
you can go ahead and publish

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.400
your website on
your custom domain.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.480
How can you do that?

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.605
It's so simple.

00:02:51.605 --> 00:02:54.605
You can simply hit over
to these Publish button.

00:02:54.605 --> 00:02:55.775
You can click on it.

00:02:55.775 --> 00:02:59.585
And then here, apart from
these staging domain,

00:02:59.585 --> 00:03:01.610
you can choose your
custom domain and

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.830
hit Publish to
select the domains.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.205
Remember, you can always on
publisher website as well.

00:03:07.205 --> 00:03:09.410
You can also go to
the designer and you

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.990
can click on this Publish
button in the toolbar,

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.065
and you can choose your
custom domain here as well,

00:03:15.065 --> 00:03:17.705
and then hit the Publish button.

00:03:17.705 --> 00:03:20.584
Right now, our staging
domain is selected.

00:03:20.584 --> 00:03:23.135
Let's publish our
project for a second,

00:03:23.135 --> 00:03:25.190
and now it's
published and you can

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.635
open it up if you click
on this little icon,

00:03:27.635 --> 00:03:30.140
whenever you make
changes to your website,

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.555
you need to make sure to
go ahead and publish it.

00:03:32.555 --> 00:03:34.310
Otherwise, that change is

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.965
private and no one can see that.

00:03:36.965 --> 00:03:38.270
So make sure to publish

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.044
your website once you
make some changes.

00:03:41.044 --> 00:03:43.085
And if you want to
Unpublish your website,

00:03:43.085 --> 00:03:45.740
you can simply click on
this unpublished button,

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.525
and it will be unpublished.

00:03:47.525 --> 00:03:49.880
If you want to modify
this staging URL,

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:50.900
as I mentioned before,

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.045
you can head over to
the project settings.

00:03:53.045 --> 00:03:55.370
And then under the
General tab here you have

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.190
sub-domain and you can just
modify this sub-domain.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.065
Let me change it
to something else.

00:04:00.065 --> 00:04:04.250
Circle design, dot
Webflow does IO.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.170
I'm going to save
changes and then

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.180
I'm going to publish it now.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.850
And right now, our
website is published on

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.050
this staging domain and no
one else can use this URL.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.290
This is a unique URL
for our project.

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.030
I'm going to open it up.

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.625
There we go. The URL
has been changed.

00:04:22.625 --> 00:04:23.690
In the future videos,

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.075
we will talk about
different hosting plans,

00:04:26.075 --> 00:04:28.685
whether you should host
on Webflow or not.

00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:30.920
So if you don't know
which plan is suitable

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.545
for you or your
clients, don't worry.

00:04:33.545 --> 00:04:34.790
We will get into it.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:35.840
Are right guys.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.295
That's all for this video.

00:04:37.295 --> 00:04:41.310
I hope you enjoyed it and
I see you in the next one.
