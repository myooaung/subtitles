00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.645
Hey, welcome back.

00:00:06.645 --> 00:00:08.340
In this video we're
going to connect

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.655
all our elements to
the fields of our CMS.

00:00:11.655 --> 00:00:13.485
Are you ready? Let's begin.

00:00:13.485 --> 00:00:16.275
First of all, I'm going
to select this heading.

00:00:16.275 --> 00:00:19.185
This heading should display
the project's name.

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:22.020
So if I click on
this settings icon,

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.715
I can check this checkbox.

00:00:23.715 --> 00:00:26.070
It says get texts from projects.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.645
This is the collection
that we created before.

00:00:28.645 --> 00:00:30.455
Then I'm going to
select the field.

00:00:30.455 --> 00:00:32.870
I'm going to select
name, plain text.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.220
This is our project name.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.940
There we go.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.295
It has been changed
to simplify plus,

00:00:37.295 --> 00:00:39.065
if you remember, we modified it.

00:00:39.065 --> 00:00:41.675
But why simplify plus y nuts,

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:43.670
another project
that's because if you

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.935
head over to the top bar here,

00:00:45.935 --> 00:00:48.980
you can see that we have this
item and it says simplify

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.520
plus this projects template
has different items,

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.890
the items that we
create at the projects.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.275
And if I go to crypto pi,

00:00:57.275 --> 00:01:00.695
you can see that this title
is changed automatically.

00:01:00.695 --> 00:01:03.095
If I go to orbit, There we go.

00:01:03.095 --> 00:01:06.215
So that's the beauty
of using Webflow CMS.

00:01:06.215 --> 00:01:08.750
I'm going to go to
simplify plus four now.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.880
Then I'm going to select
the project type.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.055
Let me click on
the Settings icon.

00:01:13.055 --> 00:01:14.930
I'm going to check this checkbox

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.685
and let me choose the field.

00:01:16.685 --> 00:01:18.620
This one is going
to be project type.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.230
There we go, UI design,
an app development.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.820
And then I'm going to select

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.895
this project date and I'm going
to click on the settings.

00:01:25.895 --> 00:01:27.920
Let me check this
checkbox and I'm going to

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.170
choose the relevant field.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.985
It's going to be
completion date.

00:01:31.985 --> 00:01:32.675
There we go.

00:01:32.675 --> 00:01:35.885
It has been changed
to June 1, 2021.

00:01:35.885 --> 00:01:38.645
Here we can modify
the format as well.

00:01:38.645 --> 00:01:41.270
So if you want to show
it differently, e.g.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.700
if you wanted to include
the time as well,

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.040
you can simply
modify the format.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.410
We have many different
formats here,

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:49.865
so that's totally up to you,

00:01:49.865 --> 00:01:53.060
but it looks good to me are
right now it's time to go

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.600
ahead and select our image,
project page, image.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.910
And I'm going to hit
this settings icon

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.560
and let me check
this gets imaged

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.270
from projects and I am going to

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.490
choose project image are right,

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.275
great, but what
about the shadow?

00:02:06.275 --> 00:02:09.815
Well, since we duplicated this
image for our drop-shadow,

00:02:09.815 --> 00:02:11.990
we just need to
select it and we just

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.345
need to simply
connected to our field,

00:02:14.345 --> 00:02:15.890
just like our main image.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.530
I'm going to check this
check marks and I'm going to

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.965
select the project image
from the field drop menu,

00:02:21.965 --> 00:02:24.530
just like that are
right now it's time to

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.590
select our project
detail, this rich text.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.545
And I'm gonna go ahead
and check this checkbox

00:02:30.545 --> 00:02:33.545
and let me select the
field project details.

00:02:33.545 --> 00:02:34.265
There we go.

00:02:34.265 --> 00:02:36.650
It has been changed to
the projects detail

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.095
that it's associated
with our right,

00:02:39.095 --> 00:02:40.940
our elements are connected and

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.190
now I can go ahead
and check it out.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.130
So if I change the
item here at the top

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.115
from simplify plus to purify.

00:02:49.115 --> 00:02:49.835
There we go.

00:02:49.835 --> 00:02:51.305
The Tidal has been changed,

00:02:51.305 --> 00:02:53.315
the project type
has been changed,

00:02:53.315 --> 00:02:55.055
the date has been changed,

00:02:55.055 --> 00:02:57.695
the image and the
project detail.

00:02:57.695 --> 00:02:59.090
And take a look at this,

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.520
the drop shadow changes
as well because

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.445
it's also using a
dynamic content.

00:03:04.445 --> 00:03:06.424
I'm going to go to another item.

00:03:06.424 --> 00:03:08.120
I'm gonna go to dash coin.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.945
There we go.

00:03:08.945 --> 00:03:11.195
It looks amazing, doesn't it?

00:03:11.195 --> 00:03:12.980
Alright, we're almost done,

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.410
but there is one more thing
we need to take care of,

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.990
and that is the other
project section.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.995
If I go to simplify
plus and I scroll down,

00:03:21.995 --> 00:03:24.365
you can see that
in other projects,

00:03:24.365 --> 00:03:27.200
we will see the simplified
plus project as well.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.540
It doesn't make sense
because we should exclude

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.375
the project that the user
is currently viewing.

00:03:32.375 --> 00:03:34.955
We should just display
other projects here.

00:03:34.955 --> 00:03:37.340
If I head over to my
design file here,

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.965
as you can see here,
we have simplified.

00:03:39.965 --> 00:03:42.035
We don't have the
simplifying project

00:03:42.035 --> 00:03:43.655
in the other projects.

00:03:43.655 --> 00:03:45.185
So how can we do that?

00:03:45.185 --> 00:03:46.805
Well, that's very simple.

00:03:46.805 --> 00:03:49.235
I'm going to select this
collection, this wrapper.

00:03:49.235 --> 00:03:51.980
And if I head over to
the elements settings,

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.290
here we have this filters option

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.105
and I'm going to hit
this Plus button.

00:03:56.105 --> 00:03:58.415
And here we have two
different fields.

00:03:58.415 --> 00:04:01.385
Here we have name,
project, project, image.

00:04:01.385 --> 00:04:03.260
You can just add
different filters,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.330
but I'm going to choose project.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.905
And then here we have

00:04:06.905 --> 00:04:11.135
another drop menu which
says ears or is not.

00:04:11.135 --> 00:04:14.104
And then here it says
current project.

00:04:14.104 --> 00:04:16.850
This project is the
current project.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.160
It means that we will
get the project that

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.920
the user is currently
viewing here as well.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.525
But this is not what we want.

00:04:23.525 --> 00:04:26.435
So I'm going to change is not.

00:04:26.435 --> 00:04:28.040
And then I'm going to hit save.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.895
And there we go.

00:04:28.895 --> 00:04:31.745
The simplify plus project
has been removed here.

00:04:31.745 --> 00:04:33.845
And here as you can
see, we have dash coin.

00:04:33.845 --> 00:04:37.730
If I go to the dash
coin project page here,

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.085
we don't have any
dash coin project

00:04:40.085 --> 00:04:42.485
and that's exactly
what we needed.

00:04:42.485 --> 00:04:43.700
One more thing I'd like to

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.740
mention here is that if I go to

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.120
the homepage and if I head
over to the recent projects,

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.860
I'm gonna go ahead and select

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.080
this collection, this wrapper.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.160
And under the sort order we
selected oldest to newest.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.615
And it doesn't make sense.

00:04:59.615 --> 00:05:00.125
Why?

00:05:00.125 --> 00:05:02.599
Because here we have
the recent projects.

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:05.180
Therefore, the completion
date should be

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.014
sorted from newest to oldest.

00:05:08.014 --> 00:05:10.265
But why did we choose
oldest to newest?

00:05:10.265 --> 00:05:12.965
That's because when we
created these projects,

00:05:12.965 --> 00:05:16.100
we randomly chose the
project's completion dates.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.660
And since I want it to get

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.719
the exact same design
that I have here,

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:23.345
simplified dash coin
and victory phi.

00:05:23.345 --> 00:05:26.000
I change this sort order from

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.790
newest to oldest,
oldest to newest.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.680
But in real-world project,

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.765
when you have the
recent projects,

00:05:32.765 --> 00:05:35.645
you need to sort it
from newest to oldest.

00:05:35.645 --> 00:05:38.030
So whenever the
agency or the client

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.700
adds a new project to
the collections items,

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.035
it will be added here.

00:05:42.035 --> 00:05:43.475
So keep that in mind.

00:05:43.475 --> 00:05:45.905
Now, I'm gonna go ahead
and check everything

00:05:45.905 --> 00:05:48.875
out and see if everything
works perfectly.

00:05:48.875 --> 00:05:50.795
If I preview my project,

00:05:50.795 --> 00:05:52.520
here I have different projects.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.950
I'm going to click on
this Learn More button.

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:55.775
There we go.

00:05:55.775 --> 00:05:58.580
Maybe it'll be redirected
to the project page and it

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.045
says simplify plus
I can scroll down.

00:06:02.045 --> 00:06:03.935
I have other projects as well.

00:06:03.935 --> 00:06:05.540
I can click on Dashed coin.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.660
I will be redirected to
the Dash coins page.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:09.275
Perfect.

00:06:09.275 --> 00:06:11.360
I'm gonna go back
to the homepage now

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.820
and let's try it out once again,

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.085
I'm going to select
vectorially fine,

00:06:16.085 --> 00:06:17.855
and everything looks great.

00:06:17.855 --> 00:06:20.750
The only thing we need to
do here is just change

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.700
the color of this
rich media texts

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.335
because we forgot to do that.

00:06:24.335 --> 00:06:27.410
And if I go ahead and check
out my design file here,

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:31.025
we can see that it doesn't
use our dark color.

00:06:31.025 --> 00:06:34.295
So I'm gonna go ahead and
select this project detail.

00:06:34.295 --> 00:06:36.275
And I'm going to
change its styling.

00:06:36.275 --> 00:06:38.930
Let me go to the typography
section and I'm going

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.630
to modify its color
to neutral medium.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.160
Now it looks much better.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.710
Are right guys, that's
all for this video.

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:49.680
I hope you enjoyed it and
I'll see you in the next one.
