00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.695
Hey, now that the
development process is over,

00:00:07.695 --> 00:00:10.305
it's time to talk about SEO.

00:00:10.305 --> 00:00:11.340
As a web developer,

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.500
you need to understand
that your work doesn't

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.545
finish when the development
process is finished.

00:00:16.545 --> 00:00:18.570
Once you develop the website,

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.330
you need to optimize
your project to rank

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.165
higher on Google and
other search engines.

00:00:24.165 --> 00:00:25.470
But how can you do that?

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.495
Well, this is the
topic of this video.

00:00:27.495 --> 00:00:32.115
Once SEO, SEO stands for
search engine optimization.

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:33.690
So let me show you an example.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.730
Whenever you go to
Google and you look

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.940
for something
That's right Apple,

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.520
when the rank of this
website is high,

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.260
it will appear higher in

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.005
the search engine and
on the first page.

00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:46.835
Because if your
website doesn't appear

00:00:46.835 --> 00:00:48.815
on the first three pages,

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:50.585
it means that your
website is not

00:00:50.585 --> 00:00:53.450
optimized and chances
are the visitors can

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.850
find your website because
most people don't

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.370
go to the fourth or fifth page.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.620
So we need to optimize
our website in

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.125
order to rank higher
on search engines.

00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:05.555
We already talked about
some points before,

00:01:05.555 --> 00:01:07.625
such as headings, hierarchy,

00:01:07.625 --> 00:01:09.485
what we're gonna do
even more things.

00:01:09.485 --> 00:01:12.095
So once you develop
your project first,

00:01:12.095 --> 00:01:13.640
you need to go ahead and check

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.260
out your headings hierarchy,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.895
like what we did before,

00:01:16.895 --> 00:01:20.360
to make sure that you
don't use more than 1h1 on

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.430
each page and you don't

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.370
skip any heading time
across your page,

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.630
then you need to make sure that

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.760
your images have all texts.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.710
And finally, what you can do is

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.945
just go ahead to
the Pages panel.

00:01:32.945 --> 00:01:35.105
And if you go to the
page settings here,

00:01:35.105 --> 00:01:37.205
you can see that we have
some settings here,

00:01:37.205 --> 00:01:39.785
right at the top we have
the page name, okay?

00:01:39.785 --> 00:01:41.690
This is only for internal use in

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.240
order to organize
all our pages here.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.755
But for external use,

00:01:45.755 --> 00:01:48.260
we need to head over
to the SEO Settings.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.790
Let's see what we have here.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.104
It says specify this page's
title and description.

00:01:53.104 --> 00:01:54.560
We can see how they look in

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.620
search engine results pages
in the preview below.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.395
Here, what we can do is enter

00:02:00.395 --> 00:02:03.035
a title tag and a
meta-description.

00:02:03.035 --> 00:02:05.000
This is basically
what will appear on

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.010
Google search result pages and

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.440
also on other search
engines results.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.165
So here for the title,

00:02:11.165 --> 00:02:13.205
I'm going to write Seroquel,

00:02:13.205 --> 00:02:16.235
which is the name of
this fictional agency,

00:02:16.235 --> 00:02:17.465
a vertical line.

00:02:17.465 --> 00:02:18.500
And then I can write

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.665
the main services that
this company offers.

00:02:21.665 --> 00:02:29.810
Let's write design and development
agency just like that.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.550
But what about meta-description?

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.620
Well, here you need
to explain what

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.690
this company does briefly.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.235
So I'm going to write,

00:02:37.235 --> 00:02:42.350
we help startups to
bring their ideas to

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.240
live by designing

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.740
stunning interfaces
and user experiences.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.860
Just like that, you can see
the search results preview.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.720
And it says this preview uses

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.670
the typical character limits for

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.860
Google search result pages on

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.590
desktop search engines
do experiments with

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.270
their character limits and

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.280
may decide to show
different content.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.410
That's 100 per cent, right?

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.390
I'm going to scroll down here.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.340
We have open graphs settings.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.030
So the info we add here shows
up when our users share

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.750
our content on their social
media accounts like Facebook,

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.870
Twitter, LinkedIn,
Pinterest, etc.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.875
So if I scroll down here
for Open Graph tidal,

00:03:24.875 --> 00:03:28.790
I'm going to check this same
as SEO title tag checkbox.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.725
And for opening
graph description,

00:03:30.725 --> 00:03:33.380
I'm going to check
this checkbox as well.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.065
Here we have Open
Graph image URL.

00:03:36.065 --> 00:03:38.810
Make sure to add an
image URL here, e.g.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.490
you can go to your assets first,

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.584
let me save this page and then
I'm going to go to Assets.

00:03:44.584 --> 00:03:46.670
Let me choose one
of these images.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.265
For instance, I'm going
to choose this one.

00:03:49.265 --> 00:03:51.890
And if I click on this
settings icon here,

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.020
I can get the link
of this image.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.180
If I click on it, I can copy it.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.210
Then let me go to Pages home.

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.645
And if I paste it right
here, There we go.

00:04:02.645 --> 00:04:05.540
This image will appear
when the user shares

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.495
or content on their
social media accounts.

00:04:08.495 --> 00:04:11.375
The image, the title,
and the description.

00:04:11.375 --> 00:04:13.190
Alright, so far, so good.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.585
Now let me save it.

00:04:14.585 --> 00:04:17.705
Now we need to go ahead and
optimize our other pages,

00:04:17.705 --> 00:04:19.145
like the contact us.

00:04:19.145 --> 00:04:20.540
So if I go to

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.485
the Contact Us page settings
here for the title tag,

00:04:24.485 --> 00:04:26.480
I'm going to write contact us

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.239
a vertical line, circle agency.

00:04:29.239 --> 00:04:32.225
And for the meta-description,
let me write,

00:04:32.225 --> 00:04:38.450
if you want to get a
code for your project,

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:44.115
don't hesitate to get
in touch with us.

00:04:44.115 --> 00:04:46.465
All right, let me check it out.

00:04:46.465 --> 00:04:48.760
If you want to get a
code for your project,

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.940
don't hesitate to get in
touch with us. That's great.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.920
I'm going to scroll down here.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.185
We have the Open Graph
settings as well.

00:04:56.185 --> 00:04:58.210
And we're going to just check

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.495
these checkboxes to get the
same title and description.

00:05:01.495 --> 00:05:04.555
And for the image, I'm going
to paste the same link here.

00:05:04.555 --> 00:05:07.165
Nice, let me save it done.

00:05:07.165 --> 00:05:10.240
Now we need to go to our
projects template page.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.640
If I go to the
settings here we have

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.580
again title meta-description
and all those fields.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.955
With one exception, this
page is a dynamic page,

00:05:18.955 --> 00:05:22.029
therefore its content
constantly changes.

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:24.340
So how can we add the title and

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.775
Meta description
for each project?

00:05:26.775 --> 00:05:28.880
Well, it's so simple as you can

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.055
see here we have
this field option.

00:05:31.055 --> 00:05:33.335
Therefore, we can feel
these text fields

00:05:33.335 --> 00:05:35.615
dynamically with
dynamic content.

00:05:35.615 --> 00:05:36.695
That's so cool.

00:05:36.695 --> 00:05:38.540
So let's suppose first

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.465
here we want to add
the project name.

00:05:41.465 --> 00:05:43.595
If I click on this Add Field,

00:05:43.595 --> 00:05:45.575
I can choose the proper field.

00:05:45.575 --> 00:05:46.760
It's going to be name.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.685
There we go. You can preview
the search results here.

00:05:49.685 --> 00:05:52.220
This is the name of
our project space,

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.035
a vertical line space.

00:05:54.035 --> 00:05:56.300
Then I'm going to add
the type of project.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.875
I'm going to add a new field.

00:05:57.875 --> 00:05:59.600
It's going to be project type.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.015
Here we have UI design,
an app development.

00:06:02.015 --> 00:06:05.030
All these information
are coming from our CMS.

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:06.995
And then a vertical line

00:06:06.995 --> 00:06:09.980
here I'm going to
write Seroquel agency.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.934
Okay, But what about
the Meta description?

00:06:12.934 --> 00:06:16.100
So let's write, check out the,

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.330
and now I'm going to add a
field project type project we

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:26.555
have done for the
project name company.

00:06:26.555 --> 00:06:28.385
So let's preview it.

00:06:28.385 --> 00:06:30.170
Check out the UI design and

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:31.910
app development project we have

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.845
done for the
simplifying company.

00:06:33.845 --> 00:06:35.435
That's great as an IT.

00:06:35.435 --> 00:06:37.310
And since we are using fields,

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:38.915
if I use these arrows,

00:06:38.915 --> 00:06:40.100
I can easily preview

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.325
the search results of
other projects as well.

00:06:43.325 --> 00:06:44.345
Let's check it out.

00:06:44.345 --> 00:06:46.325
I'm going to click
on this right arrow.

00:06:46.325 --> 00:06:49.235
And as you can see, the
content changes here.

00:06:49.235 --> 00:06:51.695
That's very nice, isn't it?

00:06:51.695 --> 00:06:53.420
I'm going to scroll down and

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.775
here for the open graph title,

00:06:55.775 --> 00:06:57.950
I'm going to check
these checkboxes.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.315
And for the image,

00:06:59.315 --> 00:07:01.460
I'm going to choose
the project image

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:02.795
from this drop-down menu,

00:07:02.795 --> 00:07:05.765
and the image will be
changed dynamically as well.

00:07:05.765 --> 00:07:08.810
So if the user shares the
link of these projects,

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.750
simplify, the thumbnail
will be this image,

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.370
but for other projects,

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.470
the thumbnail will be different,

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.465
just like that and the image

00:07:17.465 --> 00:07:20.315
matches the content
here are right, cool.

00:07:20.315 --> 00:07:21.605
Now let me save it.

00:07:21.605 --> 00:07:23.270
So what else can we do in

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.610
terms of search
engine optimization?

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.400
Well, there are many things
we can do and we're going to

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.925
cover the most important
ones in the upcoming videos.

00:07:31.925 --> 00:07:33.515
I hope you enjoyed this video

00:07:33.515 --> 00:07:36.390
and I'll see you
in the next one.
