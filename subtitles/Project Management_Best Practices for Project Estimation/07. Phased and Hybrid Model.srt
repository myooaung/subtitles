1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:05,730
This next model is phased progressive.

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,463
So, we're going to carry out or perform,

3
00:00:09,463 --> 00:00:12,730
again, our estimate in phases or stages.

4
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:17,730
This is also known as phase estimating, a bit like a waterfall approach.

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:23,730
By the way, waterfall is not dead or necessarily bad, in this particular case.

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,330
And why I say this is because your customers,

7
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,130
your clients,

8
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:32,130
might only approve an initial phase of discovery first and

9
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,330
then they only approve the next phase, next.

10
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:39,730
So it may be phase by phase, out of your control.

11
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,200
So here's why I like this approach.

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,730
Or here's how I would deal also with this approach.

13
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:49,730
So again, then the client may ask for an estimate then to complete the project.

14
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,677
So you may have done phase one, discovery,

15
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:56,730
maybe even phase two, design or whatever your phases might be.

16
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,105
And after each phase your client may ask for the

17
00:01:01,105 --> 00:01:03,730
remaining estimate of the following phases.

18
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,792
This allows for re-estimating for improved accuracy,

19
00:01:06,792 --> 00:01:10,730
based on what you've learned in the preceding phases.

20
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,730
Again, each phase drives the estimate for the next phase.

21
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,480
Here's an example.

22
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:20,730
Initiation or discovery phase was 60 hours to complete.

23
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,130
Design/analysis phase is 120.

24
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:27,730
In other words I might want to use the multiple, based on my experience, of 2.

25
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:32,530
So whatever the discovery takes I can tell my client I think

26
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,730
it'll be 120 hours for the next phase.

27
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,330
Construction and development phase.

28
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:41,730
Okay, we're going to start writing some code now, 360 hours.

29
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:45,230
I might make it a 3 multiple of the design phase.

30
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,457
That might be one of my criteria,

31
00:01:47,457 --> 00:01:52,730
one of my parameters in coming up with the following estimate for construction.

32
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:53,467
Deploy phase.

33
00:01:53,467 --> 00:01:54,572
Install, deploy, etc.

34
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:57,151
Maybe I don't use a multiple here,

35
00:01:57,151 --> 00:02:04,530
maybe I can tell by the size is 24 hours for the average,

36
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,730
you know, deploy phase.

37
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,452
This is our last model, hybrid model.

38
00:02:10,452 --> 00:02:14,341
And I think this is a very important technique to

39
00:02:14,341 --> 00:02:17,542
incorporate hybrid into your estimating process.

40
00:02:17,542 --> 00:02:24,174
This technique is called hybrid because it uses actual time spent and

41
00:02:24,174 --> 00:02:27,730
compares it against the other pre-launch estimating models.

42
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:32,730
So we had our original estimate, our project starts,

43
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:37,730
we start gathering actual hours spent against those tasks,

44
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:42,730
and we compare it to how well it shows against our estimates.

45
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,789
If we're off, we need to adjust.

46
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:45,083
But,

47
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:48,563
a prerequisite in order to do that of course is you

48
00:02:48,563 --> 00:02:51,896
need a task or a time tracking system.

49
00:02:51,896 --> 00:02:57,730
I just can't emphasize enough how important it is for you to do this.

50
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:03,730
All tasks, hours and minutes, must be tracked per planning units.

51
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:07,630
Whether it's a task or a screen or however you lay it out,

52
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,730
all the hours expended against that task,

53
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,042
the original estimate,

54
00:03:11,042 --> 00:03:16,730
you must capture and compare to see whether am I behind that estimate,

55
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,677
or am I ahead of that estimate?

56
00:03:19,677 --> 00:03:24,730
Behind meaning too many hours, and ahead meaning you have less hours.

57
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,980
So here's an example.

58
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:33,730
Let's say we've developed six screens, four reports, and two API interfaces.

59
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,671
So we want to use this information as parameters to

60
00:03:36,671 --> 00:03:38,730
re-estimate the remaining tasks of the project.

61
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,230
Again, our project is underway.

62
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:45,730
So the original estimate per screen is 18 hours.

63
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,625
Okay, that was the original estimate.

64
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,203
So how are we doing?

65
00:03:49,203 --> 00:03:54,063
We would look in our time tracking system and it would show us,

66
00:03:54,063 --> 00:03:58,730
oh, actual average hours used per screen is 27 hours.

67
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:01,063
Oh, okay, so we are actually over.

68
00:04:01,063 --> 00:04:03,730
Now there could be a variety of reasons.

69
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:06,230
Maybe they were harder than we thought.

70
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,730
Maybe our estimating model wasn't very accurate.

71
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,961
Maybe our team needed some additional training.

72
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:14,730
But now that we know that,

73
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,730
we want to use that information to re-estimate the remaining screens.

74
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:24,572
So now we're going to use the 27 hours as our estimate per

75
00:04:24,572 --> 00:04:27,730
screen to re-estimate the remaining screens.

76
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,285
Because that is what it's really taking.

77
00:04:29,285 --> 00:04:31,730
And then educate our management or our steering group on hey,

78
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:35,730
here's what it really takes to go do, now we can be more accurate.

79
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,612
And we want to repeat this for other work unit types.

80
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,730
Reports, APIs, and things like that.

81
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:49,730
So we are always monitoring the actuals against the estimates, at all times.

82
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:53,730
The team and/or the PM needs to be doing this.

83
00:04:53,730 --> 00:05:00,730
Again, this only works if you accurately track your time on all the tasks.

84
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:05,230
And I can't re-emphasize this enough.

85
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:09,730
This is very important and critical.

86
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,730
As I've mentioned throughout the description of these estimating models,

87
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:16,730
I mix and match these for each of my projects.

88
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:22,730
No one estimating model may work for you and I would suggest don't use only one.

89
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:26,677
I use several at a time and I always use the hybrid model because I

90
00:05:26,677 --> 00:05:29,771
always want to know how am I doing against my estimates?

91
00:05:29,771 --> 00:05:32,396
I don't want to be 1, 000 hours over,

92
00:05:32,396 --> 00:05:36,639
I want to only be 100 hours over and be able to talk to my

93
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,548
management or my steering committee team saying,

94
00:05:38,548 --> 00:05:45,174
hey, look I'm a little bit over now here's the data to prove what it takes,

95
00:05:45,174 --> 00:05:45,730
etc.

96
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:48,730
So you may use two or three models, which may be the best for you.

97
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,980
And you may use different models based on the

98
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,730
nature and the type of the project,

99
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:57,730
big or small or medium or something like that.

100
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,730
Recommended throughout the estimating and project development process.

101
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:05,730
So it's not just at the beginning, make an estimate and go and away you go.

102
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:09,813
You're always going to be re-estimating throughout

103
00:06:09,813 --> 00:06:12,730
the project for increased accuracy.

104
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:18,730
So your goal, as the project manager or estimator, is to do a couple of things.

105
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:23,940
You want to always be able to predict and provide the

106
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:27,730
highest quality estimate or estimates, at all times.

107
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,268
Especially before the project launches,

108
00:06:29,268 --> 00:06:31,422
gather several estimates based on the different

109
00:06:31,422 --> 00:06:32,906
model and the different assumptions.

110
00:06:32,906 --> 00:06:34,671
And then if it's a go,

111
00:06:34,671 --> 00:06:39,646
you're going to start tracking your time in a time tracking system

112
00:06:39,646 --> 00:06:43,730
and comparing those actuals against your estimates.

113
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:46,730
So using the information at hand throughout the entire project lifecycle,

114
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:58,000
you'll be able to better make estimates in the future, you'll be able to improve your skills, and have much better estimates.
