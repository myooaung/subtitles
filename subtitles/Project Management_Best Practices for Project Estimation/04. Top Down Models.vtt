00:00:00.924 --> 00:00:04.924
Now let's take a deeper look at top down historical.

2
00:00:04.924 --> 00:00:07.258
What do I mean by historical?

3
00:00:07.258 --> 00:00:11.535
It's based on past data from previous projects that I've saved

4
00:00:11.535 --> 00:00:15.299
away so I can reuse that data on new projects,

5
00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.924
to help me make my estimates better.

6
00:00:17.924 --> 00:00:21.807
So we perform this early in our estimating process and we

7
00:00:21.807 --> 00:00:23.924
can maybe use some soft specifications.

8
00:00:23.924 --> 00:00:28.980
Maybe we just think hey, we might have 20 screens or 10 reports,

9
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.924
no real detail right now.

10
00:00:30.924 --> 00:00:34.524
We want to utilize those actual costs from previous

11
00:00:34.524 --> 00:00:36.924
projects for similar tasks or functions.

12
00:00:36.924 --> 00:00:41.591
Now this works best if the WBS, Work Breakdown Structure,

13
00:00:41.591 --> 00:00:46.324
from a previous project mirrors or is similar to

14
00:00:46.324 --> 00:00:49.924
the WBS for your current project.

15
00:00:49.924 --> 00:00:51.424
So again WBS,

16
00:00:51.424 --> 00:00:55.924
it's a hierarchical and incremental decomposition of the project

17
00:00:55.924 --> 00:00:58.766
into phases or deliverables and work packages.

18
00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:03.924
So as an example, maybe one of your tasks is to design a database.

19
00:01:03.924 --> 00:01:04.284
5.

20
00:01:04.284 --> 00:01:05.364
0, maybe 5.

21
00:01:05.364 --> 00:01:06.084
1, 5.

22
00:01:06.084 --> 00:01:06.804
2, 5.

23
00:01:06.804 --> 00:01:07.164
3.

24
00:01:07.164 --> 00:01:10.764
It might be to put the attributes on the tables,

25
00:01:10.764 --> 00:01:14.591
figure out primary and foreign keys, come up with indexes.

26
00:01:14.591 --> 00:01:17.924
So, it just decomposes all the tasks down.

27
00:01:17.924 --> 00:01:21.813
So if you're able to do that from the previous project and match up

28
00:01:21.813 --> 00:01:24.524
where they make sense for this future project,

29
00:01:24.524 --> 00:01:28.524
you'll have some historical data that you may be able

30
00:01:28.524 --> 00:01:30.924
to apply to the future project.

31
00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:34.924
So example of actual hours from a Legacy project or projects.

32
00:01:34.924 --> 00:01:39.454
For example, maybe the average time to develop a simple screen,

33
00:01:39.454 --> 00:01:41.924
with some logic, is 16 hours.

34
00:01:41.924 --> 00:01:46.924
Maybe the average time to develop a moderate screen with logic is 24 hours.

35
00:01:46.924 --> 00:01:51.924
And average time to develop a complex screen with logic was 40 hours.

36
00:01:51.924 --> 00:01:59.924
And you arrived at the 16, the 24, and the 40 by looking at past actual data.

37
00:01:59.924 --> 00:02:03.424
So let's make a little estimate for the new system.

38
00:02:03.424 --> 00:02:06.924
If in the PDD we call out 7 simple screens,

39
00:02:06.924 --> 00:02:12.924
7 times 16 is 102 hours, 9 moderate screens,

40
00:02:12.924 --> 00:02:16.924
9 times 24 is 216 hours.

41
00:02:16.924 --> 00:02:20.734
Three complex, 3 times 40 is 120 hours.

42
00:02:20.734 --> 00:02:26.924
Then we can come up with a rough estimate of about 438 hours.

43
00:02:26.924 --> 00:02:36.924
And that we can do very quickly, very easily, and add that back into our PDD.

44
00:02:36.924 --> 00:02:39.258
Top down heuristic.

45
00:02:39.258 --> 00:02:43.924
Heuristic is experience-based techniques for estimation.

46
00:02:43.924 --> 00:02:46.652
This is based on your experience.

47
00:02:46.652 --> 00:02:53.924
For example, I think my team and I can build a simple screen in 20 hours.

48
00:02:53.924 --> 00:02:57.299
So you're not using actual data in this case,

49
00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.924
you're using data from your own experiences.

50
00:02:59.924 --> 00:03:04.591
We perform this early in our process and again we

51
00:03:04.591 --> 00:03:06.924
can use the soft specifications.

52
00:03:06.924 --> 00:03:13.240
Utilizes our estimated cost based on current skill sets of the team,

53
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.924
rather than the historical data as before.

54
00:03:16.924 --> 00:03:19.924
But as I mentioned, you could do both of these and compare them.

55
00:03:19.924 --> 00:03:23.082
Works best for an experienced team that knows their velocity,

56
00:03:23.082 --> 00:03:25.924
knows how much they can really do and perform.

57
00:03:25.924 --> 00:03:30.454
If you haven't worked with a team you won't have any

58
00:03:30.454 --> 00:03:32.924
probably basis for your heuristic approach.

59
00:03:32.924 --> 00:03:37.324
Example, based on average time a software engineer requires to build.

60
00:03:37.324 --> 00:03:37.724
What?

61
00:03:37.724 --> 00:03:38.924
A simple screen.

62
00:03:38.924 --> 00:03:42.424
In my team say, for example, based on our experiences,

63
00:03:42.424 --> 00:03:45.924
I think 20 hours is the right estimate for that.

64
00:03:45.924 --> 00:03:48.174
Moderate screen, I think 30 hours.

65
00:03:48.174 --> 00:03:50.049
Complex screen, maybe 50 hours.

66
00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.078
Maybe your team dynamic changes, maybe you bring on some new people.

67
00:03:54.078 --> 00:03:55.924
Maybe these hours there go up.

68
00:03:55.924 --> 00:04:01.924
Maybe over time you're more and more experienced, then these hours may go down.

69
00:04:01.924 --> 00:04:04.496
So let's go through an example.

70
00:04:04.496 --> 00:04:07.924
Seven screens again that are simple, 140 hours.

71
00:04:07.924 --> 00:04:11.924
Moderate screens, 270 hours.

72
00:04:11.924 --> 00:04:15.924
Complex screens, 150 hours.

73
00:04:15.924 --> 00:04:19.299
So our total for this particular chunk of work,

74
00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.924
these screens, will be about 560 hours.

75
00:04:21.924 --> 00:04:22.924
Again,

76
00:04:22.924 --> 00:04:29.000
this is an alternative way for you to predict the estimates for this kind of work.
