00:00:00,846 --> 00:00:02,230
Using estimating models.

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:08,119
In this section we will learn about different estimating models and how

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:13,846
and when to apply them to your estimation process.

4
00:00:13,846 --> 00:00:18,046
Okay, here are our estimating model types.

5
00:00:18,046 --> 00:00:22,846
One type are what I call pre-launch models.

6
00:00:22,846 --> 00:00:25,763
These are performed before the project begins.

7
00:00:25,763 --> 00:00:30,793
These will provide necessary information to add to your PDD to help you

8
00:00:30,793 --> 00:00:34,846
decide whether you're going to launch or not launch a project.

9
00:00:34,846 --> 00:00:38,846
Next will come what I call the post-launch models.

10
00:00:38,846 --> 00:00:41,846
And these are performed during the project.

11
00:00:41,846 --> 00:00:44,846
Yes, your estimation techniques are not done,

12
00:00:44,846 --> 00:00:48,846
your job is not done, even though the project has launched.

13
00:00:48,846 --> 00:00:52,046
You want to continually refine and validate your

14
00:00:52,046 --> 00:00:54,846
remaining hours on your project, your schedules,

15
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:55,846
during the project.

16
00:00:55,846 --> 00:00:58,846
So we're going to talk about that as well.

17
00:00:58,846 --> 00:01:01,763
Lastly, are the hybrid model.

18
00:01:01,763 --> 00:01:05,846
This uses the pre and during models.

19
00:01:05,846 --> 00:01:09,004
In fact, the hybrid model is what I always use,

20
00:01:09,004 --> 00:01:13,905
which is using the pre-launch to move the project to a go or launch

21
00:01:13,905 --> 00:01:16,787
condition and then as the project progresses,

22
00:01:16,787 --> 00:01:21,154
I apply my post-launch models to dynamically refine the project

23
00:01:21,154 --> 00:01:24,846
estimates throughout the remaining portion of the project.

24
00:01:24,846 --> 00:01:31,846
And let's talk about those in more detail right now.

25
00:01:31,846 --> 00:01:32,179
Okay,

26
00:01:32,179 --> 00:01:36,846
let's talk about the different types of models that we have discussed so far.

27
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:41,846
We have the pre-launch models and for me, I use five different approaches.

28
00:01:41,846 --> 00:01:45,346
Top down historical, top down heuristic,

29
00:01:45,346 --> 00:01:48,846
parametric, phased allocation, and bottom up.

30
00:01:48,846 --> 00:01:52,846
In fact I use probably almost all five of these on large projects to get a

31
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:56,846
good feel and perspective of what the estimates might be.

32
00:01:56,846 --> 00:02:01,221
Post-launch models, phased progressive, and of course our hybrid model,

33
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:05,741
where we use both the pre and the post launch.

34
00:02:05,741 --> 00:02:11,899
There is also an Agile model and that is covered in Module three,

35
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:12,846
Agile Estimation.

36
00:02:12,846 --> 00:02:15,000
Okay, so let's begin with the pre-launch.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Remember, the project hasn't started yet and we want to get a few estimates going.
