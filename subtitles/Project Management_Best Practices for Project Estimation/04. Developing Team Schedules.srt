1
00:00:00,549 --> 00:00:01,949
Developing team schedules.

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:07,549
Now that we have discussed ideal time and our pretty good multiplier,

3
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:10,882
we know about what our team is capable of producing.

4
00:00:10,882 --> 00:00:13,549
Now let's see how we schedule that work.

5
00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:18,049
That is come up with the complete elapsed time

6
00:00:18,049 --> 00:00:20,549
necessary to accomplish the project.

7
00:00:20,549 --> 00:00:24,282
We have focused to date on estimates.

8
00:00:24,282 --> 00:00:28,549
But estimates are only part of the picture.

9
00:00:28,549 --> 00:00:31,049
The minute you come up with an estimate,

10
00:00:31,049 --> 00:00:33,549
someone will want a date, or a milestone.

11
00:00:33,549 --> 00:00:37,549
Or basically, hey when are you going to be done?

12
00:00:37,549 --> 00:00:40,549
So what they're really asking for is a schedule.

13
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:43,549
So definition of a schedule.

14
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:46,372
It's your plan for carrying out a process,

15
00:00:46,372 --> 00:00:49,549
giving lists of intended events or milestones and dates.

16
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:54,549
Up against those tasks that we've already itemized with our estimated hours.

17
00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:58,549
Estimates and schedules, as we know, are completely different elements.

18
00:00:58,549 --> 00:01:02,759
Both are required by your customer or your management team.

19
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:06,549
Estimates alone are just not enough for the picture.

20
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:10,549
That's why we need estimates, of course in hours, and not dates.

21
00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:12,453
Estimates come up with hours.

22
00:01:12,453 --> 00:01:16,644
We apply those hours onto a schedule or a calendar to

23
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:22,049
come up with the dates based on the resources we have to

24
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,549
consume those tasks and hours.

25
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:27,431
Completion dates therefore can be derived by

26
00:01:27,431 --> 00:01:29,902
scheduling your resources on a calendar.

27
00:01:29,902 --> 00:01:31,549
It's really that simple.

28
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:37,666
As you apply resources on a calendar, you can determine completion target dates.

29
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:39,549
Let's see some examples.

30
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:42,049
Now let's do a quick first cut schedule example.

31
00:01:42,049 --> 00:01:48,549
In what I'm going to call an ideal schedule, just like we had ideal estimates.

32
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:54,549
So the estimate in ideal time is 220 hours in our example.

33
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:58,882
So using my 'pretty good capacity' multiplier from the previous sections, 1.

34
00:01:58,882 --> 00:02:02,549
12 x 220, so we think we need about 240 hour,

35
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:09,549
excuse me, 247 hours of a window of time in order to accomplish the 220.

36
00:02:09,549 --> 00:02:15,549
Okay, so now we have a rough cut of elapsed time required.

37
00:02:15,549 --> 00:02:20,549
In order to execute those 220 hours it'll take an elapsed time of 247 hours.

38
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:23,075
And again, we would only be billing or accounting for the 220.

39
00:02:23,075 --> 00:02:26,590
Remember, we think we need 220 hours of real work to get it done.

40
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,215
But we know with sick and vacation and such,

41
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:31,549
there needs to be a little more time.

42
00:02:31,549 --> 00:02:34,549
And of course those would be charged to other cost centers,

43
00:02:34,549 --> 00:02:38,549
like sick time, vacation, jury duty and things like that.

44
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:43,549
Now let's follow through with our team example of 3 developers on our team.

45
00:02:43,549 --> 00:02:49,120
So, 247 hours divided by 8 hours a day, is about 31 days.

46
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,549
And 3 into 31 is about 10 days.

47
00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:58,549
So about 10 work days for 3 developers to implement the requirement.

48
00:02:58,549 --> 00:03:02,549
Okay boss, this will be about a 2 week assignment for my team.

49
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:06,241
Obviously this is an ideal schedule because you're

50
00:03:06,241 --> 00:03:08,549
assuming that all three developers,

51
00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:12,549
are all available for 10 straight working days.

52
00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:15,443
I've also accounted for maybe a little bit of vacation or

53
00:03:15,443 --> 00:03:17,549
sick that might happen in those 10 days.

54
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:22,549
But I'm pretty confident that hey, I need two weeks to get this job done.

55
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:26,654
But let's look further in terms of, because the world's not ideal certainly,

56
00:03:26,654 --> 00:03:32,549
and how other projects or issues can affect our initial first cut.

57
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:38,443
We saw on a previous slide just how easy it is to get a first cut,

58
00:03:38,443 --> 00:03:39,549
quick, ballpark schedule.

59
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:41,049
This isn't complicated rocket science guys.

60
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:42,549
You have a few little spreadsheets,

61
00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:46,834
you can crank these numbers together and really quickly get some pretty

62
00:03:46,834 --> 00:03:50,549
confident estimates and/or quick schedules back to your management.

63
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:54,666
Now let's look a little further and do a detailed,

64
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:57,549
what I call detailed second cut schedule.

65
00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:02,549
Again the first cut was ideal, but doesn't account for other projects or tasks.

66
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:05,784
The second cut, we're going to do a resource load chart,

67
00:04:05,784 --> 00:04:07,549
more of an elapsed schedule now.

68
00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:11,549
So you can see the chart here on the screen.

69
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:14,391
And the first row going across is Week Number.

70
00:04:14,391 --> 00:04:17,549
So I have 1 Week, 2 Week, 3 Week say.

71
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:20,215
Second row is going to be the headings.

72
00:04:20,215 --> 00:04:22,882
I'm going to have a column for Resources,

73
00:04:22,882 --> 00:04:25,691
% Available that that resource is available.

74
00:04:25,691 --> 00:04:29,549
And I have my, I use week ending dates.

75
00:04:29,549 --> 00:04:30,960
So these are Fridays.

76
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,372
You could use Mondays.

77
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:34,490
Mondays or Fridays is the best.

78
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,549
I like Fridays.

79
00:04:35,549 --> 00:04:39,549
Okay, so I have three weeks, three columns, 1, 2, and 3.

80
00:04:39,549 --> 00:04:48,549
And then I look down and I have the Resources of Michael, John, and Jim.

81
00:04:48,549 --> 00:04:51,549
Michael is only available 45% of the time, because he's on other projects.

82
00:04:51,549 --> 00:04:59,626
So 45% of, you know, his 40 hours is going to be 18 for Week 1 and 18 for Week 2,

83
00:04:59,626 --> 00:05:01,549
and 18 for Week 3.

84
00:05:01,549 --> 00:05:07,549
John's available 90%, almost a full week, so 36 across.

85
00:05:07,549 --> 00:05:10,549
Jim's available 70%, 28 across.

86
00:05:10,549 --> 00:05:12,759
So then I have a Total.

87
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:15,338
So my team of three, is available,

88
00:05:15,338 --> 00:05:20,490
based on looking at other projects about 82 hours a week.

89
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:28,799
Now given that my target is 247 hours, you can see then in the Weekly Cum line,

90
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:31,549
at the very bottom, that the first week I'll consume 82,

91
00:05:31,549 --> 00:05:36,049
the second week cumulative will be 164, 2 x 82,

92
00:05:36,049 --> 00:05:40,549
and the last week will be 246, 3 x 82.

93
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:43,299
Now my estimate was 247.

94
00:05:43,299 --> 00:05:47,149
So now I can say, hey boss,

95
00:05:47,149 --> 00:05:52,799
given that I need to consume 247 hours and I did my first

96
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:54,549
rough cut and my pretty good multiplier,

97
00:05:54,549 --> 00:05:59,864
and now I look at my other projects, now I think I need three weeks,

98
00:05:59,864 --> 00:06:00,812
elapsed time.

99
00:06:00,812 --> 00:06:05,549
Three weeks should do it based on the allocation percentages.

100
00:06:05,549 --> 00:06:08,977
So going forward, again remember we're always so,

101
00:06:08,977 --> 00:06:13,233
so serious about tracking our time, that okay every developer,

102
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:17,022
when you track your time, you get 45% Michael,

103
00:06:17,022 --> 00:06:19,549
90% John, 70% Jim per week.

104
00:06:19,549 --> 00:06:21,111
The other time is allocated.

105
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:24,549
Now what I might recommend is standups and things like that,

106
00:06:24,549 --> 00:06:26,128
because life's going to change.

107
00:06:26,128 --> 00:06:30,549
Other projects or fires might occur and you rework this and you refine it.

108
00:06:30,549 --> 00:06:34,449
You might have a third cut and fourth cut, as the project progresses.

109
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:36,549
So you always know your target date.

110
00:06:36,549 --> 00:06:44,000
Now let's talk about the unfortunate habit of padding, and how we should deal with it.
