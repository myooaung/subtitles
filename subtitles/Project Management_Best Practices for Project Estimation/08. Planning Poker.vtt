00:00:01.495 --> 00:00:04.995
Planning poker is an Agile estimating technique and it

2
00:00:04.995 --> 00:00:08.495
can actually be a lot of fun as well.

3
00:00:08.495 --> 00:00:11.767
So planning poker combines expert opinions,

4
00:00:11.767 --> 00:00:14.495
analogies, and decomposed user stories.

5
00:00:14.495 --> 00:00:19.495
Those are the three key elements we mentioned on the previous slide.

6
00:00:19.495 --> 00:00:19.956
Participants.

7
00:00:19.956 --> 00:00:24.110
All people who will be directly involved in designing,

8
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.677
developing, and supporting the iterations of the work effort.

9
00:00:27.677 --> 00:00:29.495
Typically it's your software engineers.

10
00:00:29.495 --> 00:00:32.066
It could be a database architect.

11
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:35.495
It could be someone who does quality testing.

12
00:00:35.495 --> 00:00:38.495
Make sure you have the right participants in the room.

13
00:00:38.495 --> 00:00:40.495
And what do you need?

14
00:00:40.495 --> 00:00:44.495
You need a list of the features to be delivered.

15
00:00:44.495 --> 00:00:47.021
Maybe several copies of a deck of cards.

16
00:00:47.021 --> 00:00:48.600
Over there on the left,

17
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.745
you see they actually make cards for the Fibonacci Scale that you

18
00:00:52.745 --> 00:00:56.495
can use and each person can have their own deck.

19
00:00:56.495 --> 00:01:01.495
And you might even want an egg timer that can be used to limit the time spent.

20
00:01:01.495 --> 00:01:04.653
As you know, some people like to talk a lot.

21
00:01:04.653 --> 00:01:07.495
And it might kind of get you off track.

22
00:01:07.495 --> 00:01:11.209
So sometimes you might say we get two minutes to talk about this,

23
00:01:11.209 --> 00:01:13.495
especially if you have a lot of features.

24
00:01:13.495 --> 00:01:17.995
At least make the first pass over all the features to get a rough feel

25
00:01:17.995 --> 00:01:21.161
of these different story points and relative values.

26
00:01:21.161 --> 00:01:28.384
Now let's go over the actual planning poker process on the next slide.

27
00:01:28.384 --> 00:01:29.495
Thank you.

28
00:01:29.495 --> 00:01:33.495
So here is the planning poker estimation process.

29
00:01:33.495 --> 00:01:34.879
The meeting kickoff.

30
00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:39.495
So the moderator provides a short overview of this iteration.

31
00:01:39.495 --> 00:01:44.495
With a little open Q & A to discuss and clarify assumptions and risks.

32
00:01:44.495 --> 00:01:48.685
And an estimation scale is chosen, such as the Fibonacci Scale,

33
00:01:48.685 --> 00:01:52.495
and each person has their poker cards ready to go.

34
00:01:52.495 --> 00:01:56.495
Each feature, story point, is discussed.

35
00:01:56.495 --> 00:02:02.495
Each individual lays down a card, facedown, representing their estimate.

36
00:02:02.495 --> 00:02:07.495
And then everyone shows their card simultaneously by turning them over.

37
00:02:07.495 --> 00:02:10.120
The estimation process is by consensus.

38
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.495
People with the highest and lowest explain their estimates first.

39
00:02:14.495 --> 00:02:20.495
Important to understand their assumptions and reasons for their estimates.

40
00:02:20.495 --> 00:02:24.600
Why did they choose 20 points or why did they choose only three?

41
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.495
What are their assumptions and reasons?

42
00:02:26.495 --> 00:02:33.495
This causes a really good and lively discussion and that's very, very important.

43
00:02:33.495 --> 00:02:39.495
The rest of the process now is as follows, on the next slide.

44
00:02:39.495 --> 00:02:42.695
Now to continue with the process,

45
00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:47.495
repeat the estimation process until a consensus is reached.

46
00:02:47.495 --> 00:02:51.600
Everyone does not have to be at the same estimate value of course,

47
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.495
but close enough to move forward.

48
00:02:53.495 --> 00:02:55.234
You know, plus or minus a few points.

49
00:02:55.234 --> 00:02:58.895
If you still have one or two way on the opposite ends of the scale then

50
00:02:58.895 --> 00:03:03.606
you need to continue those discussions to rationalize those and better

51
00:03:03.606 --> 00:03:07.495
understand what's going on underneath the hood.

52
00:03:07.495 --> 00:03:10.870
You want to ensure that the discussion is structured.

53
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.495
Sometimes an egg timer can be used.

54
00:03:13.495 --> 00:03:16.695
When it runs out, all discussion must cease.

55
00:03:16.695 --> 00:03:19.495
Then another round of poker is played.

56
00:03:19.495 --> 00:03:24.995
That is we, once again, think about the discussions that transpired,

57
00:03:24.995 --> 00:03:28.858
pick the appropriate estimation value that we think

58
00:03:28.858 --> 00:03:32.495
each person thinks is appropriate, places it facedown,

59
00:03:32.495 --> 00:03:36.495
and then we flip the card over and begin again.

60
00:03:36.495 --> 00:03:41.495
Usually by round 2, maybe 3, the estimates will like start to converge.

61
00:03:41.495 --> 00:03:45.547
You'll want to document the user story and any discussions that

62
00:03:45.547 --> 00:03:48.495
were taking place and any agreements or actions.

63
00:03:48.495 --> 00:03:52.620
And you'll want to document the consensus estimated value as well,

64
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.495
or maybe the average value.

65
00:03:54.495 --> 00:03:57.495
They probably won't all be identical.

66
00:03:57.495 --> 00:04:01.495
And then you're going to move on to the next story point.

67
00:04:01.495 --> 00:04:04.495
And when complete, you will have your story points,

68
00:04:04.495 --> 00:04:07.495
and based on the team's velocity you can then

69
00:04:07.495 --> 00:04:10.495
compute your actual schedule estimate, if you recall that.

70
00:04:10.495 --> 00:04:14.586
So, if they all add up for this iteration,

71
00:04:14.586 --> 00:04:16.858
to be 150 story points,

72
00:04:16.858 --> 00:04:21.313
then based on your team's story point velocity how many story

73
00:04:21.313 --> 00:04:23.495
points that they can actually implement and produce,

74
00:04:23.495 --> 00:04:27.024
you can come up with a rough schedule as well.

75
00:04:27.024 --> 00:04:29.495
All very simple and easy in Agile.

76
00:04:29.495 --> 00:04:35.495
Now let's go on to the next slide and kind of summarize the overall section.

77
00:04:35.495 --> 00:04:37.628
Benefits of Agile estimation.

78
00:04:37.628 --> 00:04:41.361
I want to summarize the high-level, good,

79
00:04:41.361 --> 00:04:46.495
neat things about this whole Agile process if I may.

80
00:04:46.495 --> 00:04:47.606
It's easy.

81
00:04:47.606 --> 00:04:51.495
Centered around user stories and customer features.

82
00:04:51.495 --> 00:04:52.352
Very easy.

83
00:04:52.352 --> 00:04:57.495
Nothing really technical in this whole process, very high level and abstract.

84
00:04:57.495 --> 00:04:58.995
I think it's pretty fast.

85
00:04:58.995 --> 00:05:03.195
That planning poker is high level and fast and you can get some good

86
00:05:03.195 --> 00:05:07.495
input from the whole team of subject matter experts and come up with

87
00:05:07.495 --> 00:05:12.695
some relative values and be able to give some feedback very quickly

88
00:05:12.695 --> 00:05:15.495
back to management or the customers.

89
00:05:15.495 --> 00:05:16.906
It's team oriented.

90
00:05:16.906 --> 00:05:23.024
I am such a believer in team work and teams getting the job

91
00:05:23.024 --> 00:05:25.161
done and leveraging each other's skills.

92
00:05:25.161 --> 00:05:28.495
So you're going to have inputs from a multi-disciplined team.

93
00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:30.995
Different points of view, database and software,

94
00:05:30.995 --> 00:05:35.649
and maybe someone on the shop floor and someone in purchasing,

95
00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:40.495
who knows, that can all participate in that process.

96
00:05:40.495 --> 00:05:43.572
And of course it's always the focus on the customer.

97
00:05:43.572 --> 00:05:44.495
That's so important.

98
00:05:44.495 --> 00:05:46.965
User stories are the customer's requirements,

99
00:05:46.965 --> 00:05:51.495
in their own words, things that they can actually relate to.

100
00:05:51.495 --> 00:05:57.495
So I like this whole approach of Agile and the Agile estimation process.

101
00:05:57.495 --> 00:06:05.000
Now let's move on to the next section and talk about Agile estimating techniques.
