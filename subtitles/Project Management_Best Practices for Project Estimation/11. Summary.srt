00:00:00,392 --> 00:00:04,392
Our final section of this module is an overview summary.

2
00:00:04,392 --> 00:00:09,535
This module has covered many practical and simple tools and techniques to

3
00:00:09,535 --> 00:00:12,892
help improve your estimating skills and techniques.

4
00:00:12,892 --> 00:00:17,392
Let's review the key points on the next slide.

5
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:18,210
Summary.

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,483
Constantly refine your techniques.

7
00:00:21,483 --> 00:00:26,392
Observe what works and what doesn't.

8
00:00:26,392 --> 00:00:31,392
View my information as a starter kit and improve upon it yourself.

9
00:00:31,392 --> 00:00:35,392
Include as many subject matter experts as possible.

10
00:00:35,392 --> 00:00:41,392
Work as much as you can as a team, and pull in the right smart people.

11
00:00:41,392 --> 00:00:44,249
Track your actual cost.

12
00:00:44,249 --> 00:00:46,392
Track, track, track.

13
00:00:46,392 --> 00:00:51,392
As you learn, tracking your time plays a key role in producing quality estimates.

14
00:00:51,392 --> 00:00:55,392
Tracking is critical to your success.

15
00:00:55,392 --> 00:00:59,392
Educate your management on why estimation is good for business.

16
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:03,392
You may need to explain to management the benefits of a good estimation process,

17
00:01:03,392 --> 00:01:07,892
but also if they see your documents and templates,

18
00:01:07,892 --> 00:01:12,392
they'll begin to build trust and support your efforts.

19
00:01:12,392 --> 00:01:16,392
Ideal capacity is the best place to start.

20
00:01:16,392 --> 00:01:20,627
Determine what your team is truly capable to produce.

21
00:01:20,627 --> 00:01:24,392
This is critical for quality estimates and planning.

22
00:01:24,392 --> 00:01:26,258
Use resource schedule planning.

23
00:01:26,258 --> 00:01:31,392
This provides really good granularity of your resources over a timeframe.

24
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:37,215
Arbitrary padding must be avoided, and is never a good thing.

25
00:01:37,215 --> 00:01:40,392
Only managed buffers should be used.

26
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:44,392
Schedules are the next step after your incremental estimates.

27
00:01:44,392 --> 00:01:46,725
Estimates alone are not enough.

28
00:01:46,725 --> 00:01:51,392
You next need to determine what the schedule will be.

29
00:01:51,392 --> 00:01:55,392
The 5 and 50 rules help you manage the work effort.

30
00:01:55,392 --> 00:01:59,792
5 minutes to review the assigned task and ask any questions,

31
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:03,392
and at the 50% mark are you 50% complete?

32
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:07,392
It's just plain, good project management.

33
00:02:07,392 --> 00:02:10,392
In the next module, Agile Estimation,

34
00:02:10,392 --> 00:02:18,000
we'll explore how the approach to estimation has changed in the world of Agile. See you there.
