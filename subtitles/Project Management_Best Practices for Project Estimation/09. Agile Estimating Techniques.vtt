00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:07.769
Now let's look at an Agile estimating process in a prescriptive approach.

2
00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:10.710
That is, step by step.

3
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.585
Let's start with an overview of the technique for making an Agile estimate.

4
00:00:15.585 --> 00:00:16.710
Step by step.

5
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.460
First, you collect your user stories.

6
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.710
Second, estimate size of the user story using story points.

7
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.710
Prioritize your user stories by using the story points again.

8
00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.139
Determine your iteration deliverables.

9
00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:38.710
Determine your velocity.

10
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.710
Develop an Agile schedule.

11
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.710
Perform re-estimation.

12
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.710
And lastly best practice framework.

13
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:55.710
So let's cover each of these steps in more detail in the following slides.

14
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.853
So first, collect your user stories.

15
00:00:57.853 --> 00:01:00.353
Through discussions with your customer or product

16
00:01:00.353 --> 00:01:02.556
manager you collect user stories.

17
00:01:02.556 --> 00:01:07.437
These are brief statements of the intent or need that the

18
00:01:07.437 --> 00:01:10.710
system must do for a particular user or users.

19
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.787
And they're written in the user's own words.

20
00:01:13.787 --> 00:01:15.710
They're not technical in nature.

21
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.710
You want them focused on the value or result they get from doing this thing.

22
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.710
User stories help bridge the gap between customers and developers.

23
00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.310
Now I call your attention to the right is a little template

24
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.710
I like to use to create user stories.

25
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:40.710
So, as a role, I want to achieve a goal so that I get some benefit.

26
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.710
For example, as a student, I want to enroll in courses,

27
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.074
so that I can get a bachelor's degree.

28
00:01:51.074 --> 00:01:52.710
Something like that.

29
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.710
So here's a simple list and a sample of user stories following the template.

30
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.710
Enable customers to have credit card purchases to increase sales.

31
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.710
So the role is customers, the goal is to be able to do credit card purchases,

32
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.710
and the benefit is to increase sales.

33
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:16.710
The next example is enable suppliers to print shipping labels to save on costs.

34
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.619
So, the role is suppliers, the goal is to print shipping labels,

35
00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:25.710
and the benefit is of course to save on costs.

36
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.710
You might want to check out my companion Pluralsight course,

37
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.310
Best Practices for Requirements Gathering in which I go

38
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.710
into more detail on user stories.

39
00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:44.000
Remember user stories are not software or technical in nature at all. Now let's go on to the next step.
