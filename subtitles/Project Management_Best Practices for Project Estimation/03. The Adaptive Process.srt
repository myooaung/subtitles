1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:07,310
The Agile philosophy supports, even encourages, an adaptive process.

2
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:12,373
Clint Eastwood once said in a movie, "You adapt,

3
00:00:12,373 --> 00:00:15,748
you overcome, you improvise, let's move!

4
00:00:15,748 --> 00:00:20,401
" It is harder to adapt if you are taking big,

5
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:24,492
risky steps and easier to adapt if you're taking smaller,

6
00:00:24,492 --> 00:00:25,310
safer steps.

7
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:31,310
The term adaptive is a common descriptor of the Agile process.

8
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,310
Always adapting to requirements, budgets,

9
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:40,310
resources, staff, schedule etc., that are always changing around us.

10
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:47,080
Requirements are guaranteed to be uncertain and unpredictable.

11
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:51,310
And therefore, so are estimates.

12
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:54,644
You might want to check out another one of my Pluralsight courses

13
00:00:54,644 --> 00:00:56,310
on Best Practices for Requirements Gathering.

14
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:01,849
My approach and process assumes that requirements are

15
00:01:01,849 --> 00:01:05,310
in fact uncertain and unpredictable.

16
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:11,129
Constantly adapt and re-plan your work and activities.

17
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:13,310
Basically, that's Agile.

18
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:18,310
You're going to re-plan and re-estimate all the time.

19
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:24,310
Now let's explore what makes projects Agile.

20
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,219
The Agile philosophy.

21
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:31,310
Fundamentally, it's a different process from traditional development.

22
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:36,310
Traditional development has sometimes been known as the waterfall approach.

23
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:42,310
In Agile we want to satisfy the highest priority for the customer first.

24
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:47,605
Yes, we always want and wanted to satisfy the customer,

25
00:01:47,605 --> 00:01:51,310
but the process is more customer centric.

26
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:55,977
Accomplished by early and continuous release of

27
00:01:55,977 --> 00:01:59,310
immediately usable deliverables and software.

28
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:05,177
So the Agile approach wants to avoid long periods of development,

29
00:02:05,177 --> 00:02:07,310
then tests, then deployment.

30
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,837
But I also use the word deliverable here,

31
00:02:09,837 --> 00:02:12,047
since a release could be a document,

32
00:02:12,047 --> 00:02:14,910
requirement or an estimate and not necessarily software.

33
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:19,310
We're going to talk about that more later in this module.

34
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:26,310
In an Agile environment, we want it where changing requirements are welcomed.

35
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,837
Yes, I know that sounds strange.

36
00:02:28,837 --> 00:02:30,521
Even late in development.

37
00:02:30,521 --> 00:02:34,310
We're going to also talk about that more later.

38
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:38,310
Agile provides a more flexible approach to system development.

39
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:44,310
It's really short durations, and just in time approach.

40
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:50,310
And lastly, customers realize a much greater return on investment, sooner.

41
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:58,310
They see and use features sooner, rather than later.

42
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:03,310
Agile is an adaptive process.

43
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:08,935
"Wouldn't it be nice... if we could figure out a way to deliver software so

44
00:03:08,935 --> 00:03:13,521
fast that our customers don't have time to change their minds.

45
00:03:13,521 --> 00:03:17,310
" That's a very interesting quote by Tom Poppendieck.

46
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:23,134
The longer the period of time between when we begin writing

47
00:03:23,134 --> 00:03:26,310
software and when we deliver software,

48
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,310
the greater the chance that the business has changed.

49
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:34,310
Maybe resources have changed, budgets or schedules have changed.

50
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:39,310
The customer is still left with, possibly, nothing.

51
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:42,003
So users aren't necessarily indecisive.

52
00:03:42,003 --> 00:03:43,618
Yes, some are.

53
00:03:43,618 --> 00:03:46,310
But in general, they're not.

54
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:51,710
But dynamic business requirements drive this unpredictability in their

55
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:57,310
environment and thus drive unpredictable changes.

56
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:02,560
So what he is trying to say is how do you change our software

57
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,525
engineering approach in such a way as to accommodate the rapid

58
00:04:06,525 --> 00:04:08,310
changes in our business environment?

59
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,755
And in a nutshell,

60
00:04:10,755 --> 00:04:16,866
this is one of the big reasons that help create

61
00:04:16,866 --> 00:04:19,310
Agile-based planning and estimating.

62
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:27,644
So, if the business world is so unpredictable, what must we be able to do?

63
00:04:27,644 --> 00:04:31,000
And that's adapt. Let's explore this further.
