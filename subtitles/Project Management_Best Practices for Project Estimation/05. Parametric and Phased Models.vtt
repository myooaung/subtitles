00:00:00.481 --> 00:00:04.481
Let's talk about the next model, parametric.

2
00:00:04.481 --> 00:00:09.481
This is where we use parameters to help determine an estimate.

3
00:00:09.481 --> 00:00:14.390
We also perform this early in the estimating process and so these

4
00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.481
requirements can be a bit soft as before as well.

5
00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:21.338
Developed by identifying the number of work units

6
00:00:21.338 --> 00:00:23.481
and the duration per work unit.

7
00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:25.404
So what's a work unit?

8
00:00:25.404 --> 00:00:28.481
Well, it's really just something you can count.

9
00:00:28.481 --> 00:00:31.592
For example, we can count lines of code,

10
00:00:31.592 --> 00:00:34.314
we can count number of stored procedures,

11
00:00:34.314 --> 00:00:36.865
number of screens, things like that.

12
00:00:36.865 --> 00:00:41.481
So here's an example of common work units and estimates.

13
00:00:41.481 --> 00:00:46.481
So for each screen or page maybe 28 hours, maybe we count up 100 screens.

14
00:00:46.481 --> 00:00:48.059
Report layouts take 12 hours,

15
00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.481
and maybe the sequel to gather the data for the report is 8 hours.

16
00:00:52.481 --> 00:00:55.481
So maybe a report is 20 hours.

17
00:00:55.481 --> 00:01:00.481
API, a lot of times we have to connect an Application Program Interface.

18
00:01:00.481 --> 00:01:04.586
We must connect to different types of systems and maybe the average takes

19
00:01:04.586 --> 00:01:08.481
40 hours to write the code to connect to other systems.

20
00:01:08.481 --> 00:01:13.481
Maybe a web service takes 80 hours to do.

21
00:01:13.481 --> 00:01:15.623
So, integration endpoints with third-party vendors,

22
00:01:15.623 --> 00:01:18.481
maybe 25 hours to do something like that.

23
00:01:18.481 --> 00:01:18.954
Now,

24
00:01:18.954 --> 00:01:23.691
this is somewhat similar to historic and heuristic in that

25
00:01:23.691 --> 00:01:27.481
there were items we're counting there as well.

26
00:01:27.481 --> 00:01:29.390
So these are kind of a blend.

27
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.299
What is it that I can count?

28
00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.481
Think about all the things you can count.

29
00:01:33.481 --> 00:01:35.814
I can count screens or a report.

30
00:01:35.814 --> 00:01:38.481
Think of all those things you can count.

31
00:01:38.481 --> 00:01:42.481
Then, look at the history, have I implemented those before?

32
00:01:42.481 --> 00:01:46.481
And look at the history, the actual hours from before.

33
00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:47.433
Or if you haven't,

34
00:01:47.433 --> 00:01:50.528
heuristically look at your own experiences of your team to see if you

35
00:01:50.528 --> 00:01:54.716
can apply those hours to what you are counting.

36
00:01:54.716 --> 00:02:02.481
So the parametric, historical, and heuristic are really kind of blended together.

37
00:02:02.481 --> 00:02:06.481
Our next model is phased allocation.

38
00:02:06.481 --> 00:02:14.586
This is when our project is carried out or performed in stages or phases,

39
00:02:14.586 --> 00:02:17.481
also known as distribution estimating.

40
00:02:17.481 --> 00:02:22.481
Uses project phase percentages to arrive at an estimate.

41
00:02:22.481 --> 00:02:28.481
So, each phase helps predict the following phase or phases.

42
00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:31.606
Can be used if enough information is known about even

43
00:02:31.606 --> 00:02:33.481
just one of the phases potentially.

44
00:02:33.481 --> 00:02:37.481
Typically though it'll be the first phase.

45
00:02:37.481 --> 00:02:38.052
And again,

46
00:02:38.052 --> 00:02:40.623
the other phases are estimated by extrapolating how much

47
00:02:40.623 --> 00:02:43.481
time it took you to do the phase you're in,

48
00:02:43.481 --> 00:02:47.481
with what you think those phase allocations are.

49
00:02:47.481 --> 00:02:53.481
For example, each phase is allocated a percent of the expected total time.

50
00:02:53.481 --> 00:02:55.662
Maybe the initiation or discovery phase,

51
00:02:55.662 --> 00:03:00.338
you know the PDD phase, takes 10%, we think,

52
00:03:00.338 --> 00:03:02.481
of overall projects.

53
00:03:02.481 --> 00:03:06.481
We also think design and analysis phase is 20%.

54
00:03:06.481 --> 00:03:11.865
Construction and development phase is %60, that's the biggie usually.

55
00:03:11.865 --> 00:03:13.481
Deploy phase 10%.

56
00:03:13.481 --> 00:03:17.381
So basically, if it took us 100 hours to do the discovery phase,

57
00:03:17.381 --> 00:03:21.481
we might predict that the design phase would be 200 hours and the

58
00:03:21.481 --> 00:03:24.814
construction and development phase would be 6 times the 100,

59
00:03:24.814 --> 00:03:26.481
which would be 600 hours.

60
00:03:26.481 --> 00:03:28.833
And the deploy phase would be 100 hours.

61
00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:31.481
So again, if we think that's the general time,

62
00:03:31.481 --> 00:03:31.793
again,

63
00:03:31.793 --> 00:03:44.000
we can use historical data to maybe predict the time we've used in these phases. So here's, just again, another approach to making estimates.
