00:00:00.971 --> 00:00:06.971
Underpinning the entire estimating process is effective time tracking.

2
00:00:06.971 --> 00:00:12.971
Let's further explore why it is so important for you and your projects.

3
00:00:12.971 --> 00:00:18.971
Okay, here is a Michael proverb on tracking your time.

4
00:00:18.971 --> 00:00:23.304
If you don't track your time and I know many of you don't,

5
00:00:23.304 --> 00:00:26.971
but I really want to convince you to track your time.

6
00:00:26.971 --> 00:00:34.500
But if you don't, there is just no point in doing estimates in the first place.

7
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.971
Period!

8
00:00:34.971 --> 00:00:39.471
Tracking your time accurately will help you have a

9
00:00:39.471 --> 00:00:43.971
repeatable estimation process, will help you better predict your estimates.

10
00:00:43.971 --> 00:00:51.971
And lastly help you improve and make adjustments to your estimation process.

11
00:00:51.971 --> 00:00:55.971
Finally, your project begins.

12
00:00:55.971 --> 00:00:59.828
You have just done all this great hard work,

13
00:00:59.828 --> 00:01:01.971
iterating through several estimation cycles.

14
00:01:01.971 --> 00:01:06.125
The project is given the go ahead to begin.

15
00:01:06.125 --> 00:01:07.971
Your team is excited.

16
00:01:07.971 --> 00:01:12.971
You have your bottom-up detail tasks and you assign them out to your team.

17
00:01:12.971 --> 00:01:15.971
Your team starts development.

18
00:01:15.971 --> 00:01:17.425
Now what?

19
00:01:17.425 --> 00:01:21.062
How is the project doing?

20
00:01:21.062 --> 00:01:23.971
Are you on target?

21
00:01:23.971 --> 00:01:25.638
Are your estimates panning out?

22
00:01:25.638 --> 00:01:28.638
How would you even know the answer to those

23
00:01:28.638 --> 00:01:31.114
questions if you didn't track your time?

24
00:01:31.114 --> 00:01:32.185
Your stakeholders, customers,

25
00:01:32.185 --> 00:01:43.000
and/or management will be asking these questions and you better have an answer. So let's explore the many reasons why you should track your time.
