1
00:00:01,243 --> 00:00:04,354
Predicting elapsed time is very difficult indeed.

2
00:00:04,354 --> 00:00:09,243
Each way of measuring is important and serves its own purpose.

3
00:00:09,243 --> 00:00:13,772
So we're going to talk about reasons for ideal time and

4
00:00:13,772 --> 00:00:16,243
some good reasons for elapsed time.

5
00:00:16,243 --> 00:00:20,528
These are some of the elements that drive and extend

6
00:00:20,528 --> 00:00:22,243
unpredictability for elapsed time.

7
00:00:22,243 --> 00:00:27,243
Okay, reasons for ideal time, referees need to measure each quarter.

8
00:00:27,243 --> 00:00:30,243
So I'm kind of using the football analogy again.

9
00:00:30,243 --> 00:00:33,085
Referees need to know when the game is over.

10
00:00:33,085 --> 00:00:36,243
So there's a lot of good reasons for ideal time.

11
00:00:36,243 --> 00:00:38,868
Same thing in project management, making estimates.

12
00:00:38,868 --> 00:00:45,909
It's very important to know the true ideal time of what a task takes to do.

13
00:00:45,909 --> 00:00:50,624
And basically what you're doing is is you're coming

14
00:00:50,624 --> 00:00:54,180
up with a common denominator, removing all assumptions,

15
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,243
because they can be so varied by each person and personality and experience.

16
00:00:58,243 --> 00:01:03,243
And here are some reasons for elapsed time, because this is important as well.

17
00:01:03,243 --> 00:01:08,243
You will need to know how long to get a babysitter for your children perhaps.

18
00:01:08,243 --> 00:01:12,243
You will need to also plan driving time to and from the game.

19
00:01:12,243 --> 00:01:15,243
And you may even need to fill your tank with gas.

20
00:01:15,243 --> 00:01:18,243
So these are some really good reasons for elapsed time as well.

21
00:01:18,243 --> 00:01:20,137
And, in the project manager world,

22
00:01:20,137 --> 00:01:24,243
you need to know that someone may be on vacation for a while,

23
00:01:24,243 --> 00:01:27,243
may be sick for a while, may be on another project for a while.

24
00:01:27,243 --> 00:01:32,243
So, we want to know ideal time and then we want to know elapsed time.

25
00:01:32,243 --> 00:01:37,576
Think of one as the raw hours to get the job done and the other one,

26
00:01:37,576 --> 00:01:41,348
the amount of elapsed time, wall clock or calendar,

27
00:01:41,348 --> 00:01:46,085
in which that task could be in fact performed.

28
00:01:46,085 --> 00:01:49,243
So it's more of a schedule.

29
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:55,243
Now let's discuss more about why estimating with ideal time is best.

30
00:01:55,243 --> 00:02:00,243
Estimating ideal time is almost always easier and more accurate to predict.

31
00:02:00,243 --> 00:02:04,180
Remember the question, how long is a football game?

32
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,368
60 minutes in ideal time.

33
00:02:06,368 --> 00:02:07,243
Clear, concise.

34
00:02:07,243 --> 00:02:09,243
And we can build from there.

35
00:02:09,243 --> 00:02:13,443
Estimating elapsed time is much harder, has more variables,

36
00:02:13,443 --> 00:02:16,243
and is more difficult to predict.

37
00:02:16,243 --> 00:02:19,879
Where before, how long is a football game?

38
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:21,243
Well, it depends.

39
00:02:21,243 --> 00:02:26,627
And we discussed commercials, half time length,

40
00:02:26,627 --> 00:02:31,243
injuries, penalties, weather, and other elements.

41
00:02:31,243 --> 00:02:34,055
Your project will have the same variables and unknowns

42
00:02:34,055 --> 00:02:36,243
that will make your life more difficult.

43
00:02:36,243 --> 00:02:40,243
Hence we must start with ideal time and work from there.

44
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:40,831
Remember,

45
00:02:40,831 --> 00:02:50,243
being able to predict an estimate is a key skill and major point of this course.

46
00:02:50,243 --> 00:02:53,909
Beginning your estimates with fuzzy elapse time is not a good

47
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:59,243
approach and in fact is very difficult to predict.

48
00:02:59,243 --> 00:03:03,243
So we're going to talk about unpredictable elements,

49
00:03:03,243 --> 00:03:07,176
such as sick time, personal issues, phone calls,

50
00:03:07,176 --> 00:03:11,376
the boss calls, email you have to go through,

51
00:03:11,376 --> 00:03:14,334
bug fixing, changing tasks, priority updates,

52
00:03:14,334 --> 00:03:15,425
production failures.

53
00:03:15,425 --> 00:03:20,176
All these elements will affect your team and affect

54
00:03:20,176 --> 00:03:21,576
your estimating capabilities.

55
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:26,243
These are all very unpredictable and let's just engage that,

56
00:03:26,243 --> 00:03:27,443
we know that,

57
00:03:27,443 --> 00:03:32,243
so let's start with ideal time first and then add on the

58
00:03:32,243 --> 00:03:35,314
appropriate hours into the schedule to accommodate these.

59
00:03:35,314 --> 00:03:39,243
And we're going to talk about those in the next section.

60
00:03:39,243 --> 00:03:43,443
Somewhat predictable elements might be meetings,

61
00:03:43,443 --> 00:03:46,243
demonstrations, developing an architecture.

62
00:03:46,243 --> 00:03:49,243
I may know how many meetings I may need for this project,

63
00:03:49,243 --> 00:03:51,243
I know I need to do three demonstrations.

64
00:03:51,243 --> 00:03:53,453
I must lay out the architecture.

65
00:03:53,453 --> 00:03:56,401
Two of my guys need to get trained,

66
00:03:56,401 --> 00:03:59,822
I have four project reviews and maybe a management review.

67
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,716
I know maybe my team size.

68
00:04:01,716 --> 00:04:04,243
I have a steering committee to report to.

69
00:04:04,243 --> 00:04:07,243
And I have some developer tools maybe to be trained on.

70
00:04:07,243 --> 00:04:09,993
These kind of things I might be able to better predict,

71
00:04:09,993 --> 00:04:11,243
put into an estimating model,

72
00:04:11,243 --> 00:04:15,243
and come up with the ideal time in hours to do those.

73
00:04:15,243 --> 00:04:20,843
On the left side of the slide, it's very difficult to predict sick time,

74
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:23,243
personal issues, phone calls and such.

75
00:04:23,243 --> 00:04:24,576
That's much more of a challenge.

76
00:04:24,576 --> 00:04:27,020
Each of these we're going to talk about in the following

77
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,743
sections to make it easier and more understandable for you

78
00:04:31,743 --> 00:04:34,243
to predict really good estimates.

79
00:04:34,243 --> 00:04:40,028
In summary for this section, when building your estimates,

80
00:04:40,028 --> 00:04:43,243
start with ideal time, always!

81
00:04:43,243 --> 00:04:46,290
I want to really make this point clear.

82
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:51,243
The first step in building an estimate is to use ideal time, always.

83
00:04:51,243 --> 00:05:00,000
Now let's see how we can apply our knowledge of ideal and elapsed time, in building team estimates in the next section.
