1
00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:04,209
Now let's determine velocity.

2
00:00:04,209 --> 00:00:08,209
Remember team capacity, from the previous module?

3
00:00:08,209 --> 00:00:12,472
In the Agile world it is known as velocity.

4
00:00:12,472 --> 00:00:17,209
Velocity is a measure of the team's rate of progress.

5
00:00:17,209 --> 00:00:19,209
And you can see the little velocity chart to the right.

6
00:00:19,209 --> 00:00:22,709
What I'd also recommend is after each iteration,

7
00:00:22,709 --> 00:00:27,959
you determine how many story points you produced and just put it on a chart.

8
00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:30,709
And over time you will see what your average number of

9
00:00:30,709 --> 00:00:34,390
story points that you could produce, per iteration is.

10
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,209
And that's your velocity.

11
00:00:36,209 --> 00:00:39,893
You fold that back into the planning process and you

12
00:00:39,893 --> 00:00:42,103
know how much you can produce.

13
00:00:42,103 --> 00:00:43,209
There's an example.

14
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:48,209
Let's say the team delivered the 41 points, in a 3-week iteration.

15
00:00:48,209 --> 00:00:48,598
So,

16
00:00:48,598 --> 00:00:52,875
all the different user stories that added up to the 41

17
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:55,209
points were completed in 3 weeks.

18
00:00:55,209 --> 00:01:00,209
So the velocity of the team is 41 points per iteration.

19
00:01:00,209 --> 00:01:04,027
As the team works through multiple iterations,

20
00:01:04,027 --> 00:01:08,352
the velocity is recalculated to be as accurate as possible,

21
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:11,209
to help predict the productivity of the team.

22
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:16,209
That's very important for planning future iterations and for scheduling.

23
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:22,209
So a simple chart, as you see on the screen, is certainly appropriate.

24
00:01:22,209 --> 00:01:26,261
You can see the similarities between team capacity in the previous

25
00:01:26,261 --> 00:01:29,209
module and team velocity in the Agile world.

26
00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:33,209
The whole Agile process is seen as delivering business functions.

27
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:37,209
You don't typically talk in terms of hours or sick time or computer tasks,

28
00:01:37,209 --> 00:01:41,572
like designing the database for example.

29
00:01:41,572 --> 00:01:45,209
Now let's do some scheduling.

30
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:48,209
Here is a simple way to schedule in Agile.

31
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:51,209
Add up all the story points for the project.

32
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:54,209
If you know the team's velocity, which you should,

33
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:58,915
you can divide the total story points by the iteration's

34
00:01:58,915 --> 00:02:02,209
capacity to determine the number of iterations.

35
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:05,845
You then turn the iterations into a schedule.

36
00:02:05,845 --> 00:02:07,209
It's that simple.

37
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:10,051
Example, we have 201 story points.

38
00:02:10,051 --> 00:02:16,209
If an iteration is 3 weeks, and the team's velocity is 41 points,

39
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:19,156
we divide the 41 into the 201.

40
00:02:19,156 --> 00:02:22,103
So basically, it'll take about 5 iterations,

41
00:02:22,103 --> 00:02:29,209
or 15 weeks, to accomplish all of those user stories into usable software.

42
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:34,342
So just like in the previous modules, we first derived size,

43
00:02:34,342 --> 00:02:38,132
hours versus story points, old school versus new school,

44
00:02:38,132 --> 00:02:39,286
if you will.

45
00:02:39,286 --> 00:02:41,209
And then we derived schedule.

46
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:48,209
Okay, now let's see how we do re-estimation.

47
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,709
Now let's do some re-estimation, Agile style.

48
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:56,209
But first, remember in the previous modules we discussed the hybrid model?

49
00:02:56,209 --> 00:03:01,209
It used actual hours posted against tasks during the project execution.

50
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:03,209
And then based on the team's capacity,

51
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:05,209
we could then re-estimate the remaining work.

52
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:07,562
Very important, very handy tool.

53
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:08,973
Same for Agile.

54
00:03:08,973 --> 00:03:14,444
If the velocity changes based on the team size or skill mix,

55
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,267
sick time,

56
00:03:15,267 --> 00:03:19,797
etc., you can use your newly adjusted velocity to recalculate the

57
00:03:19,797 --> 00:03:23,764
remaining iterations and then apply it to the calendar.

58
00:03:23,764 --> 00:03:26,875
And now you have a new schedule.

59
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,209
It's that easy.

60
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:35,209
Okay, now let's recap the section on the next slide.

61
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:39,875
Now let's recap this section by what I call the

62
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:42,209
best practice framework for Agile.

63
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:47,009
Agile plans are typically more reliable because they are

64
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:54,663
planning for a smaller time horizon, planning for a smaller amount of work,

65
00:03:54,663 --> 00:03:57,209
focused on usable features.

66
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:00,709
Remember the more time you spend planning,

67
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:05,209
sometimes the less likely it will add any value.

68
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:10,209
Short iterations are very important and very successful.

69
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:16,209
Keep in mind, there's a diminishing return on time spent estimating.

70
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:20,209
It takes a greater effort for a more accurate estimate.

71
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:22,209
It is a balance though.

72
00:04:22,209 --> 00:04:24,542
Will it be worth the extra time?

73
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:29,209
It'll be up to you to decide as a project manager or a leader.

74
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:36,209
There is a relationship between estimating accuracy and effort.

75
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:40,663
Agile teams typically acknowledge that they cannot

76
00:04:40,663 --> 00:04:44,709
eliminate uncertainty from estimates and embrace that

77
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:54,000
small efforts may result in big gains. Okay, now let's move on to the summary of this module.
