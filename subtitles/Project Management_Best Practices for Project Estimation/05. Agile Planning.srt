00:00:00,819 --> 00:00:04,486
How Agile philosophy affects estimation.

2
00:00:04,486 --> 00:00:11,819
Now let's explore project estimation from the perspective of Agile.

3
00:00:11,819 --> 00:00:13,686
Agile planning, Patton style.

4
00:00:13,686 --> 00:00:18,819
"A good plan" or estimate, I added that to the quote,

5
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:25,281
"violently executed now... is better than a perfect plan executed next week.

6
00:00:25,281 --> 00:00:28,819
" That was stated by General George Patton.

7
00:00:28,819 --> 00:00:32,937
What Patton, or Agile, philosophy is trying to say is,

8
00:00:32,937 --> 00:00:35,819
don't take too much time to plan.

9
00:00:35,819 --> 00:00:38,444
The longer it takes to make perfect,

10
00:00:38,444 --> 00:00:42,819
the more likely it will actually not be perfect because the

11
00:00:42,819 --> 00:00:45,819
opportunities of success may have passed.

12
00:00:45,819 --> 00:00:49,819
This is not to say that we don't plan anymore.

13
00:00:49,819 --> 00:00:52,219
It's just a bit different approach.

14
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,819
And let's see how.

15
00:00:53,819 --> 00:00:55,701
Old thinking, new thinking.

16
00:00:55,701 --> 00:01:01,348
On the left will be the typical way we have thought about

17
00:01:01,348 --> 00:01:02,819
projects and planning and making estimates.

18
00:01:02,819 --> 00:01:07,819
And on the right will be the Agile way, what I'm calling the new thinking.

19
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:09,358
On the left, Typical,

20
00:01:09,358 --> 00:01:14,319
we plan by a series of tasks and/or steps that typically are

21
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:17,819
very detailed and more IT related sometimes.

22
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:19,503
On the Agile side,

23
00:01:19,503 --> 00:01:23,293
it's more a series of useful capabilities that we're

24
00:01:23,293 --> 00:01:25,819
going to provide to the customer.

25
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,419
Next, on the left,

26
00:01:27,419 --> 00:01:31,419
a typical way of thinking is these are then incorporated

27
00:01:31,419 --> 00:01:33,819
into a very detailed project plan.

28
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:38,819
And from an Agile perspective, it's incorporated into a product release.

29
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:44,419
It's actually tied right to what we're going to give the customer,

30
00:01:44,419 --> 00:01:45,819
their new product.

31
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:50,319
Typical, more detailed level, and on the Agile side,

32
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,878
more of an abstract approach to making estimates and planning.

33
00:01:54,878 --> 00:01:59,819
And we're going to talk about that throughout this section as well.

34
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:05,819
Lastly, we're still delivering things to the customer, in both cases, of course.

35
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:10,819
But, in the Agile approach the customer can relate better to what's delivered.

36
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:16,819
Because these are useful capabilities or features that they can relate to.

37
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:19,819
So the old way, or typical way of thinking,

38
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:24,319
is that we know or we think we know everything necessary to

39
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,819
create that task list or steps for the project.

40
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:33,219
The new way is that we assume we don't know everything,

41
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:36,819
which is usually true in the world and life.

42
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:39,930
In fact, maybe very little we know.

43
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:44,375
And in each step of the way, we are learning,

44
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:55,000
re-planning, re-estimating with each iteration and release, in the Agile process and planning activities.
