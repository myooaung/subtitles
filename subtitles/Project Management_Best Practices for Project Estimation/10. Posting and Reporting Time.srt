00:00:00,377 --> 00:00:04,377
Now here's a very simple example of posting time.

2
00:00:04,377 --> 00:00:08,907
You can see below is a spreadsheet or maybe a web-based

3
00:00:08,907 --> 00:00:11,377
application that's captured the following information.

4
00:00:11,377 --> 00:00:18,127
I call your attention to the heading up above, in darker blue.

5
00:00:18,127 --> 00:00:22,195
Date, Hours, Customer, Project, the Resource or person,

6
00:00:22,195 --> 00:00:25,377
the Task with task number, and Description.

7
00:00:25,377 --> 00:00:27,464
So each row is an entry.

8
00:00:27,464 --> 00:00:31,986
And as an example, that row that I just highlighted in light blue,

9
00:00:31,986 --> 00:00:33,377
from left to right,

10
00:00:33,377 --> 00:00:37,377
so on 9/19 eight hours were spent and it was charged to customer Michael Inc.

11
00:00:37,377 --> 00:00:39,711
under the Project Enrollment-Development.

12
00:00:39,711 --> 00:00:44,377
The Resource for this particular entry is Jim.

13
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:48,111
The Task was 140, Consult with GAIT SMEs,

14
00:00:48,111 --> 00:00:53,377
and the Description of the task was Continue reviewing the database to

15
00:00:53,377 --> 00:00:56,577
identify the tables needed for creating a login,

16
00:00:56,577 --> 00:00:58,488
profile information, company, etc.

17
00:00:58,488 --> 00:01:02,377
That's one timesheet entry for a person.

18
00:01:02,377 --> 00:01:05,711
So you collect these up each day, for each person,

19
00:01:05,711 --> 00:01:07,044
on each task, project,

20
00:01:07,044 --> 00:01:11,377
customer and you'll have your historical actuals to use against your estimates.

21
00:01:11,377 --> 00:01:19,377
And to apply to all the other estimating models we talked about in the past.

22
00:01:19,377 --> 00:01:22,377
What to report?

23
00:01:22,377 --> 00:01:26,167
I use this report to get a quick view or status on

24
00:01:26,167 --> 00:01:28,377
progress of each task in a project.

25
00:01:28,377 --> 00:01:31,377
Maybe something like this would be good for you too.

26
00:01:31,377 --> 00:01:31,711
So,

27
00:01:31,711 --> 00:01:34,711
on the previous slide was the time entry values

28
00:01:34,711 --> 00:01:36,377
themselves that each person entered.

29
00:01:36,377 --> 00:01:40,092
And on this slide I'm showing you an output report that I can

30
00:01:40,092 --> 00:01:42,377
look at quickly to see how we're doing.

31
00:01:42,377 --> 00:01:46,266
At the top row are the headings, left to right,

32
00:01:46,266 --> 00:01:49,377
Name, that's the task name and the number.

33
00:01:49,377 --> 00:01:50,444
Charged Hours.

34
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:54,177
Maybe I had some No Charge Hours.

35
00:01:54,177 --> 00:01:55,244
Estimated Hours.

36
00:01:55,244 --> 00:01:58,377
% Consumed, the Difference, and the Start Date,

37
00:01:58,377 --> 00:02:00,377
and the Last Worked Date for that task.

38
00:02:00,377 --> 00:02:01,817
These are handy items.

39
00:02:01,817 --> 00:02:07,577
So for the very first one I see the task, I see that there is 14.

40
00:02:07,577 --> 00:02:09,377
5 hours charged against it.

41
00:02:09,377 --> 00:02:12,377
The total estimate is 26 hours.

42
00:02:12,377 --> 00:02:14,377
So we've used 55.

43
00:02:14,377 --> 00:02:16,377
77% of the time.

44
00:02:16,377 --> 00:02:20,260
I could then meet with the software engineer and say do

45
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,377
you think you're about halfway done?

46
00:02:22,377 --> 00:02:24,559
If the answer is yes, we're on track.

47
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:28,377
If the answer is no, I can find out why and take corrective action,

48
00:02:28,377 --> 00:02:30,155
specifically for that task.

49
00:02:30,155 --> 00:02:35,044
But I could always learn from that to maybe modify and

50
00:02:35,044 --> 00:02:38,520
improve the estimating and scheduling process,

51
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,377
upstream for future projects.

52
00:02:41,377 --> 00:02:47,377
Now based on analyzing progress, I may need to revisit the estimates.

53
00:02:47,377 --> 00:02:49,377
And let's see how.

54
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:51,877
Revising estimates after project launch.

55
00:02:51,877 --> 00:02:54,377
This is very, very important.

56
00:02:54,377 --> 00:02:58,377
And earlier in the module we talked about the estimating hybrid model.

57
00:02:58,377 --> 00:03:00,599
And this is what we want to do.

58
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:05,092
Prior to launching the project, our top down model estimated say for example,

59
00:03:05,092 --> 00:03:07,377
16 hours per screen.

60
00:03:07,377 --> 00:03:10,044
Since we're tracking the time now,

61
00:03:10,044 --> 00:03:15,377
we can see exactly how many hours per screen were actually used.

62
00:03:15,377 --> 00:03:19,377
So the tracking system reveals for us the following things.

63
00:03:19,377 --> 00:03:23,234
Actual hours of 12 hours, on average, per screen.

64
00:03:23,234 --> 00:03:25,377
Hey, we're ahead of plan.

65
00:03:25,377 --> 00:03:29,377
Initially we planned for 16 hours and that was in our estimates,

66
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:32,520
but now that we've been working the project for a while,

67
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,377
we see that the actual results are only 12 hours.

68
00:03:35,377 --> 00:03:38,527
Or maybe the actuals were 23 hours per screen.

69
00:03:38,527 --> 00:03:42,377
Uh, we're not on track, in fact we're actually behind plan.

70
00:03:42,377 --> 00:03:44,848
And we may need to revisit.

71
00:03:44,848 --> 00:03:49,377
So either case, we should re-estimate or modify our plans accordingly.

72
00:03:49,377 --> 00:03:51,377
Whether we're behind or ahead,

73
00:03:51,377 --> 00:03:56,177
to accurately predict the remaining time to do those screens and then

74
00:03:56,177 --> 00:03:59,377
reflect that in the schedule accordingly as well.

75
00:03:59,377 --> 00:04:10,000
Wow, we have covered a lot of material in this module. Now let's cover the key points in the summary section, coming up ahead.
