1
00:00:01,337 --> 00:00:04,937
Elements of a project definition document.

2
00:00:04,937 --> 00:00:07,337
So what's in it?

3
00:00:07,337 --> 00:00:12,414
A project definition document is a collection of elements that can

4
00:00:12,414 --> 00:00:16,712
adequately cover all of the potential pieces of information that would

5
00:00:16,712 --> 00:00:19,337
be required to create your initial estimates.

6
00:00:19,337 --> 00:00:23,337
Such as, purpose, goals, objectives, success criteria,

7
00:00:23,337 --> 00:00:28,087
what's in scope, what's out of scope, assumptions,

8
00:00:28,087 --> 00:00:33,337
recommended approach, business drivers, budget and schedule.

9
00:00:33,337 --> 00:00:36,837
Return on investment, constraints, risks,

10
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:40,337
stakeholders, preliminary schedule and estimates.

11
00:00:40,337 --> 00:00:45,337
Policies and standards, legal and regulatory, and competitive drivers.

12
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:48,337
This is just a short list of what might be part of

13
00:00:48,337 --> 00:00:49,337
your project definition document.

14
00:00:49,337 --> 00:00:53,087
In the following slides we'll go into detail in each

15
00:00:53,087 --> 00:00:55,337
one of these and what's required.

16
00:00:55,337 --> 00:00:59,337
Now let's go into a little more detail of each one of those.

17
00:00:59,337 --> 00:00:59,694
Purpose.

18
00:00:59,694 --> 00:01:01,837
Replace the current student enrollment system.

19
00:01:01,837 --> 00:01:05,765
So we're going to be giving examples of each one of these

20
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:08,337
elements and what you might write for each one.

21
00:01:08,337 --> 00:01:13,337
So for example, purpose, replace the current student enrollment system.

22
00:01:13,337 --> 00:01:16,937
Goals and objectives, improve student services,

23
00:01:16,937 --> 00:01:21,396
provide better financial management, avoid end of life of old hardware.

24
00:01:21,396 --> 00:01:25,051
These might be some of the initial goals and objectives for

25
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:29,337
replacing the current student enrollment system.

26
00:01:29,337 --> 00:01:30,337
Success criteria.

27
00:01:30,337 --> 00:01:35,337
All data successfully migrated and accessible on the new system.

28
00:01:35,337 --> 00:01:38,765
Sounds like a good goal, good success criteria.

29
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,337
New system online by December 1.

30
00:01:41,337 --> 00:01:44,513
Now this is just a short list of these.

31
00:01:44,513 --> 00:01:46,278
But purpose, goals and objectives,

32
00:01:46,278 --> 00:01:49,396
and success criteria are some of the most important elements

33
00:01:49,396 --> 00:01:52,337
and should be flushed out as much as you can.

34
00:01:52,337 --> 00:01:55,337
More elements of a project definition.

35
00:01:55,337 --> 00:01:58,337
What's in our out of scope?

36
00:01:58,337 --> 00:01:59,670
In scope.

37
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,337
Student enrollment, financial management, cashier, accounts receivable.

38
00:02:04,337 --> 00:02:06,837
What's out of scope?

39
00:02:06,837 --> 00:02:09,337
Sales, marketing, student grades.

40
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:12,487
It's very important to itemize what's out of scope.

41
00:02:12,487 --> 00:02:16,337
In other words, what things the project will not be covering.

42
00:02:16,337 --> 00:02:16,690
Assumptions.

43
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:19,160
Insufficient budget for adding an IT staff.

44
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,337
Maybe there's not enough programmers to do the job.

45
00:02:22,337 --> 00:02:24,670
No off-the-shelf solution available.

46
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:29,337
Must migrate Legacy data from an old system.

47
00:02:29,337 --> 00:02:30,670
Recommended approach.

48
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:35,337
You've put together this approach going forward.

49
00:02:35,337 --> 00:02:39,337
Hey, we should develop use cases, some screen sketches.

50
00:02:39,337 --> 00:02:44,587
We think it's going to be custom development, be the right path.

51
00:02:44,587 --> 00:02:46,337
Initial architecture, web application.

52
00:02:46,337 --> 00:02:47,837
Additional elements.

53
00:02:47,837 --> 00:02:52,337
Business drivers, unsupported hardware and infrastructure.

54
00:02:52,337 --> 00:02:54,984
So we're using some very old hardware now that

55
00:02:54,984 --> 00:02:57,337
we're going to need to get off of.

56
00:02:57,337 --> 00:02:58,653
Inadequate service support to students.

57
00:02:58,653 --> 00:03:02,337
Another business driver, students may not be as happy as they used to be.

58
00:03:02,337 --> 00:03:05,194
Maybe our revenue is down.

59
00:03:05,194 --> 00:03:08,051
Inadequate access to financial information.

60
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:10,337
All critical business drivers.

61
00:03:10,337 --> 00:03:10,803
Budget.

62
00:03:10,803 --> 00:03:12,670
Remember budget from estimate?

63
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:17,337
So the budget is what we have available to spend.

64
00:03:17,337 --> 00:03:19,454
We have a three year budget.

65
00:03:19,454 --> 00:03:21,925
We're going to allocate this capital expenditure,

66
00:03:21,925 --> 00:03:26,194
25% the first year, maybe 40% the second year,

67
00:03:26,194 --> 00:03:28,480
35% the third year.

68
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,337
I have five million dollars.

69
00:03:31,337 --> 00:03:31,765
Schedule.

70
00:03:31,765 --> 00:03:34,337
Must be online by December 1.

71
00:03:34,337 --> 00:03:37,337
I left the year off of course.

72
00:03:37,337 --> 00:03:39,337
Here are the next three.

73
00:03:39,337 --> 00:03:40,537
Return on investment.

74
00:03:40,537 --> 00:03:44,428
Say a five hundred thousand dollar investment will return seven

75
00:03:44,428 --> 00:03:47,337
hundred and fifty thousand dollars in six months.

76
00:03:47,337 --> 00:03:51,126
That's a 50% ROI, a 50% Return on Investment,

77
00:03:51,126 --> 00:03:56,408
and that formula is simply net profit divided by investment times one hundred.

78
00:03:56,408 --> 00:04:00,337
The financial folks in your company will always do an ROI.

79
00:04:00,337 --> 00:04:05,337
Projects should not be approved as a go without a reasonable ROI.

80
00:04:05,337 --> 00:04:05,980
Constraints.

81
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:09,837
Projects must begin by July 1.

82
00:04:09,837 --> 00:04:16,837
Data migration must be performed during summer, which is the low usage months.

83
00:04:16,837 --> 00:04:19,337
School's out maybe, something like that.

84
00:04:19,337 --> 00:04:19,781
Risks.

85
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:22,003
The old hardware may fail.

86
00:04:22,003 --> 00:04:22,892
Business continuity,

87
00:04:22,892 --> 00:04:29,003
in other words our business might fail or slow down if the hardware does fail.

88
00:04:29,003 --> 00:04:32,337
The budget may only be available for this fiscal year.

89
00:04:32,337 --> 00:04:35,337
Here's an opportunity now to move forward.

90
00:04:35,337 --> 00:04:39,623
Additional elements of a project definition.

91
00:04:39,623 --> 00:04:40,337
Stakeholders.

92
00:04:40,337 --> 00:04:43,260
Stakeholders are key individuals in an organization that have an

93
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,337
interest in the success of the completion of the project.

94
00:04:46,337 --> 00:04:50,781
In this case we have the Dean of the University,

95
00:04:50,781 --> 00:04:54,337
IT Operations Director, and the Chief Financial Officer.

96
00:04:54,337 --> 00:04:56,337
Next is preliminary schedule.

97
00:04:56,337 --> 00:05:00,337
Project planning, we want to begin Jan 1.

98
00:05:00,337 --> 00:05:02,837
Specification development, Feb 1.

99
00:05:02,837 --> 00:05:05,337
System release, April 1.

100
00:05:05,337 --> 00:05:06,106
Preliminary estimates.

101
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:10,337
Again, this course is on the portion that creates these estimates.

102
00:05:10,337 --> 00:05:13,670
In the next two modules we're going to talk about how we

103
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,337
fill out this estimate portion certainly.

104
00:05:15,337 --> 00:05:18,572
But in this case, we think at this point in time,

105
00:05:18,572 --> 00:05:20,337
consulting is one hundred thousand dollars,

106
00:05:20,337 --> 00:05:26,337
infrastructure one hundred fifty, and development two hundred fifty thousand.

107
00:05:26,337 --> 00:05:29,337
And here are our last three elements.

108
00:05:29,337 --> 00:05:30,408
Policies and standards.

109
00:05:30,408 --> 00:05:34,337
Every organization has a set of policies that must be followed.

110
00:05:34,337 --> 00:05:37,253
In this case there's a security policy.

111
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,337
It must be PCI compliant.

112
00:05:39,337 --> 00:05:40,087
Standards.

113
00:05:40,087 --> 00:05:45,337
Follow the university application lifecycle management standards.

114
00:05:45,337 --> 00:05:47,003
Legal and regulatory.

115
00:05:47,003 --> 00:05:50,337
Legal, it must be ADA compliant.

116
00:05:50,337 --> 00:05:55,337
Regulatory, we know of none at this time.

117
00:05:55,337 --> 00:05:56,246
Competitor drivers.

118
00:05:56,246 --> 00:06:00,337
Other universities enable a much better student enrollment experience.

119
00:06:00,337 --> 00:06:04,337
So, this project is going to help us beat those other universities.

120
00:06:04,337 --> 00:06:10,337
Greater competition among schools, that's also a big drive here for our project.

121
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:16,337
Construction of a Project Definition Document, or sometimes PDD for short.

122
00:06:16,337 --> 00:06:20,070
Remember this is just your starter list.

123
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:24,337
Continuously build up your PDD with each project.

124
00:06:24,337 --> 00:06:27,631
Continuously add in more major and minor elements.

125
00:06:27,631 --> 00:06:31,337
A major element for example was legal and regulatory.

126
00:06:31,337 --> 00:06:34,337
Under there you have what I call minor elements.

127
00:06:34,337 --> 00:06:39,051
ADA, HIPPA, PCI, SOX, things that would fall under legal and regulatory.

128
00:06:39,051 --> 00:06:45,337
With my first project, back years ago, ADA was a requirement.

129
00:06:45,337 --> 00:06:47,524
So I had that in that section.

130
00:06:47,524 --> 00:06:49,087
Then came a healthcare client.

131
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,337
Then came a university.

132
00:06:50,337 --> 00:06:51,837
And then came a business client.

133
00:06:51,837 --> 00:06:55,337
All of which I add these, so later when the next project comes up,

134
00:06:55,337 --> 00:06:56,537
I say hey customer,

135
00:06:56,537 --> 00:07:00,137
I have legal and regulatory sections here to talk about and do

136
00:07:00,137 --> 00:07:03,051
you have any requirements under any of these?

137
00:07:03,051 --> 00:07:07,337
Because these will drive requirements, which in turn drive estimates.

138
00:07:07,337 --> 00:07:18,000
A solid PDD will enable you to quickly gather requirements. Good, quality requirements drive better estimates.
