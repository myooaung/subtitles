00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
Hello, I'm Michael Krasowski from Pluralsight.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:09,500
I will be presenting the course Best Practices for Project Estimation.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,833
Course overview.

4
00:00:10,833 --> 00:00:15,500
This course is comprised of three modules.

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,864
Fundamentals of estimation.

6
00:00:16,864 --> 00:00:21,000
This module discusses the fundamentals of project estimation and

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
will give you a broader understanding of terms,

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,500
definitions, and background of estimation.

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,654
Tools and techniques.

10
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:32,800
This module provides an overview of several methods and tools that

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,500
can be used to help you develop your estimates.

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,500
And you will become more comfortable and accurate with your estimates.

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,500
Agile estimation.

14
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:47,500
This module teaches you how to apply Agile approaches to project estimation.

15
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,853
I am sure you've all heard a lot about Agile.

16
00:00:49,853 --> 00:00:50,324
But seriously,

17
00:00:50,324 --> 00:00:54,929
we can learn and adapt several of the Agile philosophies to

18
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:59,500
attacking estimations in a new and different way.

19
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:04,500
Let's go over the fundamentals of estimation module overview.

20
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,500
Why are you here?

21
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,750
Planning is everything.

22
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,000
Why do planning?

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,500
Runaway projects.

24
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,333
Fears of estimating.

25
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:17,778
The importance of estimating.

26
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:21,444
What you need for an estimate.

27
00:01:21,444 --> 00:01:24,500
The right level of effort.

28
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,389
Elements of a project definition.

29
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:31,500
The project triangle dilemma.

30
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,500
Are you up for the job?

31
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,500
The importance of process.

32
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:42,500
These will be the topics we will be covering in Module number one.

33
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:47,500
Let's explore some of the reasons why you may be here today taking this course.

34
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,278
You are asked to be planner and not a doer.

35
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:54,167
Maybe you have been programming for a while and now you're asked to

36
00:01:54,167 --> 00:01:57,500
step up and play more of a project manager role.

37
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,300
Are you a software engineering expert,

38
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,500
yet feel like fish out of water when it comes to making an estimate?

39
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,500
You are not likely comfortable possibly performing a

40
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,500
management skill test rather than programming.

41
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,100
Do you need help augmenting or transitioning your technical

42
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,500
skills with planning and estimating skills?

43
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,441
I think it is a smart move to grow your soft skills

44
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:23,500
to augment your technical skills.

45
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,500
Have you been asked to be a project manager on a new project?

46
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,722
With such small staffs today,

47
00:02:29,722 --> 00:02:35,500
many of us are asked to perform more than one kind of task.

48
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,324
Is your project over schedule or over budget?

49
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,500
Maybe you have been doing some planning and estimation,

50
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,500
but your projects are over budget and possibly late.

51
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,500
Are you confused on just how to make a reasonable estimate?

52
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,500
Some people just wing it without any templates or process.

53
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,500
This course will help put some tools and processes in your hands.

54
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,750
Are you afraid of making estimates?

55
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:03,500
Many developers are just plain nervous about making an estimate.

56
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,500
Generally, it is about committing to an estimate that they know is very weak.

57
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,633
You mean I have to deliver based on what I said?

58
00:03:12,633 --> 00:03:14,500
Ah, yes you do.

59
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,100
"Plans are Nothing; Planning is Everything.

60
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,900
" This is a quotation by Dwight D.

61
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,500
Eisenhower.

62
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,500
Now he wasn't actually saying that plans were worthless of course.

63
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,500
I mean, he did plan the D-Day invasion.

64
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:35,500
So what did the war hero and former President really mean?

65
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:41,500
It is the process of planning that is the most important element.

66
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,324
A plan is still very important,

67
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:49,500
but not as much as the process that creates the plan.

68
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,000
Plans help you consider opportunities and challenges and ways

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,500
or approaches to take advantage of them.

70
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,000
Without plans, the planning process,

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,500
your projects are at risk of failure to meet its goals.

72
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,167
So plans are certainly important,

73
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:13,500
but the planning process itself is of the most importance.

74
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,750
Why do planning?

75
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,500
Planning and estimating is difficult.

76
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,773
Yep, we all know that.

77
00:04:21,773 --> 00:04:24,500
Sometimes we don't do enough planning.

78
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,643
Planning is hard.

79
00:04:26,643 --> 00:04:29,500
Let's just start programming.

80
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,700
Sometimes we spend too much time on our plan and we become

81
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,500
rigid and fall in love with our plan.

82
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,808
Organizations, especially the fiscal part of organizations,

83
00:04:40,808 --> 00:04:44,500
expect and in fact demand plans.

84
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,500
That is the business world.

85
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,000
Estimates and plans are not just about determining schedules,

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,500
resources, and budgets.

87
00:04:53,500 --> 00:05:00,500
Plans and estimates drive value for the business and investment decisions.

88
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,500
In order to provide optimal value to the business,

89
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:10,500
plans and estimates are created iteratively and incrementally.

90
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,433
So if earlier in your career you were a software engineer,

91
00:05:13,433 --> 00:05:16,000
you were probably focused on important technical

92
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,500
capabilities and other cools things.

93
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:30,000
But now, if you are entering the project manager lead role, you will need to better learn the key planning activity of project estimation.
