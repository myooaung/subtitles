00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:04.669
Now let's talk about my 5 and 50 rules.

2
00:00:04.669 --> 00:00:08.169
Okay first off, all work gets tracked, no exceptions.

3
00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:14.169
We're tracking every element of work, every hour, down to the 15 minute level.

4
00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:16.669
Every unit of work has a task number, a name,

5
00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:21.169
and an estimate associated with it, plus the aggregation of the actuals.

6
00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:24.169
Now what is my 5% rule?

7
00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:27.780
When assigned a task the developer uses the first 5% of the estimate

8
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.987
to make a quick assessment of the task at hand.

9
00:00:30.987 --> 00:00:36.078
Brings up any issues to the team lead, or if there is no problem,

10
00:00:36.078 --> 00:00:37.169
just continues work.

11
00:00:37.169 --> 00:00:40.502
Now it might be a little less than 5%, but look at the task,

12
00:00:40.502 --> 00:00:43.816
look at what needs to be done, look at the requirements.

13
00:00:43.816 --> 00:00:48.757
Do I think I can get it done within the estimated time?

14
00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:49.169
Etc.

15
00:00:49.169 --> 00:00:54.740
Every single task that you assign gets received by that developer and they

16
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.169
look at the 5% of the effort and give you that feedback.

17
00:00:58.169 --> 00:01:01.169
First off, to make sure are we heading in the right direction?

18
00:01:01.169 --> 00:01:05.169
Now we have the 50% rule.

19
00:01:05.169 --> 00:01:09.169
When 50% of the estimated hours are used,

20
00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:13.294
the developer must review the work to see if 50% of

21
00:01:13.294 --> 00:01:15.169
the work itself is completed.

22
00:01:15.169 --> 00:01:19.169
If not, then immediately go to the team lead for discussions.

23
00:01:19.169 --> 00:01:19.931
So again,

24
00:01:19.931 --> 00:01:24.883
I've used 10 hours of a 20-hour task and I think I'm about

25
00:01:24.883 --> 00:01:27.169
halfway done with the actual functionality,

26
00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:28.725
I am on track.

27
00:01:28.725 --> 00:01:34.169
But if I've used 10 hours and I think I've barely scratched the surface,

28
00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:36.906
then I have to go right to my team lead and say hey,

29
00:01:36.906 --> 00:01:37.327
I'm behind.

30
00:01:37.327 --> 00:01:38.169
What are our options?

31
00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:44.169
So you can take corrective action.

32
00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:46.669
And we do this every day.

33
00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:49.169
We review project performance each day.

34
00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:52.169
We look at the 50% mark and see how we're doing.

35
00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:59.169
We constantly review and if necessary revise estimates, because, life happens.

36
00:01:59.169 --> 00:02:02.902
Now what information should we even track?

37
00:02:02.902 --> 00:02:07.169
Oh, we'll see that on the next slide.

38
00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:10.169
Now let's look at the items that I track in my business.

39
00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:12.947
I would suggest you probably track maybe at least these

40
00:02:12.947 --> 00:02:15.169
and you may need to track even more.

41
00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:18.875
Certainly I want to track at the customer level,

42
00:02:18.875 --> 00:02:22.169
project level, every customer may have multiple projects.

43
00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:23.883
Task number level.

44
00:02:23.883 --> 00:02:30.169
I have so many tasks in this project, for this customer.

45
00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:34.169
Have a quick little task description as well.

46
00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:36.992
Put in my estimated hours for that task.

47
00:02:36.992 --> 00:02:40.169
And then as people post hours against that task,

48
00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:44.169
I'm accumulating the actual hours so I can see progress.

49
00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:46.947
I want to see who put those hours in there,

50
00:02:46.947 --> 00:02:49.169
whether it was Michael or Joe or Sam.

51
00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:53.169
I want to see when do they post that time, date and time.

52
00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:56.598
And a little bit about what they did.

53
00:02:56.598 --> 00:02:59.169
So I might enter a description.

54
00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:00.026
Say hey,

55
00:03:00.026 --> 00:03:04.312
I want to put in three hours against this customer

56
00:03:04.312 --> 00:03:06.222
project task and what did I do?

57
00:03:06.222 --> 00:03:15.000
I helped design a database or I finished a screen and things like that. And we'll see a more detailed example on the next slide.
