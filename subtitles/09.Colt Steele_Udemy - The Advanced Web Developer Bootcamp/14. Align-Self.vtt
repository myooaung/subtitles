00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:01.350
All right.

2
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:07.110
So we've made a lot of progress with our container properties covered all of these here check mark.

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:07.880
Awesome.

4
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.330
Feel so much better now.

5
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.460
Next up we're going to start focusing on the properties that apply to the individual items individual

6
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.000
boxes.

7
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.250
In our case so we have some more control rather than just at the container level we have control over

8
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.450
individual things whatever those things are.

9
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.580
It looks like there's a lot more than there actually are.

10
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.430
Because these three are often combined and used with a shorthand flex.

11
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.070
So Flex allows you to control these three properties but I listed them separately because we are going

12
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.750
to talk about them individually.

13
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.700
So let's get started.

14
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.030
First up is a line self so a line self is just like a line items in that it allows you to figure out

15
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.220
how things should be aligned across the cross axis.

16
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.370
However it works on the individual basis so for an individual item.

17
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.370
So let me show you an example.

18
00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:02.030
Here we have a line items set to flex start for the container.

19
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.860
So these four boxes are aligned to flex start along the cross axis.

20
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.330
But then I singled out box 2 and I said align self flex and and it's aligned to the end.

21
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.390
Because a flex and so it singles this one out.

22
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.550
So it's a way to override a line items but it works the same way the same values.

23
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.290
So we have like start flex and center and we also have baseline.

24
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.890
So there's another example in this case I centered all of them using a line items and then selected

25
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.430
box to and box 3 and said align self is flex start meaning that those start up top.

26
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.040
And the other two are centered along the cross axis and one more example.

27
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.440
In this case a line item is set to flex.

28
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.880
And so everything is aligned to the bottom and the spaces above.

29
00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.470
But then I set box three to have align itself set to stretch.

30
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.730
So it takes up the entire space which by the way is the default.

31
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.240
If we hadn't set a line items to be flex and remember the default is stretch.

32
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.690
So let's hop decode pen and play around a little bit.

33
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:22.350
So as you can see here we've got nine of them and by default our line items is set to stretch.

34
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.610
Should we review.

35
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:24.740
Nothing happens.

36
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.660
So let's change it though a way from scratch and let's do Center.

37
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.670
OK so they're all centered but now what I can do is use a line self.

38
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:46.190
Let's pick about seven box seven and I'll just set a line south to be flex and perfect.

39
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:53.010
So it's aligned to the bottom there and let's do box for let's do three lucky number and we'll do a

40
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.890
line self and let's do flex start perfect.

41
00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:06.140
So as you can see it allows us to override the value that we're applying to the container with a line

42
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.730
items.

43
00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.120
So they're very very similar.

44
00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.560
It's just a more specific version for an individual item rather than the blanket statement for the container

45
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.830
and everything inside of it.

46
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.120
So if I change this back to stretch I could just comment it out.

47
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:26.900
You can see that are two that we individually singled out are still doing what we want them to do.

48
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:32.660
So that's pretty much it to align itself if you're comfortable with those values center stretch flex

49
00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.130
start flex and baseline that we've seen a couple of times now.

50
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.520
Same values that you can use just a different property name.

51
00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:47.180
And if we just switch this over when you get rid of the height on my container for now and if I switch

52
00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.750
this over to be a column.

53
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.380
Same thing applies to the default stretch as you can see.

54
00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.580
Let's change that to the center.

55
00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.200
So our cross axis goes from left to right in there centered here.

56
00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.620
Except for three and seven which I called out individually.

57
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.130
Zoom way out.

58
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.900
There you go.

59
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.230
Totally worth it.

60
00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.370
OK.

61
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:14.930
So that's it for a line self.
