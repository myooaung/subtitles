00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.850
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.620
In this video we'll be recapping what we learned in the past couple of videos.

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.980
We learned that object oriented programming is a model based on objects which are constructed from some

4
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.310
kind of blueprint in languages that have built in support for O.P..

5
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:21.840
We call these blueprints classes and the objects created from them instances since we do not have built

6
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.770
in class support in javascript.

7
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.760
We mimic classes by using functions to create objects through the use of constructor functions and the

8
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.470
new keyword we saw that the new keyword does four things.

9
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.810
It creates an object out of thin air.

10
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.540
It sets the value of the key word this to be that object created in the previous that it adds return

11
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:48.930
this to the constructor function and it sets a property on the object which we can access using Dunder

12
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:49.800
Kroto.

13
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.750
We'll talk much more about that in the next video.

14
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.850
Finally we can refactor duplication if multiple constructor functions share properties by invoking another

15
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.030
constructor function and using call or apply to set the value of the keyword this to be the correct

16
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.970
object created from the constructor function in the next video.

17
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.600
We'll examine a property on functions called prototype and dive deeper into what the new keyword does.

18
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:16.250
See there.
