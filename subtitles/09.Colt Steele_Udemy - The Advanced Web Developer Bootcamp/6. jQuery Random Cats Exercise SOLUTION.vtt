00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:00.930
All right.

2
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.420
So let's get building this should be pretty quick.

3
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:10.020
The first thing we should do is require Jay queery so I'm going to grab this you URL here and add that

4
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.300
script in.

5
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.650
You can also if you're using code pen required over here Richard you have all on do that.

6
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.380
So we know this is working.

7
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.070
All right.

8
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.420
I'll make some space.

9
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.110
And we have our H-1.

10
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.780
The next thing we'll add is a button.

11
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.280
Let's give it an ID.

12
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.620
My old standard just beat n I'll just say get.

13
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.650
Random cat will be our button text and then we'll add an image with nothing in it to start.

14
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.120
Although we could provide a starting image as well.

15
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.400
Maybe we should just take this one right here.

16
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.420
No idea what it looks like.

17
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.120
Let's put it in there.

18
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.020
There we go.

19
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.460
It's kind of large.

20
00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.720
So one thing it might do ahead of time is just style so that we get maybe with no bigger than 200 pixels

21
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.470
good enough we're not going for beauty here.

22
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.400
What a cute cat.

23
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.710
Speaking of beauty OK.

24
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.730
So over here in our javascript side of things we need so when we click that button.

25
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.020
So we'll have our dollar sign.

26
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:20.940
It's like the button click and will just do our simple alert.

27
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:28.170
Make sure that works good are getting the alert means our Java's paired J queries required correctly.

28
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.520
So now what we want to do is send a request.

29
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.450
Now this is Jason and it's a get request.

30
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:41.180
So I would prefer to use dollar sign don't get Jaison but you could easily do Dorsch and get or are

31
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.570
signed.

32
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:48.230
Ajax and specified methods get data type is Jason but Jason makes it much easier.

33
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:55.730
It will take the you know it's a random dog cat slash meow and that's all we need.

34
00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:03.550
Well done and when it's done we can start by just constantly logging the data.

35
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:12.190
Like this make sure that works clear some of that random cat.

36
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.330
There we go.

37
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:21.850
So what we actually want is data dot file that will be the actual image you are all as you can see there.

38
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.660
So rather than just constantly logging We want to actually update the source of this image so it will

39
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:34.130
select the image and I guess let's give it an idea just to be safer.

40
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:44.550
I'll call this cat image and then it was selected over here at Image dot and this is where I recommended

41
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:53.370
using this method 80 and we can specify we're updating source and now it should be equal to data dot

42
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.210
file which is what the API is giving us back.

43
00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.540
Let's see if it works.

44
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.410
Sometimes takes a moment for this API every go.

45
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.490
And we worried that I made a mistake.

46
00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.420
Looks good get this cartoon out of here on a real cat photo.

47
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.860
OK.

48
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.470
We'll leave off on that one.

49
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.620
Of course we can handle the error.

50
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.850
We could move this to a separate function but we don't leave it at this.

51
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:27.400
I'll just add a dot fail in case there is a problem just because it's good to have that let's do an

52
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.570
alert.

53
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.620
Something went wrong.

54
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.920
Actually you know let's just to request is not civil.

55
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.160
You know that I think that's enough.

56
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.770
So if we were able to get that if you didn't get Jaison Ajax or don't get are perfectly valid ways of

57
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.210
doing it as well.

58
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.600
And that's pretty much it we're using gay queery nice simple syntax compatible across all browsers.

59
00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:58.570
Random cats.

60
00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:59.580
What's not to like.
