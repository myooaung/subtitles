00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,790
Welcome back in the last video we started making a recipe component so let's continue where we left

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,040
off.

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:15,330
If you recall we've got a recipe component and so far it takes in two props a title and a array of ingredients

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,680
and we don't have much styling or anything going on so so far it just looks like this.

5
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:27,930
In this example we passed and pasta for the title and flour and water for the ingredients.

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,830
Now let's add the remaining data.

7
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:38,420
I'm going to assume that my props will have an image and an instruction passed to it or instructions.

8
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,730
So that should be all the things that my component needs now.

9
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,200
Title image instructions and ingredients.

10
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:52,720
Let's actually display that so I'll just throw a tag here and then put the instructions in and just

11
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,360
to get the image show up also at the image tag.

12
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:07,290
My source is going to equal my image and my old text I'll just set equal to the title.

13
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,300
All right.

14
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,740
So that should do it for the component.

15
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,040
Let's pass it in on the jazz side.

16
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:25,050
And I'll make this multiple lines just so it's easier to see.

17
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,630
I want to give it some instructions.

18
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:35,430
I'll just say Mix ingredients and my image.

19
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:44,070
I've cheated a little bit here so I've already copied over to the public folder a spaghetti file through

20
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,580
that.

21
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:52,800
So this spaghetti that Jay peg is just an image that I got in order to put it in cloud 9.

22
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,410
You could just drag and drop from your desktop into the folder and it will be uploaded for you.

23
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:03,260
So because spaghetti is being delivered in public I can just reference it.

24
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:05,900
Like that

25
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:14,420
there's a different way to include images and re-act that we'll see later similar to what's being done

26
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,860
up here with the logo.

27
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,670
Speaking of which I'll get rid of this logo because we're not using it.

28
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:24,020
So the other way of importing images that actually uses web pack will learn later.

29
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:28,390
Remember this public folder isn't part of the web pack build process.

30
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:35,940
So spaghetti won't be packaged up by web pack which is generally something you want to do.

31
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,270
All right.

32
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,280
Now that all set.

33
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,970
Let's see if it all works.

34
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,250
I need to close this P-TECH

35
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:53,990
I need to remember to start my server up again so I'm going to get into that directory recipe Propp

36
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,760
starter and then say NPM start

37
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:03,920
and then I'll open this up.

38
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:09,070
And now our image is showing up and our instructions are here too.

39
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,880
So now we've got all of our props inside of this component.

40
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,610
We're rendering the data that we've passed in.

41
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,960
So that's a great step.

42
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,120
The next thing we want to do is style this so it looks reasonable.

43
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:20,790
So let's do that now.

44
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:43,530
Let's start by looking at this recipe Geass and rearranging HCM so that it fits better with the card

45
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,060
that we saw before.

46
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:51,630
So remember in this version the image is on top then the title then this Ingredion string list of ingredients

47
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,140
instructions and then the instructions text.

48
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,020
So lets match that.

49
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:58,570
All right.

50
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:05,990
First of all put div up top here and inside that div I'll add my image.

51
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:19,000
Next up let's create another div and inside of that div we'll put the content of the card.

52
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,250
So I'm going to change this day and age 3

53
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,500
I'll remember to add my ingredients here.

54
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:29,450
Mactan for

55
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,510
then I'll also put a label above here for the instructions.

56
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,370
OK let's see how that looks.

57
00:04:48,230 --> 00:05:00,090
Looking better looking more like our example a little bit more like it.

58
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,740
Now let's add some classes that we can then style.

59
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:12,480
So first I'll give this a class name of recipe card.

60
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:17,070
Give this one a class name of recipe image

61
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,810
excuse me recipe card image that I did before.

62
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:31,410
And then this one will be my card content.

63
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:43,200
And I'll give this one a classic recipe title.

64
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:48,100
All right let's move on to the C Ss.

65
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:56,180
So again I won't focus too much on the CSSA but I'll show each class.

66
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,780
So here's the class for our recipe card.

67
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:05,170
We're going to make it take up a third of the screen so that we put three cards next to each other and

68
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:09,210
above that we'll use fluxbox so that the latter makes more sense.

69
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:16,340
But see what else there is a border background and some border radius.

70
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:20,860
We're giving the card content a little bit of padding so it's below the image a little.

71
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:27,640
The recipe card image div will take up 50 percent of our whole card and then we'll give some some width

72
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,650
and height to the image itself.

73
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:37,690
Lastly the H-3 for the recipe title will have no margins so it doesn't take up as much empty space.

74
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:43,300
All right now we've added the CSSA and we'll just double check that we've included that CSSA we have

75
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:43,750
not.

76
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,440
So I'll include it.

77
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:53,770
Now with those changes I'll double check to make sure things are running.

78
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,230
It is it looks much more like a card at this point.

79
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:02,740
So a lot of progress but there's still a few errors so it's going fix those.

80
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:07,740
So I forgot when I first created this app to get rid of all the styling app that's DSS.

81
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,670
So let's go there.

82
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:16,040
It's recipe app that the SS now and I'm just going to delete all of this for now.

83
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:23,380
In fact you delete it all and then one other thing I want to do is I want to add a font.

84
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,310
So let's just see that change.

85
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,390
Yeah it looks a lot more like our other example.

86
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:31,320
But if you notice the fonts here are different.

87
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,800
So this is the standard what font.

88
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,020
I think this is rubato.

89
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:40,300
So let's let's grab that Fontenette it.

90
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:40,600
All right.

91
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:45,940
First thing I'm going to do is go into indexation Chimo and I'm just going to throw in the link for

92
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,690
that one.

93
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,750
So now I've got this robot font from Google.

94
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,200
I'll say that.

95
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:58,810
And then inside my index SS I'll make some changes here.

96
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,820
So I'm going to change the font family to.

97
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:11,980
And then I'll also change the background to this color here.

98
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,130
It's grayish color.

99
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,940
So with those changes let's take a look.

100
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:18,700
OK.

101
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,730
Looks good to me.

102
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,160
So that looks pretty close to our solution let's compare.

103
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:24,590
Yeah yeah.

104
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,640
Pretty good.

105
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,510
So that's it for making the recipe card component.

106
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:32,870
Next up we're going to take a step back and talk about default props and prop types.
