Welcome back for this exercise I'd like you to build another pie chart.

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.190
In this video.

3
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.270
I'll demonstrate what I'd like you to do.

4
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.910
The dataset you'll be working with should look familiar.

5
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.840
It's the breakdown of births by month and by year that we first looked at when we learned about our

6
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:24.410
graphs this time around though I'd like to graph the data as a pie chart so that we can more easily

7
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.910
see births per month as a fraction of the total number of births for the year.

8
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.010
Here's the eventual chart you should be working towards as you can see it's got a couple of different

9
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.720
features.

10
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.940
First when the page loads you see a graph for the year 1967.

11
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.310
The months are color coded.

12
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.850
January is this blue wedge at the top and the graph is sorted by month.

13
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.580
So the next wedge is February and March and so on.

14
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.620
There's also a range on the bottom so you can change the year that you're looking at and have the text

15
00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.880
update finally.

16
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.970
I've also got an entire pie chart which groups data by quarter rather than by month.

17
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:11.110
For example the blue wedge represents all births from January through March and the green which represents

18
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.630
all births from April through June.

19
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.500
I consider building this visualization in three stages.

20
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.410
First just focus on a chart showing data for every month in a single year.

21
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.800
Second at a range and put so that you can adjust the year but still show the data for every month.

22
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.760
Lastly try to build this in her chart that group stated by quarter instead of by month.

23
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.630
You should consider this last stage of bonus.

24
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.560
I've given you a minimal amount of HCM Ellen CSSA to get started.

25
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.870
Feel free to style your visualization in a way that's completely different from what you see here.

26
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:49.820
Good luck.

27
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.170
I'll show you my solution in the next video.
