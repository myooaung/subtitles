1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,830
OK so we're going to start right off by installing Noj.

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:03,750
Yes.

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,670
And the way I'm going to do this might be familiar to some view if you've taken online courses before

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,630
anything on to me are going to be using Cloud 9.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,820
So Cloud Nine is a web based developer environment.

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,090
It's an I.D. It's awesome it's free.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,000
Basically what Amazon owns it now actually.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,100
And when you create a new workspace on there which is what we'll do will create a node workspace.

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:31,720
It installs note on the computer somewhere on Amazon servers and gives it to us for free.

10
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:35,970
Now it is a paid product if you're trying to scale up a giant company or something you want hundreds

11
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:36,640
of accounts.

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,010
But if you're just using it for your own personal use it's totally free.

13
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,510
So we're going to use it.

14
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,990
You do not have to.

15
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,090
That will be included instructions if you want to brave installing things on your own.

16
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,080
Just know that especially Mongo can be a pain to install on your own environment.

17
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:58,620
If you have other databases or you've tried to install Monga before or if you happen to be on a PC that's

18
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,700
probably the biggest problem and I have a lot of students who use PCs.

19
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,750
So I highly recommend that you use cloud 9 just for this course.

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,570
And again you don't have to.

21
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,440
But I think that you should just to make things smooth so we can get to react.

22
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,720
So the way that it works if you go to C9 IO is also included as a resource.

23
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,840
You just need to create an account using your e-mail address.

24
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:25,350
They will ask for a credit card but you will not be charged anything.

25
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,630
It's totally free.

26
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,840
There's no surprise payments that pop up no subscription unless you opt into that.

27
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:37,050
The only reason they want a credit card is to prevent spam prevent people from abusing the system.

28
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:42,780
If you do not have a credit card as a absolute last resort and there are instructions following this

29
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,810
lecture about getting an invite to our course workspace which will then allow you to create your own

30
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,280
account without a credit card but just be conscientious.

31
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,810
It can take a bit of time for us to respond to that.

32
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,310
But if you do need that if you're in that boat and you're willing to wait a couple hours or a day or

33
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:04,800
two then follow the instructions that are after this lecture about getting an account for free without

34
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,410
a credit card.

35
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,420
But again they will not charge you.

36
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,960
So create an account here sign up.

37
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,810
And once you finish that you should see something like this although you probably will not have all

38
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:15,900
these workspaces here.

39
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:16,900
You definitely want.

40
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,790
These are all different environments that I've created with essentially a single click.

41
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,390
So I have some Python environment.

42
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,280
I have some node environments.

43
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,240
What else do I have my ask.

44
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,390
Well environment.

45
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,350
Basically everything that you could want at your fingertips.

46
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,460
The single click.

47
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,750
I think it's pretty awesome.

48
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,640
So we're going to click on Create a new workspace and we're going to give it a name.

49
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:46,440
Call it whatever you want to call mine WPB part two and I'm going to make it public.

50
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:50,210
And I'm also going to select the node j as a template.

51
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:55,050
So this is all we have to do to actually create our own node environment might take a moment.

52
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,180
I'll fast forward through this and before you know it we're done.

53
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,950
So you should see here is the idea.

54
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,580
So we have a couple of components.

55
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,780
There's really three things I'd break it down into.

56
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,030
We have our file nav bar over here.

57
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,890
Her navigator.

58
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,700
So these are all the folders and files contained in our workspace.

59
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,390
And these are just here by default when you create a new workspace.

60
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,880
We're going to delete them all.

61
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,040
It's just kind of showing you some sample stuff so it's not totally empty.

62
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:25,770
Then over here we have our command line or we can enter commands you can list all the files we can navigate

63
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:32,190
directories will start our server here we'll install Mongo down here and then here we have our actual

64
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:32,820
Ed..

65
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,180
So if you want to look at a file let's say the server does.

66
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,160
Yes.

67
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,580
Which we didn't write.

68
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:39,950
We can see the code here.

69
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:48,780
I can edit it I can it save command s or control us or you could also go and delete that appear to file

70
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,860
save.

71
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,930
So the last thing I'll do in this video is just show you how to run this application.

72
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,160
We didn't build it but might as well try running it.

73
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:04,730
So if we make sure we're in the same directory as our server J S file and we just run node server.

74
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,600
Yes and that means things are working as long as you don't get an error.

75
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:14,620
So if you can just type node and you get this node Seelye or you can start typing javascript you're

76
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,460
all good.

77
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,340
So as far as the actual server itself.

78
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,380
Boy how do I get out of here.

79
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:29,070
OK so if we run our server the last thing we need to talk about is how we actually view the application

80
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:36,110
and to do that you go to preview preview running application it will open it up over here.

81
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:42,460
What I liked to do is actually copy that close out of it and open a new tab and just keep the app running

82
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,560
here.

83
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,310
So what we see right now is the default chat example they build for us.

84
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:53,470
I should mention that I'm probably really zoomed in and it looks I assume different for you on your

85
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:58,340
computer but the main idea is that we have this little application that's running a node server.

86
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,380
We're going to delete it all.

87
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:03,900
So don't get too attached to it and replace it with our own node app in the next video.
