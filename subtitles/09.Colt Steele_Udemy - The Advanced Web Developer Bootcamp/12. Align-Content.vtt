1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:00.910
All right.

2
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.420
So we have one more property to learn not in total just one more right now until we build our next little

3
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.960
project a responsive nav bar.

4
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.530
So this property is called a line content.

5
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.060
My personal opinion and I kind of find it confusing compared to a line item is really just the naming.

6
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.710
I think I would have named it something else the way that it works conceptually is actually not that

7
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.910
difficult to grasp.

8
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.970
It's just that sometimes I mix up which when I which align content or line items anyway.

9
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.970
What it does is it allows us to define how space is distributed.

10
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.310
Just like just by content on line items.

11
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.470
But it is how space is distributed between rows along the cross axes.

12
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:48.300
So if we don't have multiple rows if things aren't wrapping to multiple rows then we won't have any

13
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.680
space between them to control.

14
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.480
So nothing happens but if we do have different rows.

15
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.900
Here's an example.

16
00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:02.400
So we set a line items to stretch remember across axis by default top to bottom.

17
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.580
And this case we have three rows and there's no space between them right now because a line item is

18
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.680
set to stretch.

19
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.800
Hello everyone.

20
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.950
This is Colts from the future.

21
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.370
This is a bit of a patch or a temporary fix for this video.

22
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.920
There is a problem that Andrew one of the current students pointed out.

23
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.090
I don't know your last name Andrew but thank you.

24
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.920
In the slides here where it says a line items it's supposed to say align content.

25
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.660
I just a couple of seconds ago mentioned that they're easy to confuse and then I confused them myself

26
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.520
in the slides.

27
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.280
So the slides are updated.

28
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.570
If you actually look at the slides separate from the video and I'm working on a new video to upload

29
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.480
but this is just the temporary fix I'm away from home away from my microphone and my setup.

30
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.440
Sorry it sounds so bad and I'm away from the initial file.

31
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.850
I can't edit the actual files so I'm just adding some content on top of it to try and make it clear

32
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.190
where the problem is.

33
00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.550
So when it says it line items in the code here it's actually a line in content.

34
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.760
I should have it fixed.

35
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.620
Thanks OK.

36
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.970
Back to good sounding calls.

37
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:10.020
But I could change it to flex starred in that space between them is shoved to the bottom.

38
00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:17.800
They all move up to the start of the cross axes or flex and does the opposite pushes everything down.

39
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:28.710
Space between divides that space between the rows and space around divides it between as well as around

40
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.550
and finally center so vertically center.

41
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.800
In this case of vertical or if we had columns that were working with the same thing but horizontally

42
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.620
centered.

43
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.150
So let's play around.

44
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.270
First thing we need to do is actually get some rows.

45
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.000
Let's give these things away so that they take up more space and we'll be forced to wrap.

46
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:57.240
So let's say with about 300 pixels like this a big bigger as well.

47
00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.960
OK.

48
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.660
Now we need them to wrap because those aren't actually 300 pixels.

49
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.390
They're just being compressed.

50
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:10.340
So on our container let's say flex rap is rap.

51
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.670
You have permission to rap.

52
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.690
The other thing I'd say is let's change height to be 100.

53
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.270
VH viewport height and I am zoomed in.

54
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.040
There we go.

55
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.200
Hopefully this is easy enough for you to see.

56
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.470
OK.

57
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.750
So what's happening right now by default if you look as I resized this notice the white space that you

58
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.660
might expect is actually just turning into content.

59
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.480
It's being stretched out and that's because by default a line content is stretch.

60
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:49.000
So if I did a line content stretch nothing changes.

61
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.180
So I could do flex start and save.

62
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.750
And now things go back to normal what you would expect possibly are white spaces down at the bottom

63
00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:59.820
are cross axes.

64
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.270
It goes from top to bottom.

65
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.260
They are aligned to the top of it.

66
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.180
The opposite flex and they move down to the bottom.

67
00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:09.550
Whitespace comes up top.

68
00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.170
Or how about space between.

69
00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.820
Pretty common commonly used one.

70
00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:24.660
Now that space is between the two rows they're pushed to the top and bottom and we have space around

71
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:32.880
very similar and then we have center and center pushes those roast the middle as well.

72
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.290
So this is different than a line items and a line and justify content.

73
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:44.060
They all work in a similar way in that they deal with distributing space.

74
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:51.020
But you know just by content is distributing space on the main axis line items it's distributing space

75
00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:57.380
on the cross axis and the line content is distributing space between rows on the Cross access.

76
00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.840
So a lot of terminology.

77
00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.850
So that's it for the new stuff in this video.

78
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.340
But if you want to stick around like I've been doing the past couple of videos I'll just show mixing

79
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.620
and matching some of the other properties.

80
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:14.640
So the next one I'll do if we add in let's do a justified content let's say just the right content Center.

81
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.480
What's going to happen.

82
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.700
What do you think.

83
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.610
Very slight change.

84
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:26.810
This right here this row has no white space and it takes up the entire thing but this one did have one

85
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:27.410
space.

86
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:33.180
And so what it did is it took that white space and it distributed it on either side and it centered

87
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.150
our content.

88
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.300
As you can see.

89
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.160
OK.

90
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.040
So how about a big change.

91
00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.610
Let's go to flex direction and make it a column.

92
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.240
And why don't we get even fantods to columnar verse.

93
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.900
It's been a while.

94
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.650
I've reached on that.

95
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:56.310
So here we go we've got one two three four five six seven eight nine starting from the bottom to the

96
00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:01.410
top is our main axis and our cross axis goes from left to right.

97
00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.000
All right.

98
00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.780
So we have a line content flex start.

99
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.160
Let's try the center.

100
00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:09.740
Looks kind of cool.

101
00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.370
So what's happening is that it's aligning these taking the space between the rows and shoving it to

102
00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:19.110
the sides lining them on that cross axis from left to right.

103
00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.830
So if I wanted to move all of them keep them a chunk like this.

104
00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:30.990
These are many nine items in this shape and I want to move them to the bottom so that they're resting

105
00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.710
on this.

106
00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:32.580
How would I do that.

107
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:34.970
What's the property.

108
00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.490
OK.

109
00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.440
Well remember this is our main axis in this case.

110
00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:43.470
It goes from top I keep doing that goes from bottom to top.

111
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.410
So this is the start of the main axis.

112
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:55.040
So we want to do justify content flaks start and you can see actually without that it does that because

113
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.230
the default is flex start.

114
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:58.380
OK.

115
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:01.050
And we could also change on content.

116
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.290
Let's try to do space between.

117
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.710
OK so now we have evenly spaced across the corrupt axis.

118
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.060
Quite the tongue twister.

119
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:12.460
And I'll leave it at that for now.

120
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.260
But it's good to play around with this.

121
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.330
Make sure you understand how things work.

122
00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.950
Make sure you can predict what will happen before you type the code.

123
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:20.450
All right.

124
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:26.210
So that wraps up these properties wraps up or wraps up these properties that we need to know to make

125
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:30.720
our next little tool Widget A nice nav bar that's also responsive.

126
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.120
OK.

127
00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:31.670
Coming up.
