00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.460
Now let's do an exercise involving updating some state.

2
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.210
A little more complicated.

3
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.590
I've made this simple app using create react up.

4
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:08.720
Let's take a look at the code.

5
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:18.810
So this app just has one component called app and you can see in our constructor we have state which

6
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:26.900
has an array of instructors and our array of instructors contains objects.

7
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.500
Each object has a name and a hobby's array.

8
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.770
So definitely much more complicated.

9
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:38.700
The first piece of state we saw were we just had a string and then down here in our render method we'll

10
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.790
just loop over that array of instructors and display the instructor name and then display the list of

11
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.550
instructor hobbies.

12
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.510
So what's your goal for this assignment.

13
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:57.210
Well your code should randomly select an instructor and then randomly decide to remove that instructor's

14
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.020
hobby.

15
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:06.710
So let's say that's Matt was randomly selected and then one of those Javie should be randomly moved.

16
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.500
Let's say that random removed Havi happens to be math.

17
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.500
So after your code has been loaded for five seconds math should be removed and all we should see is

18
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.210
the from that.

19
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:24.120
Now if I refresh that page a different hobby should be randomly move from a different random instructor.

20
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:31.090
So the basic setup for this code would be at the bottom of this constructor function.

21
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.490
I'm going to have a set time out

22
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.580
that runs in approximately five seconds and does something to update the state.

23
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.960
Make sure you use an arrow function here.

24
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.750
We want to make sure that we preserve this in our callback function so that this set state refers to

25
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:54.170
the right.

26
00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:01.890
This will see this more but just for the time being make sure this is an arrow function on normal function.

27
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.050
And one more piece of advice.

28
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.890
Make absolutely sure that you don't modify anything directly in this that's at stake.

29
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.040
Remember what we talked about in our pure function examples in the last video.

30
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.030
All the objects the update using set state must not modify the original state.

31
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.750
So good luck with that and then we'll see a solution after you give it a try.
