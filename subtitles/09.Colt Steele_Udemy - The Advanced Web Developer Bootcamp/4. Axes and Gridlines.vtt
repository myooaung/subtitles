00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:01.910
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:07.530
In this video will continue to improve the scatterplot we made in the last video by adding the title

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.520
axes and grid lines.

4
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.520
Let's review what we've done so far in the last video.

5
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.700
We made a scatterplot to visualize birth data from different countries in 2011.

6
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.180
Here are some links to the code where we left it off.

7
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.460
We know what's being visualized because we wrote the code.

8
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.820
But imagine if you shared this scatterplot with a friend of yours.

9
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.200
They'd have no idea what the data is supposed to represent.

10
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.870
There are no labels no axes there's no information of any kind on the page about what exactly we're

11
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:40.620
looking at.

12
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.870
Let's fix that.

13
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.670
The first thing we'll do is create some axes graph axes are a difficult thing to draw on your own.

14
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:55.250
You need to draw the line representing the axis along with tick marks and text labels for each tick

15
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.430
mark.

16
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.060
Doing all this from scratch can be quite an ordeal.

17
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.230
Fortunately D-3 has methods that will take care of all of this busywork for you.

18
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:12.580
There are four methods D-3 uses to create axes axes top axis right axis bottom and axes left.

19
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:19.160
All of these methods taken a scale and return a function that can generate an axis in SVGA.

20
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.630
The method we choose determines where the text labels will sit relative to the axis but to whip up a

21
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.340
quick x axis using D-3 got access.

22
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:36.300
Bottom pasand the scale that we created in the previous video this pattern is fairly typical.

23
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.200
In order to get the axis to show up we need to call the axis function we've created on a D-3 selection

24
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.890
cool.

25
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.470
There's our axis if we inspect it using the elements tab we can see that there's a fair amount going

26
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.680
on our access is inside of a group that we depended.

27
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.950
It's got a path consisting of the main axis line along with tick marks on either side.

28
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.370
Inside of each one of these groups we've got a line from a tick mark along with the text label.

29
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:14.480
The position of our axis is a little less than ideal by default D-3 appends axes starting from the origin

30
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.000
of the SVGA that is the upper left corner.

31
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.520
If we want the axis somewhere else we need to move it ourselves.

32
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.870
Let's do that now by setting the transform attribute on the group with the appended

33
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.000
nice.

34
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.620
Let's repeat this process for the y axis.

35
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.420
This time we'll use axes left instead of axis bottom

36
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:42.480
cool.

37
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.210
This is already looking much better.

38
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.140
If you'd like to add grid lines to improve the readability of your graph you can do that directly from

39
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.580
the axes.

40
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.370
The simplest thing to do is change the size of the ticks so that they stretch across the SPG.

41
00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.570
The only catch is that the graph area takes padding into account.

42
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:07.420
So the length of the ticks shown to to adjust the length of the tit's we can use the tick size method

43
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.690
and passing the desired length the ticks will stretch in the direction of the axis label.

44
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.460
So for both of our axes we'll want our sizes to be negative.

45
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.320
The x axis this will stretch the ticks up.

46
00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:28.610
We want the total size to be the negative value of the height plus twice the padding one on top and

47
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:29.510
one on bottom.

48
00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:37.490
We'll take a very similar approach for the y axis.

49
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.980
Note that having the text size updates the length of the text with text labels and the text at either

50
00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.600
end of the axes.

51
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.030
If you don't want to adjust the text on either end of the axes you can set their lengths separately

52
00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.810
using the tick size outer method.

53
00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.040
Here's what it looks like.

54
00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.450
If we set the outer take size to zero

55
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.980
let's also adjust the styling of the grid lines.

56
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.940
Each grid line is inside of a group with the class tick.

57
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.720
So we'll select those Blyton the stroke color and make the lines dash using the stroke dash array property

58
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:21.250
the value for this property takes two numbers the length of the dash and the distance between dashes.

59
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:28.120
Let's finish things up by adding some labels to the axes and giving our graph a title D-3 doesn't provide

60
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.850
us with any secret sauce for adding these things.

61
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.210
To add these text labels we just need to go back to our D-3 fundamentals.

62
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:44.390
Select the SPG append the text element position correctly and set its inner text.

63
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:50.600
Here's how we can do that for the x axis label here we're positioning the text element so that it's

64
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.330
centered horizontally and vertically aligned with the x axis.

65
00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.660
Then we're using the D-y attribute to push it down relative to the x axis.

66
00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.910
Finally we're centering the text relative to its X attribute and setting the text inside of it.

67
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.160
We're not doing much else to style these elements.

68
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:15.610
Feel free to add some styling of your own either using the D-3 style method or Anisya file as you can

69
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.180
see it's kind of a tight squeeze and the label is getting cut off.

70
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.030
Let me give the visualization a little more padding.

71
00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.060
Cool that's better.

72
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.420
Adding a title is very similar.

73
00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:36.380
A bump up the text a bit but otherwise what we're doing should look very similar to what we just did.

74
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.950
All that's left now is the y axis.

75
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:44.620
This one is a little trickier because we need to rotate the text 90 degrees after the rotation we need

76
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.390
to be careful with the x and y attributes.

77
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.630
Since adjusting the X attribute will now move the text element in the vertical direction and adjusting

78
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.160
the Y attribute will move the element in the horizontal direction.

79
00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.410
Getting the positioning right can take a bit of guess and check if you make a mistake.

80
00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:06.210
Take a look at where the element wound up using the elements tab and adjust as necessary.

81
00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.550
Eventually you should land on code that looks something like this.

82
00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.710
It's definitely a lot clearer now what our graph is representing.

83
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.970
There are further enhancements we could make.

84
00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:18.910
But we'll stop here for now.

85
00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:23.370
Take a look at the exercises for some of these intermediate D-3 concepts.

86
00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:29.320
In the next video we'll change gears a bit and talk about other Grath types but we'll come back to this

87
00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.200
example soon enough.

88
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.800
I'll see you in the next video.
