00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.780
Now we're kind of to do an exercise.

2
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.950
So our goal is to build this app as you can tell there's very little styling and honestly not a lot

3
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.520
of functionality.

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:22.620
You are essentially just typing something in here like feed Moxey and then the two item that you just

5
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:29.600
save will show up in the DOM and I can type something else let's say wash my car.

6
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.140
So that's the entire app.

7
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.010
There's very minimal styling So don't focus on the styling.

8
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.220
The main goal of this is just to make sure that you understand forms and that you understand events.

9
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.280
So we haven't seen a lot of live coding of a full app with events or forms yet.

10
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.690
That's by design.

11
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.880
So I'm hoping that you can pick up enough from the last few videos to get this done.

12
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.730
But if you get stuck Don't worry.

13
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.080
Next we'll have a solution.

14
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.230
Then after that we'll go in depth into an app that has forms and events.
