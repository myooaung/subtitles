00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:07.290
OK so if I open up my network Inspektor here and I click our button that sending dollar signs that Ajax

2
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.240
we can see that it's a char that's created looks just the same to Chrome and this network Inspektor

3
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.670
as any other ex-aide chart that we could create.

4
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.710
So you know it's still get requests as are you or else everything is the same.

5
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.220
So what you should take away from that is that this is just generating an a char behind the scenes if

6
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.600
you want to look at the source code.

7
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.180
It's kind of convoluted to track it down.

8
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:41.510
Here's the base Ajax file Ajax that J s on there get hungry repo and if you do a search for ex-aide

9
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.260
char or SML HGP it never shows up on here.

10
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.440
And that's because they've split it up into separate files and these little modules.

11
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.970
So all these things appear that are basically required are imported.

12
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.460
So I followed it over here and here is the key line.

13
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.970
Return new window that SML HTP request.

14
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.630
So take querido Ajax settings.

15
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.690
X 8 char.

16
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.310
So never we see Ajax setting start X a char in the source code.

17
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.000
It's returning a new X amount.

18
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:20.510
HTP request if it can and then further down can also see where they're actually opening that request.

19
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.530
So in that options this is referring to the options we provide when we do something like this.

20
00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:27.970
This is options.

21
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.390
So that's that's the method here.

22
00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.500
And then options that you are so it's going to be that are we provide and then that request is sent.

23
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.870
If you scroll further down if we just do a search for it here we go.

24
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.070
It's a chart send so that request is sent.
