1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,710
The next instructor I'd like you to meet in L.A. she'll pick Oh boy where do we start early.

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,340
We've been teaching together for a couple of years now.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,660
First at General Assembly and then we both went to galvanize and work together as well.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,360
He is without a doubt one of the best instructors ever had the privilege of working with.

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,670
We're actually very evenly matched and ping pong as well.

6
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:26,160
And we have pretty similar backgrounds as to how we arrived at teaching moment.

7
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:26,960
What's your story.

8
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:27,390
Sure.

9
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,430
So I actually studied finance.

10
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:33,660
I worked as a consultant for a couple of years and I was working on a startup and was the only person

11
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,920
who was not technical there.

12
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:40,140
So I actually kind of had to learn the hard way to build websites and build applications and always

13
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,250
had the dream of being a teacher but never thought I'd be lucky enough to do it.

14
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,850
When I did and I'm really passionate about seeing people learn how to code in doing some similar things

15
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,990
that both you and I have done so I'm asking ever on this what's your thing.

16
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:53,660
They're quick to him.

17
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,270
I mean you teach it all you do everything.

18
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,240
But what's your sweet spot.

19
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:02,030
Yeah I really like teaching some more the advanced concepts in javascript I think it's pretty easy to

20
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,630
learn some of the fundamentals on your own but when you really start diving into those more advanced

21
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,970
topics it's really hard to do it just by yourself.

22
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,970
So I really enjoy teaching those.

23
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:13,380
I struggle to learn it myself and I've just gotten better and better at teaching it.

24
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,060
So it's a real passion of mine to impart that knowledge on people who are just getting started with

25
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:21,500
more advanced parts in the language and we're really lucky to have Ellie to teach that stuff because

26
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:27,740
personally I struggle with it but it's always been a master at breaking down those tough parts of Javascript.

27
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:32,060
So you see him a bunch in this course of pop up pretty much all javascript stuff.

28
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,400
Testing.

29
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:37,490
Yes 20:15 much more hardcore stuff.

30
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:38,030
All right.

31
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:42,590
So now that you've met all the instructors and whiskey I wish you.

32
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,150
Let's take a little bit of time to talk about what the Course covers and what you can expect.
