1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:06,300
Next up we'll see props in action by creating a recipe application.

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:11,520
Our objective is pretty straightforward we're going to use props in an application and the application

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,790
we're going to build is this recipes app.

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,280
So to start with.

5
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,380
Of this functionality above will work.

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,820
This is all just for show.

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:28,710
But we'll be able to see different recipes with images and ingredients and instructions and a title.

8
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,410
So let's build this.

9
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,240
The first thing you always want to do when you're thinking about a new project is to break it down into

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,830
components.

11
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:43,680
So when I'm tackling this problem the first thing that I would work on is I probably make one component

12
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,830
for a single recipe.

13
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:52,380
So this recipe card here will be one component and then I can write another component that contains

14
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,120
recipe cards.

15
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,680
So let's let's start that way.

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,470
Let's start by making a single one of these recipes.

17
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:04,950
Let's get started by going over to cloud nine and creating a new application.

18
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:22,810
So as you can see I mean re-act directory and I'm going to say create re-act up recipe prop's starter.

19
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,620
All right our app is all created.

20
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:33,050
And this time let's go into this directory go into packets Jaison and we'll update the version of re-act

21
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:34,370
we're using.

22
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:41,030
So again if your version already says 16 then you don't need to do anything here but at the time of

23
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:48,680
making this video reac 16 is not quite out yet so I'm going to specify sixteen point zero point zero

24
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:57,270
dash RC dot 3 and I'll do the same for re-act.

25
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:57,580
All right.

26
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:02,050
Now that I've done that the next thing I want to do is reinstall my modules.

27
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:07,790
So I'm just going to go in to hear CD into my recipe Propp starter.

28
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:19,510
I'm going to remove the package lock Jaison file and I'm also going to remove no modules.

29
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,190
Now do NPM install again.

30
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,830
All right we've got our modules installed.

31
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:32,080
And let's just run it to make sure everything works.

32
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:38,770
I'll open this up

33
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,380
and we've got to react 16 Up up and running.

34
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,340
All right.

35
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,390
Now let's get started with a recipe.

36
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:55,080
The first thing we'll do is go back to our code and rename this app that jast to recipe app.

37
00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:02,880
So it's rename that file to recipe app and we'll rename it here as well.

38
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,940
And Nurse we got an error there because of the rename.

39
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,150
All right.

40
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:14,740
Now both files are renamed let's open that up and I'll import recipe app that's VSS instead of app that

41
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:20,780
C-s us and then I'll also rename this to recipe up and down here recipe.

42
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,440
Up next we need to fix index just so let's go there.

43
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:34,970
And inside of here we need to change everything from app to recipe app.

44
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:39,830
Now remember the name here doesn't really matter I could keep it as app as far as the the name of the

45
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:44,220
import goes but I'm just going to make a recipe out for consistency.

46
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,960
Let's check the server.

47
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,430
No errors we're looking good.

48
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,060
Next thing I want to do is create a recipe component.

49
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,970
So let's start that over here.

50
00:03:54,980 --> 00:04:05,430
Make a new file and I'll call it just recipe dodgiest and then also give it a CSSA file.

51
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:32,460
Now inside a recipe Jasp will have the normal code.

52
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,960
Now we have a component that should just render something.

53
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:39,390
So let's add it into our recipe app Jass and make sure it works.

54
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:44,970
So I'll just get rid of all of this because we don't need it for now.

55
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,670
Import recipe.

56
00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:00,150
And then use the computer here.

57
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:06,020
So we should see the text recipe and it's not too exciting right now but it shows up.

58
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,630
So that means is working.

59
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,410
Now let's start working towards making this look more like a recipe.

60
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:17,630
So if you remember what this looks like we've got a title of some ingredients instruction string and

61
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,220
an image.

62
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:25,100
So let's go back to our recipe component and the first thing I might want to do is pass something to

63
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,560
this component so I'll check out recipe.

64
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:36,870
And I'll say a title is now let's just make some pasta.

65
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,430
So now inside a recipe.

66
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:48,070
Yes I have access to pasta via this stop Propst that title so I can render that simply by saying stop

67
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:53,000
Propst that title and I should see pasta on the screen.

68
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,970
And I do.

69
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:07,650
But a common practice here is to restructure this object so I can also say conc title equals that's

70
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,470
not prop's if you're not familiar with destructuring like this you might want to go back in the course

71
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,380
and check it out.

72
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:20,490
It's used all over and react essentially we're creating a variable called Title as long as the stop

73
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,130
props has a property in it called Title.

74
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:28,160
It's a shorthand for saying title equals this not perhaps that title.

75
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,020
OK.

76
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:35,460
And I also want to remember to update the title here so now I've got a variable I don't need to use

77
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,400
this dot props.

78
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,620
All right next let's add ingredients.

79
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:45,220
So if I go over here ingredients there's a list of things so an array makes sense.

80
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:54,600
I'm going to say my ingredients are equal to an array inside of curly brackets because we want a javascript

81
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,160
array.

82
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:02,530
And I'll just give it two ingredients flour and water.

83
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,360
All right.

84
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:11,400
Now inside of my recipe component I want to use those ingredients to generate some some GSX so I'll

85
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:24,240
make a concept ingredients equal to the stock prop stock ingredients that map and the parameters here

86
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,440
are going to be my ingredient and then my index.

87
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,530
And to wrap those Bremner's

88
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:43,850
and commonly here when there's only a one line return like we have here we've got to have sex rather

89
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:46,820
than use curly braces and have to explicitly say return.

90
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,410
We just use parentheses which just wraps this statement for us.

91
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:54,290
So now we don't have to use return when we return from our map.

92
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:58,790
And what I want to return is a list of allies.

93
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:05,490
So for each ingredient I want to make an ally make the key equal to index.

94
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,700
Remember the key needs to be unique for this array.

95
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,770
So the index should work because I don't think my ingredient list is going to change.

96
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,320
And then I also want to include my ingredient and I want to close off my ally.

97
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,430
All right.

98
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:29,550
Next up let's render this list of ingredients so I'll make a UL here and then I'll close off the UL

99
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:36,990
and inside of that render that array the ingredients array.

100
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:41,500
And remember this is array of jazz sax elements not of strings anymore.

101
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,380
So we could just render it directly like that.

102
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:49,950
One other catch here is that we can never return multiple GSX elements next to each other.

103
00:08:49,990 --> 00:09:02,580
So I just need to wrap this in a div.

104
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:02,960
All right.

105
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,240
Let's see how that works.

106
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,970
As you can see we are showing flour and water.

107
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,540
So we're on our way.

108
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:19,720
We're not quite at this recipe component yet but we have a list of ingredients and we have a title.

109
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,200
This video is getting a little long saw and it there.

110
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:27,060
Next up what instructions and an image and we'll add some CSSA so it doesn't look terrible.
