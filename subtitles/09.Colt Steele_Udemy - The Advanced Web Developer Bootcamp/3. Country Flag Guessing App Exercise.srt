1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,680
Now you're going to work on an app to make a country flag guessing game.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:09,660
And this should use component didn't mount to make an Ajax request plus all the things we've learned

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,480
previously about props and state the application looks like this.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,020
You're presented with a random flag and four options.

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,190
You'll make your choice.

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,140
I'm not sure which flag this is

7
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,670
and then if you're wrong it'll tell you the correct answer.

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,130
Let's see if I can get one right.

9
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:37,740
And if you're correct Cuba will tell you that and you essentially just keep going this way every time

10
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:38,640
you click next.

11
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,310
You get a new random flag.

12
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,530
One of these options is the correct option.

13
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,210
And the other three are incorrect options.

14
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,740
So how are you getting this data.

15
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:55,300
We'll use the rest country's API in your component didn't mount you make a get request to this your

16
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,860
L and you'll get back an array that looks like this.

17
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:04,550
All the properties aren't shown here but the things we care about are in each object will have a name

18
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:05,770
and a flag.

19
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:11,210
So you make a request on component and mount get all these results and then use the results in your

20
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:17,500
application to randomly pick four countries one of which should be your solution.

21
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,540
Good luck on this one.

22
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,700
And like always we'll have a solution after.
