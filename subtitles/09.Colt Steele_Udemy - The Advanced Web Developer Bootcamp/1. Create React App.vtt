00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.470
Let's get started with create react out.

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.880
So create re-act that was a tool that we're going to use a lot in this course and its goal is basically

3
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.330
to get you up and running with a fully working re-act application without much configuration.

4
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:22.150
So first our objectives are going to be to describe web pack that's a tool they create re-act app uses

5
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.370
to install create re-act up.

6
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:32.750
And finally to make an application using create react out of all what is web pack.

7
00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.620
Well it's described on the Web site as a module bundler for modern javascript applications essentially

8
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.430
a build tool and the features that we're going to use it for.

9
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:47.470
First of all to combine different files javascript files into a single bundle jackass.

10
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.980
So if you've ever built a production application before you know that it's usually advantageous to bundle

11
00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:01.010
all of our javascript into one single file so that the download is quicker for the client where Peck

12
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.670
also has a plug in system that makes it very configurable.

13
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.840
One of the plug ins that we'll use is the babble plugin if you remember our application before when

14
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.640
we opened up the console we saw that the apple is a little slow because we were running Babel on the

15
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.320
client side in the browser.

16
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.620
Well we're back now can run Babel for us before we ever deliver the javascript to the client.

17
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.470
And what that can also do things like bundle up our CSSA or images as well.

18
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.390
So I want to make the point now that Westpac is an awesome tool.

19
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.370
It's configurable.

20
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.770
It's really powerful and you can really do a lot with it but it doesn't really help you learn react.

21
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.660
So my priority in this course is really going to be to focus on learning reacts first and pack later

22
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.660
and create react that is a great tool that allows you to build the re-act application without really

23
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:57.800
knowing much about what pack it comes with a preconfigured web pack so you don't have to do it yourself.

24
00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.960
So that's what I'll focus on in this course.

25
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.520
Now let's talk about using create re-act out.

26
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.690
So the first thing I'm doing here is I'm opening up a terminal window to start typing some commands

27
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.460
in cloud 9.

28
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.690
If you remember cloud 9 was the tool that we used back in the node section.

29
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.170
So if you skipped over that section you might want to go back and check it out.

30
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.990
The set up instructions at least if you want to get a new window that looks like this just click on

31
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:33.490
this tab and say new terminal window and then from here there's already some files installed from the

32
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:34.380
last projects.

33
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.850
So I'm going to start by making a new folder just for Riak stuff.

34
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:47.110
All right now I've got my re-act folder the next thing I want to do is use create reactor.

35
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:59.410
So in order to use it I'll have to install it using NPM going to do NPM install Dashti create reacts.

36
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.760
All right great now it's installed.

37
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.050
Next step would be to create a new project.

38
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.140
So the command there is create react.

39
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.930
And then the name of your project so let's just call this one hello world.

40
00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:19.050
And this may take a little while with Cloud 9 but stick with it I promise it will finish up.

41
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.950
OK.

42
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.730
There we go.

43
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.070
So we've got our our new project installed.

44
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.970
Hello world.

45
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.370
And the first thing you'll see is all the commands that you can run.

46
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:38.380
So NPM start actually run our server for us NPM run build is for production we won't need that right

47
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.010
now.

48
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:46.000
NPM test runs the one test file that we've got and NPM run inject is what you'll use if you want to

49
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.970
configure web pack on your own.

50
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:55.810
So this takes all the scripts that are already predefined for building web pack and ejects them into

51
00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.760
your environment so that you can edit them yourself.

52
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.010
We won't be using this for for now.

53
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.090
So this suggestion says Down here the first thing you want to do is change directories into the new

54
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.470
directory that was created for your project.

55
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:15.080
So I'll see the into hello world and let me clear this consolers well.

56
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:22.340
Now inside of here I've got my new project directory and in order to run this I'll just do NPM start

57
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:31.180
and now my development server is running and I can click on this link and say open in Preview

58
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:41.800
and there's our app and the next video will see all the files that we get and kind of explore what create

59
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.850
re-act that gives us.
