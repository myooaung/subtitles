Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:07,460
In this video we're going to introduce a new kind of loop for easily iterating over arrays and newer

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:08,320
data structures.

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:17,550
In 2015 in the form of Lupe the syntax of a for loop is very similar to a for loop a for loop is traditionally

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:23,740
used to loop over keys in an object but it isn't the most helpful for iterating over values in an array.

6
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,410
That's where four of can help us out.

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:33,670
Let's create a variable called R and assign it to the array with 1 2 3 4 and 5.

8
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,900
We can now use a form of a loop to iterate over all the values in this array.

9
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:47,010
We will say four letters all of our and inside of that loop cancelled out log each of al.

10
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,860
So how does a for loop work.

11
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:54,850
Yes 2015 gives us a new primitive data type called a symbol which you will not be working with frequently

12
00:00:55,090 --> 00:01:01,720
but there is a method on symbols called iterator which specifies how a data type is iterated over some

13
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:07,660
built in data types like strings and special kinds of objects like arrays as well as to new data structures

14
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:14,620
which we'll examine later maps and sets and the built in symbol that iterator function however objects

15
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,610
do not.

16
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:20,430
This means that we cannot use a for loop to iterate over an object.

17
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:21,780
Let's examine what we mean by that.

18
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:28,000
In the chrome console I'll use the console that Diyar command to look at an array and if we examine

19
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:34,490
it's donder proto we will see that on the array dot prototype there exists a method called symbol iterator.

20
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,130
This means we can use a for loop.

21
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,320
How about an object.

22
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:44,590
If we go up to the Dunder Prato and look at the object prototype we will see there is no symbol that

23
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,030
iterator implemented.

24
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,190
And if we try to use a for loop we will get a type error.

25
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:54,610
Since we're trying to invoke a function called iterator that does not exist in the next video we're

26
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:59,470
going to introduce a new operator which might look a bit strange at first but will quite a bit with

27
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:01,830
writing cleaner and more maintainable code.

28
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,320
See if there.
