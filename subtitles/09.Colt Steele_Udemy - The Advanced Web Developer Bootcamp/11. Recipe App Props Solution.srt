1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,510
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:04,710
Hope that wasn't too challenging but I think it's great exercise.

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,940
So let's go for the solution.

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,700
Remember we're at this point with our recipe component and we want to build this.

5
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:18,660
So I suggest starting first with the nav bar mainly because it's all stacked against him.

6
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,170
So it should be an easy place to start.

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,460
So first thing I want to do is I'll just create a copy of this.

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:35,080
So we have the starter code and the solution.

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,470
So I've gotten that directory copied over and I have started the server so we're all set up to start

10
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:44,610
development in the new recipe proper solution folder.

11
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,300
Now let's talk about that now.

12
00:00:47,250 --> 00:01:00,800
I'll start by making the two files for the component the nav bar J.S. and the Gnab RC ss.

13
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:07,360
Now it's fill in the nav bar component like always we need the standard imports and the class definition

14
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,000
so let's do that

15
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:23,850
OK.

16
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:27,040
Now we've got the skeleton of our bar component.

17
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:39,830
The next thing that I'm going to do is just return our ECMO here and I've already got that set up.

18
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,570
So this is going to be very similar for the nav bar we have the recipe app which will be off to the

19
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:54,900
left and then the nav off to the right which has new recipe home about and contact us and all these

20
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,860
things won't do anything for right now.

21
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,470
So that's our now Barch component.

22
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:09,920
Let's add it into our recipe app.

23
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:12,180
All right now we've added to the recipe app.

24
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,420
Let's see it in the browser.

25
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,760
There we go it's rendering.

26
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:23,350
Now let's add some CSSA.

27
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,870
All right let's talk over this CSSA quickly.

28
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,910
So in the top level of that component I made a header tag.

29
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,450
So I'm just adding some styles that are the main thing here is that it's display flex.

30
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:44,040
We're adding some space between and adding some color for the text we're taking up the list style for

31
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:50,130
all the allies in the header and we're taking out the text decoration for anchors reading some opacity

32
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:57,420
when we hover some pretty standard stuff so I'll include this in the notes but I won't go over it line

33
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,220
by line.

34
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:04,790
In this last part here where we're changing the now slightly when the size of the the window changes.

35
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:05,160
All right.

36
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,810
Let's see that.

37
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:11,960
And as you can see now we've got a header that looks a lot more like our solution.

38
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,210
So pretty good progress.

39
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:17,710
Let's now work on a list of these recipe components.

40
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,690
Now make recipe list.

41
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:26,030
Jasin CSSA so I had that.

42
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:32,520
And the purpose of this component is just to take in a list of recipes and then display them using the

43
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,200
recipe component.

44
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,750
So it's not going to do too much we'll see.

45
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:43,130
I'll start by adding the normal boiler plate that we're always going to have we're going to import re-acting

46
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:59,660
component and we're going to create the class.

47
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:05,110
Now this recipe list is going to render a list of recipe components so let's import that as well.

48
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,230
And we also want to import the CSSA that we just created.

49
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,540
So now I've got everything set up.

50
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:23,840
The next step would be to accept a prop that describes all the recipes that I want to display.

51
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:30,030
And since we don't have any any data coming in from the user let's create some default props here so

52
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,610
we can display something.

53
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,220
So at the top of my class I'll add some default props

54
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:42,720
and I've already got an array of different props that I'll copy over.

55
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:46,290
So these are the props that I use for my my solution.

56
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:50,790
We've got spaghetti milkshake and avocado toast for my my solutions.

57
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,620
I remember so far we've only got spaghetti as an image.

58
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,870
I'll copy over the milkshake and the avocado toast as well.

59
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:00,470
So all three of these files should exist in the public folder.

60
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,350
Next let's specify some prop types.

61
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,000
So and my prop types here

62
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:13,240
and the only problem taking an adverse component is an array of recipes.

63
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,130
And like I said that's going to be an array

64
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:26,480
and this is an array of objects this time.

65
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:32,570
Now with prop types you can get more specific and say prop types that shape and describe the shape of

66
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,590
every object that you expect.

67
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:40,640
But in this case we're going to describe that inside the recipe component so no need to do it twice.

68
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,600
Also you'll notice that this is underlined because I don't have prop types importer yet so I have to

69
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:54,420
go up to the top and do that.

70
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:58,670
Now in my render method I just want to iterate over the recipes array.

71
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:02,150
I want to map over each element and return some GSX.

72
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,310
So let's do that.

73
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:35,770
Now all I have to do in this component is return the list of GSX elements inside of a div.

74
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:45,510
I've added a class name here so we can style this container.

75
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:49,370
Now we need to use this component inside of our recipe map.

76
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,300
Let's go to recipe objects.

77
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,210
And rather than render one recipe here let's run into the whole recipe list.

78
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,820
So first I'll import the list

79
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,920
and then I'll render the list.

80
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,740
And remember since we have different props here.

81
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:24,530
I'm not passing in recipe recipes array but in practice we should pass that in when we have real data.

82
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:27,510
Now let's check that out in the browser.

83
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:33,080
It looks like we've got a bug here and it says it can't resolve recipe list that's VSS and that looks

84
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,830
like it's in the recipe list jazz file so check that out.

85
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:46,240
And the issue here is that I didn't do a relative path so I need to add relative to this current directory

86
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,110
and now it works.

87
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,230
All right so we've got all of our recipe lists.

88
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,940
I just need to do a few things so I'll add some styling to the recipe list so that it doesn't show up

89
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,060
in a column like this.

90
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:09,550
And then I'll also add those two images first the styling so recipe list that's the SS I'm going to

91
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:15,920
add the recipe list has display flex direction flex direction row and then this flex wrap so that wrap

92
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:21,770
to the next line and then when the screen gets small it will it will change the display.

93
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,800
Let's see that

94
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:26,800
great.

95
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,370
Now they look much better.

96
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:35,280
Now off camera I'll just add in those other images by dragging and dropping into this public folder

97
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,260
my avocado image of my milkshake image.

98
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,790
And then check it out.

99
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:43,470
And they added those images.

100
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,620
So let's go check out the website.

101
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,720
And there we go.

102
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,610
Looks good looks just like our solution.

103
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,720
Great.

104
00:08:50,740 --> 00:09:00,190
So the last step I want to do before I call it quits is to add prop types to that recipe component.

105
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:10,860
I'm just going to paste in the prop types and explain.

106
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:15,850
So just like the other example we're just adding prop types this component so that the user of the component

107
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,280
is clear what things are required.

108
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:24,700
So in this case we've got prop types for the title the ingredients the instructions in the image and

109
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,880
come to think of it we should probably also make this recipe less required.

110
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:36,550
So anyway all of these are required because they're needed for display and in the recipe lists.

111
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:43,920
I'm also going to add required to this and that's all that's are completed up.

112
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:47,200
So next up we'll talk about one more props concept props that children.
