00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,410
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:05,950
In this video we'll continue building this marketing page for mountain travel.

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:11,100
In the last video we took care of what you see when the page loads.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,470
Now let's work on what we want people to see when they scroll.

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,760
I'll start with the HVM out first.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,220
I'll create a new section and give it a class of destination's

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,210
inside of this section.

8
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:26,140
I'll create a title

9
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,870
and then I'll paste in some marketing text inside of a tag.

10
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,440
Next hour including H tag.

11
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,790
After that I want to include some images of mountains.

12
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,360
I'll do this with a UL.

13
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,870
I'll give this UL a class of grid and inside of it.

14
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:59,980
I'll lay out my four images so that I don't need a unique class or ID for each one.

15
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,260
I'll add the background images as inline styles.

16
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:22,840
I'll give two of them a class of small end to a class of large.

17
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,420
When I save and refresh I can see the text but not the images.

18
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,270
So let's hop into the stylesheet and fix the look of this section.

19
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,700
I'll start with some general styles.

20
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,760
I'll make all UL's have a list style of none.

21
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:43,090
And for my grid class I'll set the width to 100 percent

22
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:54,100
enable fluxbox allow the content to wrap and center the content

23
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,280
also style my H R tags.

24
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,460
I'll give them a fixed width and height set a background color

25
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:14,170
and give them some large I'll also clear out the default border that many browsers give to these elements.

26
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,630
Next let's tackle the text inside of our sections.

27
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:22,470
For my titles I'll make sure each word is capitalized.

28
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:34,120
And I'll add a few different properties for the font.

29
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:40,040
I'll also give my titles some margin and centered text.

30
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:54,570
For tags inside of my sections I'll set a maximum width of 775 pixels and the line height of two I'll

31
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,960
also give these elements some padding and margin

32
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:09,050
and once again Center the text.

33
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,690
This is looking better.

34
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,100
Next let's get those images showing up

35
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,150
to do this.

36
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:29,230
I'll add some styles for Elmis inside of my grade class inside of my destination class.

37
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:32,310
First I'll give each allys some height and padding.

38
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:39,830
Next eclipse the image to the content area so that the padding is reserved for white space.

39
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:48,120
I'll make sure the images cover the L.A. area and center them to.

40
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:52,730
Now I just need to specify the difference between small and large list items.

41
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,170
I'll use flex basis here and have small items take up 30 percent of the width

42
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,600
while large items take up the remaining 70 percent

43
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,080
there are images

44
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,370
great.

45
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:29,490
I think this section is complete Let's quickly tackle the next section.

46
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:36,020
Once people have seen the images our next step is to give them an overview of the packages we offer.

47
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:42,560
So once again I'll create a section this time with a class of packages inside I'll make another title

48
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,680
pay some tax inside of a p tag and add in a jar.

49
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,720
After that I'll include another grid.

50
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,530
This time the grid will have descriptions of different packages.

51
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:04,390
Each list item in my grid will have an icon an H for with some title text and a tag with a more detailed

52
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:11,510
description of the package.

53
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:18,070
If you remember from the intro video each one of these packages had an icon accompanying it to add these

54
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,730
icons.

55
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,790
I'll use an icon library called font.

56
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,850
Awesome to include Fogelson.

57
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:28,470
I just need to add since DSS inside of my head once I've done this.

58
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,500
Adding the icons is pretty simple.

59
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,790
When I find an icon I like on the web site

60
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,910
I can click on it to see what class name I should use.

61
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:50,440
Note that each icon also comes in multiple sizes.

62
00:05:50,640 --> 00:06:05,540
You can pass any one of these scale classes like F to X or f a 3x to increase the size of the icon.

63
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:09,780
For my first ally I'll use a compass icon to represent guided trips

64
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:19,660
next.

65
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,770
I'll use a camera icon to represent photo trips.

66
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,110
Then I'll use a bicycle icon to represent bicycle trips.

67
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,690
And finally I'll use the checkered flag icon to represent racing trips.

68
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,230
Notice that I'm also using the 4 x icon to make these icons larger

69
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,220
great.

70
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:17,560
We can see all of that content showing up on the page.

71
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,450
Now it just needs a little bit of styling love.

72
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:24,000
First I'll add one general rule to stripe our sections

73
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,660
excluding the hero section.

74
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:35,880
I'd like every other section to switch between having a white background and a light gray background.

75
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:43,440
Finally I'll need to style the list items inside of my package's grid

76
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,890
for the list items themselves.

77
00:07:51,900 --> 00:08:02,990
I'll give them some padding set the flex basis to 50 percent and center attacks.

78
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,370
I'll also change the font color of each icon

79
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,690
finally bump up the font size for my age for elements

80
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,480
and gives them some margin on top and bottom

81
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:34,370
nights that takes care of the packages section.

82
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,800
In the next video we'll tackle the rest of this page.

83
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,050
I'll see you there.
