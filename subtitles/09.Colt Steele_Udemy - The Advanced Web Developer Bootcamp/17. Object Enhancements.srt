00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:06,270
Welcome back in this section we're going to discuss some helpful object enhancements that yes 2015 gives

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,110
us.

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:11,040
We're going to start with a new feature called object shorthand notation.

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,020
Let's take a look at the object below.

5
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:16,620
We can see here that the keys and values are the same name.

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:23,580
In 2015 we can refactor this code and if the keys and values have the same name we do not have to repeat

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:24,760
that declaration.

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:31,640
Another nice feature that 2015 gives us is the ability to write succinct object methods.

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,290
We're defining a method as a function that is placed on an object.

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,800
So let's see what that will look like in S-5.

11
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,150
It should be pretty familiar.

12
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,920
And if you remember back in our discussion on perio functions we mentioned that we should not be using

13
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,770
aero functions as methods in objects.

14
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:52,710
The reason for this was because our functions do not get their own key word this and we might accidentally

15
00:00:52,770 --> 00:01:00,180
not get the correct value for the keyword that we want in 2015 we simply omit the colon and the function

16
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,910
keyword and place parentheses after the name of our method.

17
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:04,900
We can see below.

18
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,430
We're not using aero functions for the function keyword.

19
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,520
One last thing we'll look at is a handy feature called computed property names.

20
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:13,750
That might sound like a lot.

21
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,810
So let's see what we mean within five.

22
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,440
Example You are making a variable called first name and assigning it to the string.

23
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:26,490
Ellie if we wanted an object to have the key with whatever the value of the first name variable is we

24
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,160
would have to use bracket notation and let javascript evaluate that.

25
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:37,010
Unfortunately in S-5 we first have to make an object and then assign a value using bracket notation.

26
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:43,050
In 2015 we can assign a value using bracket notation while defining our object.

27
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,670
Let's see what that looks like here.

28
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:51,800
We simply add brackets around the name of the key to let javascript compute the name of the property.

29
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,800
That's exactly what computed property names are.

30
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:00,210
Before we recap what we've learned in this section it's your turn to practice a bit with some 2015 object

31
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,230
enhancements.

32
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,920
Good luck and I'll see you in the next video.
