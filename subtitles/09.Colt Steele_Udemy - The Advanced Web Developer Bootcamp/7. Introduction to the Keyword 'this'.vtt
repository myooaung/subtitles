00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.760
In the section we're going to be talking about the key word this the key word this is a bit tricky to

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.290
wrap your head around when learning intermedia javascript but it's the foundation for object oriented

3
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.050
programming.

4
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.830
In other trickier concepts like call apply and Byne which we'll cover in a later video to get started.

5
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.730
We're going to try to understand what the key word this is.

6
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.930
We're going to then analyze the four ways.

7
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.890
The key word this can be determined so that we always know what the value of the key word is.

8
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.430
Finally I'm going to try as hard as possible to not use the word this in a sentence.

9
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.360
Here we go.

10
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.520
So what is the key word this.

11
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.990
First off it is a reserved key word in javascript which means that we can not set it as the value of

12
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:45.550
a variable or importantly the value of the key word this is determined by how a function is called.

13
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.970
We usually call that the function's execution context.

14
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.190
In javascript every time that a function is run to special keywords are given to that function the arguments

15
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.390
keyword and the keyword this.

16
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:06.200
It's important to note that every time that a function is run a keyword this is defined for that function.

17
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.070
Another important thing to note about the keyword this is that if you can understand the four rules

18
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:18.330
for how the value of the keyword this can be determined the global rule object or implicit explicit

19
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.810
and new you will never have a problem with a keyword this.

20
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.260
So let's get started with the most broad rule of them all.

21
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:32.160
The global rule applies when you see the keyword this outside of a declared object.

22
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.240
What do I mean by a declared object.

23
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.060
What we mean here is that there has not been an object literal defined which contains a function which

24
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.160
uses the key word.

25
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.660
This you can also think of this as when the keyword this is in the wild when you see the keyword this

26
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:53.410
in the global context its value refers to the global object which in the browser is the window object.

27
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.900
In fact maybe you didn't know that every variable that you declare in the global scope is actually attached

28
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.400
to the window object.

29
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.740
Let's see what I mean by that.

30
00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.700
I'm going to declare a variable called instructor and assign it to the string Elodie the instructor

31
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.820
variable is in the global scope and actually can be accessed through the window object.

32
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.860
This is where all of our global variables live in the browser.

33
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.700
In fact instructor is the same exact thing as a windowed instructor.

34
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.830
Now that we have an idea of what the window object is let's come back to the keyboard.

35
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.640
This on the first line we see the keyword this in the wild.

36
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.290
It is not inside of any object.

37
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.660
So what is its value.

38
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.620
You guessed it it's the window.

39
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.840
Simple enough when the keyword this is outside of an object and you don't see call apply or bind or

40
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.480
the new keyword its value is the global object.

41
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.830
So what have you learned so far.

42
00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.520
The keyword this is a reserved keyword that can be determined using one of the four rules.

43
00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.510
We saw a bit of the first rule which stated that when the keyword this is not inside of a declared object

44
00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.710
its value is the global object in the next video.

45
00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.370
We're going to see what happens when the keyword this is inside of a function.

46
00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.860
See if there.
