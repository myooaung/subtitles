1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,520
All right welcome back.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:04,990
So it's time again for a quick and hopefully fun exercise.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,760
We've learned a lot about char's how they work their syntax.

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,890
It's time for you to get your hands dirty and build something so that something is this.

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,380
It's a very simple little widget that displays the current price of bitcoin.

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,810
Yes I'm using euros here but we'll talk about that in a moment.

7
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,490
Doesn't have to be euros.

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,710
There's a button down here that you click and it will refresh the price with whatever the most recent

9
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,940
price of bitcoin is according to the API.

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,860
That will also show you in just a moment.

11
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,630
So if you're not familiar with Bitcoin I'm not going to try to explain it.

12
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:37,940
I'll do a terrible job.

13
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,660
Essentially it's what's known as a crypto currency.

14
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:45,600
And if you've somehow escaped ever hearing about it all that really matters for this exercise is that

15
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,740
it's price changes.

16
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:53,070
It fluctuates a lot just like a stock or an exchange rate and that's nice for us to use as an example

17
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:58,980
here because every time we click this button there might or usually is a new price that is reflected

18
00:00:58,980 --> 00:00:59,380
here.

19
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:04,620
So the API we're going to use start there is put out by coin desk.

20
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,650
The you are Alpher the documentation is coin desk dot com slash API.

21
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,840
I'll include that in the resources.

22
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,820
But as you can see there's a couple of API is there's a historical one.

23
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,270
We don't care about that.

24
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,910
You could build something with it but that's not going to change very often.

25
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,310
But we want the real time data API.

26
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:29,220
So here's the actual You RL API that coined us our complex view on such BPI sosh current crisis Jaison.

27
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,860
I'll also include that as a resource if you visit the URL in your browser.

28
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,870
Here's the Jason response we get.

29
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:42,660
So we don't care really about the time or the disclaimer or even the chart name we want this BPI Bitcoin

30
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:47,220
price index and within that there are three sections for three currencies.

31
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,200
You've got U.S. dollars pounds and euros.

32
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,730
So feel free to pick whichever one you care about.

33
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:58,190
And I'm sorry if your current or if your home currency is not here.

34
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,690
I have no control over that.

35
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:08,100
So just pick one of these and what you need to do is go to the starter code use this URL and make requests.

36
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,260
So they started very simple.

37
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,610
There's an H1.

38
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:16,500
There's no price currently displayed but it goes in a span with the idea of price.

39
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,710
So whatever I put here they'll see is green because we have some simple CCS.

40
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,490
So what you'll need to do is when a user clicks this button right here they need to have javascript

41
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:34,140
that listens for an event makes a request to this API gets the data back extract the rate whether it's

42
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:41,190
U.S. dollars pounds or euros and updates this span right here to reflect that rate.

43
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:45,000
So in the end should be able to click and get a price.

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,250
And if I wait and click again I get a new price.

45
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:54,210
So that's what you're building started code is in the links as well as the API itself to give that a

46
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,050
shot if you want a little bit of a bonus.

47
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:02,340
You could do a couple of different things you could have it so that a price is displayed when the page

48
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:02,940
loads.

49
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,650
Currently that doesn't happen when I refresh the page.

50
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,400
There's no price until I click.

51
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,560
So that's a pretty easy change.

52
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:16,380
You could also include maybe a radio button or radio buttons or a checkbox for a user to specify what

53
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,550
currency they want rather than hard coding US dollars or euros.

54
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:26,010
So a couple of options if you want to go above and beyond give this a shot and we'll have a solution

55
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,210
video up next.
