1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:05,320
Hagen this course is a bit different and that we have four instructors you've already met me.

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,290
Now it's time to meet our next instructor.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,740
MATALIN Hey I was going this is WiFi of course mascot.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,130
Every course I've done so far it had an animal.

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,130
Whiskey is our mascot this time.

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,040
That's been a teacher for over 10 years teaching budding engineers at UCLA and devolve into camps like

7
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,340
galvanize.

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:29,130
And he has a Ph.D. in mathematics and he just published his first book Power up unlocking the hidden

9
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,610
mathematics of videogames in stores now.

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,660
That's him right there.

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,720
According to his personal bio on his website Matt loves to eagerly go off on nerdy math tangents at

12
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,310
every possible opportunity.

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,400
So you have that to look forward to.

14
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,320
Joking aside I've known Matt for three years.

15
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,500
We used to teach together galvanize.

16
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,890
He's just an incredible instructor and super smart guy all around just great person.

17
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,350
So you'll see a lot more of him and Matthew later on in the D-3 and data visualization sections of the

18
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,080
course.

19
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:07,490
So I've done a lot of talking all that Matt take over and chat a bit about his background so met.

20
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,320
How did you end up running your own boot camp.

21
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:15,180
Ah well I've always loved teaching when I was in grad school I taught students for a number of years

22
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:21,360
and after that I worked at math education start up and that's sort of where I picked up my my technical

23
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,710
chops.

24
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:27,900
And after a few years doing that I miss being in the classroom so I started teaching at galvanize and

25
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,300
after doing that for about a year I started rhythm with Ellington.

26
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,930
So I'm going to ask everyone this question.

27
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:41,040
You know we have this giant curriculum in bootcamp you've taught or three months or six months long.

28
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:41,920
All of that stuff.

29
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,260
What's your thing.

30
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,540
What's your favorite topic to teach.

31
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,260
I really love teaching D-3.

32
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,370
Let me sort of teach some some of the more math concepts which I always think is fun.

33
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:56,090
And Students also get to build things that are really cool to look at.

34
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,560
So you get a lot of wows when you're when you're given those kinds of talks.

35
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,570
Isn't that convenient.

36
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,650
Yes teaching I do three sections.

37
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,040
So you'll see a lot more of that later on in the course will pop up a couple of times.

38
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,540
Talk about some CSSA stuff.

39
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:15,950
But the main focus of his lessons are going to be on D-3 and building a really cool dashboard that is

40
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,900
going to be fun.

41
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,830
All right.

42
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:18,670
So I was.
