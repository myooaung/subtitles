00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.220
Moving on along to something a little bit more exciting.

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.220
We've been talking about things like translating scaling and rotating moving things around effecting

3
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.300
change on elements but we haven't been able to animate those changes yet.

4
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.680
We've been able to rotate something but it happens instantaneously.

5
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.690
So it's not quite animated that changes now though because in this section we're talking about CSSA

6
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:29.160
transitions so transitions allow us to control the animation speed the timing the acceleration and a

7
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.040
couple other properties when changing as properties on given elements.

8
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.600
So here's a little bit of an example we could double the size of a div which we already know how to

9
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.180
do.

10
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.350
But now we can say make sure that it goes over three seconds so don't don't double instantaneously but

11
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.360
take three seconds.

12
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.420
But that's not all that we can control.

13
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.090
We'll see there's actually four transition properties that we can control.

14
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.410
So the first one that we'll talk about is the duration which we already discussed briefly.

15
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.130
That's how long that change should take.

16
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:07.410
So if we're changing something from purple to yellow How many seconds or milliseconds do we want it

17
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.040
to take.

18
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.780
Or for doubling something in size three we want that to happen over half a second or 20 seconds.

19
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.990
Then there's transition property now transition property is actually calling out which individuals has

20
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.070
properties we want to transition.

21
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.680
So you might have five different things that are changed.

22
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:33.990
When you hover over let's say a div you change the background color you scale it you rotate it and you

23
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.540
also change the opacity.

24
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.210
Yes that's all I'm going for.

25
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.990
But let's say that you only want to animate the changing of the rotation and the scale.

26
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.470
You don't want to animate the color you want that to happen immediately.

27
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.930
Transition property allows you to call out which of those properties you care about.

28
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.660
So we'll dive into this in the next video.

29
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.440
The next one is transition timing function.

30
00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.110
This one is essentially the acceleration of the transition.

31
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.380
So given let's say 10 seconds for a duration we're animating the background color over 10 seconds.

32
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.970
We could animate it in a bunch of different ways.

33
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.090
We wanted to happen linearly over those 10 seconds or do you want it to change 90 percent of the way

34
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.910
very quickly and then the last 10 percent take a long time.

35
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.520
Or the opposite of that.

36
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.410
And we can actually custom define our own timing curves.

37
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.590
So that's coming up.

38
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.890
And then we have transition delay and transition delay is just once a change is set to occur.

39
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.190
How long do you wait until the transition starts.

40
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.080
So we've been working with huffers let's say we hover over something and it's supposed to change to

41
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.260
blue from yellow without transition delay.

42
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.100
It just would start immediately.

43
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.070
The transition.

44
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.580
But we can tell it to wait two seconds or half a second.

45
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.690
And usually it's kind of annoying if something doesn't happen right away when you hover.

46
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.460
But sometimes you do need to take advantage of that for certain animations.

47
00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.710
So those are the four key properties.

48
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.440
And in the next video we're actually going to deep dive into them we'll start typing them and see how

49
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.960
they work.

50
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.890
But until then I just want to go over to a demo code pen that I have.

51
00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:15.900
I have three different divs very similar at least at first but they have a couple of different transitions

52
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:16.430
applied.

53
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.930
So all of them change color when we hover.

54
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.160
This one the first one changes immediately to red as soon as I hover so there's no transition applied.

55
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.710
This is what we know how to do.

56
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:27.930
Currently.

57
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.530
This one however does have a transition.

58
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.980
It takes one second to change to read.

59
00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.640
So you can see that it animates that.

60
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.660
And then we've had this one that's labeled craziness and I'll explain a bit about what happens before

61
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.850
I triggered it because it seems kind of weird.

62
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.360
So there are a couple of things that are changing on this one.

63
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.450
First I'm changing the border radius which turns it into a circle.

64
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.170
So it looks like a circle.

65
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.460
The color is changing the background color.

66
00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.880
And there's a rotate happening at the same time as well.

67
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:06.090
Has a scale but you'll see they don't all have transitions and on top of that there's a delay that happens

68
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.640
so I'm going to hover right now and notice that it changes to a circle immediately.

69
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.320
But then when we reverse it it changes to a circle right away.

70
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.040
But the other elements the other changes don't occur for another second.

71
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.650
So there is a pause So that's the delay.

72
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.540
So here I go again changes to a circle.

73
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:32.360
Then it starts rotating and changes color and shrinks all three of those have a transition applied.

74
00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.410
So what I'm trying to show you here is that you can have more than one property transition.

75
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.550
In this case we're changing the color and that's transitioning nicely.

76
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.290
We're changing the size using transform scale that we just saw.

77
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:50.900
And then we're also rotating it using transform rotate and then the fourth thing that is not being transitioned

78
00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.670
is the border radius.

79
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:59.090
Notice how it goes immediately back to square when I release or hover away mouse off I guess it's the

80
00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.320
correct term.

81
00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.270
And then when I hover over it it immediately turns to a circle there's no smooth transition.

82
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.750
It doesn't take any time at all unlike the other properties.

83
00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.630
OK.

84
00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:15.200
So not the best experience obviously to have this on your site but it kind of combines everything that

85
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.280
we're going to see how to do in this section.

86
00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:22.180
And before we actually dive in the code and the next video I just want to have a quick pep talk.

87
00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:28.370
We will be building something more exciting more interesting than rotating circles and squares.

88
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:34.390
In this case we'll be building up to a more complex animation a couple of them later on in this section.

89
00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.260
But we've got to start at the basics.

90
00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.660
OK.

91
00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:37.760
So let's get going.
