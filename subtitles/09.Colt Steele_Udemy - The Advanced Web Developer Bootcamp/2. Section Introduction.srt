High in this section we're going to learn about a very popular front in library called reac react was

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,440
created by Facebook.

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:12,210
It started out on the web but it's also been used for many other purposes like mobile applications and

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,100
virtual reality.

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:22,030
We'll start out with the fundamentals react including GSX components prop's state and component lifecycle

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,160
methods.

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:29,340
Next we'll talk about more advanced concepts like the re-act router redux and authentication.

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,320
By the end of the Course you'll be a re-act expert.

9
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:37,800
You may be wondering why we chose react over other printed frameworks like angular puji Yes.

10
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,510
Well there are a few reasons.

11
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:45,540
First react has a very strong community of developers who make many useful open source packages.

12
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:51,300
Secondly I personally really enjoy programming re-act After you master the basics Riak becomes very

13
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,910
easy to use.

14
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,330
I think you're going to enjoy it as well.

15
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,770
So let's get started.
