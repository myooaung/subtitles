00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.530
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.890
In this video we'll use D-3 to add event listeners to the Dom as well as to insert and remove elements

3
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.350
from the DOM along the way.

4
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:16.840
We'll also take a look at two methods we didn't get a chance to explore in the previous videos to start.

5
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.630
Let's take a look at some code.

6
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.540
If you'd like to come along here's a link to the HVM Ellen CSSA amusing as well as a link to what the

7
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.500
page looks like.

8
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.590
Live as you can see I've got a simple little note taking app but right now it doesn't do much because

9
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.400
I haven't written any javascript because of this.

10
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.190
Our form is currently broken.

11
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.390
It should add a new note but right now it just refreshes the page.

12
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.440
Let's get this app working in order to do so.

13
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.820
Well we did add an event listener to the form to attach an event listener in D-3.

14
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:55.570
We use the method like a vanilla javascript add event listener method decrees on method except as its

15
00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.260
first argument.

16
00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.110
That type of event to listen for and second argument a callback to run when the event is triggered.

17
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.780
Before we jump in and start fixing our form Let's first look at a simpler example of adding an event

18
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.230
listener with D-3.

19
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.030
Here's how we could add a listener for click events to the H-1 tag.

20
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.990
Now when we click on each one we see a message log to the con..

21
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.850
You can't attach multiple Westerner's of the same type to the same selection using on.

22
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.930
If you try to only the most recent listener will run as it will replace any previously existing listener.

23
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.560
This also means that you can remove the listener by passing and now as the second argument to the method.

24
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.910
So in the console we can remove the event message.

25
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.720
We just attached to the H-1 like this.

26
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.360
Now nothing will happen when you click lets get to coding.

27
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.320
I'd like to get the form working in my note app will again need to use the on method but this time we'll

28
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.090
need to listen for submit events.

29
00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.540
The first thing we'll need to do is prevent the default behavior of the form.

30
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.620
Since this is what is causing the page to reload the javascript we do this by accessing the event object

31
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.360
as the first element in the callback and then calling prevent default on that object.

32
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.860
However event listener callbacks and D-3 have a different structure which will learn more about later.

33
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.500
For now all you need to know is that you can't access the event through any of the callback functions

34
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.680
arguments.

35
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.360
Instead you need a special property attached to D-3 called D-3 data event.

36
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.930
This object will have all of the methods and properties you expect from the event object.

37
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.980
In particular there is a prevent default method that will prevent the default behavior of the form.

38
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.330
So let's throw that in before we do anything else.

39
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.070
Next let's grab the input using D-3 so that we can access the value inside of it.

40
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.640
Now what if we look at the structure of the HMO.

41
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.080
We can see that each note is really just a tag with a class note along with some text.

42
00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.690
So the first thing we need to do is find a new p tag to this list of notes.

43
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.330
We can append a new element to an existing selection using the append method.

44
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.090
This method will append a new element to the selection with whatever tag may be passing.

45
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:17.040
It also returns and the only selection to you with the appendant elements.

46
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:23.090
So in order to add Arnaout we need to append a new tag to the divs containing all of the notes.

47
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.830
Give our new P-TECH class.

48
00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.970
Note and put some text into it.

49
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.250
This code looks OK so let's try adding another.

50
00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.230
Looks like we have a problem.

51
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.690
Our new note doesn't have any text in it.

52
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:39.940
Can you spot the issue.

53
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.750
I'll give you a moment to look through the code.

54
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:51.940
The problem is right here where we're calling input text input elements don't have inner text.

55
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:58.080
Instead the characters the user types are stored in a value property in order to access this data using

56
00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.160
D-3 we need to use the property method and pass in the name of the property we're looking for.

57
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:12.660
In this case of value to refresh the page.

58
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:19.090
Now things look much better one slight annoyance is the fact that once we submit a new note the form

59
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.400
doesn't clear we can fix this problem by using the property method as a setter rather than a getter.

60
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:31.940
After appending the new note in this case we want to set the value property equal to distraint cool.

61
00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.980
This is looking good.

62
00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:39.230
One last thing if you need to remove elements from the down instead of adding them to the DOM 8:3 also

63
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.090
comes with a remove method that you can call in a selection.

64
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:48.560
Let's hop into the console and remove all the notes on the page.

65
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.080
That's it for event listeners.

66
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.660
Now it's time for you to try some of this out on your own.

67
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.880
Check out the exercises when you're ready.

68
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.570
Move on to the next section where you'll begin to talk about data binding using D-3.
