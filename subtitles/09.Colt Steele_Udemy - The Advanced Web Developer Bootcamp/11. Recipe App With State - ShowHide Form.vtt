00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.900
The last video we were able to save a recipe to the state in the recipe app component.

2
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:13.260
Now we want to figure out how to hide and show the form after we've either saved the recipe or if we've

3
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.460
clicked the X button to close the form.

4
00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:25.110
So let's think about this for a sec I'll go back to the finished product.

5
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.690
So here's our solution.

6
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.800
And when I click on new recipe the form shows up if I click on this x the form goes away.

7
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.480
So right away you'll see that we have two different components that care about the same piece of state.

8
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.350
This nav bar component is one of them cooking new recipe makes that form show up.

9
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.490
But then this component is our recipe input and clicking on the X makes that go away.

10
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:51.930
Now let's take a look at the code.

11
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.110
Notice here that the nav bar and the recipe input are siblings and I mentioned earlier two siblings

12
00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.530
can never share state.

13
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.860
So if we put the state in the nav bar we wouldn't have a good way of passing into the recipe input and

14
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:05.980
vice versa.

15
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.430
Whenever you're in the situation when two siblings need to share state the answer is to push the state

16
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.690
up to the parent.

17
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:19.860
So that means this app component the recipe app should own the state and what state should it own.

18
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.620
Well it should just be a boolean to decide whether or not to show the form.

19
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:24.800
So let's set that up.

20
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.160
Now we have a piece of state just to decide whether or not to show the form and we should use that inside

21
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:51.300
of a render method to conditionally show the render input component.

22
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.740
So now if Show form is true we will mount the recipe and put component into the DOM.

23
00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.070
If it is false then we'll just return now which won't render anything.

24
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.990
So when I reload this I should see the form anymore.

25
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.870
And now my form is gone.

26
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.310
Now the next step is to hook it up so that we can actually make the form show up in order to do that

27
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.390
the entire recipe app component needs to pass a callback function to the nav bar component so that when

28
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:31.770
the new recipe link is clicked the state in the recipe app component the higher level one can update.

29
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.190
OK back to the code.

30
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.050
Like I mentioned and we pass a callback function to this nav bar component and it should be a simple

31
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.610
function so I'll just use an inline arrow function.

32
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.030
Let's name the prop.

33
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.830
How about on recipe.

34
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.170
I'll say on new recipe

35
00:02:51.930 --> 00:03:09.020
and that inside of this function I just want to call set state and set show form to true.

36
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.150
Now so far code doesn't do anything because the nav bar doesn't do anything with this on recipe.

37
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.770
On new recipe Propp.

38
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.720
So now we have to change the nav bar.

39
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.380
Let's start by giving it some default props and prop types.

40
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.730
And this one I don't think we've seen before.

41
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.710
It's prop types that phunk F U N C

42
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.320
and they also need to remember to import Propp types.

43
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.020
OK there we go.

44
00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.900
And now the only thing that's left is to invoke that callback when new recipe is clicked.

45
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.170
So I had an on click there

46
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.440
OK let's test this out.

47
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.300
All right my form shows up but now I can't get rid of it.

48
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:28.770
So now let's get this close button working our close button is located in the recipe and put.

49
00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.870
And if you recall we already had close set up in the code that I copied over.

50
00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.020
So let's take a look at that.

51
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:42.950
In this form there's the X button and unclick we call the method called on clothes and unclose is coming

52
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.220
as a prop.

53
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.370
So if we look at the default props at the top here we've already got an enclosed method that does nothing

54
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:58.400
and inside of render we're extracting that on clothes from the stop props from the object.

55
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:04.920
So the only step left now is to give our recipe input component and unclose method.

56
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.140
And I'll add that unclose method inside of here.

57
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:21.000
Let's make this multiple line so it's a little easier to read.

58
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.280
And what do I want to do on close.

59
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:36.600
Well I want to change the state of show form to be false so that we are not seeing the form.

60
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.350
All right now we're passing in unclose method.

61
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:45.170
That's a function which will invoke this sad state and make show form become false.

62
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.800
So let's see that

63
00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:53.340
I'll refresh the page and then open up the recipe form again and try to close it.

64
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.000
And it now works.

65
00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.090
So showing in closing works.

66
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:04.150
The last change we need to make is to get the form to go away when we save a new recipe.

67
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.710
So right now the form sticks around was tried out

68
00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.440
as you can see the form still up there.

69
00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.580
So we want that form to be hidden after we click save.

70
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:18.970
So let's do that as well.

71
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.280
That logic should go into our handle save method.

72
00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.110
So let's go check that out.

73
00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.430
And then inside of here we want to update one more piece of state which is to make show form always

74
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:32.880
false

75
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:43.020
OK let's test that.

76
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.450
All right.

77
00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:44.060
Looks good.

78
00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.170
Our recipe goes away.

79
00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.240
That's all for this one in the next video we'll be able to delete recipes.
