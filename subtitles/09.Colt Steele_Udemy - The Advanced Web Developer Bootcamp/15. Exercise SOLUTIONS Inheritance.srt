Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:07,300
In this video we're going to be going over solutions to the inheritance exercises for this exercise.

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:12,530
We need to pass along the methods and properties from the vehicle constructor to a new constructor function

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,210
called car and a new constructor function called motorcycle.

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,620
First let's make a constructor function for a car inside of here.

6
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:24,470
We don't need to copy and paste all of the code from the vehicle constructor.

7
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:30,650
So let's invoke the vehicle constructor using apply passing in the keyword this as the first argument

8
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,140
in order to inherit the start and two string methods from the vehicle prototype.

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:42,480
We need to set up prototype to be an object created from a vehicle prototype so we'll use object that

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,190
create to do that on the next line.

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,460
We need to make sure that the constructor is reset for the current prototype.

12
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:56,570
So we'll set up prototype that constructor to be the car constructor will do the same thing for our

13
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:00,790
motor cycle function here will also use apply passing in the keyword.

14
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,680
This is the first parameter and arguments as the second will then specify this dot number wheels to

15
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:12,090
be to in order to inherit the two string method from the vehicle that prototype will set.

16
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:19,370
Motorcycle that prototype to be an object created from vehicle that prototype finally will reset the

17
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:26,060
constructor on the motorcycle prototype to be the motor cycle function and that's all for the inheritance

18
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,020
exercises.

19
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:27,940
You in the next video.
