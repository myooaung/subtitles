1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,000
Well come back.

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:03,140
So this video will be very very quick.

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,980
But we just need to hammer out some basic terms that we're going to come back to that we'll refer to

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,860
throughout these next couple of videos and they're really important actually.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,190
Usually terminology stuff maybe is not that exciting or that important but in this case a lot of the

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,740
properties that we'll talk about there very definitions depend on some of these terms.

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,170
OK so there's a couple of things.

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:32,460
First we have a flex container and that refers to whatever item whatever container has the display flex

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,540
property.

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:42,370
So in this case when we assign display flex to our container div it becomes a flex container.

11
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,690
Beforehand is just a container.

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,570
Now it's a flex container.

13
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:51,420
The next bit are the individual boxes or whatever the content is.

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,760
If they are inside of a container with display flex we call them flex items.

15
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:02,560
So they worked they'll actually behave differently than just a traditional item or whatever you have

16
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,940
inside of a device.

17
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:07,690
We've already seen when we did this.

18
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:12,320
Here is how they were behaving before by applying display flex to the container.

19
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:17,480
The children the flex items are behaving very differently.

20
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:22,060
So when we refer to flex item it's just something inside of a flex container.

21
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:22,670
OK.

22
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:27,930
Now the two most important things I should point out all of all three of these are flex items.

23
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:32,050
I just didn't put the text flex item over here because I thought it was confusing.

24
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,480
You might think of us labeling this arrow.

25
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,140
So yes all three of these are flex items.

26
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:41,680
Ok so now onto the two most important bits of jargon.

27
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,630
Main axis and cross axis.

28
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,120
So these two axes are very important.

29
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:51,160
They'll pop up in pretty much at least the next five or six videos possibly every video in this section

30
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:58,540
underlying every move of the content that we make whether we are shifting things to the right or down

31
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,720
or centering them spacing them out.

32
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,550
It happens along one of these axes.

33
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:10,900
So the main axis in this case is not always I don't want to make sure that you understand it's not always

34
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:16,290
from left to right like this but in our case it is in this demonstration where this is our first flex

35
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,840
item or second or third.

36
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,270
They are arranged in a row.

37
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:25,630
The main access by default goes from left to right and then the cross axis is always just the opposite

38
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,140
perpendicular.

39
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:32,550
In our case it moves from top to bottom but that's actually not something you could tell from this diagram.

40
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:39,730
If it wasn't labeled but if I had 10 different flex items on a couple of rows they would float downwards.

41
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,230
So the next row would happen here.

42
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:46,200
The next row would have and below that the cross axis is pointing that way.

43
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:51,970
But as we progressed through the videos we'll see ways of reversing the main axis so that our content

44
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:57,800
starts here and goes that way or by inverting it entirely and making everything into a column so that

45
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:03,340
the main axis is actually going from top to bottom and the cross axis is going from left to right or

46
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,540
from right to left.

47
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,560
So not to overwhelm you with that but just be aware there are these two terms.

48
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,200
May the axis cross axis perpendicular and we're now going to learn a bunch of properties that allow

49
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:20,930
us to manipulate how things work across these axes axes right axes.

50
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:21,630
All right.

51
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,550
Now for that let's get writing some code.
