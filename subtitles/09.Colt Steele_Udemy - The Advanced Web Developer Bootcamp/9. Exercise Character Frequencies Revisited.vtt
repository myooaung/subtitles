Welcome back.

2
00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:08.480
In this video I'd like you to refactor the previous character count app so that the visualization uses

3
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:16.230
SPG along with the three at a minimum you should use recked elements and SVGA to replace the divs we

4
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.750
use for the visualization before.

5
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.790
As a bonus you can also try to add text elements for each rectangle so that a character accompanies

6
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.620
each bar.

7
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.130
Here's a quick demo of what the app looks like using SPG instead of HCM.

8
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:38.750
Here's one phrase and here's another as you can see the functionality is the same as before.

9
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.640
Though the graph and styling look a bit different now that I'm using as Viji remember to focus on the

10
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.240
rectangles first.

11
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:52.130
Adding text to your wrath in this exercise should be considered a bonus.

12
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.070
Good luck.

13
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.470
I'll show you my solution in the next video.
