1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,290
All right let's get down to business.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,960
Let's start animating.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,170
Well actually first we're not going animate.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,210
First we're going to talk about some ways that we can trigger our animations which is equally important

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,070
at least in the early stages.

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,130
We need a way of starting animations.

7
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,210
We need something to cause them.

8
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:23,070
We could I could show you how to animate things just as soon as the page loads have something happen

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:23,820
immediately.

10
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,780
But that's a pretty rare thing.

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:32,730
Usually animations are triggered by a scroll or a click or a hover often.

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,440
So there are you know there's more than that but those are some of the more common things or submitting

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,930
a form hitting the enter key instead of an input.

14
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:45,990
Those sort of things will start by talking about these triggers these state changes in C Ss and then

15
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:50,240
soon we'll see how to connect them if you will to animations.

16
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:50,800
All right.

17
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,430
So the keyword is pseudo classes.

18
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,230
C Ss 3 pseudo classes.

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,390
You may have heard them called pseudo selectors as well on the corresponding MDAC page which I have

20
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,170
opened here.

21
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,350
It's also in the resources for this lecture.

22
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:11,580
There is a pseudo class page essentially pseudo classes are special selectors that you add on actually

23
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:17,640
to another schlechter that I'll just read that specifies a special State of the selected elements so

24
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,460
they're relatively new in the grand scheme of success.

25
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:21,750
They haven't been around that long.

26
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,070
They always start with a colon.

27
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:29,970
You can see here selector colon pseudo class and they allow you to select things based off of particular

28
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:30,740
States.

29
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,570
So in our case we're going to care about three for now hover focused and active.

30
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,630
So we'll go into each one of those shortly.

31
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,160
But there are a bunch of other ones.

32
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,420
And I just want to be clear not all of these are used to trigger things like animations.

33
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,950
This is not a particularly cohesive group of pseudo classes.

34
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,770
They vary a lot.

35
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,620
They range in what they do what they select not all of them have to do with you know something the user

36
00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:01,360
does like hovering or clicking on a button like the ones will focus on some of them are very very different.

37
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,570
So if you are not familiar with some of these if you took my last course that talks a lot about and

38
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:12,480
child and of type those didn't have anything to do with animation really although it could but traditionally

39
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,150
they don't.

40
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:13,630
OK.

41
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,920
So let's kick it off by talking about hover.
