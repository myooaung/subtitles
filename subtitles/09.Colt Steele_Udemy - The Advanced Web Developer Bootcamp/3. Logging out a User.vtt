00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.860
Before move on to our message list I actually want to add that functionality for logging out so we can

2
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.680
see some changes between pages.

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.400
So instead of our nav bar we're going to change up things inside of the nav bar.

4
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.740
We brought in the current user a little while back from relax so that we could display different links

5
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.430
depending on if they're signed up or not.

6
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.680
So what we'll do inside of this nav bar is render everything like we were before except we're going

7
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:31.110
to add a little bit of conditional logic to say after this div if this is that Propst our current user

8
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.810
that is authenticated if this user has logged in.

9
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:41.690
Then what's gonna turn a bunch of each TNL what are we going to return here.

10
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.390
Well for the class of nav bar nav

11
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:55.690
and nav bar right and inside of the nav bar and inside of the stand up are now.

12
00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:05.020
And inside of this list I will make another click and this link is going to go to the route to create

13
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.990
a new message for that user.

14
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.990
We don't have this one yet but let's set up some boilerplate like we did before.

15
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.340
Slash users slash whatever.

16
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:21.490
That props does current user data user doc ID every single user we have here is going to refer to that

17
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:22.360
user object.

18
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:30.070
So lets grab the ID for that user and I'll go to slash messages slash new inside of your will eventually

19
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.510
make this a link to display a form to create a new message.

20
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.130
I will do that a little bit later.

21
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.490
Let's make sure that this closes the text of new message for that like

22
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.870
someone I'm going to worry too much about when this route is going to go.

23
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.140
This is really just for visual display right now.

24
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.020
But we're going to be another lie and this is where we can add some functionality right away here.

25
00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.230
We'll have another link.

26
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.920
And let's just make an anchor tag because we don't need re-act router to handle this.

27
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.850
So we're going to add an on click and you're going to call this dot log out

28
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.460
and log out it is a very simple function.

29
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.650
It's going to log the user but how do we implement this in a single page application.

30
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.130
When we log in we place a token in local storage so logging out is going to be the idea of removing

31
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.430
that token from local storage.

32
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.580
So yes let's make sure that we add a little bit of functionality for dispatching an action of logging

33
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:36.310
up so what we're going to do here is write a function called blog and the first thing we're going to

34
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.540
do is make sure that inside of here we can dispatch some other action.

35
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.650
So we're going to use that thunk as well.

36
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:50.220
And inside of this funk we're going to first clear local storage.

37
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:59.010
We're then going to dispatch our set current user function to be an empty object.

38
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.570
So the idea of not simply calling that current user but with an empty object instead of a populated

39
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:04.920
object.

40
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.900
So inside of our nav bar we want to start using this log function that we need.

41
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:17.100
So let's import log out from that last store slash actions slash off and inside of here we're simply

42
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.880
going to place a function called Laaga.

43
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.300
We'll use that new syntax so we get the rate that you are the key word this we're going to prevent the

44
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.900
default action and I will call this up prop's doggo.

45
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.170
So where did this that Propst that log out come from.

46
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.090
Well we have to pass it in in MAP dispatched prop's.

47
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.760
So let's go make sure we get a log out there and we'll see if we can log out the user.

48
00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.530
Let's see if this was me sure that our syntax is correct.

49
00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.580
Well we need the other part of the turn there.

50
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.550
So let's make sure that we close in our turn every operator.

51
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.200
The rest of that code has a section on the user's authenticated.

52
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.340
So we have another syntax error here instead of our template story.

53
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.250
So let's make sure that our template string is correct.

54
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.780
So we want to make sure that this template string is inside those curly braces and the inner curly brace

55
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.110
closes where I want to evaluate a variable that looks a lot better.

56
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.340
It's good to look at this with sign up Sovietism similar information here.

57
00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:26.240
Put in a password and username and it looks like we made it and now we see a new message and log out.

58
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:33.860
So it was a little bit more let's click log out and now we're back to this original page and how do

59
00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.260
we know if we did this correctly.

60
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.980
Let's go take a look at local storage and we see that there's no token in there right now.

61
00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.350
Let's go log in again and see what the token looks like now in local storage.

62
00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.400
So if you look at local storage we now have that token and that looks good.

63
00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.140
So it looks like we're logging in and logging out successfully.

64
00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.980
We'll fix these lost items is probably just an issue with some HD.

65
00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.080
Right now our goal is to take all the messages we have in our database and display them right where

66
00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.350
it says you meet him and we'll do that next.
