1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:07,050
OK so we have two out of four down the next two properties are transition delay and transition timing

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:07,820
function.

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,680
So we're going to start off with delay.

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:16,620
It's pretty simple all that it does is it allows us to specify how long of a pause there should be before

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,680
the transition actually begins.

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:24,000
And there are two versions we can use we can pass in a single time like four seconds.

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:29,220
And this would say okay this transition wait for seconds until it begins.

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,960
As soon as it's triggered pause for four seconds.

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,980
Horrible experience for the most part as a user.

10
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:40,650
But you know you can work with milliseconds sometimes using delays if you want to transition to happen

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:46,050
but you want one to happen immediately and then another one when that one completes or when that finishes.

12
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:51,060
And the way you could do that is with this second version down here where you pass in comma separated

13
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:51,780
values.

14
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:58,200
So just like we did with transition property where we had color and opacity and then two different times

15
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,220
or durations that correspond to the properties.

16
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,930
You can do the same thing with transition delay.

17
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:09,690
So this one would apply to whatever the first property we're transitioning is and this would apply to

18
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,650
the second and so on if we have more than two.

19
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,560
So let's go to code Penn and play around.

20
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:15,810
All right.

21
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,140
So we have these two boring and animated boxes.

22
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,270
And right now there's no delay on animated.

23
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:29,310
So it's as simple as saying transition delay and let's do something like two seconds to make it really

24
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,740
clear.

25
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:38,300
So this is unchanged of course but this one that has the animated class I hover and then the transition

26
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:38,780
kicks in.

27
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,200
Two seconds later.

28
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,800
Now remember we're not transitioning the scale that's happening here.

29
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:50,630
So it does immediately double in size but the transition doesn't kick in for two seconds which is for

30
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:51,440
border radius.

31
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,450
And then also for background color.

32
00:01:53,810 --> 00:02:00,060
And then if we wanted to we could do something like this transition delay will be one second for our

33
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:08,180
background Khama to 0.5 milliseconds for border radius.

34
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,400
So let me actually make this even clearer.

35
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,020
Let's do two seconds.

36
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:17,630
So what this is saying is that OK the background transition should take five seconds but don't start

37
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:23,570
it until two seconds after it's been triggered and the border radius should take one second to complete.

38
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:29,580
But wait half a second you know point five milliseconds isn't going to get us very far.

39
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:32,100
We won't notice that insanely fast.

40
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,750
I meant to do point five seconds.

41
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,600
So let's try that again.

42
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,700
You can see it weights half a second.

43
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,340
Then the border radius kicks in.

44
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,660
But the background transition doesn't kick in for a while.

45
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:49,400
And let me speed this up so that background takes one second and border radius take one second so that

46
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:55,760
it's a little clearer and let's say the transition delay is five seconds for background and two seconds

47
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:56,930
for border radius.

48
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:03,530
So now there should be a two second pause before it turns into a circle and then adds that finishes

49
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,890
there should be a short pause and then the rest of the background should transition.

50
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:09,270
All right.

51
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:14,450
So that's all there is to using transition delay as you can see the order does matter if you're going

52
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:18,390
to assign multiple transitions that have differing values.

53
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:18,710
OK.

54
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:24,500
So that brings us to our next and final property here for transitions at least which is the transition

55
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,580
timing function.

56
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:30,530
So I did save this one for last on purpose now because it's particularly tough or challenging to get

57
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:34,850
it's just harder to notice the changes that it makes sometimes.

58
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:39,050
Essentially what it controls is the acceleration of our animation.

59
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:42,230
So we could have 10 different animations that take 10 seconds.

60
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:47,950
Let's say we're animating background color we could have 10 different things that are the exact same

61
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,830
colors from red to purple let's say over 10 seconds.

62
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,700
But in those 10 seconds there are so many different ways that the animation could proceed.

63
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:01,120
It could start off really quickly and then slow down for the last second or it could take ten seconds

64
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,720
and basically go at the same speed the entire time.

65
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,470
And there are more complex curves that we can define.

66
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,670
You can see down here as well where we can actually specify different values along a curve for it to

67
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,740
follow.

68
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,430
So this can be a little bit difficult to wrap your head around.

69
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,770
There is pretty cool.

70
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:26,140
Easing functions that I found at easing dot net and what this does it shows you some really common shapes

71
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:29,780
or curves that you can use for your easing functions.

72
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,250
So here's an example if you hover over one of them is in sign.

73
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,120
Notice that little red may zoom in a bit.

74
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,080
The red flag on the right side.

75
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,790
That's the thing that's being transitioned or animated.

76
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,470
And watch it.

77
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,430
It doesn't go at a constant speed.

78
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,630
It starts off slow and then it speeds up a bit towards the end or for you to a more drastic one.

79
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:58,450
How about is this to ease out and back this one so what this does if I can get it to trigger.

80
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,350
There you go.

81
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:05,830
Is it basically goes very pretty quickly at the beginning and slows down and it goes a little bit too

82
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,940
far actually and then comes back to our End Point.

83
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,950
So watch that again.

84
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:13,260
And let's see.

85
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:17,200
Let's do one more about is in out Sercq.

86
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,270
So what's happening here.

87
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:26,440
Start slow and it speeds up and then it ends slow I don't know if you can pick that up on the video.

88
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:32,210
One thing of note this section down here is actually reserved for things that you can't do with just

89
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:38,180
c s s so things with these more complex curves like these bounces these are actually accomplished with

90
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,910
javascript plus VSS.

91
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:44,480
Or you can do them when we talk about keyframes in just the next section coming up.

92
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,390
But with transitions on their own you're limited to these types of curves.

93
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:49,050
OK.

94
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:52,580
So it's kind of hard when we just talk about it without actually seeing example.

95
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:56,960
I like the examples on the transition timing function page on D-N.

96
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:06,260
So I'll scroll down and you can see if it loads under examples there are that six eight different red

97
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:11,860
squares that are all identical but they have different timing functions but they're doing the same thing.

98
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:19,280
So they go from a Red Square to a smaller blue square that's also moving it's being transformed or translated

99
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,270
across the page.

100
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:24,980
But notice that even though they start at the same place they end at the same place they take a very

101
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,760
different journey to get there.

102
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,490
The acceleration is different.

103
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:34,370
So these are transition timing functions that are controlling that and they're really important towards

104
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:40,540
making your animations feel natural making them feel sort of like they're alive sometimes.

105
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,870
So let's let's play around.

106
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:47,480
We're not going to do anything crazy but let's go to our transition playground and I'm actually going

107
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,210
to undo all this commented out.

108
00:06:50,210 --> 00:07:02,050
For now of this code and what we're going to do instead is say the animated box let's do all boxes when

109
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,030
they hover when we hover.

110
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:08,790
Do a translate X let's do 300 pixels.

111
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,960
So we'll have it move across the screen.

112
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,800
There we go.

113
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:12,830
Perfect.

114
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:22,780
Now we're going to do is add a transition to the animated box animated class so that animated will just

115
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:29,390
do transition property which is going to be transformed.

116
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,850
Let's do a duration.

117
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:40,420
Let's have it take two seconds so we can see these changes happen and then we'll add in.

118
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,810
We don't need a delay that's fine.

119
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:49,540
Well the transition timing function and we'll start with linear which is one of the the values that

120
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,910
we get by default.

121
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,740
And you can actually see those values here.

122
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:59,820
So we have ease ease and ease out ease it out linear steps start and step and are the predefined ones.

123
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:02,610
But then we can also define our own function.

124
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:09,190
If you are familiar with cubic bezier as the air curves never know how to pronounce that you can define

125
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:09,970
your own.

126
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,580
And there's also a tool that I'll show you.

127
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:15,620
But realistically most of the time I'm just using is in easy out.

128
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,940
Those are kind of the most common ones and there their defaults for a reason.

129
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,550
OK so if we go back we just have it as linear as I hover.

130
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,180
You'll see it goes from point A to point B over here in a linear speed.

131
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:33,180
Takes two seconds and it goes the exact same speed the entire time.

132
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:37,070
But I can change that to something like is in.

133
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:44,460
And if we look at the graph for that let's go to this page this is another tool I'll go to ease and

134
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,300
this is called Sezer.

135
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,240
SS easing animation tool.

136
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,770
It's in the Resources page.

137
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:53,240
This is what the graph for the curve for is and looks like.

138
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:58,620
So as it is is it go slower and then it picks up speed towards the end.

139
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,000
So let's try it out.

140
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:05,510
We have easy to find it go slow and then it speeds up towards the end.

141
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,750
Hopefully you can see that change happening.

142
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,410
It takes a little bit and then it gets going.

143
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,990
So we can do the same thing but change it to ease out which works the opposite way.

144
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:21,500
So goes quickly and then slows down sort of like I don't know if you know baseball you're running towards

145
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,100
a base.

146
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:26,070
You go quickly and then you start to slow down as you get there.

147
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,940
Maybe that's a terrible analogy.

148
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,860
Sometimes people speed up and slide.

149
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:37,100
But whatever the point is that in this case the acceleration is greater at the beginning the speed is

150
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,900
greater at the beginning and then it slows down as it gets closer.

151
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,600
So it makes a big difference if we get rid of that line.

152
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:50,010
Rather than just going at a constant speed so you can play around some of the other ones let's do is

153
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:54,700
in dash out and if you take a look at what that one looks like.

154
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:02,380
Kind of eases and go slow at the beginning and then speeds up and then go slower at the end as well.

155
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,680
So let's take a look.

156
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:04,460
Quicker.

157
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,600
Slow down.

158
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,350
So one more time.

159
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:16,260
He goes slow and then quick and then slow hopefully you can see that it might be a bit hard over the

160
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:21,480
video frame rate the screen casting software captures that well.

161
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:27,780
The last thing that I'll say is that you can capture your own so you can do things like define your

162
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,930
own equation.

163
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,950
Let's say that you like this is Outback.

164
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:37,980
So it goes past and then comes back you can click on it on this Web site and it actually will give you

165
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:45,270
the cubic bezier curve that you want so you can copy that over and I can just replace this is in out

166
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,710
with that curve.

167
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,760
So now as I do this and see what happens.

168
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,930
There you go.

169
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,930
You can see that hover.

170
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,280
It goes a bit too far and then comes back.

171
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:02,080
So this definitely isn't a math course but if you're curious and you want to define some of your own

172
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,630
timing functions this tool is really fun and useful.

173
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:12,520
What you can do is find something that you like say you like this and then you can tweak it so totally

174
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,640
change it to something like this.

175
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,860
Let's have it go really really quickly.

176
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,530
At the beginning and then slow down towards the end.

177
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,680
Every go so we could do this.

178
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:33,160
And if you wanted to actually grab the code to do that down here you can copy this transition timing

179
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:33,820
function.

180
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:41,530
Copy that and bring it over and paste that in hopefully you can see that.

181
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,410
So it's going very quick and then slowing down.

182
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,510
So it's like an exaggerated version of E's out.

183
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,440
OK so the last thing that you should know.

184
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,160
Just like with these other properties.

185
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,410
Transition delay transition duration and property.

186
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:01,090
You can have multiple timing functions assigned and the order matters of course just like the other

187
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:01,740
three.

188
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:07,090
So if we added in transition timing function whatever came first let's say ease in would correspond

189
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:11,640
to these values and whatever came second would correspond to these values.

190
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:16,570
And you are not limited to two however many values you have you just need commas to separate them.

191
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,980
But I'll stick to this for now.

192
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,210
Hopefully you get the idea.

193
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:24,160
And that wraps up the key for properties that have to do with transitions.

194
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:30,780
So we had transition property transition duration transition timing function and transition delay.

195
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:36,010
So in the following video you actually see a way of combining all four properties into a single line

196
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:41,770
a single shorthand property that can make your life a lot easier and makes my life easier a lot less

197
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:42,720
typing.

198
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,470
So I'll see you there.
