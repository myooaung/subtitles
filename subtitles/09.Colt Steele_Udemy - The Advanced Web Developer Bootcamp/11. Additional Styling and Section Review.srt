1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,550
It with a couple of small c s s fixes to make.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,790
So if it were to refresh this page you would see that this log out and new message don't really look

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,760
as good as the sign up and log in.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,830
So if we were to take a look at what's going on here probably has something to do you know an app.

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:17,710
Yes.

6
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:20,310
I just make sure that the HD is the same and there we go.

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,180
It's not.

8
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,000
I just added an extra dash which is not a valid bootstrap class.

9
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,910
That will fix most of our issues.

10
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,220
Let's go take a look at this image timeline.

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,650
And as for this image timeline here we're going to read a little bit of our own s s.

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,050
Let's go back to our index that's the SS and target the classic timeline image will give us a border

13
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,620
radius of 50 pixels get a nice circular image.

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,780
We'll make sure that we have some height on this image that he thinks to be 40 pixels and that 40 pixels

15
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:56,640
who also had a with 40 pixels a little bit of margin so add two pixels 3D pixels 10 and 10.

16
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,930
That should give us a little breathing room will also make sure that all of our buttons when we hover

17
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:09,850
over them have a cursor pointer and for any of our buttons that are anchor tags that have a class of

18
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:14,670
PTEN danger and undercover States as well.

19
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,850
We want to make sure that these all have a color away.

20
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,230
It's going to be a bit easier and cleaner to see the.

21
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:22,940
So take a look.

22
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,210
And that looks much better right away.

23
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:32,740
So you can go to any message that says delete me the message.

24
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,990
You can see that delete button looks a lot cleaner.

25
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,920
Let's also move the logo to the center so to the class of Napp are Hetter going to be sure and targeting

26
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,700
that anywhere else.

27
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,180
So we don't duplicate that rule.

28
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,990
So at a margin of 0 1 and just essential that and that looks good right over there in the middle.

29
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,220
You can now log out.

30
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:55,010
We can sign up that whatever functionality we want here.

31
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,710
E-mails this is still valid.

32
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,640
We don't have a photo here and that's OK.

33
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,200
Maybe I'm a server will want to validate e-mail address and so on.

34
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:08,890
But that's a lot of additional functionality that you can make a new message.

35
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:12,150
That's as awesome an average to leave a message.

36
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,350
Looks like that's working.

37
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,400
Let's also find a valid image that when you sign up we make sure that that's working.

38
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,980
So we'll put in some dummy information right here.

39
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:22,680
And here let's go.

40
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:32,680
Gotta admit you are out of HTP colon slash slash Lauren Fix all dot com slash 200 slash 200 and let's

41
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,360
give that a second.

42
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,070
Lauren pixel sometimes takes a little bit of a while.

43
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,350
So let's go make a new message.

44
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,540
Hello.

45
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,680
Well that I'll give that a second.

46
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,840
And there we go.

47
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,100
Nice picture of a dog.

48
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:51,830
So are images working need to leave functionally working and functionality all backed by a mongo database.

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,060
With persistence done all on the front and back and using redux or hydrating we're doing all sorts of

50
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,790
really nice things in this application to make it work.

51
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,520
So we'll talk about in and off with is adding a little bit more functionality and deploying this to

52
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:05,900
rogue.
