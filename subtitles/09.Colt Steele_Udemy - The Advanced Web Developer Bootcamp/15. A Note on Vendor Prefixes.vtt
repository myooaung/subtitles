00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.130
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:06.960
So I'm here with a quick video just going over a commonly asked question which is what about browser

3
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.850
prefixes or vendor prefixes and the code that I've been writing things like this line right here.

4
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.560
You may or may not know depending on your own experience that there are vendor prefixes that we need

5
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.380
to add in order to make sure that this is working across as many browsers as possible.

6
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.150
So if you're not sure what vendor prefixes are MDA and has a pretty good article on it.

7
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.060
Zoom in a bit.

8
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.140
The main idea is that there's all these different browsers.

9
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:40.590
There's chrome Safari Opera Internet Explorer edge all these Firefox and a whole bunch of other ones

10
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.640
that are much smaller.

11
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:49.830
And as these new experimental or nonstandard properties and CSSA are created not all browsers implement

12
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.530
them at the exact same time or in the exact same way.

13
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.960
So the workaround is that there are specific browser prefixes you put in front of a property so things

14
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.720
like Dasch Web Kit dash and you would put that in front of a property like transition.

15
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.360
Now the reason that I'm not including them here and I'm not typing them myself in this section is that

16
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.480
they kind of clutter things up.

17
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.950
Here's an example.

18
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.580
Here's three she says properties that we've we've already seen.

19
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.010
We're applying them basically rotating something and changing the transform origin.

20
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.420
Well if we use the proper C Ss prefixes or vendor prefixes it looks like this.

21
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.060
Which is a lot longer.

22
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.750
Not only is it longer it's a huge pain to type in and typing them from scratch or by hand and pretty

23
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.270
much always get it wrong and not to mention the fact they change so certain things that require a vendor

24
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.750
prefix to work in a browser.

25
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.090
Today in a couple of weeks months years probably will not.

26
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.390
So there's no reason to type them yourself.

27
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.920
And certainly for me there's no reason to commit them to video because they do change.

28
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.420
And it's it's probably the biggest pain point of these video courses is updating things as they change.

29
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:05.280
So rather than doing that use a prefix or so there are a couple of different ways of doing this.

30
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.630
There are browser based prefigures which I'm going to show you now.

31
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.750
And there's also command line tools or text editor tools in Adam or subline text or whatever editor

32
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:15.900
that you prefer.

33
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.240
But I'm going to show these browser tools.

34
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.440
So here's an example.

35
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.380
This one is auto prefix or does it have that IO it's auto prefix or C S.

36
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.670
I mean if you just Google CSSA prefix or there's a bunch that pop up.

37
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.540
So in the left you just paste your C S S code and then on the right it will do two things.

38
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.800
It will add any necessary browser prefixes but it will also remove any unnecessary once things that

39
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.860
P.B. were previously necessary.

40
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:50.120
So if we take this single little line here when we hover over a paragraph translate it 20 pixels and

41
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.260
20 by 20 which is what's happening here at.

42
00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:03.760
So if we copy that go to our auto prefix or paste this in you can see that it now gives us three different

43
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.040
lines that accomplish the same thing.

44
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.080
But one is with the Web Kit vendor prefix and another is with M-S and you get if you want to learn more

45
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.780
about those men and as they change come and go you can learn a lot more about them if you're not familiar

46
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:17.320
with them.

47
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.900
But my preferred approach is just to use an auto pretty fixer.

48
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.680
And I have another one up called use with three E's if you want to try it out.

49
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.440
This is actually also if you click on it it's a node based tool you can use the command line if you

50
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.640
prefer that.

51
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:34.090
All right.

52
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.360
So that wraps up the quick video on vendor prefixes.

53
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.610
I just wanted to make it clear that yes they are things still you should be aware of them even though

54
00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.690
I'm not going through and writing them for every line of code because I don't want to bore you.

55
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:47.700
Takes a long time.

56
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.760
I don't want to clutter the demo code I want to keep it simple and focused on the things that matter

57
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.910
and also things change.

58
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.490
And I don't want this to go out of date as quickly as the vendor prefixes do.

59
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.810
So hopefully that's a quick explanation if you want more information again read some of the included

60
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:02.830
resources.

61
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:03.290
All right.

62
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.570
Moving on to more fun things.
