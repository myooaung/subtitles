00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.130
In this video we'll be introducing two new vs 20:17 string methods.

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.310
The first is PAD's start which allows us to pad or place a certain character a number of times before

3
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:12.810
the start of a string.

4
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.620
The first parameter is the total length of the new string and the second is what the pad from the start.

5
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.100
This is quite useful when you need to have strings that are all the same length but your input might

6
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.220
not always have that.

7
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.680
So maybe you want to pad some input with zeros or some other operator.

8
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.250
The second method is pad and which allows us to pad or place a certain character a number of times.

9
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.390
At the end of the string the first parameter is the total length of the new string and the second is

10
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.630
what to pad with from the end.

11
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.980
So you might be thinking when would you actually use something like pad and or pad start while you might

12
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.690
not use it in everyday coding.

13
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.930
It can be useful to make sure that strings are always a certain length even if they need to be padded.

14
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.460
In fact there was an incident not long ago where many essential libraries including no J us depended

15
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.310
on an external function for padding strings.

16
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.590
The owner of the external function removed it from a public registry and instantly broke thousands of

17
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.810
applications.

18
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.950
So even if you don't use this function too much just know it has some important use cases for libraries

19
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.670
and frameworks that you'll be using if you want to learn more about this fiasco.

20
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.520
You can read about it in the section that's in the next video.

21
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.590
We'll talk about one of the larger features and yes 20:17 easing functions.

22
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.050
See that.
