1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,670
Okay the next property we're taking a look at it's called order and order is another one of those that

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:11,340
applies to the individual items in a flex container rather than to the flex container or to the parent

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:12,630
on the whole.

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:19,380
So instead it applies to items and what it allows us to do is we can specify in order for how things

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:25,670
should be displayed inside a flex container so we can write them one way in the time out in the markup

6
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,130
and without changing that at all.

7
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,850
WE CAN YOU SEE assess and reorder them so that the user will see them in a different order.

8
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,040
And that's particularly useful when you're working with responsive layouts.

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:42,860
You might want things to be in one order in a wide layout and then you might switch them up.

10
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,330
When you go to a mobile lab for example.

11
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:50,430
So the way that it works it's kind of unintuitive at first.

12
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:58,410
So if we tried to say Box 1 and in reset order to be two you might expect that box one would just move

13
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,640
to position two.

14
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,470
But what actually happens is it goes to the very end.

15
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,320
Well that's kind of weird.

16
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,810
What's happening is that by default everything has an order of zero.

17
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:16,620
So when we set something to have order of two we're not specifying position two.

18
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,520
We're saying that everything has an order of zero by default.

19
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,510
But this one other item has an order of two.

20
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,690
Well two should go at the end then because that's the greatest number.

21
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,810
But we can take advantage of the fact that all items by default have order of zero by using negative

22
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:34,490
numbers.

23
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:40,540
So if I set box three to have order if negative when it comes to the beginning.

24
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:48,310
So if I actually wanted to do something like make Box 1 the second box in line like we have here so

25
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,130
goes to 1 3 4.

26
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,790
It's a little more involved.

27
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:59,640
I need to specify box one has an order of 2 box to has an order of 1 and box 3 and 4 have an order of

28
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,410
three and we could do other numbers to be clear.

29
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:10,440
It doesn't matter 1 2 and 3 as long as they come in the correct order from lowest to greatest I could

30
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,340
use negative numbers.

31
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,170
I could use 110 111 112.

32
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,140
It doesn't matter.

33
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,410
What's more important.

34
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,450
The only thing that matters is how they relate to one another.

35
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,500
So you wouldn't typically have something like this where you're giving every single thing in order.

36
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,460
Usually when you're reordering content you know if you wanted to do something like that you just have

37
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,820
to think swap.

38
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:35,790
You would probably just do that in your markup where it's more common as if you have something at the

39
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:40,470
end you want to move it to the beginning or you have two things that you want to come after another

40
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,260
two in the case of a mobile lay out.

41
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,220
Imagine if this is collapsing.

42
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,150
Well I guess I could do that.

43
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,820
You won't really see what I'm talking about but imagine that that's happening and we want these four

44
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,560
and the two to go off on their own and disappear or go to a second line.

45
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,820
Maybe these are advertisements and this is our main content in the middle.

46
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,550
I could use order to facilitate that.

47
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,930
So that's a more typical use case.

48
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,470
Let's play around with it briefly.

49
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,700
So we have our container and our flex items.

50
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,340
We have nine of them let's say lucky number seven.

51
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:24,150
So again if I go to box 7 and I just say Order eight just put to that yet because Box number 7 has an

52
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:24,720
order of 8.

53
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,360
Everything else has a order of zero.

54
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,880
So goes the end.

55
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:36,900
But then if I come and do Box 1 and I say that has an order of seven.

56
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,820
It almost moves the end but not quite.

57
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,150
Because box 7 has an order of eight.

58
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,740
So these all have order of zero.

59
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,050
And then this has seven.

60
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:51,730
And then it says eight and I was kind of confusing when there's also numbers on these boxes but that's

61
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,410
how it works.

62
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:57,190
And let's say I wanted to have box 9 go to the very beginning which is the easiest way to do that.

63
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,980
Give it a negative one or negative anything.

64
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:08,430
So let's do that box 9 order negative 9 never go and I could change it to negative 100.

65
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,700
Same thing.

66
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:16,810
But as soon as I give it a positive number it goes back to where it was because all of these have zeros

67
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,430
and if I gave it 10 it would go to the very end or 100.

68
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,140
OK.

69
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,820
So I think you get that by now.

70
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,840
By default the order is zero.

71
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:31,000
And most of the time when we're working with orders I usually keep things that order zero.

72
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,800
And then the thing is I'm manipulating.

73
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,810
I move them to the end or the beginning using negative one or one.

74
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:43,530
Let me also add that if I change our flex direction to ro reverse we go from nine to one.

75
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,400
In this case visually that's what happens.

76
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,780
But remember it's just our main access goes from right to left.

77
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:58,270
So if I want to reorder something I go box nine and I say Order is negative to it hops to the beginning

78
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,400
even though it's moving to the right.

79
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,810
This is where the main axis starts and it goes that way.

80
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:07,190
Sometimes students do get confused about that because they're just used to things going from left to

81
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:07,570
right.

82
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:12,550
But we're changing the main axis direction and that's what indicates or determines the order.

83
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:15,200
OK let's go back to our regular room.

84
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,280
And that's it.
