00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,320
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:06,250
In this video we'll be talking about the fourth rule for determining the value of the key word this

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:11,200
and will recap all four rules to help you wrap your mind around the tricky topic.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,620
The fourth rule for determining the value of the key word this is when you see the new keyword.

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:21,660
The new keyword is a reserve key word which does quite a few things we'll be covering the New keyword

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,220
in more depth in the object oriented section.

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,060
For now just know that when the new key word is used a new object is created.

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,550
The new keyword is used with the function and inside of the function definition.

9
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,660
The keyword this will refer to the new object that is created.

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:44,340
Finally when the new keyword is used an implicit return this is added to the function which uses it.

11
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,180
That sounds like a lot but will cover it in great detail in the object oriented programming section.

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,990
For now let's take a look at this code example.

13
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,840
We have a function called person which takes in two parameters.

14
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,610
First name and last name inside of the function we are attaching properties on the keyword.

15
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:03,070
This equal to the values passed to the function.

16
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,980
You may be thinking hold on a second.

17
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:05,960
The value of the keyword.

18
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,620
This is the global object.

19
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,560
We saw that in a previous video and in fact you would be absolutely right.

20
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,920
However the value of the keyword this changes when we use the new keyword.

21
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,540
Like we said before the keyword this now refers to an object that is created when the new keyword is

22
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,200
used.

23
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:27,660
We are storing that object in a variable called L-E and can then access the first name and last name

24
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,280
properties on it.

25
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,680
To recap we covered quite a lot in the section we examined the keyword this which is a reserve key word

26
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,610
in javascript whose value is determined at execution.

27
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,550
We saw the four rules for determining the value of the keyword.

28
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:49,620
This global implicit or object binding explicit and the new keyword when set in the global context in

29
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,550
a function.

30
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:55,280
The keyword this is either the Global Object window in the browser or undefined.

31
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:01,020
If we're using strict mode when the keyword this is inside of a declared object its value will be the

32
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,160
closest parent object.

33
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,580
When we lose the context of the keyword this we want we can explicitly set the value of the keyword.

34
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,640
This Using call apply or bind.

35
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:17,220
Finally when the new keyword is used the value of the keyword this is set to be an empty object and

36
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,340
returned from the function that is invoked with the new keyword.

37
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,870
Once again we'll covered this quite a bit more in the object oriented section.

38
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:29,160
Congratulations you made it through the series on a keyword this yourself on the back.

39
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,620
This is some tough material.

40
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,800
If you're still confused try to walk through some of the code examples.

41
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,490
Be sure to ask us any questions.

42
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,130
We're always happy to help out.

43
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,950
Thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next section.
