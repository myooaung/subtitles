00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:05,210
In the last video we looked at re-act router setup and some basic functionality.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,800
Now we'll talk about a few more advanced features.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:19,000
So objectives will be to use the L parameters for out defined route props defined with router and last

4
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:24,820
passing your own props to a component in a route component and this will be the difference between using

5
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:33,050
render inside that raw component or using the component prop Inside the Raw component.

6
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,160
First up your L parameters.

7
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:40,820
So just like on the back end if we have some parameter that we care about within the drill we can add

8
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,510
a colon and then premiÃ¨re name here.

9
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:49,820
So in this case call in name and then if we want to render whatever's in that route or use whatever's

10
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:58,190
in that route we can use Match.com up harams so matched up harams that name is the string that matches

11
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,730
from this route.

12
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:05,960
So if I had a path like Slash Tim this component would say Hello Tim.

13
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,550
What does this match pro-ams Where does it come from.

14
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,880
Well those are route props.

15
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:16,460
Any component that is rendered from within a route component gets three props.

16
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:22,210
The first which we just saw is called match and that's info about how the path inside the route matched

17
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,460
the current Eurail.

18
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:30,180
The next one is the location and that's information about where you are now similar to a window location.

19
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:35,320
And the final one is history which is similar to the HCM L5 history object.

20
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:40,150
It allows you to do things like go back and change the oil.

21
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:45,790
All three of these props can be pretty useful at times but they're only available when that component

22
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,870
is rendered from within a route component.

23
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,820
But there's times when you want those three props outside of or out component.

24
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,310
And that's what with routers for.

25
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:01,360
So if your component is not rendered from within a route component you can wrap it you know with router

26
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,620
function and then you will receive those three props.

27
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:10,820
So here's an example of a component that wants to use the history prop.

28
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:15,800
Now history is normally a prop that gets passed in if you're inside of a route component.

29
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,340
But in this case this button code is not inside of a route component.

30
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:27,470
So we want history because when you click on that go home we want to change the oil to slash.

31
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,010
That's what this push does here.

32
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:36,180
In order for this history prop to be defined we need to wrap this switch demo in a with router function

33
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:45,090
with router will return a new component that gets all three of these props history match and location.

34
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:49,680
Another problem that you run into is that when you use a route component the component that you end

35
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,250
up rendering you want to pass additional props too.

36
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:55,270
But the component property won't allow you to do that.

37
00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:01,590
So in order to solve this problem or use render instead of component and as a word of warning down here

38
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,970
the route component can either use render or a component you should not be using both.

39
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,980
Let's look at example.

40
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:16,980
So in this example we've got a component called teachers and it expects a teacher's prop which is an

41
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,480
array of teacher names.

42
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:21,660
Here it's just going to be Tim man Ellie.

43
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:27,290
So it's going to loop over that teacher's array and it's going to just display each teacher an ally.

44
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:33,000
Now inside of our main app we want to use that teacher's component but we also want to pass that teachers

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,700
prop in.

46
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:41,940
So in order to get that to work we'll use render rather than component render essentially takes a stateless

47
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,360
functional component.

48
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:47,970
The first parameter is prop's the props that we're going to get and those props are the props that you

49
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:53,800
get inside of her out component like match location and history.

50
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:59,950
Now when we render that component we want to spread out our props so that this teachers component will

51
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:05,950
get matched location history and then we'll also want to provide our additional props in this case the

52
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:13,140
teacher's array is equal to that teachers are we created up here now in this renders the teachers component

53
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,410
will get the props that it expects and everything work.

54
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:24,190
The last thing I want to mention is that you should go check out the re-act router docs.

55
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:30,910
So here's the beginning of the Web documentation and there's tons of great examples in here let me make

56
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:31,980
that a little bigger.

57
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,420
There's tons of great examples in here.

58
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,980
So it's definitely worth checking out if you get stuck or if you just want to learn a little bit more

59
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,270
on your own.

60
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:46,330
For example there's information about auth which will cover later animated transitions.

61
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:49,060
So lots of good use cases here.

62
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:54,070
I would definitely use this as a resource because next up we're going to be doing an exercise involving

63
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,910
the re-act router.
