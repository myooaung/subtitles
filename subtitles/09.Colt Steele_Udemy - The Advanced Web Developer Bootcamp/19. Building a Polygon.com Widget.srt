1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:00,770
All right.

2
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:01,790
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:07,790
So in this video I'm really talking about how these properties work together alongside rap flex rap.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:14,360
So Flex meaning flex grow flex shrink and flex basis in combination with flex rap and to do that.

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,500
I didn't want to just hit you with some more slides.

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,310
Instead we're going to build a very simple widget.

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,680
This is a Web site polygon a game site gaming news and reviews.

8
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:30,240
And there's this little banner they have on every review page and you'll notice there's three evenly

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:30,740
spaced.

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:37,080
Or even the size things boxes shrink they shrink together they grow together.

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:44,460
But there's this cool behavior when you get to a point it wraps and then takes up the entire row and

12
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,140
then they go to culms.

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,490
So to make this it's actually pretty simple.

14
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,730
You have to understand how flex grow shrink and bubble bath how that works.

15
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,780
So here's some starter code that I made.

16
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,110
If you want to follow along first thing will do.

17
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,360
Just look at the markup.

18
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,400
So we've got a container div with three boxes.

19
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,880
Each box has an H3 inside with some dummy text.

20
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,300
And then the middle box has a class of middle just so I can change its colors.

21
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,240
There's other ways of doing that of course.

22
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,900
Cleaner ways using emptive type or something but I just wanted to have this video focus purely on flex

23
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:20,970
blocks.

24
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:30,870
So let's start off by selecting our container and let's give that the magic display flex as we go.

25
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:33,350
Super easy to get them in line like that.

26
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,940
OK so now let's do just some basic color.

27
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:44,960
So the box the top and bottom are the first and third boxes are going to have a color background and

28
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:45,760
color.

29
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:46,940
I'm not memorizing this.

30
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:52,630
It is CCPs 00 zero for two.

31
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,680
And let's do the same thing.

32
00:01:54,690 --> 00:02:02,310
But for middle and that color is be 2 0 0 3 9.

33
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,290
All right.

34
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,710
So now that we have that out of the way let's take a look at their default behavior.

35
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,870
So it's actually pretty close to what we want.

36
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,560
Things are shrinking evenly.

37
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,560
But then this happens.

38
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,010
We don't want that.

39
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:23,070
So the first thing you know just to be clear the default flex shrink is one but we could play around

40
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:23,840
with that.

41
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:31,080
And do you know Frech flex shrink to and that goes of course on the actual items not the container.

42
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,660
There you go.

43
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,010
So they will have a drink of two but the middle one will have a flex shrinker.

44
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,870
One what happens.

45
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,490
Here we go.

46
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:43,720
There we go.

47
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,540
It shrinks at a much slower rate.

48
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,050
It still does shrink but much slower than the left and the right.

49
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,220
But we don't care about that for now.

50
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,610
So let's talk about the rapping behavior.

51
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,790
So I want it to wrap.

52
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,550
So that's on our container.

53
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:05,340
So it's Flack's wrap colon wrap but it just starts wrapping right away.

54
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,630
Why is it doing that.

55
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,400
Not what I want.

56
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,680
And this has to do with a couple of things.

57
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:18,950
One is that we don't have a flex basis set which remember is the initial state that it gets put in there.

58
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,620
And what's happening instead is the initial state of each one of these.

59
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,870
Let's take a look.

60
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,880
447 pixels 516.

61
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,500
453.

62
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,670
So let me get rid of the disp the display flex.

63
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,880
You know you can see these are massive.

64
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,590
They go all the way across of course.

65
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,950
So we don't have a flex basis set.

66
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:43,700
And so it's using the width of the content inside to determine that.

67
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,540
And because of that this thing is too large to fit over here.

68
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,860
So it goes onto the next line.

69
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,400
We don't want that.

70
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:57,650
What we want instead is for them to wrap at a specific point and for us I believe they think the number

71
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:00,340
that I came up with was around 200 pixels.

72
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:11,060
So once each one of them is 200 pixels wide it should wrap it to D that comes to flex basis.

73
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:25,540
So Flex bases we could give you something small like 100 pixels and save turn flex wrap like spaces.

74
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:30,220
So let's add a flex bases to the boxes flex bases.

75
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,310
If I can spell it and let's just do one hundred pixels at the beginning.

76
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,160
There we go.

77
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:41,570
So they're forced into this 100 pixel sized container I guess.

78
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:47,110
And there's three of them and we have a bunch of space by default flex grow is what it's 0.

79
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,640
So they don't take up the space.

80
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:53,010
So if we want them to do flex grow one.

81
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,250
Now they all take up that space.

82
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:55,810
OK.

83
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,340
So we're getting close.

84
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:58,720
Right.

85
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,800
That looks good.

86
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:05,550
But now what happens when we get to the point where they should wrap.

87
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,970
And where is that point.

88
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,910
Well flex basis is set to be 100 pixels right now.

89
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,610
So that's pretty small.

90
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:22,700
So when they each take up 100 pixels which is going to be where you right there and you see that line

91
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:25,950
right there.

92
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,510
Yup.

93
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:33,970
So right when we hit 300 pixels it shifts down and you can see now that they are rapping.

94
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,420
And why is it taking up this entire row.

95
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,720
Well there's a bunch of whitespace and we that flex grow to be one.

96
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,700
So if we get rid of flex grow and let it flex basis to be 200.

97
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,680
So they start there.

98
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,700
And once I shrink down to that size notice it doesn't take up the whole row.

99
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:56,430
But if I add flex grow it now grows to take up the entire row.

100
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:57,720
OK.

101
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:03,640
So that's kind of just that's it that's a little trick using flex basis along with wrap.

102
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:07,480
So combining them can make some really make for some really nice results.

103
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,130
Also I'll just show as I keep shrinking what happens.

104
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,110
Well flex basis is 200 pixels.

105
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,370
We're running out of space.

106
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,700
Go onto the next line and now they each have a roach themselves.

107
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:24,700
They take up all that white space because flex goes one I think it's pretty nifty.

108
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,290
Very easy to make a nice layout like that.

109
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:33,850
And really we have or we've achieved what at least the functionality of this you know the styling stuff

110
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:37,590
to do but it's exactly the same you know the numbers might be different.

111
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,010
I didn't go through and look at the exact with.

112
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,820
We compare that to ours.

113
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,230
Let's see where does that change.

114
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:51,330
Looks about the same as far as the widths.

115
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,380
So you could experiment more with that.

116
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,810
So that's really all I wanted to show on this video.

117
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:58,920
The last thing we could do is simplify this with a single line.

118
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:03,230
So just change it to flex what's our flex grow zero.

119
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:07,710
What's the shrink one that's the default and the basis 200 pixels.

120
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:14,210
Get rid of these two lines and just see we end up with the same exact result right there.

121
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,310
Cool.

122
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,960
So if you want to see the stylus you can do that.

123
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,380
But if you don't care.

124
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:19,970
Go ahead.

125
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:20,910
Move on.

126
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:30,780
So if you do care all we'll do is set a set the color to be white and the font family should be I think

127
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:35,820
Helvetica we can add some padding.

128
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,840
There we go just all around.

129
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:47,460
The other thing that we can do is add that hover effect I don't know if you noticed that it just changes

130
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,600
background colors.

131
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,860
So does box colon hover.

132
00:07:53,500 --> 00:08:03,330
Well just do background and that color is f f 0 0 5 2 perfect still a little bra.

133
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,600
So why don't we add a nice transition.

134
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,340
Some review here.

135
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,000
Transition.

136
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:13,930
Let's go very fast point one seconds and let's do that just on background.

137
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,830
Yeah it's a little nicer.

138
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,080
All right.

139
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,000
And that's pretty much it honestly.

140
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:26,190
Oh and the last thing I did zoom out here and you can see our font size is not quite right.

141
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:35,110
So we might want to replace that with something to H-3 maybe will do font size maybe 30 pixels.

142
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:40,610
That looks good although you may want it to shrink down the window so you could use a media query you

143
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,870
could use calc you could use.

144
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:50,430
What else could you do a percentage or even do VH or V W in this case could do like two.

145
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:57,080
VW I'm not really a fan of this because it gets too small at the end.

146
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:02,680
It's doing 2 percent of the width of the window but just showing you could do that.

147
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:06,190
But I think 30 pixels or work right or not.
