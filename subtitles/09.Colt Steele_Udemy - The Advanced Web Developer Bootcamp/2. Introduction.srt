Hello again I'm here with Tim Garcia The Greatest Man That Ever Lived to introduce the next chunk of

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:11,510
content and of course moving our focus away from CSX for now and towards writing Asynchronous JavaScript.

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,200
The end goal here is to eventually build single page applications using javascript.

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:21,270
So Tim's going to take a lead on this next section and introduce some important concepts around asynchronous

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:27,540
Janus will cover things like how to write Asynchronous JavaScript how to manage asynchronous code using

6
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,960
callbacks and how the javascript event loop works.

7
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,360
The material here is essential.

8
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:36,240
Understand is fundamental for building single page applications.

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:42,860
After that I'll be back to cover the actual process of making requests to third party API is using AJAX.

10
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,090
Until then you're in Tim's good hands.
