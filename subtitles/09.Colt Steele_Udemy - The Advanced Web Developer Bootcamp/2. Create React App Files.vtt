00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:00.870
All right.

2
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.140
Now let's look at the files that create re-act that are created for us.

3
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.060
Our only objective this time will be to check out these files so let's get started.

4
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:10.480
OK.

5
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:16.160
We're back in our cloud nine workspace and if you remember before we created this re-act directory all

6
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:22.630
open that up and then take a look at what's gotten created here create re-act up created a package that

7
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.980
Jason for us.

8
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.820
And it also didn't NPM install to install all of our node modules.

9
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.790
So if we look in the modules folder here we can see all the dependencies already installed for application.

10
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.400
Let's take a look at the package.

11
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.250
Jason first

12
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.690
so in this file you can see all the dependencies far re-act up just like before we have reactor's a

13
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.000
dependency and react arm because we're using react in the browser.

14
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.590
And this third one reac scripts is the file that does all of the web configuration for us.

15
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.810
You'll notice that both react and react.

16
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:06.950
Or at version 15 point 6.1 at the time of the recording of this video re-act 16 is almost out.

17
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.180
It's very close.

18
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.470
So for most of the projects that we're going to do here I'm actually going to replace this with the

19
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.360
release candidate of Riak 16.

20
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.090
Just to make sure that everything is up to the latest and greatest version of react at the time of watching

21
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.150
this video you may not even have this version.

22
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:29.030
By the time you saw your app this might already be version 16 by default but in later videos we'll see

23
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.820
how to change this to the release candidate version 16 so that we can test out with the latest version

24
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.830
of react.

25
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.750
Now let's look in the public folder.

26
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.050
So the public folder contains files that don't go through the web pack build process so any file in

27
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.210
here will be delivered as is the one we care about right now.

28
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.680
Index page to.

29
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.390
So this file is the basis of our Web site it's the index page that will be delivered to the client and

30
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.910
the main thing here is that we have this div ID equals root.

31
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.720
So where does that thing come into play.

32
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:12.060
If we look in the source folder and open up index j s just like we saw before in that one page a shemale

33
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.100
file that didn't use create react up.

34
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.680
We need to react darm render in order to tell re-act where to attach the component to the DOM.

35
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.610
So right here we're using document I get only by id root and that root div that we just saw earlier

36
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.360
is the one that will attach a component called app to.

37
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.510
Now where does the app live.

38
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.050
Well in the same source folder we've got an app.

39
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.170
Yes.

40
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.060
And this is our app component.

41
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.330
It looks pretty similar to what we've seen before except for a couple of minor changes.

42
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.780
So we have this import syntax going on here which we'll learn more about in the next video.

43
00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.560
And because we're importing component we no longer have to say re-act component.

44
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.040
We can just use component by itself.

45
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.320
Let's make a small change this file just to see it working.

46
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.650
I will open up the browser and check it out.

47
00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.080
So

48
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.450
let's say hello world here instead for our Hello world.

49
00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.050
If you've still got the app running in the terminal window you can just open this and preview again.

50
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.170
But assuming you don't you can just say NPM start

51
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:31.180
and then click on this link to open it up again using open in Preview.

52
00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.380
Now keep in mind that when you create re-act app any change that you make is automatically picked up.

53
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.530
So you don't actually have to restart your server each time.

54
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.930
You can just leave NPM start running and the browser will refresh automatically.

55
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.650
One catch though is if you ever install any other packages using NPM install then you have to kill your

56
00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.000
server and started up again.

57
00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.430
So let's open this in the browser.

58
00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:01.670
Actually before you do make sure your app Jasc file is saved because the changes won't get picked up

59
00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.340
unless this files saved.

60
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:10.830
So I'll click on this link and say open in preview and then click this button here and voila.

61
00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.690
We got our change Hello world.

62
00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.430
All right next up we'll learn about the importance index.
