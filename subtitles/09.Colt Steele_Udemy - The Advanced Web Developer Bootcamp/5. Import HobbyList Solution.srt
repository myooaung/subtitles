00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,500
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:06,060
So let's finish up this Moxey component with our hobby list.

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:10,740
So if I go back to the code we've got this heavy list class that I'll copy over

4
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,130
and then I want to make a new file for that.

5
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:25,770
Let's open a new terminal so I don't have to keep killing the server and I'll go into my re-act folder.

6
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,730
And hello world.

7
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,730
And then I'll touch source Havi list.

8
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:36,370
AS.

9
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,100
Now I've got that file I'll just paste in my code and

10
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:49,470
remember we don't need re-act component but we do need to import react.

11
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:57,860
So import reacts and component Honan's from reacts.

12
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,310
Here we go.

13
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:05,900
And then last thing to do is export defaults hobby list.

14
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,560
Right now our components all set up the last piece of the puzzle is to use it in the pet.

15
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,560
So inside of Petraeus I'm going to throw in imports

16
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:27,310
the list from the slash Havi list and then I'll use that component right here.

17
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:43,850
Oh and I asked my semi-colon and from there we go now with those changes we should see our lists and

18
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,710
we do great.

19
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,140
So that's it.

20
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:52,250
Now that we have all the introduction to create re-act up out of the way let's talk about prop's.
