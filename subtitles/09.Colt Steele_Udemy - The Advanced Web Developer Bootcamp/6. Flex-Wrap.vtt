00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.040
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:07.890
So the next property we're learning about is called Flex wrap and all it does is it allows us to specify

3
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.130
if the items in a flex container have to stay on a single line or if they can be wrapped into more than

4
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:14.750
one line.

5
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.640
So for example to make more sense let's make our boxes a lot larger.

6
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.490
Because right now they actually fit into a single line a single row.

7
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:30.410
OK but if we made them 300 pixels wide then we should only be able to fit a couple on a single line.

8
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.040
But actually this is kind of strange.

9
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.130
These are supposed to be 300 pixels.

10
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.010
What's going on.

11
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.460
These aren't 300 pixels.

12
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.710
Let me show you.

13
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.060
Take this back to Roe.

14
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:50.080
So they all fit here so let's say I want to make them much larger if I go up to my box styles.

15
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.280
Let's make them have a wealth of something even much bigger 500 pixels.

16
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.870
Those are not 500 pixels.

17
00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:04.760
What if I made them 1000 pixels or something crazy for I don't know 4500 as you can see.

18
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.670
I've hit this maximum point where it's like Xbox because I made this a flex container saying no no no

19
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.290
I'm not gonna do that for you.

20
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.440
I have to keep everything in a single line here.

21
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.940
So I'm just going to make things as big as I can but I'm not going to make them any bigger.

22
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.630
So rather than doing 4500 which is massive let's do 300.

23
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.200
Why not.

24
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.360
So that brings us to our property flex rap flex rap.

25
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.340
If we add that to our container it's like rap colon rap.

26
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.560
The default value by the way is no rap.

27
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:43.490
So we usually don't have to play with that unless you've somehow maybe using javascript turned it off

28
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:44.750
and turn it back on.

29
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.500
But definitely it's just something you should know.

30
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.720
The default is no rap.

31
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:56.670
But if we set it to wrap our content now goes on two separate lines and it grows to the size the width

32
00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.950
that we specified.

33
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:04.150
So let me show you that I said 300 pixels but it's obviously not 300 pixels.

34
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.280
But if I do flex wrap colon wrap and save.

35
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.870
You can see hopefully that it grew and it's much larger than it used to be.

36
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.730
And it almost takes up two full lines.

37
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:23.670
Now that we've allowed it to wrap and I can change the width to 500 and it will make as many rows as

38
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.210
it needs.

39
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.280
In this case three rows.

40
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.580
And they all fit pretty nicely.

41
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:36.410
So that's the basics of flex wrap using Roe but what about Roe reverse.

42
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.220
Does that change anything.

43
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.150
Not really just the order is different.

44
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.840
So one two three and then it starts wrapping here four five six.

45
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.030
Remember the main axis goes this way.

46
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.990
And then they go downwards because the cross axis goes from top to bottom.

47
00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.940
Which brings me to the next thing I want to show you to bring this back to row which is a third value

48
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.380
rap dash reverse.

49
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:12.210
And what this will do is it allows it to wrap but it changes the start and end of the cross axis.

50
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.500
So instead of having the cross axes starting appear and moving downwards so that all subsequent rows

51
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.970
are below it actually does the opposite where all subsequent rows are above.

52
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:32.530
So if we change this to rapid dash reverse you'll see that the main access is still left to right.

53
00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.850
But now our roads go upward.

54
00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:42.490
So we start at the bottom and go upwards and we can combine that with road reverse.

55
00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.610
Now we got a lot of axes to to keep straight.

56
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.300
We have our main access going from right to left.

57
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.610
One two three four five six seven eight nine.

58
00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.880
And our cross axis going from bottom to top.

59
00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.120
So when we wrap those rows are going upwards.

60
00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.200
So you may have guessed this but we can also do the exact same thing if we're working with a column

61
00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.300
instead of a row.

62
00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:11.060
The only problem really is that by just making it a column we don't actually have a with on this container

63
00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.580
so there isn't any wrapping happening.

64
00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.700
So let me just make this regular rock sort of wrap reverse.

65
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:19.520
They just keep going.

66
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:25.280
There is no limit like there was with the side of the screen that forced our items to wrap.

67
00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.320
In this case we can just keep adding on.

68
00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:35.600
So what I could do is give our container a max height or just a height we could do something like VHF

69
00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.510
100 Vage if you're familiar with that viewport height.

70
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:46.760
Basically as this grows this is 100 VH whatever we're able to see on the screen at that time.

71
00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:52.320
Or you could give it a pixel value as well let's say 800 pixels if you wanted.

72
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.210
And we have these columns that are wrapping.

73
00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.600
So we have one two three four five.

74
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.190
It can't fit the next one.

75
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.000
So it wraps six seven eight nine.

76
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.450
Don't worry about the spacing if they are centered or not centered anything like that.

77
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.560
Those are future properties we'll be learning.

78
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.990
But just the fact that we can have a column that wraps.

79
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.780
So in this case our main axis goes from top to bottom.

80
00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.850
And our cross axis goes from left to right.

81
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.140
Remember this is where we start.

82
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.890
And then it wraps to the second row and then third if necessary.

83
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:30.930
And so on.

84
00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:39.530
So we could do the same thing by doing column dash reverse and this case our main Access starts down

85
00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.910
here.

86
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.740
One two three four five and then it wraps over here.

87
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.840
And yes we can do wrap reverse.

88
00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:55.740
And now our main axis goes top to bottom excuse me bottom to top and our cross axis goes right to the

89
00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:56.920
left.

90
00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:57.350
OK.

91
00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.060
A lot of combinations there.

92
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.130
But the key takeaway is that there's a cross axis.

93
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:07.660
There's a main axis understanding those is really going to help you visualize how things work.

94
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:13.700
Flex direction allows us to specify how content and move along that main axis if it's left to right

95
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:20.630
right to left top to bottom bottom to top and flex wrap allows us to specify if content should wrap

96
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.120
onto a second row or second column.

97
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.130
In this case or however many subsequent rows are columns not just two.

98
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.530
OK.

99
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.850
So that wraps up flex wrap.

100
00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:30.390
Oh gosh.

101
00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:31.010
OK.
