00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:02,210
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,410
In this video we're going to be talking about prototypes.

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:11,360
We'll first understand what the prototype object is we'll then describe and diagram the relationship

4
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:14,820
between under proto prototype and constructor.

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:21,140
Well then add methods and properties on the prototype object to write more efficient code and explain

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:26,690
the difference between adding methods and properties to the prototype versus the constructor function.

7
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:33,230
Finally we'll define and implement inheritance through the prototype object before we get the prototypes.

8
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:37,530
Let's quickly review one more time what the new keyword does first.

9
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,130
It creates an object out of thin air.

10
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:46,540
Second it sets the value of the keyword this to be that object created in the previous step.

11
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:50,540
Third it adds or return this to the constructor function.

12
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:57,740
Finally it creates a link which we can access as Dunder Prato between the object created and the prototype

13
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,770
property of the constructor function.

14
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,820
Let's talk a bit more about that point.

15
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,380
Better yet let's diagram this relationship.

16
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:11,150
Don't be too intimidated by this diagram or walk through it step by step as a guide.

17
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,920
A circle is a function and a square is an object.

18
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:20,810
So here we have a person constructor function which has a property called prototype which is an object

19
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:28,500
that object has a property on it called constructor which points back to the original constructor function.

20
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:35,210
If properties or methods are placed on the person prototype they can be accessible from any object created

21
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,520
from that constructor function.

22
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,520
Finally the way in which these objects which are created by the constructor function get access to the

23
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,790
prototype object is through a link called Dunder proto.

24
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,260
This link gets a step list when the new keyword is used.

25
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:56,060
To recap every constructor function has a property on it called prototype.

26
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:01,040
This property is an object which can have methods and properties placed on it.

27
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:07,340
These methods and properties are shared and accessible by any object that is created from that constructor

28
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,070
function.

29
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,160
When the new keyword is used.

30
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,950
Now let's see what this looks like with a code example.

31
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:18,230
I'm going to copy and paste some code in the chrome console and we can walk through each line of it.

32
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:23,320
First I have a constructor function called person with a property called name.

33
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:28,730
Since I have created a function we can already see that there is a property on it called up prototype

34
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,380
in javascript.

35
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:34,680
Every single function has a property on it called predicate.

36
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:41,090
Now I'm going to create two objects called an alley from my constructor function using the new keyword.

37
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,850
Since I use the new keyword a property has been added to each of these objects called under Procope

38
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:53,410
which points to the prototype property and the person constructor will discuss in the next video.

39
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,840
Why this prototype property is so useful.

40
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:03,450
Finally the prototype object has a property on it called constructor which points back to the original

41
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,620
function.

42
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:10,440
The constructor property is not something you'll be using or manipulating frequently but it is an important

43
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,080
part in a concept called inheritance which we'll discuss in a leader video.

44
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:21,690
To recap I actually want to jump back a couple of slides to the diagram so we can go over it again.

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,350
Remember circles are functions and squares are objects.

46
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:31,780
So here I have two objects called L-E and colt which were created from the person constructor function.

47
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,930
Since I use the new keyword when I created them.

48
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:40,480
Each of these objects has a property on it called under Provo which points to the prototype property

49
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:46,960
on the person constructor in the next video will examine the prototype object and see just how useful

50
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,740
it is.

51
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,160
