00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.420
An last video we talked about composable components and components are really at the core of re-act

2
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.000
you can't really do react to that.

3
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.630
Understanding what a component is.

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.780
So let's get started with our first component.

5
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:19.000
So our objectives are simple we're going to create a re-act component and then we're going to use react

6
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.530
arm to render that component on the page.

7
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:28.750
So let's get to some code.

8
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.700
Let's get started with this HDMI file.

9
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:38.070
So we're going to learn react without any added tools or build files or anything I want to focus just

10
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.760
on the very basics to get started.

11
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.040
So what am I including here.

12
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.620
Well first of all there's a script for reacts.

13
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.710
That's our re-act library that we're about to learn.

14
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.330
And then the second one is poor re-act dom.

15
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.730
And the reason those two are separated is because re-act is actually used in a lot more places other

16
00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.320
than just the Web.

17
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.810
There's also Riak native and re-act for V.R..

18
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.690
So the core component of re-act is separated from the DOM component which we're going to be using here

19
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.100
in the web.

20
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.990
And finally we're including re-act Dom factories.

21
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.270
So we're going to be using this to create some Dohm elements that will show on the page.

22
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.560
So let's get started with our first component.

23
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.280
The first thing I want to do here is create a class.

24
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.290
So every re-act component is going to need to have class and you should call it something that's relevant

25
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.000
for the component you're creating.

26
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.880
So here we're going to create a pet component it's going to show my pet cat moxie.

27
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:46.620
So I'll make a pet and it will extend re-act stock component again every component you create is going

28
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.820
to extend from component.

29
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.820
And as I mentioned earlier all components are going to have a render method.

30
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.700
Spell it right.

31
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.090
So there we go we've got a render method now.

32
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.500
And the gold render method eventually is to return some HCM mail that we want to put in the DOM.

33
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:11.550
And the way that we're going to do that is by using a factory provided by this library here react on

34
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.780
factories to create elements for the page.

35
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:23.460
So the first element I'm going to create is an H2 and I'm going to set that equal to reacts factories

36
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.880
that H2.

37
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.450
Now this is a function that takes first as a parameter what attributes you want inside that too.

38
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.580
So we're going to start by just giving it no.

39
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.450
The second parameter is what you'd like inside that age to tag.

40
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.200
So I'm going to put a string Moxey inside H2.

41
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.790
Next thing we're going to create is an image for Moxey.

42
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:56.490
So I'm going to say react on factories again that image this time we actually want to give it some attributes

43
00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.090
because we want to provide the source for that image.

44
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:07.020
So I'm going to provide a objects inside of there I'll give it a source and my source I'll copy right

45
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.230
here.

46
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.560
It's going to be an image of Moxey and then you should also always provide an alt attribute.

47
00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.600
So just name it.

48
00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.640
Moxey my cat.

49
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:30.000
All right now we've got our age to Dom element and we've got our image of what we need to put on the

50
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.600
screen and with re-act you can never return multiple components next to each other you always have to

51
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.120
put it inside of one Dom element.

52
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.680
So I'm going to return now.

53
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.390
Re-act Dom factories that div..

54
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:55.140
So I'll put both of these inside of a div it'll have no attributes and then the elements that I want

55
00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.640
to put inside that div are my age to first and my image second

56
00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.190
Okay now I have my finished component.

57
00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.830
It's a it's got a render method and it returns some DOM element.

58
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.210
So let's see it in the browser.

59
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:18.110
All right so in my browser and I don't see anything and if I open up the developer tools look at the

60
00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.110
console there is no heir's So it's going on.

61
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:27.200
Well let's go back to the code and take a look what's going on here is that we've created a component

62
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.110
but we haven't actually rendered it in the DOM yet.

63
00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:36.840
And to do that we're going to have to use re-act Dom render So remember re-act Dom here is what we're

64
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.250
using to render something on the screen.

65
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.470
And we always have to do this and every app that we create with reacts we're going to have to tell it

66
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.800
where to hook our components into the DOM.

67
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:54.660
So I'm going to call re-act Dom here render and the first thing that you want to provide is the element

68
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.160
that you want to render.

69
00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:02.680
So I'm going to say reacts create elements of pet.

70
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:10.510
So that creates a HDMI element out of my pet component and the next thing I want to do is decide where

71
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.050
in the Dom to put it.

72
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:19.180
And I've already got this div here so I'm going to get that element by id and then put my re-act component

73
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.740
there and the DOM.

74
00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.950
So say documents get element by id

75
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.010
and pass an app.

76
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.000
Right so this is just plain old vanilla javascript's.

77
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:40.450
We're just getting an element out of the Dom and then we'll use that to render our component.

78
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.760
OK.

79
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.900
Now with that change let's see what's going on in the browser.

80
00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:45.120
All right.

81
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:52.470
And as you can see now we've got that age to appear Moxey and we've got the picture of Moxey as well.

82
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:53.600
So there you have it.

83
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.170
We've got our first component in reac.

84
00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.840
Let's take a look at it in the code one more time.

85
00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.270
Remember the main things here are that we need react react.

86
00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.810
And in this case we also need react on factories in order to create the elements that we want to create.

87
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:15.910
And finally once we create our component using this class syntax we need to tell re-act where we want

88
00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:19.530
to render this component in the DOM using react on render.

89
00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:24.850
Now I should mention that this is not code that you'll typically write with react but this is react

90
00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.350
at its lowest level.

91
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:33.190
No extra tools no fancy things going on just HVM Ellen javascript's nothing else.

92
00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:37.200
Next up will start learning about some tools that help make this process much much easier.

93
00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.330
So we don't have to use things like react on factories.
