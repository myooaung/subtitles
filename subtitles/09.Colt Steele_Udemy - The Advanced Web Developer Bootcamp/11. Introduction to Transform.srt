1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:00,960
All right.

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:07,410
So the next topic that we'll tackle here is Seah says transforms so transform is actually a property

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,760
that she has comes with.

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,760
It's really really powerful.

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:13,170
It's a little bit complicated potentially intimidating.

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,340
So we're going to break it down.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,080
And the first thing we should discuss is what does it actually do.

8
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:24,390
So the official definition or the explanation is that transform but to manipulate the coordinate space

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,080
of the SS visual formatting model.

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,590
So I translated this a bit into something a bit more understandable.

11
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,030
Hopefully this is what I got.

12
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:37,800
Transform lets you move warp rotate and scale elements.

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:44,250
So it allows us to take elements let's say a div and it's at a certain place on our page.

14
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,840
I can spin it around.

15
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,760
I can move it X pixels to the right or down.

16
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:58,950
I can do things like scaling it up shrinking it down warping it according to 3-D perspective all different

17
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,300
things that I can do.

18
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:06,210
And when we use this in conjunction with what we're going to learn about CSSA transitions and keyframes

19
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,190
we can then animate them.

20
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:12,660
So what I'm going to show you now isn't really animating I'm going to show you how to move things that

21
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,630
are warp them how to skew them and rotate.

22
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,490
But it's not going to be graceful.

23
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,640
I can be animated.

24
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,260
So if we rotate something it's going to rotate immediately.

25
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:28,680
Our next step will then be learning how to slow it down how to set the timing function of it all that.

26
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,860
So for now we're going to start by taking a look at the documentation which is actually a bit overwhelming.

27
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:38,190
If we look at the official transform syntax I copied it over here.

28
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,400
There are so many possible variations for this.

29
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,510
It's a bit different than other properties.

30
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,050
You know background color.

31
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:49,970
You pass it a color maybe it's an R.G. B color maybe it's RBA might be hexadecimal.

32
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:56,970
It might be a named color and it's kind of a lot of variation for most CSSA properties but transform

33
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,370
has.

34
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:03,150
I don't know what two dozen or more possible functions that we pass in.

35
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:10,470
If we go to the docks here I'm an M.D. and I scroll down to syntax can see that the syntax looks like

36
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:15,820
this transform colon just like any other property followed by a function.

37
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:26,290
So in this case translating scale rotate skew skew X skew y matrix translate 3D.

38
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,300
You know there's tons of them I don't go for all of them and we're not going to talk about all of them

39
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,550
in this section either.

40
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,270
I'm just going to point out a few of them basically because they're commonly used in animations.

41
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:41,880
And those three that we're going to talk about up front are translating turns to X translate Y and then

42
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,450
we'll talk about scaling and scale x and scale Y and then rotation.

43
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,710
And those three functions put together cover most of the bases for animations.

44
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:56,580
Maybe you need to do something with a 3-D animation or a false 3-D or skew something at some point but

45
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:03,690
usually least in my experience most UI animations are done by rotating by translating moving something

46
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,370
essentially and scaling it.

47
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,850
So without further ado let's end this video.

48
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,460
I'll see you in the next video where we start typing some code.

49
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,240
We talked about our first transform.
