00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.640
All right.

2
00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.300
So next up let's work on getting that delete functionality to work.

3
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.890
So there's something we can click on it to do a button or just a little x that will then delete it not

4
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.500
only from the API but also from the DOM.

5
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.840
And it's very similar to how we did the Create where we have some code that does the API called written

6
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.080
in the last component because it manages to do state and it's triggered by some thing in a child's component.

7
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.330
In this case it will be on to do item and the route itself.

8
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:39.290
It's a delete request we need to send to slash API slash to use slash a particular ID.

9
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.410
So let's start off by asking about this actually in a different order.

10
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.950
Let's define a delete to do function here a method that takes in an ID.

11
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.480
That idea is the idea of the Do we want to delete.

12
00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.240
So we're kind of writing this in the opposite way where we write the API call first and then we trigger

13
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.200
it later.

14
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.870
We're just going to start by writing it.

15
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.800
It's going to be very similar just to fetch again.

16
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:07.990
The only difference.

17
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.240
Well one of the only differences is that you are l because we now need to construct a new you or else

18
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.030
so let's call it Konst delete.

19
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.110
You are all equals.

20
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.340
API you are L plus slash.

21
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:26.380
Next is C..

22
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.130
I put the slash in here.

23
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.820
Not yet.

24
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.910
Let's put this slash up here.

25
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.670
And then down here I'll just be able to do plus

26
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.840
ID that we're passing it.

27
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.300
So this will construct you around like a slash API slash traduce slash 6:7 ABC whatever the ideas.

28
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:56.190
OK then what I'm going to start doing is actually copying the entire fetch from AD to do so you don't

29
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.640
have to watch me type that whole thing and just add it.

30
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:06.940
So we're going to fetch delete you Arel instead method is now going to be a delete and get rid of the

31
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.310
headers and the body because we're not sending any information along.

32
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.530
We're just making into that request.

33
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.870
Then we'll keep the error checking the same.

34
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.140
Technically there's no response that we should expect back.

35
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.950
So we don't have to return response Jason.

36
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.030
The only time there would be a response dodgiest on this if there's an error because the way the API

37
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.640
works.

38
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.400
So we shouldn't get anything back.

39
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:39.720
But even if we do it doesn't really matter because all we're going to do is afterwards let's just change

40
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.280
this.

41
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.660
We're going to set state to remove the to do that we just tried to remove.

42
00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:54.530
So we have the idea remember that's coming in here and rather than setting state like this we're going

43
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.810
to first filter out.

44
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:04.690
So let's just do to do as equals this that state to do so the current to use filter.

45
00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.510
And then what we're going to try and do is to do

46
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:18.360
that underscore ID is not equal to the ID to basically get rid of the one that were trying to delete

47
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:24.870
and then we're going to reassign States so this starts to set state and we'll just say that to dues

48
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:34.360
is equal to dues which is kind of confusing but remember we're just taking you out of office and reciting

49
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.640
into it to use variable and then we're updating to do as part of the state to equal that new variable

50
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.210
which is everything that was there minus the one we tried to delete.

51
00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:44.440
OK.

52
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.410
So we have this defined.

53
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.680
Hopefully there's no errors but we'll know in a moment because right now we're not ever calling this.

54
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:57.010
So what we want to do is pass this on down to each individual to do item.

55
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.980
So here's where we're creating the two items.

56
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.200
So we're actually going to pass something in here.

57
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:13.580
We're going to have an on delete equals this dot delete to do and we need to bind it.

58
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.360
The problem is we can't do it here.

59
00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:20.450
Where's that going forever.

60
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:25.460
Because we also need to pass in some data that's particular to each individual to do item.

61
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:34.830
So we're going to bind it down here to do it to do that find this and then our second argument is going

62
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.480
to be T Dot underscore.

63
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:45.510
So for each to do item number remapping over tea refers to the actual data coming from the API or in

64
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.920
the state are going to take that and take the ID and pass that in.

65
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.950
So we're finding this and then the second argument will actually when this function is called we'll

66
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.300
pass this data as an argument.

67
00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.570
So then up here we'll have an ID to work with.

68
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.430
OK.

69
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.710
So we're almost there but we're still never calling this in the to do item.

70
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.350
So down and to do item first thing I'm going to do is pull this out as well.

71
00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:20.240
We'll just call it on delete and then we need to use and on quick to call it and I'm going to restructure

72
00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.680
my code here just a tiny little bit because what's going to happen is we're going to have an undelete

73
00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:32.270
and an on toggle two different things where you click on maybe an X or a button you want to delete that

74
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.570
to do.

75
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.090
But if you click anywhere else we want to update the status.

76
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.210
Right so if I click here I don't want to delete it but if I click on an X over here or a delete button

77
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.810
I do so I'm going to add two components.

78
00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:48.160
Excuse me are two components two parts to this I'm just going to wrap them in a span.

79
00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.050
So we have our ally after name just a span here.

80
00:05:53.510 --> 00:06:00.770
We could do a button as well but I'm going to start and I'll just put an X with a space on either side

81
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:09.410
and this span when we click it so it will do an on click equals on the lead and that should be it.

82
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:15.740
So when we click that span with the X we're calling on the lead which itself has passed in here and

83
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.190
we don't have to provide the ID and to do item we're doing it here.

84
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.580
And that in turn calls delete to do.

85
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.730
OK let's see what happens.

86
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:27.330
Let's try and delete one of these duplicates.

87
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.470
Let's open up the network tab as well so we can see what happens.

88
00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:32.560
So it looks like it worked.

89
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.230
Here's the request that was sent I believe.

90
00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:37.700
No that was the first request.

91
00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.290
Here's the one that was sent.

92
00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:47.280
The Delete request can see you sent to slash AP I-Slash to do slash that ID and it's no longer here.

93
00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.790
Refresh the page it's gone.

94
00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.250
Great.

95
00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:54.240
So I click anywhere else though nothing happens and that's good.

96
00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.790
We only want it on this X. again we'll worry about styling later.

97
00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.310
But this is fine for now.

98
00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.090
Tyler Moore looks good.

99
00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:09.640
Let's also try it when we create one and just make sure it also works that we can delete it.

100
00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:12.460
And I'm just refreshing just to make sure things are persisting.

101
00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.010
How they should in the database.

102
00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:15.330
Everything looks good.

103
00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:16.090
OK.

104
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:21.840
Before I forget let's actually update our to do form so it doesn't start as EHLO ha.

105
00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:24.830
Let's make the initial input value just an empty string.

106
00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.860
And we have our delete working.

107
00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:34.870
You can see again the bulk of the logic here is just the fetch the API call itself.

108
00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:35.640
OK.

109
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:42.690
So next we're going to do very very similar thing but working on toggling or updating the status the

110
00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:43.820
completed status.

111
00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:47.960
So it would basically follow the same pattern except rather than delete request.

112
00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:49.520
We're going to send a put request.
