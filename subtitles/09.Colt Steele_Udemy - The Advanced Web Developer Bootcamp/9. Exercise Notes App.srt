00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,800
Welcome back for the next exercise I'd like you to try to add some features to the Notes app.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,660
We looked at before in this video.

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,450
I'll demonstrate the features I'd like to add.

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:17,310
You can find a link to the starter code for this exercise in the list of resources.

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,990
First I'd like you to add a button to the bottom of the page that lets you remove all of the current

6
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,670
notes.

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,640
This doesn't stop me from adding new notes afterwards.

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,780
It just removes all current notes from the page next.

9
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:37,430
I'd like you to add an I'm Feeling Lucky button which changes the style of the notes how you want this

10
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,260
button to work is up to you.

11
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:44,150
I have it randomly update the font size of each note or you could have it change the color of the notes

12
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,170
update the text or do something completely different.

13
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:52,130
Lastly I'd like you to try to implement a preview feature for your notes.

14
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:57,760
When I start typing in a new note I can see the potential new note appear on the screen it's colored

15
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,850
differently than all of the existing notes because it's a preview but once I add the note my preview

16
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,940
note becomes an actual note in the preview area disappears.

17
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:11,880
If I try to add a second note the preview area appears once again.

18
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:15,960
Good luck adding these features I'll show you my solution to this exercise.

19
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:16,760
