00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:01.800
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.320
In this video we'll finish up our study of data joins D-3 by exploring a more general update pattern

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:13.440
for binding data to elements in the last video we learned how to use the exit selection and D-3 to remove

4
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.510
elements from the DOM when they are no longer joined with data.

5
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.660
I've taken that code and put it inside of an event listener.

6
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:29.270
There's now a button in my HMO that I can click on to remove quotes from R-rated movies.

7
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.090
I've also added a second button that when clicked should add some new quotes to the page.

8
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.990
I've got the new quote stored in a variable but right now the button isn't working.

9
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.070
Let's implement this functionality along the way.

10
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.610
We'll talk about D-3 general update pattern our button has an ID of at.

11
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.740
So when our javascript lets select this button with D-3 and add an event listener for clicks.

12
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:57.290
When I click on the Add button I want to add the new quotes to the array of quotes and use D-3 to bind

13
00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.390
the new array to the list items.

14
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.280
Then I want to style them so that they look consistent with the existing quotes.

15
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.100
For now I'll duplicate all the styling we used to and we added the first set of quotes.

16
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.360
Though I'd encourage you to try to refactor this code on your own to remove the duplication

17
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.450
finally.

18
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.620
I'll go ahead and remove the ad button from the page so that we can add the same quotes over and over

19
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:23.080
again.

20
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.250
Let's save this and see what happens when I click on the Add button.

21
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.810
Something's not right.

22
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:37.120
The newest items aren't being appended to the quotes list they're being appended to the HVM El when

23
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.970
you are appending new elements on an update.

24
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.780
Make sure you first select the parent element you'd like to append to before selecting the children.

25
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.920
Otherwise by default your new elements will get appended to the HCM tag.

26
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.600
In this case we need to update our initial selections so that we're first selecting the unordered list

27
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.990
before creating the selection of list items.

28
00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.460
Let's refresh the page and try again.

29
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.050
Much better.

30
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.720
It's also important to note that any changes you make to the selection will only affect the new list

31
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.620
items.

32
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.800
This is because we're passing the enter selection.

33
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.290
You can think of every selection in D-3 as having three parts the enter selection corresponds to pieces

34
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.960
of data that don't yet have elements on the page.

35
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:25.080
The exit selection corresponds to elements on the page that no longer have pieces of data and the update

36
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.040
selection corresponds to elements on the page that are successfully joined to data D-3 treats these

37
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.390
groups separately.

38
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.850
For example if we change the padding from 20 pixels to zero in our code we see that only the new quotes

39
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.230
reflect this change.

40
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.870
Because we're only targeting the nodes.

41
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.760
The Enter selection is separation between the enter and update selections can be helpful if we want

42
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.670
to style one group differently than the other.

43
00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.560
But what if we want to apply the same set of changes to both selections.

44
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.870
We could just grab each group individually and apply the changes we want but D-3 provides us with a

45
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.190
method called merge that merges together the enter and update selections.

46
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.840
Let's apply our existing style rules to the new quotes but after merging Let's change the font color

47
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.530
of every quote on the page here's what that would look like.

48
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.830
First we're binding existing list items to our new data and storing the selection.

49
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.360
Since we haven't called enter or exit this represents the update selection.

50
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.930
Next we're hopping into the intersection appending the new list items and styling them appropriately.

51
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.280
This is exactly what we did before.

52
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.820
Finally we're merging our entered selection with our update selection.

53
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.680
This is why we stored the update selection in a variable.

54
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.420
Once we've merged our selections we're updating the style of every list item in that selection not just

55
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.220
the new ones this pattern.

56
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.540
Part of what's called the general update pattern in D-3 the general update pattern consists of these

57
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.390
four steps when you're joining an arbitrary amount of data to an arbitrary number of elements.

58
00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.690
First grab the update selection.

59
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:06.580
Make any changes unique to that selection and store the selection in a variable next grab the exit selection

60
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.030
and remove any unnecessary elements.

61
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.190
Then grab the enter selection and make any changes unique to it.

62
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.940
Finally merge the enter and update selections and make any changes that you want to be shared across

63
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.940
both of these selections will get more practice with this pattern in the exercises.

64
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.200
That's it for the section on joining data elements with D-3 in the next section.

65
00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.580
We'll learn about the SVGA element in HCM L and how to use D-3 with us Weegee.

66
00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.710
I'll meet you back here after you finish the exercises for this section.
