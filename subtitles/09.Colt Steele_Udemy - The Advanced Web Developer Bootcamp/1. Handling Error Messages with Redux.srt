1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,630
So if we look back on what we've got so far everything seems to be working.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:09,060
When we canceled out log logged in when we click on sign up and something goes wrong we get these error

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:13,340
messages that just a bad request an encore promise undefined.

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,570
So if we click on this right here and head over to the Network tab and look at are in our Ajax requests

5
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,340
we can see the response from the server.

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,800
Is this nice error object.

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,020
So sorry the user name or email is taken.

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,580
What we want to do now is display this message to the user to do that.

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,540
We're going to dispatch another action.

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,530
If something goes incorrectly.

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:39,080
So inside of our office we're going to add a little bit of functionality to handle errors.

12
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,350
Let's go to our actions and we're going to have some actions for errors.

13
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,060
So we want to be able to dispatch an action to add or remove an error.

14
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,250
So let's start by importing our action types.

15
00:00:53,810 --> 00:01:05,900
Let's get an error and another and that comes from I-Slash action types.

16
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:09,140
So we're going to go back to folder and go to action Tex

17
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,540
and here we're getting right to very small action creators functions that return actions.

18
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,730
So make a function called an error which accepts a parameter we'll call that error and it's going to

19
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:24,460
return an object.

20
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,630
So I want to make sure we have those parentheses around that that's really important.

21
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:35,250
That type of add error and that error as whatever the second parameter is and here we'll call this from.

22
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,920
We'll let's make another function we'll call that remove error which doesn't accept any parameters.

23
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,490
It's still going to return an object.

24
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:47,030
So let's make sure we also change the type to remove error and online and delete that parameter.

25
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:50,620
So these are just some action creators for adding and removing errors.

26
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,520
We're going to need these inside of our office.

27
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:58,720
We're going to need these because inside of you yes we want to either show the error or remove any existing

28
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,560
errors.

29
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:07,390
So let's import and error and remove error from slash errors.

30
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:14,620
And we're going to use these inside of our DOT then or our DOT catch if there any previous errors let's

31
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:23,610
dispatch remove our and if there are any errors that get created let's dispatch add error with an error

32
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:30,700
message number that message property is coming from the server in our error object.

33
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:35,440
So I mean yes let's go send those errors to these forms.

34
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,650
So we've got to go to a relaxed day and we're going to grab those errors so we can keep errors and get

35
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,260
that from state that errors.

36
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,030
Let's see this.

37
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:48,440
We should be able to now pass these as props to our forms.

38
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:56,420
So inside of our off form let's add a prop. we'll call that errors and we'll get that value of errors.

39
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,030
Let's do the same thing in our other form as well.

40
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,990
So this and inside of our form how do we display these errors.

41
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,080
Let's write a little bit of conditional logic to see if there are any errors.

42
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,160
So if there are any errors you want to display them.

43
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,720
Otherwise don't do anything so right after our wedding what's.

44
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:25,420
A little bit of conditional logic which ESX will say if there are if there is a message property inside

45
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:35,270
of errors let's go display some information so will display a div with the class name of alert color

46
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,140
danger.

47
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:41,620
Pretty standard bootstrap I don't have an inside of your whatever that error messages.

48
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:47,370
Let's go make sure because I did make sure that our syntax is proper.

49
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,760
That looks good.

50
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,080
So are there any specific errors here will display them.

51
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,250
Otherwise we will.

52
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,470
So let's go to the browser and it says errors is not defined.

53
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:59,800
So that's because we're trying to use something called errors but where did it come from.

54
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,670
It came from prox.

55
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:06,460
So if to make sure that we pass that from this start process what's the first page and how errors is

56
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,610
not defined as well inside of major US.

57
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,840
And that's because inside a manger.

58
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,220
Yes.

59
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,720
I also do structure errors from props as well.

60
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,530
You'll make this mistake quite a few times.

61
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,040
It's great to see me make it because you will as well and that's totally fine.

62
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:24,310
So we're going to pass these as props to our main component and then we'll pass them down as props to

63
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,600
the form.

64
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:29,070
So if you have a page and click sign up we should now see that error.

65
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,990
And that looks good.

66
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,190
Let's get going again and this error is still here.

67
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,420
And that's not really applicable to the log in form.

68
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:42,320
So anytime that we switch on these routes let's clear those error messages that we've seen previously

69
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,600
to do that.

70
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:46,210
We're going to use the re-act rather.

71
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:51,620
So what we'll do is if there's any change between sign up in loggin we're just going to clear any previous

72
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,910
error messages in order to do that.

73
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:58,840
We're going to send our remove error action creator to our form.

74
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:08,140
So let's ignore it remove our from Dr. I-Slash store slash actions slash hairs.

75
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,220
And we're then going to pass in Ramoo.

76
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:17,340
We can only pass a prompt if we sent it in though as an app dispatched.

77
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,460
So let's make sure that we pass that in as well.

78
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,540
So that's Kassandra with error.

79
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:26,770
And inside of each of our all forms we pass and a cousin of Ruah will also call this room of error to

80
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:31,170
keep it consistent and we'll pass in that same prop to the other form as well.

81
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,890
So each of our forms have the ability to remove an error.

82
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,160
So back in our off form we're going to structure something else from props.

83
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:47,220
We're going to structure an object called history and we get this from the Riak router as this not perhaps

84
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:52,010
that history will also structure the remove error function.

85
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:57,450
What we'll do here is simply Before we return we'll call history lesson.

86
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:00,010
We're just do a listen for any change in the route.

87
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:05,600
And if there is a change in the route we're going to call her a move error function.

88
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,760
So let's say this let's go back to our application and if we try to sign in with something we'll see

89
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,450
invalid e-mail or password.

90
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,740
Notice the error messages on and on line the blurring there isn't sensitive information we want to make

91
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,500
sure that no one sees here.

92
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:20,960
So it looks like I have that right here.

93
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:21,970
That looks good.

94
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:26,910
Let's try to sign up and here was that nice error message that says user name or e-mail is ready taken.

95
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,560
And the next section we're going to start redirecting.

96
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:34,510
When we successfully log in we'll talk about how to display all those messages and keep working in our

97
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,170
application.
