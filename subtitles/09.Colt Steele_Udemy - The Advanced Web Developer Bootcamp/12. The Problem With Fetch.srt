1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,770
All right.

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,820
So if you can tell by now that fetch is cool.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,970
It's easy to use.

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,170
It's a lot cleaner shorter and more modern than having to write a bunch of essay charts all over the

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:10,970
place.

6
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,510
So what's not to love.

7
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,550
Well the main problem at the moment has to do with browser support.

8
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,940
So this is the most recent browser compatibility chart from the MDA docs.

9
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:27,230
And as you can see there's a lot of no support for some experimental features.

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,210
OK that seems fine but everything supports that looks like nothing does.

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,830
But this is a big problem.

12
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,670
Internet Explorer has no basic support for French at the moment.

13
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,980
So keep that in mind if you're using it.

14
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,210
It's also the reason that I'm going to show some libraries right after this video that can help you

15
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:45,990
get around that.

16
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,130
So wrap that up.

17
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:47,870
I like fetch.

18
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,010
You should like fetch.

19
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,420
But keep in mind it does not currently work in Internet Explorer which is a big bummer.

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,970
So now we're going to talk about Jay queery in x years.
