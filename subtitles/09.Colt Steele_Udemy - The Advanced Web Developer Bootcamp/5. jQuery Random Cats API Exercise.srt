1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,750
All right.

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:05,320
So we've seen enough of Ajax with Jay Querrey it's time for a quick exercise.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:11,790
So we're going to build super simple random cat photo generator whatever we want to call this.

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,100
There's a button click a button we get a random cat photo.

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,550
Oh that's a good one.

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,960
Click it again you get another random cat photo.

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,320
And again you can keep going up another QAD.

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,880
So you know I know we get a lot of cat lovers.

9
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,950
We did a dog photos app get to do cats as well.

10
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,220
I looked very hard.

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,530
Found an API.

12
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:36,690
I've included the link in the resources but the URL is random dumb cat slash meow.

13
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:42,600
I like it and all it gives you back and Jaison is a single key file.

14
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,020
And then the property is that you are no.

15
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,270
So I'm not going to give you any starter code.

16
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,650
No need to do this yourself.

17
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:53,900
Basically require a query set up just a simple button don't really style it.

18
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,890
I mean if you want to go ahead button and then an image and you're just going to update the source of

19
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:04,710
that image by making an API call and you might want to use one of the shorthand methods it's up to you

20
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:10,980
getting this you Aro taking the data back and then appending it to or actually not pending it but updating

21
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,780
the source of that image.

22
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,130
The only thing I'll mention if you're not familiar with a query you may want to use this method.

23
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:24,200
TR for attribute to update the source of the image.

24
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,150
That's all I'll say.

25
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:25,730
OK.

26
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:26,680
So give it a shot.

27
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,920
No need to make a code pen or fire up sublime or whatever you want to use for quite a query.

28
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,090
Get a button going and image going and then get some random Casco.

29
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:35,750
All right.

30
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,150
I have a solution in just a moment.
