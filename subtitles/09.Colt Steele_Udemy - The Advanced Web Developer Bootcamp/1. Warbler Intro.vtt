Write Welcome to the section on warbler.

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.710
And over the next couple screencast we're going to be building a Twitter clone.

3
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.130
And here's the functionality that we have so far.

4
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.540
So I can log in a log in with my username and password has an account that I made before.

5
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.860
And here we have a nice little Twitter feed I can make any message if like that says Hello everyone

6
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:22.780
and I'll go at that message.

7
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.520
See that pop up right here.

8
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.150
And notice that I can only delete the messages that I've created so I'll delete this one.

9
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.300
And there it is.

10
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.790
If I decide to log out I can also try to log in.

11
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.620
And we have a little bit of validation.

12
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.790
So in case there is an invalid e-mail or password We'll have that no problem.

13
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.130
I can also sign up like again saw sign up with some new information with another password and another

14
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.480
username and let's get the image you are at this time.

15
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.290
And here we have the good old Twitter egg.

16
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.470
So if I'd like it I can make any message here that says hello.

17
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.240
Spell that right everyone.

18
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.150
Let's do this one more time and we can see right here at the bottom.

19
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.320
That's what I have.

20
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.480
So what's actually happening here.

21
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.220
Under the Hood is that I have two separate servers running.

22
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.450
I'm running this on a local host 3000 and we're actually going to deploy this application a bit later.

23
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.160
But what I want to show you is that I have a application running which is a create react up and I also

24
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.500
have an entire node back end which is power and the authentication token authorization and so on.

25
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.150
So what we're going to do in these first couple of sessions is strictly focused on the Bakken.

26
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.540
We're going to imagine that we're a bunch of back end developers and we have to build the API that allows

27
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.520
for this application to be created.

28
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.230
And once we build the API and test it out a bit in the terminal we're then going to go back to the front

29
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.240
end and add all of the react and redux.

30
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.470
And we had better code necessary to build this application.

31
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.230
There isn't a ton of functionality right now but the structure that we're going to build really will

32
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.940
allow you to add a lot of functionality on top of it in a scalable fashion.

33
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.340
So let's get started with a back end for warbler.
