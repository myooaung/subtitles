1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,750
So we left off and I mean just by adding a route to slash which would render our home page component.

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,530
So let's first include that main component inside of our objects.

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,240
So let's import mean does mean inside of our apparatus.

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,220
And inside of the class of onboarding What's that mean component.

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:23,160
This will allow for all my house to be configured as well inside of the main component.

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,120
We saw that we brought in home page but we actually don't have this component yet.

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,220
Let's go to that.

8
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:33,330
So inside the components who's going to could do file called Page dodginess.

9
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,260
This is going to be a very simple component.

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,740
It's acting essentially as a landing page.

11
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,750
It's going to display the message list which we're not going to get yet.

12
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:45,000
We're just a standard landing page that as the user to sign up.

13
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:49,000
So we're going to import re-act from Riak this will be another Segal's functional component so we don't

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,770
need a structure component.

15
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:54,510
We'll also import link from re-act Rotterdam.

16
00:00:54,730 --> 00:01:00,730
We're then getting a function called home page and this is a seamless functional component.

17
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,030
We'll pass some props later but for now all we're going to do is return to make sure we wrap this in

18
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,200
parentheses.

19
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,370
What we're doing a little bit of GSX.

20
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:13,090
So let's start with the class name of home hero which will style and a little bit.

21
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,370
So I going to do it now but that's OK.

22
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,870
We're making each one says what's happening.

23
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:25,950
Well then we can each four as new to warbler and then a little call to action with a link component

24
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,510
to slash Messiah.

25
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,540
We don't have any of these routes built yet.

26
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:36,300
We're just adding a little bit of each team now to get us to those routes which will add a little bit.

27
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,230
Give us a class name.

28
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,070
Beauty and beauty and primary pre-standard bootstrap.

29
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:44,890
Let's just make sure we spot primary correctly and hear what the cause of that wing component.

30
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:52,190
And it's I will just add the text Sign-Up here would say this and take a look in the browser and what

31
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:59,050
we have so far is going to tell us export default imported as home page was not found in component's

32
00:01:59,050 --> 00:01:59,800
home page.

33
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,420
Well we're going to make sure we export that default home page.

34
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,730
Pretty common mistake I'll make.

35
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,120
Take a look.

36
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,100
Alan untied is invalid expected a string but not an object.

37
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,920
Check the method of AB.

38
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,290
So what's happening here.

39
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:23,210
Well this is happening because we accidentally didn't raft with router and include mean you ought make

40
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:29,090
sure that with router includes everything connect as well as your component.

41
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:36,620
So if we take a look now we should see what's happening in order and are about now we need to solve

42
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:37,380
it.

43
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:43,590
So let's go back to our index that's Yesus and let's make sure that we style this correctly using command

44
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,840
to jump to files on a different machine or setting that might be different.

45
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:52,570
But I'm a man and those text editors will allow you to do the certain type of work the next CEO says

46
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:57,680
Let's start dialing this home page component after that.

47
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:04,830
Onboarding if Gnab are let's add some rules for our home hero let's dial this home here so I'll give

48
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,700
anything a classic home hero.

49
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:14,500
Some with and some I will get this with a 100 you part with I'll give it a high of 100.

50
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:21,410
I will make sure I completely covers the entire page will get the position of absolute and start positioning

51
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,900
it in the top left.

52
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:31,780
So at the top of zero left of zero we also want to make sure we get the say display flaks a line items

53
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:41,660
of center and justify justified content center so he can center horizontally and vertically.

54
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,630
We also want to make sure that we get the background image.

55
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,260
So what are we going to use.

56
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:53,330
How that's going to be a u r l and here we'll go to slash images slash sign it.

57
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,000
So I sign up home.

58
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:03,200
So I signed out on GBG that should give us our initial image and it's completely covering it.

59
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,400
But that's not looking too good yet.

60
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:10,890
Well we need to make sure that we give it is the index of negative one that we love for our NAV bar

61
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,570
to post on top of it.

62
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:18,220
One to make sure we still see our neighbor Meskin center a little bit more Missoulian that it takes

63
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,090
a lot of center for any text inside of there.

64
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,580
We'll get this a little bit of breathing room so we'll give it one more padding.

65
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,470
We want to also make sure that we have a background position.

66
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,440
Of center center center.

67
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:35,780
So that image is completely centered in the middle.

68
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:41,490
We also want to make sure that we get as a background size as well of cover to completely cover that

69
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,110
page.

70
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,610
So it's getting a little bit better.

71
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:51,000
But all of our text here is displayed horizontally as a row and so we want to make sure we change our

72
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,690
direction to how not as a row.

73
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:59,310
And now everything centering vertically now looks good.

74
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,310
It's a lot of as we wrote so take a look in the previous sections on fluxbox and I'll add some notes

75
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:08,940
on background positions and so on to help out that.

76
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,680
So we got this nice little page right here.

77
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:15,640
I think we're ready to sign of users but there's a little bit more styling that I want to add.

78
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,180
Give us the color of white.

79
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:22,860
So it pops a little bit more and that's a little bit too white.

80
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:26,250
So let's get fancy here and add a little bit of texture.

81
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:32,180
So all we really want to do here is just add a little bit of blur so it gives 0 0 pixels and then we'll

82
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:37,020
give it a color for that texture because look at a brownish color.

83
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,560
Make sure we get that semi-colon.

84
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:43,350
So if compiling successfully so we were freshest and that works better.

85
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:46,680
So anything that takes time to parse out a little bit touch on was a really nice way to get that to

86
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,370
happen.

87
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,400
So the next action will start putting more together.

88
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,690
Start signing up and logging in users and building those components that.
