00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.280
So he got some messages being displayed but was try to style this a little bit more and do a lot of

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.960
this work with bootstrap.

3
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:12.320
So instead of just returning a message list we're going to return a little bit of GSX or return a div

4
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:19.940
with a class name of Roll Call SMOP and it's out of here we'll make another div with the class of offset

5
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.470
one and call him of 10 inside here.

6
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.140
Let's make an ordered list with the class name

7
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.740
list group that's for bootstrap and our own idea of messages.

8
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.300
That's all right our own C S S The style is a bit more to make sure we close that well.

9
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:48.200
And inside of this you go out our message list let's see let's take a look at the browser and it's looking

10
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.570
a little bit better.

11
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.760
The messages are just lying in line.

12
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.950
So now it's our turn to add a little bit more styling in our index that us.

13
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.230
So let's add a little bit of styling for our messages.

14
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.670
So we're going to do is use that idea of messages.

15
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.810
How much had it any idea messages where there's any list of item inside.

16
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.170
I mean I actually don't have the style yet.

17
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.920
We'll add that into our list items in a second but we'll get this a display a flex we'll get those and

18
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:27.530
a line items of Flexcar and all of that padding for some breathing room or we will get to 7 pixels 20

19
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:28.950
pixels 12 pixels.

20
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.370
Can tweak this if you want to look a little bit different.

21
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.230
So we're going to write another selector where if there's an idea of a message that does not have the

22
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:44.110
class of no hover we're going to find all of the elements with a class of list group item inside and

23
00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.210
target their hover C and when that happens we're going to have a background color.

24
00:01:49.270 --> 00:02:00.180
It's going to be that similar grayish color that we had before which was 60 C-f 0 minutes in color that

25
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.870
we saw before.

26
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.470
So let's see this if is were first page not much is really being changed here because we have to add

27
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.560
that list group item class.

28
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.890
So we're going to do that inside of our message item.

29
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.590
So inside of our message item we don't really have any styling around any of these items.

30
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.640
And we want to make sure that each message item is actually a list item inside of those divs.

31
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.490
And here we'll get this a class name of list group item which is bootstrap and of styling that we've

32
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:29.500
done as well.

33
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.630
Let's make sure that the item is wrapping everything with the exception of the enclosing div.

34
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:35.500
Let's see if this.

35
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.370
And now it looks a whole lot better.

36
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:46.580
Now there's a little bit more that we'll have to fix and we'll do this in a leader video.

37
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.910
This should be a good start.

38
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.370
When we start adding another component call the user side instead of a message time on we're going to

39
00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:00.540
display a little bit of information about the current user so let's go make a component called user

40
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:01.630
aside.

41
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.010
And this is not a very small component.

42
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.840
Second going to have any say so we're just going to pass in user aside and we'll pass and it will create

43
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.960
a file called user aside inside of our components folder

44
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.460
so inside of our message timeline we're going to display that user site with some props out of the profile

45
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:30.170
image you are all from Propst profile image you are in a username a process don't username and you could

46
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.720
disrupt your process if you want it above.

47
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:32.980
It'll do the same thing.

48
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.330
So we want to make sure in our message timeline we're passing down these props correctly.

49
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.760
So what component vendors message time line that is our home page.

50
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.220
We want to make sure we're passing in some information to this message time line and that's going to

51
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.930
come from the current user.

52
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.490
So I'll pass on a product called profile image you are out and that's going to be the current users

53
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:57.940
property but only current user will get that through user profile image.

54
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:07.270
We also want make sure it has a proper user name which is current user dot user type user name.

55
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.510
Our message timeline now has the Propst that is passing down to the user side.

56
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.430
This user is going to be a little picture of the user who's logged in and that's it.

57
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:24.670
So back in our user aside let's go make this component so let's import react from react.

58
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.580
It's going to be a state with a functional component.

59
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.520
We're also going to import a default profile image to make sure we spell that correctly.

60
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.190
From that our flash images slushed evolved Dasch profile dash image.

61
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:46.890
Doug GBG And once again we're simply going to make a component called Gezer aside and here will the

62
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.620
structure some of the props that we get my profile image you are all end user name

63
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.310
will then return a little bit of GSX

64
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.570
inside of this aside we'll give it a class name with a little bit of bootstrap styling.

65
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:13.090
We'll give that a call Esam to also make sure that inside of this aside we have a div with the class

66
00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.040
name of panel panels fault.

67
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.420
It's just a little bit of bootstrap style and gear and inside of here we want to make sure that we have

68
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:26.710
a panel body and inside of the panel body looks at our image and the S R C is going to be either the

69
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:32.320
profile image that we're getting from prop's or if it doesn't exist the default profile image that we

70
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:38.190
have is an image in our images folder and we also attribute will be to user name.

71
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.410
Let's also give this a class name from Bootstrap of EMG dash thumbnail

72
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.380
let's can see this and take a look what we get.

73
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.280
Users that is not defined.

74
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.800
So we got to make sure that we're importing our user aside in the message timeline.

75
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.820
So let's get that from Flash users at.

76
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.670
Now it looks like x4 de-evolved was not found.

77
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.760
So we got to start making this mistake.

78
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.440
I guess I'm making this mistake and we're going to take out that user.

79
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:12.110
We're going to export the default user aside and we have a huge picture of your we can see that it's

80
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.960
actually pushing the items onto the next line.

81
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.070
So let's go set a with a hide on this specific image.

82
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.700
We didn't see s s or just specified is an attribute on that image.

83
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.720
So out of with 200 on a height 200.

84
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.650
And when we refresh the page it looks great.

85
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:29.630
That looks a lot better.

86
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:36.420
So a little bit more styling to go but we want to focus on next is the ability to add messages and to

87
00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.840
delete messages that are only belonging to current users.
