00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:06.020
Welcome back in this section we're going to use D-3 to manipulate elements and.

2
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.340
We'll get to fancy data visualisations eventually.

3
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.170
But first it's important to understand the D-3 approached common tasks.

4
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.420
You can do in the know what javascript or Jake.

5
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.730
And this video will learn how to select elements non-dom using D-3 that select and D-3 that select all

6
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:30.390
will set attributes in our text and style properties on D-3 selections and we'll learn how to get attribute

7
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.800
and property values on the selections.

8
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.400
We'll also see how to change the three methods together to make more complex changes to the dome in

9
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.410
the next video.

10
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.850
We'll explore the selection methods a bit further by pasand callback functions and do them to set properties

11
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.760
and attributes dynamically.

12
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.650
After that we'll add a ventless news using the method and use that event to access the event objects

13
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.880
inside of an event listener.

14
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.850
Finally we'll see how to add and removes DOM elements with D-3.

15
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.310
So let's jump into it to begin using the three.

16
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.630
All you need to do is load it at the bottom of your HVM else using the script tag.

17
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.300
I've already made a simple HDMI out page with a few different elements and loaded D-3 at the bottom.

18
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.840
You can see the code at this link and a live version of the HD M-L at this one.

19
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.910
If you hop into the chrome console you can verify that D-3 loaded correctly by typing D-3 and pressing

20
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:24.910
enter.

21
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.820
If you see the D-3 object you're good to go.

22
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:34.890
It's important to note that what we use in D-3 version for throughout these sections Lets start by using

23
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:41.830
D-3 to select elements in the DOM for this D-3 provides us with two methods D-3 that select when we

24
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.520
want to select a single element in D-3 does select all.

25
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:53.040
When we want to select multiple elements both of these methods except a valid CSSA selector but to use

26
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.190
these methods to select a couple of things in the dark.

27
00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.210
First let them deal with an idea page title.

28
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.910
I can do something similar to grab all the allies in both cases.

29
00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.090
D-3 returns to us a selection object.

30
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.920
This object has two internal properties called groups and parents the leading underscores are meant

31
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.550
to indicate that you should not be accessing these properties directly.

32
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.970
So how do you access the elements in the selection.

33
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.850
Well if you want to access all of the allies you've selected just as raw HVM elements you should use

34
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.340
the nodes method on the selection.

35
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.160
This method returns an array of matching elements.

36
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.670
If you just want the first element you can also use the node method

37
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.290
however most of the time when you use the three you don't want to access the elements directly.

38
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.050
You probably want to interact with them via the D-3 selection object.

39
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:55.080
For example if we wanted to change the background color of the H-1 we use the style method on the D-3

40
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.810
selection to set a new color.

41
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.120
Notice that the style method again returns a D-3 selection to us.

42
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.620
This pattern of returning a selection allows us to change many methods to the other so that we can update

43
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.000
many properties of our selection without having to receive the element over and over.

44
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.800
Let's take a look at a few more methods.

45
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:21.400
After updating some styles I'll add a class and set the text inside of the 20 D-3 is cool.

46
00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.720
The style method let to set any CSSA style property.

47
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.380
Similarly the adder method to set other attributes on the selected elements.

48
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.910
The text method lets us set the entire text of our selection.

49
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.460
There is an h t m l method that lets us set inner HD amount to hear used three methods to set values

50
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:42.460
on our elements.

51
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.260
But we can also use them to get values whenever you don't pass in an argument to determine the new value.

52
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.960
These methods will work as getters for example if we call text on our page title selection.

53
00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.400
We'll get the inner text.

54
00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:04.290
If we call stylin passengers the name of a property will get the corresponding value for that property.

55
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:10.650
Finally notice that we use the outer method to set a class but when we're working with classes specifically

56
00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.660
D-3 provides us with a different method called class.

57
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:21.480
Class act takes in a space separated list of class names that we want to set and a value if that value

58
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.320
is truthy.

59
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.600
Those classes will be set on the selection.

60
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.580
Otherwise they'll be removed.

61
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.570
Here's our code look using the class method instead.

62
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:31.650
Cool.

63
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.020
This covers the basics of working with selections D-3 in the next video.

64
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.680
We'll learn about how to set attributes and properties using callback functions rather than hardcoded

65
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.450
values like we've done here.

66
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:43.260
I'll see if there.
