00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,470
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:06,600
Over the course of the next few videos we're going to build this marketing page for mountain travel

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,350
together.

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:14,210
In this video we'll build everything you see when the page loads the nav bar the background and this

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,820
text in the middle of the page.

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,170
Let's take a look at the code we're working with.

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:27,000
I've gotten assets folder with a blank stylesheet along with five pictures of mountains my HVM file

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,100
is pretty minimal so far.

9
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:35,170
I've got some Medhat tags and I'm loading a couple of months but the body is empty.

10
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,440
Let's start by building out the headers in my HVM owl.

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,030
I'll create a header element and give it to children and H-2 and NF

12
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:52,110
inside of the H-2 I'll put in a tag with the name of the site.

13
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:52,950
Mountain travel

14
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,870
inside the nav I'll add three more 8 x 1 for tours.

15
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:09,990
One for about and one for contact.

16
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:16,160
Since these links don't actually go anywhere I'll set all of their Tref attributes equal to the hash

17
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:24,140
tag which will just send the user back to the top of the page so far this page is pretty Doleac.

18
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:33,430
Let's hop into the CSSA and start styling first I'll set some general styles to avoid any consistencies

19
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:34,510
across browsers.

20
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:42,090
I'll clear out all margins and paddings and I'll set the box size of every element to be border box

21
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,490
next on the HVM Eltang.

22
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:56,130
I'll style the font by setting values for the font property and the color property.

23
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:02,470
After that how style the nav and the atax for my nav I don't want to see bullet points.

24
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:09,820
So I'll set the list style to none and for the atax rather than the default browser behavior.

25
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,530
This scene underlines I'll set the text decoration to none but I'll trigger a different opacity when

26
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,760
you hover over a link.

27
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,680
Now let's get into style specific to the header

28
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,180
for the header itself.

29
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,330
I'll use fluxbox

30
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:47,570
justify the content to use space between the line items in the center.

31
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,110
I'll also give the headers some padding

32
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,140
next.

33
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,680
I'll use the Google quicksand font for the H-2

34
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,140
for the Navajo side of the header.

35
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,260
I'll again set the display to fluxbox and nudge it over to the right a bit

36
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,440
also give the list items inside of them have some margin

37
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,130
that's looking better.

38
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:30,040
Before moving on from the header though let me quickly add the CSSA transition to have it fade in.

39
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:34,310
For this I'll set a 1 second animation on the header using an animation.

40
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:42,310
I'll call fade in the fine fade and using a keyframe which specifies that when the animation is finished

41
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:47,180
the opacity should be one to trigger the fade.

42
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:54,540
This also means I need to set the initial opacity on the header to zero save and refresh.

43
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,070
OK great.

44
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,410
This seems to be working next.

45
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,670
Let's add a section to hold the background image and title text.

46
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:09,470
When the page loads I'll put everything inside a section with a class of hero

47
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,160
inside of this section.

48
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:21,160
I'll create a div with a class and background image also passing the you are l to the background image

49
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:31,690
as a style attribute I'll talk more about why I'm doing things this way in the next video.

50
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,830
After that I'll create a second div for the hero content

51
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,470
inside of it.

52
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:44,720
I'm an H-1 for my title and H-3 for my subtitle

53
00:04:52,120 --> 00:05:02,570
and an ATAC with the class of Beati N or the contact us button.

54
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,650
This seems to be loading.

55
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:04,940
So let's hop back into this.

56
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:09,970
SS Now I'll need a few more general styles.

57
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,480
First I'll add some styling to buttons.

58
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:18,830
I'll give them a border radius make their text uppercase bold and centered

59
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,800
had a background color

60
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,340
and give them full opacity.

61
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,410
While I'm here I'll also use fluxbox for every section.

62
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:54,230
I'll use a column layout on line items to the center and give every section some padding to ensure that

63
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:59,080
the content we've written so far will take up the full display height on page load or need to use some

64
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:02,110
positioning for my hero class.

65
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,740
I'll set it to position relative

66
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:10,100
center of the content using justified content in text align

67
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,490
and set a min height of 100 th

68
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,440
for the background image.

69
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,270
I can then use absolute positioning

70
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:34,290
and set my top and left values to be zero which will place this div at the upper left corner of the

71
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:38,270
euro section I'll set the width and height to 100 percent

72
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:43,440
the background size to cover

73
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:52,890
and I'll make sure the image is behind any other elements by setting z index to negative 1.

74
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:58,500
Lastly I'll also give it a background color based on the image content so that you won't see a white

75
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,620
flicker before the image loads.

76
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:05,050
Next I'll style the content inside of the section

77
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:14,180
I'll set font and margin bottom properties for both the one and three elements.

78
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,270
Both of these will use the open Sans font.

79
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:47,320
I'll also set some styling on my button.

80
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:50,790
This is close but now the header is getting in the way.

81
00:07:55,250 --> 00:08:03,200
To fix this I'll also give the header absolute positioning and give it a width of 100 percent.

82
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,000
Almost there.

83
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:10,870
Before we add the second animation let's fix our font colors.

84
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:13,680
I'd like to use a white font for all tags.

85
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,090
As well as all text inside of the header

86
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,810
and all text inside of the hero.

87
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,270
Finally let's add an animation for the hero area.

88
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:32,190
I'll start by giving this area an opacity of zero

89
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:40,890
I'll also push you down 100 pixels.

90
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:47,960
Then after one second I'll give it a 1 second animation called slides 8.

91
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,660
Once again I'll use keyframes to transition the opacity to one and the top margin to zero.

92
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:08,720
Now when I refresh the page the nav fades and and then the content of the hero area fades in and slides

93
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,540
up.

94
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,160
OK this is a good place to pause in the next video.

95
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,830
We'll tackle a couple more sections on this page.
