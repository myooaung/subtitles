1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:00,830
All right.

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,990
So we saw how to write ts s transitions we saw the syntax.

3
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:09,820
The four main properties as well as the shorthand version we haven't really discussed performance.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,540
There's actually two things you haven't discussed.

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,370
What are the properties that can be transitioned.

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,740
Are there things that cannot be transitioned.

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:17,820
Yes.

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,250
And then also what should be transitioned and what I mean there is you know what are the things that

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,700
are the fastest the most performant to transition and what things are a nuisance can cause performance

10
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,970
issues if you're transitioning them.

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,960
So we're going to answer those two questions in this very quick video.

12
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,560
So the first thing what can be transitioned.

13
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,050
Here's the official list pretty long.

14
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:45,780
So there's a bunch of things on here some of which we've already worked with like background color transform

15
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:50,900
we've seen things like border radius Forder with all these things that we've seen before.

16
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,080
So as you can see there's quite a large list of properties.

17
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:59,020
These are the things that can be transitioned but it's not a complete list of all CSSA properties.

18
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,530
So there are things that cannot be transitioned at all.

19
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:07,950
But then there's this second question which is what are the things that make sense to transition what

20
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,210
will not affect your Web site performance very much to transition.

21
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,600
And that list is much much shorter.

22
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,550
It's actually just four key properties.

23
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,620
Now again this is not a hard rule.

24
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:25,470
There are certain situations when you'll need to do things like background color or perhaps something

25
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:30,030
that's you know on this list that doesn't make it into these four properties but these four are kind

26
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:36,240
of a standard set of properties that are recommended to animate or transition and that you should try

27
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,140
to stick to these.

28
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,970
If you're concerned about performance.

29
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:45,960
So if you're doing your own personal project a web page for yourself or maybe a demonstration page or

30
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,220
some sort of art project whatever it is you know feel free to use any of these.

31
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,720
But if you work at a company or you're starting a big app and you're concerned about the performance

32
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:01,260
of your animations perhaps you'll have 10 20 30 100 different things on the page that could be transitioning

33
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,300
at any given time.

34
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:08,220
Or you're worried about mobile performance how these animations perform on iOS or Android phones and

35
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,090
the web browsers.

36
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,170
Then you should try to stick to these four.

37
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,110
And these four don't just come out of nowhere.

38
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,720
There's actually a reason for them.

39
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:18,740
One there are a bunch of articles talking about them which I'll show you to.

40
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,930
I've talked to a couple different people who work at different companies.

41
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:28,110
I want them to get a feel for what their internal rules were about using transitions and what the animator

42
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:35,400
will properties where and from both companies to reasonably large 100 plus person San Francisco startups.

43
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,160
They said the exact same for properties transform.

44
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,750
So translate scale and rotate as well as opacity.

45
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,150
So where is this coming from.

46
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:49,860
Well underlying all of this here's a great article that kind of details it including the resources it's

47
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:56,460
from a Web site called Timofei rocks but it actually talks about why these four properties can be animated

48
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:03,000
cheaply or easily and why all those other properties for a couple different reasons are slower or less

49
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:08,380
performant and it has to do with how a browser actually renders a web page.

50
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,410
So this could be a much longer video.

51
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:13,230
This could be an entire course actually at my previous job.

52
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:18,690
We created a four or five hour course just about browser rendering and performance.

53
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:22,000
So this is going to be a real really quick crash course in it.

54
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:26,680
But basically there's a couple of different stages that go into the rendering of any web page.

55
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:32,730
So there's things like calculating the styles that apply to elements generating the position for where

56
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:33,960
certain things should be.

57
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,810
So that includes things like with higher margin left top.

58
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:42,180
Then we move on and there's this paint set up stage you don't need to worry about that.

59
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,920
But then the paint actually happens this is when pixels are actually filled out or colored in for each

60
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:47,650
element.

61
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:52,600
So that's things like background border radius bhakt shadow which makes sense.

62
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:59,000
And then finally there's what's called composite layers and that's things like transform and opacity.

63
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,720
So these four.

64
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,020
So notice that those come at the very very end.

65
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:07,620
So for those to change it doesn't require much work.

66
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,110
It doesn't have to go through this entire process again.

67
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:16,470
But if you are trying to animate something like let's say with or margin then what is going to happen

68
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,140
is what's kind of called a waterfall.

69
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,220
Basically it requires more work.

70
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:26,520
The entire process starts over here in the lay out changing means that things have to be repainted and

71
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,300
so on.

72
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,730
So it kind of creates this cascade effect.

73
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,910
So what you want to do if at all possible.

74
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:37,140
And again this is only if you're really concerned about performance is stick to transform and opacity.

75
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,890
And with those properties you can actually achieve a lot.

76
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:46,260
Most of the animations that you see on popular large web sites they have tons of animations going on

77
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:53,130
you know small little interactive effects but they're usually done with just transform scale transform

78
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,130
translate transform rotate and opacity.

79
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,850
So you can do a lot with those.

80
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,440
OK.

81
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,590
So that kind of wraps it up I recommend you check out this article if you want to know more about how

82
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,600
the render process works in your browser.

83
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:10,270
If you want to go into more detail about things like lay out or paint in the different stages.

84
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,920
But for now just keep that in mind.

85
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:17,780
It's definitely not a hard rule but it's just worth knowing that it's out there and that there's a reason

86
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:22,820
that these four properties are in general recommended across the web development community for your

87
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,550
animations.

88
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,240
All righty.

89
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,870
I think that's a pretty good place to stop.

90
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,710
To wrap up our discussion on C as.
