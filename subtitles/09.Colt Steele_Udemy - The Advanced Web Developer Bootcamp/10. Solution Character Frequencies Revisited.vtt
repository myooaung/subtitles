00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:08.310
Hello again I hope you were able to successfully refactor your character count app to use SPG in this

2
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:08.900
video.

3
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.580
I'll walk you through some potential solutions.

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.190
First a create a solution that doesn't involve text elements then other or some text elements into the

5
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:17.950
mix.

6
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:26.320
Before we get into the javascript Lets first make some small tweaks to the HMO and see SS in my HMO.

7
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.500
I'll need to change the element with an idea of letters from a div to an SVGA element.

8
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.360
I'll throw in the version based profile in SML namespace attributes but otherwise won't do much to the

9
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.410
SPG.

10
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.230
Next I can make some slight modifications to the CSSA file for one.

11
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:50.090
I'll set the SPG with my javascript so I can remove this with the property next.

12
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:56.680
Since the elements with a class of letter will now be SVGA rectangles I can remove most of these properties.

13
00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.750
The only thing I care about is the color which should now be the value of the cell property not the

14
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.790
background color property.

15
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:09.680
I'll also update the styling for my new class since I won't use text labels to start.

16
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.530
For now I'll indicate a character is new just by updating the Thill on Iraq element cool.

17
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.920
Now let's hop into the app J.S. first of the site on a width and height.

18
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.960
I'll also have some bar padding now that I have a within height.

19
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.960
Let me set these attributes on the SPG and store the selection in a variable next.

20
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.370
Let's hop into the eventless nerve for the form submission.

21
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.950
This shouldn't look that different from before.

22
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.730
One thing I'll do differently though is store the result of my get frequency's function call inside

23
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.250
of a variable.

24
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.220
That way I can use the same pattern we saw in the D-3 and SVGA video to calculate the bar with.

25
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.360
Based on the number of rectangles I'm trying to draw along with the bar padding.

26
00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:04.360
Also since I've already stored my D-3 SPG selection as a variable I can replace my D-3 select call with

27
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.490
that variable OK great.

28
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.340
We're almost done with the basic functionality.

29
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.060
We don't need to change the exit selection for the enter selection.

30
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.360
We just need to change what we're appending from a div to erect element.

31
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.490
Now all that's left is to change what we do with the merged selection.

32
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.200
Since I'm not working with divs anymore some of the attributes I want to update will be different.

33
00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.410
Let me start with the with this attribute.

34
00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.210
I want to keep but its value should now be equal to the bar which I calculated above.

35
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.200
I also still need a height attribute.

36
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:48.150
I'll just leave this as is though I'll remove the unitive pixels setting if it's tight could be problematic

37
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.410
if we enter a string which has a really high frequency count for a particular character.

38
00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.090
But given what we know so far about D-3 I don't think it's worth trying to account for this potential

39
00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.600
issue.

40
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.930
Setting enter text on a rectangle doesn't make sense so we can remove these lines.

41
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.950
We can also remove the line height in the margin right.

42
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.280
Instead we'll need to set x and y attributes on our rectangles.

43
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:17.230
The value for our X attribute should look the same as in the D-3 and SPG that each x coordinate should

44
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.520
be offset by another multiple of the bar with plus the bar padding.

45
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.950
As for the y coordinate it should just equal the SPG height minus the height of the bar.

46
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:33.440
In other words it should equal the SPG height minus the dot count times 20.

47
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.240
Let's save everything and refresh the page when I enter a phrase.

48
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:44.350
I see the bars showing up when I enter another phrase the bards get updated.

49
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.700
Now let's briefly tackle the bonus.

50
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.340
There are several ways to do this but it's a little tricky because for each data point you'll now need

51
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.520
a couple of things for the user to see a rectangle and the next element will cover this pattern more

52
00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.550
in the next section.

53
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.250
But for now what I'm going to do is append a group element for each data point.

54
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.620
Now inside of this group I want to append a text element and a record element to do this.

55
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:16.290
Also store the enter selection in a variable which all call letter enter rather than merging right away.

56
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:21.070
Let me first append twice for each element in the enter selection.

57
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.160
I'll also need to merge selections one for rectangles and one for text elements.

58
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.040
Let's do rectangles first since we basically already written this code.

59
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:35.350
The only thing I need to do is select each rectangle inside of each group in the merged selection before

60
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.110
updating attributes that are specific to the rectangle.

61
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.930
Next I'll use a similar pattern for the text elements.

62
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.390
Once I've selected these elements I'll set the x coordinate to be the midpoint of each bar and the y

63
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:55.480
coordinate to be a little higher than the top of the bar.

64
00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.460
I'll also set the inner text cool.

65
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.500
The last thing I'll do is update some of the styles these fill properties I only want to be set on the

66
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.910
rectangle not the entire group for the text.

67
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.980
I'll do something similar to what we did before by making new characters a bit larger.

68
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:22.430
Let's take a look here's one phrase here's another suite.

69
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.460
It looks like this is working.

70
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.590
I hope this video was helpful.

71
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:33.700
Again if the bonus was too challenging Don't worry we'll see this pattern again in the next section.

72
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.790
When you're ready let's learn about some more intermediate D-3.

73
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.720
I'll see you in the next video.
