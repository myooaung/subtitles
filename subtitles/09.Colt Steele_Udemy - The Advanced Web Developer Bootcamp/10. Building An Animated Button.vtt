00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.050
All right.

2
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.640
So we've seen a couple of different CSSA Suder selectors.

3
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.880
Now we're going to put them to use.

4
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.610
We're going to build a simple but hopefully meaningful demo.

5
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.730
It's going to be a button just a single button but it takes a couple of these pseudo classes and builds

6
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.230
upon them.

7
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.430
So here's what it looks like.

8
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.540
Has sort of a 3D effect.

9
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.600
And as I hover over this button it does nothing by the way so it's purely visual clicking it doesn't

10
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.880
do anything as far as functionality but I hover.

11
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.280
It looks like it depresses a bit.

12
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.240
And then I click and it depresses all the way.

13
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:39.310
So there's three states there's the intermediate state and then there's the click which is actually

14
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.710
the active state.

15
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.780
And then there's the Baystate So

16
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.140
so the way that this will work if you'd like to follow along and I have a starter code code pen has

17
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.910
nothing in it really just the markup.

18
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.040
So a font that I'm going to use the H-1 and the button and then everything else we do will happen on

19
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.130
the CSSA side.

20
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.620
If you don't want to follow along you don't need to.

21
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.330
You can just see the solution.

22
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:10.170
You can basically just click the link change the view to Ed. view and you'll see the code the way I'll

23
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.600
structure this is that I'll start off with the most important most relevant functionality.

24
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.240
The button the pseudo selectors the pseudo classes and then I'll save the styling of the background

25
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.860
and the H-1 here for the very end.

26
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.370
So if you don't care about that stuff you can skip it if you just want to see the button.

27
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.800
I'm going to start with that.

28
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.990
So without further ado let's do that.

29
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.770
The button has a class of PTEN.

30
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:39.420
So I'll work with that dot between and the first thing that we want to do is just remove some of the

31
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.540
base styles.

32
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.630
So this button is pretty ugly.

33
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.580
If you notice.

34
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.340
So if I click on it I get that outline.

35
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.260
This one does not have that.

36
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.940
I mean get rid of that.

37
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.610
It's very ugly to have that outline it's the default in most browsers so we'll say outline nothing.

38
00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.800
Say it again and it's got.

39
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:02.250
All right.

40
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:11.320
Next I'm going to get rid of a border border none and I'm going to change the cursor to pointer.

41
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:18.660
So what that will do is as I hover over the button I get that pointer looking thing I know you call

42
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.350
that the cursor.

43
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.510
Yes.

44
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:29.040
Not a big deal but just a small thing then we're now going to move on to display in position so display

45
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.470
I'm going to set to block and position.

46
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.970
I'm going to set to relative and that part's important position because the way that we actually achieve

47
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:46.840
this effect there's a box shadow underneath here at the Baystate And if you pay attention to the bottom

48
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.720
edge it never changes.

49
00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:56.510
It's always the same as far as this edge here but the box shadow shrinks as I hover and along with that

50
00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:03.230
the button itself the lighter color shifts downwards to make it look like we're depressing it a bit

51
00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.630
what's actually happening is that the box shadow shrinks a bit and then the button itself moves downwards

52
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:10.540
a couple of pixels.

53
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.890
And then when I click it switches over to the active state where the box shadow is gone and the red

54
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.630
the button moves down a couple more pixels to take up that same space down here.

55
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:22.410
So one more time.

56
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.510
Dark Shadow shrinks a bit.

57
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.610
I hover and then goes away completely.

58
00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.350
So we need position to be relative in order to move the button down a couple of pixels.

59
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.460
So you'll see what I'm talking about just a little bit.

60
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.850
Once we get to those pseudo selectors.

61
00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.780
OK.

62
00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.350
So the next thing that we'll do is start getting into some of the colors here.

63
00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.940
So we have the background color of the button which I have a hexadecimal.

64
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.400
I don't have this memorized.

65
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.660
It's FCD to 6.

66
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.990
It gives us that orange color perfect.

67
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.240
Then we have font size which I have 16 pixels.

68
00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.780
Then after that we have the font weight which have 300 pixels.

69
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.580
We don't actually have the font that I used which I think is a railway Ledo.

70
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.570
I don't have that set up just yet.

71
00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.380
We'll get to that at the end.

72
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.280
All right so we have that.

73
00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.280
Next up change the font color to be white.

74
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.020
And there we go.

75
00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.740
All right.

76
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.730
Just sort of getting there.

77
00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:37.060
Next we have two that aren't crucial but I like text transform what it will do is make everything uppercase

78
00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.460
which is how this button works.

79
00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:45.520
And yes we could just change the markup to be uppercase but I like to get this way to text transform

80
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:52.260
uppercase added a little bit of spacing between the letters just two pixels spread them out a bit it

81
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.340
now we get on to sort of the box model stuff the padding and margin.

82
00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.970
So padding is going to be 25 pixels

83
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:06.610
and 80 pixels.

84
00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.840
So this is just going to make the button bigger.

85
00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.020
So we're getting there it's the right size.

86
00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:17.550
Now we need to work on the borders here and we also are going to want to center the button.

87
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.120
So a minor thing but we'll do margin's zero audio.

88
00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.840
There we go.

89
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.820
Button nascent and center.

90
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:32.430
Now we've got the box shadow and the border radius so those are the two final touches on the base button.

91
00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.190
So the shorter radius is going to give us those curved edges and the back shadow will give us the shadow

92
00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.870
below.

93
00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.310
So let's start with the border radius border radius.

94
00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.910
Think ahead 20 pixels.

95
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.680
You can experiment with that.

96
00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.500
That looks about right.

97
00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.040
And then the box shadow.

98
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.970
If you haven't used box shadow there's a lot of different ways you can use it.

99
00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.390
As far as the syntax.

100
00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:03.940
I mean when you use it with two parameters you pass it first which is the X offset in the y offset.

101
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.390
So I'll show you a couple of examples here.

102
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:12.680
But I'm going to start with 0 and then 6 pixels and then a color and the color is another hexadecimal

103
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:19.570
just a darker shade of this basically a four to four and that gives us the dark shadow there.

104
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.010
So as I mentioned this is X offset and y offset.

105
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.400
So if I give this a bigger number like 20 pixels for the X offset.

106
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:34.910
Notice that to the right we have a much larger dark shadow that's also offset 6 pixels down.

107
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.570
So I could make that bigger smaller.

108
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:42.330
I could give it 0 for the Y offset.

109
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:43.990
Now it's only on the right side.

110
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.650
But we want it to go directly below.

111
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:50.050
So we'll do zero x offset 6 pixels Y.

112
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:56.500
And what we'll be doing is when I hover we're going to reduce that down to 4 pixels.

113
00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.980
Maybe it's two we'll play around with it.

114
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:04.200
So we'll reduce it down and then reduce it further when we click to make it active.

115
00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:05.540
OK.

116
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.240
So let's go back to six and that's it for the base button state.

117
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.790
Aside from the font which will get around to signing in a little bit.

118
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:20.750
Now that brings us to our two other states hover as well as active and hover is nice and simple.

119
00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:22.490
Actually they're both very similar.

120
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.060
But let's start with Hover.

121
00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.640
It's my favorite on Dot PTEN.

122
00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:32.290
Colin hover you know we could also select just a button but it's better to use that class in case we

123
00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:34.230
have multiple buttons on this page.

124
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:38.400
We're going to start by changing the box shadows.

125
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:45.470
Remember the box shadow shrinks the focus right and you make this bigger the darker area as I hover.

126
00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:46.880
It shrinks down.

127
00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.070
So start with that.

128
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:49.890
Oh boy that's fake.

129
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:51.740
OK.

130
00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:57.570
So we have dark shadow and to start I'll just copy our previous box shadow mainly because I don't want

131
00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:03.760
to type that hexadecimal again and all will do is reduce this down to 4 pixels.

132
00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:05.240
So basically shrinking it.

133
00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:06.950
So I'll save.

134
00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.020
And it might be hard to see in the video.

135
00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:14.770
But as I hover that box shadow change it's just a tiny bit.

136
00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:18.830
But you'll also notice that it looks a little bit different.

137
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:23.330
Right it looks like the bottom of the button is moving up because that box shadow is shrinking.

138
00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:28.920
It sort of makes the button look smaller but we want it to look like it's more like we're actually clicking

139
00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:29.520
on it.

140
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:34.750
And to do that we need the top of the button to also move down at the same time.

141
00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:40.970
And this is where the position relative comes in because I can now say top two pixels

142
00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:46.510
and what that will do is shift the button down.

143
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:51.980
As you can see so are box shadows still reducing.

144
00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:59.220
Let's see if I can zoom in more area shadow goes away or it doesn't go away but it shrinks and the whole

145
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.920
button looks like it's being clicked.

146
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:02.520
All right.

147
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:06.210
Moving onto the next state which is going to be active.

148
00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:10.250
So in that state we want the button to look like it's fully depressed.

149
00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:15.270
The box shatter should be gone entirely but we're not just removing the dark shadow because that would

150
00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:18.790
make it look like the button shrinks like we saw in the previous example.

151
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:23.570
We want to also shift the button down a couple more pixels.

152
00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:31.430
So we'll start with our DOT PTEN active and we can start with BOQ shadow.

153
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:39.090
And to remove the bark shadow you could just use the exact same syntax and just change it to be 00 which

154
00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:42.930
is effectively removing it or at least not letting us see it.

155
00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.310
So see if you can tell.

156
00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:46.010
A click.

157
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.840
There is no box shadow at all.

158
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:49.540
Here we go.

159
00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:56.080
Regular state hover active box shadow is gone.

160
00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:57.450
So that's one way to do it.

161
00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:59.830
We can also say box shadow none.

162
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:04.990
And save either one.

163
00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:11.460
Then the only other thing we need to do is move the top down because it now looks like the bottom of

164
00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.690
the button is just jumping upwards of it just not what we want.

165
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.230
So to achieve that we just do top.

166
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:23.860
And I think what I had was 6 pixels for this one let's just triple check how that looks.

167
00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:26.740
It's really up to us to finesse it and figure out what works.

168
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:32.400
But I think that looks good origo perfect.

169
00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:33.630
So the math checks out.

170
00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:37.120
We have six pixel Vocht shadow and the first date.

171
00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.280
And then we're redistributing it.

172
00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:44.530
We're removing the top down to pixels and shrinking the black shadow to four and then we're removing

173
00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:51.220
the buckshot in the final state and moving everything down to be six pixels offset perfect.

174
00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.190
So that's it for the button itself.

175
00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.340
So you can leave this video if you haven't already.

176
00:10:56.650 --> 00:11:00.550
If you want to see the rest the styling I'm going to do that very quickly.

177
00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:05.260
It's not that exciting but if you just like to be a part of it you'd like to kind of have the exact

178
00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.460
same end result as me.

179
00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:12.640
First thing I'll do is go up top and I'm going to select the body and start with just setting the background

180
00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.740
color making it this yellow.

181
00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:25.570
So it's just background dash color and then we'll have a hexadecimal which is f c d is 0 for b f c d

182
00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:27.110
zero for B.

183
00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:28.330
There we go.

184
00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.050
All right.

185
00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.910
Looking closer.

186
00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:35.110
Now let's apply this font font family.

187
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:37.620
Ledo is the font that I included here.

188
00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:42.050
All right we got that change that's also set the color to be white.

189
00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:43.050
OK.

190
00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:44.650
So are one is close.

191
00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:47.970
Now all we need to do is center it and change the font.

192
00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:56.090
Wait so we'll select the H one all h ones and we'll change the text a line to be Center.

193
00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:56.860
There we go.

194
00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:00.220
And our font weight is 300.

195
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:01.420
There we go.

196
00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.470
This button does nothing looks.

197
00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.810
Ok enough.

198
00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:11.780
We've got our quick states where actually our hover and then our active state matching what we had earlier.

199
00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:16.990
If you'd like to see this in more of a full screen if you'd like to admire your handiwork can go to

200
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:20.650
change view look at it as a full page.

201
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:21.360
Awesome.

202
00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:25.770
So if you'd like to play around with it change colors change some of the dimensions.

203
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:31.280
Add another button that is offset to the right or to the left instead of down.

204
00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:34.090
And make sure you change the box châteaux appropriately.

205
00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:39.190
But you can make it look like you know you have a three dimensional button from a different perspective.

206
00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:39.850
Cool.

207
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:40.600
So that's it.

208
00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.470
So in the next video.
