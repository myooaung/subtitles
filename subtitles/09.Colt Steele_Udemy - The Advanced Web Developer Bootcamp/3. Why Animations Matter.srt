1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,590
And that brings me to my next point I want to bring up is why the animations really matter.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:05,270
Yes.

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,000
The flashy part of things is interesting it's cool to see what people can do.

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,870
You know you can add glitter to your page add some sparkle.

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:17,970
But beyond that is there some real utility for learning how to do CSSA animations.

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:24,510
And I think the answer is yes this is a medium article written by Michael velar Mikael Vlaar.

7
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:25,650
I apologize.

8
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:30,760
I'm butchering his name is a user interface developer at striped stripe.

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:35,260
You have probably come across if you buy things online frequently.

10
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,280
It's a payment processing company slash API.

11
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,930
Probably put through that as well explanation.

12
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,950
But the key thing here is that this article I think does a great job of summing up a couple of the reasons

13
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,090
why animations matter.

14
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,800
So at Strype the payment experience is what they do right.

15
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,850
That is their product really is having a solid payment experience.

16
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,720
So it really matters for them to improve that to optimize it.

17
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,400
And this article talks about why animations are used and how they're used to improve that process.

18
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,810
So things like animations can add context.

19
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,920
So here's an example of how an animation could provide some utility to a user to make things clear.

20
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,580
So in this example when the user clicks the Remember Me check box there's a nice little kind of slide

21
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:26,290
out or three dimensional foldout animation where the phone number and put slides down.

22
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,470
And that really shows the user that there's a connection there that there's context.

23
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,010
You only need to input your phone number if you're checking the Remember Me checkbox and that they're

24
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,620
important they're connected.

25
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,870
So other things would be providing feedback to users.

26
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:45,930
So a common one is this shaking or a jiggle I guess to mimic sort of the shaking of somebody's head

27
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,560
in a negative gesture.

28
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:53,070
So when you try and pay without filling any information out or you're missing a component you get this

29
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,750
error feedback.

30
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:59,470
And it's more visceral I guess it's more visual that's clearer.

31
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,890
Ideally what's happening something that this does this article doesn't touch on.

32
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:06,840
But that is related to this point has to do with accessibility.

33
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:12,070
People who have visual impairments often can benefit from animations on a page.

34
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,020
They can.

35
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:18,720
Like I said draw people's attention make things clearer as this is doing here rather than just having

36
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:25,330
us you know a small red icon having the actual shake clearly indicates that this is not going to work.

37
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:30,750
The next topic he goes into is what he refers to as sleight of hand essentially creating an illusion

38
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:36,690
of speed or snappishness deceiving your users a little bit by using animations making the experience

39
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,800
seem better.

40
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,450
What's happening here is that they're sending a verification code to a mobile device and takes a bit

41
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,370
of time.

42
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:50,820
And they have this little animation that says starts off with sending code sent and then we just sent

43
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,880
a text message to your phone number.

44
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:56,240
And the point he's making is that it's actually not true.

45
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,020
They are sending it.

46
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,650
But the animation is not in sync with that.

47
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,510
You may get your text before that or afterwards.

48
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,760
They don't know exactly how long it will take from the front end side of things.

49
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:11,760
But this animation kind of provides this step by step process that is potentially more engaging for

50
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,730
a user rather than just loading loading loading loading and just kind of waiting.

51
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:21,490
And you could be staring at the same state here the entire time they decided to break it up even though

52
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:25,140
on the back and this has zero connections to influence.

53
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,630
There's no relationship between what's actually being displayed and what's happening.

54
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:32,240
The animation makes it seem nicer.

55
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,100
One more thing.

56
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,340
This transition here he talks about how there are two states.

57
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,060
There's this first state payment info.

58
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,960
You click that and it transitions to the pay button.

59
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,430
But it uses the exact same transition as the above content.

60
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:55,660
So if you notice one time sort of slides over and the button does the exact same thing and he writes

61
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:01,060
about how the reason he did that the reason he has that match the button matches the same transition

62
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:05,880
as the content above is to highlight that the actions are linked to that button.

63
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:11,230
So as it as it changes the action changes well and then we get to the last point he makes which is what

64
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,640
he calls a bonus round.

65
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,710
This one sticks out a bit but I still think it's really important.

66
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:20,830
So it's not something that makes or breaks the actual flow as he mentions it could be removed without

67
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,350
any serious consequence.

68
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:28,870
It's just a nice looking flashy animation but the reason he thinks it's important is that it indicates

69
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,050
to users that this is a new site.

70
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,070
This is something that is currently being worked on.

71
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:39,630
This is not a company that it's 10 years old with an old static site where animations weren't an option.

72
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,580
This is something that was released recently.

73
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,850
It's sharp it's fresh.

74
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,300
I think you get it hopefully you get what I'm trying to say.

75
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:51,970
It can kind of lend your site and therefore your company some credibility an air of professionalism

76
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:52,830
if you will.

77
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,320
So while it may seem minor I do agree with that.

78
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,280
That having animations having a Polish site makes a difference.

79
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:58,780
OK.

80
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:03,700
So that wraps up kind of the key points I wanted to talk about around why you should care about learning

81
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:09,820
animations why it's not just flashy sparkles that you're throwing on to a completed web page but why

82
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,960
it's actually an integral part of designing a website designing an application.

83
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:20,110
So before we dive into any code there is one quick point I want to make when we're actually learning

84
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:24,420
this stuff how do we transition something we see assess how to create a simple animation.

85
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:28,750
How do we do a hover animation whatever we talk about in the next couple of videos.

86
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:33,730
I think you'll see that getting things to move getting things to animate is easy that's actually the

87
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:34,500
easy part.

88
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,630
So it might seem intimidating at first but if somebody asks you move this over 20 pixels to the right

89
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:44,120
when a user clicks on it that's actually not very difficult.

90
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,390
As far as the syntax in the code but what is hard about animating and this is something that I learned

91
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:53,680
personally when I started out with animations something that I have seen a lot of students encounter

92
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,280
and get frustrated by.

93
00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:00,670
The hard part is that planning how things should work conceptualizing the animation designing things

94
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:01,850
is hard.

95
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,500
So getting things to move is easy but planning how they should move is hard.

96
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:08,990
And I think that's true of a lot of things but especially animations.

97
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,550
So if you have some great idea implementing it often it's not that difficult.

98
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:19,060
Maybe if there's some crazy curves and complex trajectories you need things to follow where you have

99
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,860
to get into some math and trig.

100
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,360
Yes that could be difficult.

101
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:27,900
But typically most web apps most of the animations you see are not that difficult to implement.

102
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,200
Again the hard part is conceptualizing it.

103
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:35,060
That's where having a design background or having a designer on your team can really help.

104
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,440
And I'm not a designer who can be upfront about that.

105
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:41,770
I do my best to make these examples look good to come up with real world animations but it's something

106
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:42,920
I struggle with as well.

107
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,620
When I'm designing my own apps I always talk to somebody about how the animations should work because

108
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,020
usually my first instinct is not great.

109
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:50,910
OK.

110
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,980
So with all that said we talked about why animations matter.

111
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,680
We saw some cool things you can do with animations.

112
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,200
Now we're going to dive into code.

113
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:58,580
All right.

114
00:06:58,610 --> 00:06:59,320
So in the next video.
