00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.590
Welcome back I hope that wasn't too hard.

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.090
So let's talk about the solution now.

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:13.860
All right remember find index is a method that loops over our array and returns the index for which

4
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.480
the callback returns a truth value.

5
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.930
And if it never returns the truth value.

6
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.000
Find the next word turn negative 1.

7
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.060
So how does that all work.

8
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.970
Well we're going to have to loop over each element just like before and for each

9
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.150
loop over each element.

10
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.340
And now inside of here we want to invoke are call back again just like before passing in first the element

11
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.570
that we're on.

12
00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.810
Second the index and third the entire array.

13
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.050
But this is essentially the implementation of.

14
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.140
For each we have different behavior here.

15
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.020
So we want to know if this callback returns a truth value.

16
00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:04.490
So let's put that in IF statement.

17
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:12.100
And if that returns the truth value then that means we've found the index.

18
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.610
So if that's true return our index.

19
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.910
Simple as that.

20
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.000
We can't forget the other case if we never find the truth value here.

21
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.210
We also need to return negative one.

22
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:30.970
So if we ever reach the end of this for a loop we know that that callback has never been truthy because

23
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.740
the function would have stopped at this return statement.

24
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.290
So down here we're going to return negative 1.

25
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:43.900
In the case where we've gone through every element and we've never had truthy value so we haven't found

26
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.440
an index that makes that callback truthy.

27
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.700
So there you have it.

28
00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.530
That's our find index method similar to for each but a little different in the sense that we have to

29
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.910
check that truthiness.
