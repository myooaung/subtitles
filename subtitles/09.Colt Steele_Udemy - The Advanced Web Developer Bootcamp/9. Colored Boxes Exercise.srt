1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:05,050
Now will work on an assignment to help solidify all of the state concepts that we've learned.

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:10,600
So next up we're going to build this application.

3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:19,030
It's 32 square divs on the page and every 300 milliseconds box is randomly chosen and the color is changed

4
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:23,540
to another random color.

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,250
It's a bit mesmerizing.

6
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:32,350
So let's take a look at the starter code and then we'll come back and think about how to build this.

7
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,950
OK so here's our starting code.

8
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,960
I've used create react to app to create a random box's starter and I've also gone into packets Jaison

9
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:46,230
and I've updated the react in the re-act versions to 16.

10
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,360
I should probably also update that 16.

11
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,950
But anyway they've been updated.

12
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,630
The latest version of react and I've removed no modules and reinstall everything.

13
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,690
So that should be all set.

14
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,390
And also I've got some default props down here.

15
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:07,230
These are all the available colors and CSSA that exist so you can use these to set up your state and

16
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,550
also to pick a random color when you're changing the state.

17
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:16,350
Now of course this component will need a constructor and it needs some state for all 32 boxes and will

18
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:23,820
also need a set interval that will randomly choose a box and then change it using Set say every 300

19
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:24,940
milliseconds.

20
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:31,440
So let's talk about how we might set up this applet to go look at the application again.

21
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:37,180
So just looking at this app it looks like all these boxes are basically the same component.

22
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:43,650
Right we're going to have 32 of some component you might want to call it a box or anything else.

23
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:48,040
And then it's going to have one property which is the color.

24
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:52,680
Hopefully you can work with that as a starting point to figure out your state.

25
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:57,600
One other piece of advice you might want to make this box a stateless functional component because it

26
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,050
the box itself won't have any state.

27
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,480
The app above it should control of the state.

28
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,110
All right that's it.

29
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,120
Good luck on implementing this.

30
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,680
And we'll look at a solution right after you're done.
