Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:06,870
In this video we'll draw some letters on Viji using the text element.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:13,650
Let's revisit Carstares Viji from the previous video and that a text caption to the bottom of the SVGA.

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,880
Here's a link to the code pen.

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,840
When using the text element at a minimum you should specify where you want it to be using the x and

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:28,500
y attributes the x and y coordinates passed in refer to the position of the bottom left corner of the

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,710
text.

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,710
As you can see this can make for a text element that's off center.

9
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,440
If you want to center the text there are a couple of ways to do it.

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:45,600
One is to use the DX or D-y attributes to shift the text element from its anchor point horizontally

11
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,050
or vertically.

12
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:53,570
However this requires you to know beforehand the amount you need to shift by a simpler approach is to

13
00:00:53,570 --> 00:01:00,560
use the text anchor property which you can set either as an attribute on the element or using VSS text

14
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,760
anchor takes one of three possible values start middle or end.

15
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,850
If you set it to middle then the x and y coordinates will refer to the position of the bottom middle

16
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:11,920
of the element.

17
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:18,380
If you set it to end the coordinates will refer to the position of the bottom right corner for vertical

18
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,270
rather than horizontal alignment.

19
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:23,210
You can also use the alignment baseline attribute.

20
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:29,110
It has a number of values but for centering vertically you can set its value to middle.

21
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:34,330
Let's center our tax by setting text anger to middle.

22
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,050
We can also set other CSSA properties such as font size and font family.

23
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:45,890
We can even set colors however unlike fonts outside of SVGA we need to set colors using fail and stroke

24
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,290
just like with other SVGA elements.

25
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,710
We can also rotate text.

26
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,820
This is particularly helpful if you're trying to label axes and need text to be vertically aligned to

27
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,350
rotate.

28
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,480
You can use the transform attribute and pass to the value that specifies the rotation in order to rotate.

29
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:09,030
You should specify the degree of rotation and the coordinates of the point you want to rotate around.

30
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,070
Here's an example.

31
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:16,720
The same technique can be used to rotate other shapes who we've looked at such as circles and polygons

32
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,600
that about covers the text element in the next video will cover a much more complex SPG element the

33
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,860
path element.

34
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:26,620
I'll see their.
