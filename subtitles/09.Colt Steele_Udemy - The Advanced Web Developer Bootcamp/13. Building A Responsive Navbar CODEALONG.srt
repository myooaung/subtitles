1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:00,830
OK.

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,810
So I don't want to just bombard you with all these different properties.

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,670
I want you to feel like you're making something learning stuff and then applying it blah blah blah.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,770
So let's go ahead and make a little Neph bar.

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,390
So here's what it will look like.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,890
Don't expect anything too crazy.

7
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:22,150
I'm not you know a designer but it's functionally very calm and very important to a typical web layout.

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:28,440
So in our case we have these four links that are aligned to the right up top but it's responsive.

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:33,770
And as you can see as you scroll Well first of all everything kind of shifts over stays the same.

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,540
Then they kind of split up that space take up the same amount of space like a traditional kind of nap

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:45,480
or an iPad maybe or a tablet lay out and then they go to the standard column layout on a mobile size.

12
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:51,150
So you know the actual styling behind the spacing the colors the font size all that's very very easy

13
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:51,960
to change.

14
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,370
But what we're going to focus on is really the flex box part of it.

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,270
So that will be kind of how we structure this.

16
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:03,570
I'll start off with very ugly styled code or on style elements and just position them using flex blocks

17
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:04,550
how I want it to work.

18
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,640
And then if you care about watching me style it I'll do that yet.

19
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:14,280
But you also have the source code the solution code included along with this video starter and solution

20
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,370
are resources.

21
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,820
So if you'd like to just skip ahead and look at that.

22
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:18,800
Feel free to do so.

23
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,850
OK.

24
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,890
So here's our beautiful starter code.

25
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:30,760
Basically all it is is a Nav. with four links and each link has some text in it as well as an icon.

26
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,670
Not mandatory but I'm using font awesome again.

27
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,170
We've got home with a home icon about with a question mark contact to the phone.

28
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,090
And it's very very tiny.

29
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,740
And then dogs of course every NASCAR needs dogs and a little preprint.

30
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,470
All right.

31
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,150
And then over here I've got fun.

32
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:48,600
Awesome.

33
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,000
And then a font from Google fonts that is not mandatory but I just didn't want to have to you know have

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,790
you import that yourself if you're trying to follow along if you're doing this as a code along.

35
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,970
So the first thing we should do is establish how it's going to work.

36
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,670
As far as flex box we know it's a flex box section so you need to use it.

37
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:12,190
The rough idea is that we're going to make this Nav. a flexible container.

38
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:19,330
These items inside of it will be able to align them to this side using just the right content.

39
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:26,040
But then what we'll need to do is change how they are justified or what the value is just if the content

40
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,420
as the screen size shrinks.

41
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:35,330
And then finally at this break point we'll want to change it from a row to a column layout.

42
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:39,260
But let's start making it work just on this maximum size.

43
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,460
So we want things over on the right side.

44
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:47,280
So we're going to start by selecting the nav which is not a class don't need that period.

45
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,590
We make this a bit bigger.

46
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:49,290
OK.

47
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:56,010
So we'll do now and we'll start with display flex.

48
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:02,030
Not very big change but what we want to do is now shift those things over to the right.

49
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:09,150
In this case remember by default it's a row we could be explicit no problem with that flex direction

50
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:15,240
is Roe and that means our main axis goes from left to right.

51
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:22,920
So to move things to the right side we want to preserve the order so we don't want to do like Roe reverse

52
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:29,610
for example which technically moves them to the right but now Douggs is the first item which is fine

53
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:33,220
by me but our customer does not like that.

54
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,940
So if we go back to Roe Instead we need to change his justify content.

55
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,170
That's the point to justify content.

56
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:48,430
It allows us to distribute all this space over here on that main axis and if we add that border that's

57
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:52,390
due to pixel's solid pink Not really.

58
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,150
Nope.

59
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,230
There you go.

60
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,490
We've got a ton of space.

61
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,570
So by pushing it over but just the right content we don't want it to center instead.

62
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,160
What we want is going to be flex and all the way on that right side.

63
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,600
Okay.

64
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:13,550
So yeah we'll worry about the spacing and a little bit at the end.

65
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,920
We're going to want to add some padding to make things look nicer but for now that's the right just

66
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,030
what we want.

67
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:27,950
So then the next step would be to get this to work at this middle break point.

68
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:32,570
Let me go to the solution right there as we go.

69
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,550
I'm always zoomed in by the way so that's why that's happening.

70
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,540
It's really closer.

71
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:42,000
There we go where they spread out evenly and that's really some people would prefer if they were just

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,560
centered rather than spreading out like that totally up to whoever's designing this which in this case

73
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:49,200
was me.

74
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,880
And I'm not a good designer.

75
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,800
So what we want to do is have a break point.

76
00:04:53,820 --> 00:05:01,200
So just to go over what we would do or we're going to do is change just if I content to space and we

77
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,630
could either do space around which is most likely what we'll do.

78
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,120
Or you could also play around a space between.

79
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,000
But we don't want that just to happen by default.

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,780
We want that to happen at a break point.

81
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:21,180
And the one that I defined it was actually kind of nice if you use code pen you get this.

82
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:26,730
Well I can't point to it with the mouse but if you look in the middle of the screen there's a screen

83
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:32,210
size readout that tells you how large and so I had it right about here.

84
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:32,810
I believe it.

85
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:37,080
Nine hundred twenty pixel or so and that's fully zoomed out.

86
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:43,510
So that means actually right here it changes over.

87
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:52,200
So to do that we define at media always a good habit to have that screen and you don't have to have

88
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,240
that and will do max with.

89
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,770
We do need this part.

90
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,410
Play around with what number you prefer but I'm doing 920 pixels.

91
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,490
OK.

92
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:12,830
And then all that will do in here is tell our NAV to justify content space around.

93
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:13,630
OK.

94
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,170
So nothing changes yet.

95
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:21,120
But as I shrink it down every go that's happening much earlier than probably happened to you because

96
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,790
you've been.

97
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:27,060
So this is more what it looks like happens right there.

98
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:35,020
So you could also change that if you prefer to center if you'd like that more you know play around with

99
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:35,670
these.

100
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,330
Figure out what works best for you.

101
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,280
Because personally if I'm being blunt I don't know if I like that space around but that's what I went

102
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,360
with.

103
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,330
All right.

104
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:56,360
So then we have this other thing to take care of which is I go to the original changing them to a column

105
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:03,600
this is a really classic use for fluxbox and just naff bars in general having things switch over to

106
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,910
a column when you get to Mobile size.

107
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,830
And that's really simple.

108
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:12,780
If we ignore the media query aspect for now and we just want to make it into a column right away all

109
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,180
we have to do is flex direction.

110
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,560
Gerrity have changed that too.

111
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,650
Column and there we go.

112
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:26,410
So it's as simple as switching that over but using a media query.

113
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:38,940
So this time and again at media and we'll do screen and Max with I think it's 400 or maybe 600 pixels

114
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:45,090
will work and all we want to do is Nav..

115
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:51,890
We're going to make that flex direction column.

116
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,560
So nothing happens.

117
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:58,510
But as I resize we get that column but there's one key difference that we're missing.

118
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,040
If you look at how this was working everything is centered.

119
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:07,030
So what's the property to align them centered on that cross access.

120
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:11,790
Because remember our main access goes from top to bottom Cross access left to right.

121
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:23,000
It's not just about content this time it bigger instead it's line items center so as you can see as

122
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,820
we go.

123
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:30,280
And just to hit that home you know we could change that to flex and

124
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,540
there you go or flex start which is the default but we want center.

125
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:40,870
So that's actually it for the Flex box portion.

126
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:45,340
We have this responsive nav bar just looks really really bad.

127
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,940
So what I'll do if you care is I'll style it.

128
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:53,200
You can also just look at the solution to see how like I'll point out some of the key things to make

129
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,370
it work a little better.

130
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:57,950
Aside from I go to 100 percent here.

131
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:03,830
Aside from the color and there's a slight hover effect with the transition throwback to our last couple

132
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:04,840
of sections.

133
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,710
There's also a change in the font size that happens.

134
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:12,220
So as I scroll here could see the font shrinks.

135
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,150
I just added that to the break point.

136
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,230
So if you want to add some of those styles.

137
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,550
Here we go.

138
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:24,540
First thing that we can take care of is style these links so I'll do that now.

139
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,230
Anchor tag first thing that we can do is just make them bigger.

140
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,200
Let's try 40 pixels.

141
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:32,220
Pretty big.

142
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,520
Let's get rid of all that.

143
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,990
GROSS default styling so that's text decoration.

144
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:38,880
None.

145
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:42,750
And let's also change the color.

146
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,260
I was using a gray Hex that I found.

147
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:50,130
I think it's nine five a five a six.

148
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,920
And when I say I think I'm actually just reading.

149
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,230
I definitely know that the next thing will do let's change the font.

150
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:04,240
So that's font family and we'll use the font that I included up here which is called railway but it's

151
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,670
spelled oddly on purpose of course.

152
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,570
OK.

153
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,110
So we're getting closer.

154
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:15,080
The next thing we could do would be nice is to add that underline the bottom.

155
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:23,260
So that's actually just a border bottom border bottom one pixel solid and to have another color that's

156
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,210
not memorized five to see Nine AA

157
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:30,150
goal.

158
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,770
Now they look like.

159
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,680
First let me get rid of this awful pink border.

160
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:40,660
It looks like just one giant line which maybe some people like actually but there would be an easier

161
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,340
way just to get a giant line.

162
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,210
What we could do is just assign it to the neph.

163
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,980
But what we want is some space between them.

164
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,720
They're running together.

165
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,460
So that calls for maybe a margin.

166
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:56,660
So on these days these lengths will just add margin.

167
00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:01,730
And let's just do a margin everywhere to start it seems to work well.

168
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,960
I like the space appear as well.

169
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:08,470
So now we have some space and this is looking pretty good.

170
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:14,390
What we can also do is come in here and add our little hover effect.

171
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:21,720
So we do a hover and all I'm doing I don't even know if you could pick up on that in the video.

172
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,170
Just changing the color so just color.

173
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:34,870
And then another lovely hex 3 4 9 8 D-B And I'm also changing the border bottom color.

174
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,090
And that's the exact same color.

175
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,900
I'll just copy that.

176
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,160
OK.

177
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,960
So we hover.

178
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,400
You can see that happens.

179
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,650
But we could add a transition.

180
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:51,630
So let's do transition and let's make it maybe half a second

181
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,990
and let's ease out OK it's a little better.

182
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,420
If we wanted you can also apply it to the border.

183
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,610
You could do all instead of color.

184
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,350
But that will apply to other things.

185
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,390
If we ended up changing those later.

186
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,160
OK.

187
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,640
So another thing you might notice is this spacing here the icons are very close.

188
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,280
There's a little more space there.

189
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:25,370
So if we select the icons we can just add a margin.

190
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,170
Right.

191
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,450
And let's do maybe 10 pixels.

192
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,910
Yep looks good.

193
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:32,250
Have a little space there.

194
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:38,580
So now as we shrink this down we have a problem which is that they end up going on separate lines.

195
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,630
I am zoomed in.

196
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:42,690
So that could be contributing to it.

197
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:47,110
Let me see still happens though.

198
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:53,110
So what we can do is just change the font size when we get to this first breakpoint when we do space

199
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:53,840
around.

200
00:12:54,010 --> 00:13:02,400
We just select anchor tags and just change font size to something like I don't know 25 26 pixels.

201
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,610
See how that works.

202
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:10,400
Not that we go perfect so that it's working just how we want it.

203
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,270
As you can see looks pretty good.

204
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:19,060
The only other thing that we could really do if we wanted to is play around with what it would look

205
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,930
like if we centered this.

206
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:25,010
That break point rather than space around.

207
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,710
Looks pretty similar.

208
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:34,110
But if we change it to space between or space around there is more space there.

209
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:39,840
I kind of prefer it centered to be honest and not totally up to you.

210
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:43,320
You could also just to be clear you could move it to the left.

211
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:47,220
No reason why not have it over there.

212
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:49,780
Starts on the right.

213
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:52,150
It was left in the middle.

214
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,060
Let's keep it Center.

215
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,830
I like that.

216
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,870
And that wraps it up.

217
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:03,580
So let me just change the view to full page zoom out to 100 percent.

218
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,060
Here's a lovely little Nav. beautiful hover effect.

219
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,490
Brilliant artistry.

220
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:09,780
Shrink it down.

221
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:10,340
OK.

222
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:11,450
Here's our tablet.

223
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,780
Old now FUBAR and then our mobile and Ackbar.

224
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:22,250
And you know we could adjust this slightly if make these bigger on mobile or sometimes what you'll see

225
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,290
is on mobile.

226
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,760
You get this background added.

227
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,960
If we really wanted to you know you could do something like this.

228
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:34,710
On the mobile size just gives the NAF a background.

229
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,680
I don't know what color would look good.

230
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:41,660
Maybe Gray.

231
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:45,510
No not gray but you can see what I'm talking about.

232
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,410
You get this board.

233
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,590
Well we can get rid of that border pretty easily by the way.

234
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:52,290
We need to do is come up here and say body

235
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,510
zero and it goes away.

236
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:04,170
But hopefully you can see what I'm talking about where we could make this look like a more legitimate

237
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:11,190
mobile lay out where you have a Nashbar up top that's a contrast in color just that's not the color

238
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:12,740
that we want it to do.

239
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:21,930
But maybe we could change the items to that item or let's just you anchor tag color white can be kind

240
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:24,660
of a stark change but there we go.

241
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:29,070
You know I don't really like that color scheme but it works.

242
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:36,130
We get this nice mobile lay up and I actually went and found a slightly nicer color darker blue that

243
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,140
I think looks much better.

244
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:38,960
OK.

245
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:41,450
So here we go shrink it down.

246
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,540
There we go.

247
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,620
Looks pretty good.

248
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,740
I change the font color to white as well.

249
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:50,770
You can see that here color white and then background that is next perfect.

250
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,550
So that's the end finally made.

251
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:56,270
So we're going to keep moving on a couple of other properties.

252
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:01,660
We'll see some properties that apply specifically to the items inside of a container or flex container.

253
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:04,020
And then we'll build another project.

254
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:04,590
All right.
