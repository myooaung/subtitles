00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.190
Hi and welcome to the first real technical section of this course.

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.920
So we're going to kick things off with a topic that is very near and dear to my heart personally.

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.840
It's something that I love to do as a developer but I especially love to teach.

4
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.610
It's something that I think is pretty engaging to learn as well.

5
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.790
So that topic is animations and s. s. s. s. s. s. s. comes with a couple of different in tools for creating

6
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:31.880
animations ranging from really simple things like a hover effect up to pretty complex full blown animations

7
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.600
that you would expect from maybe an artist even narrative animations.

8
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.590
Now we're not going to get into that.

9
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.860
We're not going to get into creating short films or anything with C Ss which is technically possible

10
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.870
but we are going to focus on the more practical elements so that means in practice is that we'll start

11
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.870
off by talking about the different tools that we need.

12
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.250
Things like CSSA transforms transitions as well as keyframe animations.

13
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.590
So we'll learn those different tools and then we'll learn to put them together to make a couple of different

14
00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.450
projects.

15
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.070
But before we get there I love doing this.

16
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.930
I just want to show a couple of really cool examples of what people have done with animations and then

17
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.750
I also want to discuss why animations really matter.

18
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.130
It's not just that they're flashy or impressive but we'll start off by taking a look at things that

19
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.560
are flashy and impressive.

20
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:23.010
The first one I want to talk about is a site called in pieces 30 species 30 pieces or species in pieces

21
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.280
species and PCs.

22
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:34.230
Basically it's an amazing web site that has 30 animated little visuals of 30 different endangered species.

23
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:43.760
So if we click on one let's take the African penguin can see that it's formed from what those 30 triangles

24
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.380
here.

25
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.190
And that's kind of the 30 pieces part of the name.

26
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:54.340
But any time I go to another animal those same thirty triangles reconfigure that change shape but they're

27
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.340
still triangles that change color and they change position to form or another animal.

28
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.550
So now we have the Greek red damsel and so on.

29
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.980
So I guess spend forever looking at this playing with it.

30
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.430
It's a really cool site to check out.

31
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.810
It works on mobile as well.

32
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.980
Really impressive stuff but it's all done with CSSA And that's actually what I find more impressive.

33
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.700
So we won't unfortunately be getting into creating something like this.

34
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:24.260
This is as much art as it is web development but we will learn the tools that this use is that this

35
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.700
is built upon.

36
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.510
Another thing I'll show you is this site for a French creative agency.

37
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.600
It's just a portfolio page or a marketing page but has a ton of animations going on.

38
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.810
So aside from the cool art style can see simple things like these glasses the sunglasses have a glare

39
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:47.850
animating But then you know there's this nice little bouncy effect here and over here as well.

40
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.460
Let me refresh the page so that you can see what happens.

41
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.030
There's this loading icon and then that cool.

42
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:59.410
I don't know what to call that sort of liquid effect as it loads and that's all done with CSSA as well.

43
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.690
And I could go on and on a bunch of other examples as students in my previous courses can attest.

44
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.070
I just find cool CSSA projects really fun.

45
00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.440
I want to take a moment to now go back to something more real world are more applicable to your life

46
00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.810
and to most developers lives.

47
00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.680
We're not usually creating these amazing art pieces.

48
00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.080
We're usually adding animations to more traditional webapps.

49
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.080
So I'm on the TO ME HOME page here and there's a bunch of animations that you may or may not notice

50
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.020
as you use the site day to day.

51
00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:37.070
So things like you know I hover over a course let's say the web fell for bootcamp we get a sort of opacity

52
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:43.940
effect where it dims a little bit to show that it's selected and then slowly this over or this pop up

53
00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.080
fades in on the right side.

54
00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.360
It's not immediate.

55
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.200
It fades in.

56
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.200
And that was a choice that the developers made.

57
00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:57.160
Similarly if I resize the page here take a look at the hamburger menu as a quick on it.

58
00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.690
We have this nice animated slide out.

59
00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:05.750
So this is a pretty common thing on mobile apps to have animated rather than just having it appear out

60
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:06.750
of nowhere.

61
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.130
It makes for a better experience a lot a lot of people would argue to have it fade in or have it slide

62
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.300
in like that.

63
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.410
So just two simple things that you may not notice but there's animations all over the place on sites

64
00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.120
and most of the time they're not that intrusive.
