00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,060
Welcome back congratulations on making it this far in this section.

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:06,750
There's just one thing to do.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:12,090
Use what you've learned about D-3 to create a David dashboard visualizing some data that you're interested

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,150
in.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,640
This is easier said than done.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:21,670
However you've learned a lot about D-3 in putting it all into one set of visualizations is no easy task.

7
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:26,250
I don't want to prescribe too much of what you should do for this final project but here are some general

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,040
guidelines.

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,690
First your dashboard should consist of at least two visualizations.

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:39,000
Second at least one of the visualizations should be an advanced graph type that we studied either a

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,780
map or a force directed graph third.

12
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:48,050
Your visualization should involve some dynamic component rather than just being rendered once on the

13
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,070
page load.

14
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,020
They should be able to update based on some user interaction.

15
00:00:53,170 --> 00:01:00,110
And finally your visualizations should use tool tips to highlight important features of the data.

16
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,300
Other than that there are no restrictions.

17
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,610
You can visualise any dataset you want using whatever types of graphs you want.

18
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:11,450
You can choose from the types of graphs who have studied together or you can choose an entirely different

19
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,130
type of chart.

20
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,130
We didn't cover all of the graph Alpert's D-3 provides.

21
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:21,650
So there were definitely many more types of charts the D-3 can help you build and there are also other

22
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,820
helpers that we haven't touched on.

23
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,360
So as you're working on this project make sure to consult the D-3 docs regularly.

24
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,130
I've added some links to example datasets and the resources for this video.

25
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,460
I've also built a sample dashboard in case you need inspiration.

26
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,950
We looked at this dashboard in the very first D-3 section.

27
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:46,490
You may remember that I've got three graphs here a map chart a pie chart and a bar chart.

28
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:53,340
The map chart visualizes CO2 emissions by country and by year I can adjust the year and adjust the coloring

29
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,390
to represent emissions or emissions per capita.

30
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:01,330
The pie chart visualizes the same data though the tooltip is a bit different.

31
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:06,680
When I mouseover an arc in the circle I see what percentage of total emissions for that year are represented

32
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,070
by that arc.

33
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:14,480
For example in 2011 the United States was responsible for just over 16 percent of all CO2 emissions

34
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,220
worldwide China was responsible for nearly 28 percent.

35
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,540
Lastly you can click on a country to see a breakdown of its emissions by year and the bar chart on the

36
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,190
right.

37
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:29,380
This is helpful in identifying trends in emissions.

38
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:35,450
Unfortunately the trends through 2011 aren't great over the two decades in the data set.

39
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:40,800
Very few countries significantly reduce their carbon footprint.

40
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,690
I hope that the sample dashboard gives you some ideas.

41
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:48,970
Feel free to build your own dashboard for this data set or to visualize something entirely different.

42
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,910
In the next two videos I'll walk through my code for this dashboard.
