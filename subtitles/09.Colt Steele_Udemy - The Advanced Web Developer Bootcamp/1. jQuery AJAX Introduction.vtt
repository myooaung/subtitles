00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:00.780
All right.

2
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:01.790
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.520
So we've seen ex-aide jars and we've seen fetch fetch of course is a more modern hipper version that

4
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.560
lets us send requests with a nice clean syntax.

5
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.130
The big drawback though is that it's not fully supported currently across all the major browsers which

6
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.920
is a pretty significant issue.

7
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.900
Eventually that shouldn't be a problem.

8
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.530
But in the meantime if you want to send requests and you want a nice clean syntax and you want it to

9
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.800
work in all browsers you can turn to third party libraries.

10
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.630
So we're going to take a look at two the first of which is Jey query.

11
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.070
The most popular javascript library of all time currently at least you probably come across it before

12
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.160
a lot of people like to use it for manipulating the DOM selecting elements adding event listeners.

13
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.390
Its slogan is it's the right.

14
00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.510
Less do more javascript library.

15
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.300
So it simplifies the syntax and makes things easier generally to write than just plain Javascript.

16
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.410
So here's an example.

17
00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.590
Sort of a classic example to fade an element in a pretty common thing that people want to do if you

18
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.040
don't use Jey query and you write it from scratch.

19
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.780
You have to define a function fade in 15 to 20 ish lines of code.

20
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.690
And if you do use J query you can replace all of that with a single line.

21
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.240
Assuming that you've required a query here you've imported it into your code so it saves you a lot of

22
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.020
space.

23
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:25.230
A lot of code a lot of time and the same thing applies not just for manipulating the dom or for selecting

24
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.720
elements but also for making requests.

25
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.590
So it's a nicer interface for sending SML HTP requests.

26
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:39.120
So there's an example a common task sending a get request taking the data that comes back and parsing

27
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.730
the Jaison Without Jay query it looks something like this.

28
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.540
And also with that fetch because we want this to work in all browsers we need to make an X amount of

29
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:49.650
requests.

30
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.760
We open it.

31
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.280
We wait for it to come back we'll do something with it with Jay Querrey.

32
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.450
It's pretty much a single line.

33
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.070
We'll talk a lot more about this get Jay some method and exactly how it works.

34
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:08.170
But it takes a common operation making a get request and parsing Jasen combines it into a single function.

35
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.670
So it's way easier as the slide says there are four J.A.G. methods.

36
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.160
We're going to take a look at.

37
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.610
But really there's just one really important one which is dollar signs Ajax.

38
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.270
The other three are just shorthand methods that actually call dollar sign that Ajax in their source

39
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.960
code and I'll show that to you later.

40
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.340
So dollar sign Ajax is the key method that everything else is built on top of.

41
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.080
So we're going to focus on that one first.

42
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.050
But before we get there the last thing I want to do in this video is just make sure everyone knows how

43
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.200
to include a query.

44
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.300
If you've never used it before so you can download it and include it just like you would any other script.

45
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.260
You can also use a CDN.

46
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.540
So on code does a query dot com they have a bunch of hosted CD ends.

47
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:51.870
You can pick one.

48
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:58.820
I'm going to be using Jay query 3 so pick uncompress minimize them whatever you want and then it gives

49
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.790
you a script that you can include So you can copy this script and come over to your subcompacts Adam

50
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.410
whatever you're using for an editor.

51
00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.950
I'm going to use code pen and we can just include it here.

52
00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:16.620
And to make sure it works can do something like dollar sign and let's just use this button.

53
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.670
I gave it an ID and just used dumb click which is a J Querrey thing.

54
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:29.130
And what we'll do when we click is just alerts to a query works.

55
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.850
See if it works perfect.

56
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.340
So that's one way of requiring Jey query.

57
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.690
If you are using code peno and you don't want to have these obnoxious scripts all over the place cluttering

58
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:47.790
your code you can also go up to this little settings icon on the javascript tab and you can quick add

59
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.930
this dropdown menu a whole bunch of different javascript libraries angular D-3 J queries that's what

60
00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.720
we want not were you.

61
00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:01.130
But Jay query save and close and it should work just the same way.

62
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.580
So that's where we'll stop.

63
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.070
I'm going to make a point of explicitly including the script just so if people are looking at the code

64
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.200
then they're not aware that you can quick add that it's clear what's happening with that.

65
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.720
Out of the way in the next video we'll dive into some code.
