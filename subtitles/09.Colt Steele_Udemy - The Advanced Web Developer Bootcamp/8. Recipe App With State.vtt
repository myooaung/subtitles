00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.790
Now will continue building the recipe's app that we started before except now will include state in

2
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.010
our application that we're going to build looks like this.

3
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.090
Now you may think this looks exactly like our old app but there's some significant changes.

4
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.270
First of all we can add new recipes.

5
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.270
So this link up here works.

6
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.090
It pops up a form I can add pizza

7
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:37.250
and then from my ingredients all make its tomato sauce.

8
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.230
And if I go down I'll get another one.

9
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.540
Let's say mozzarella.

10
00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:45.170
That's good.

11
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.750
Oh and I guess dough.

12
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.080
And then here's my picture.

13
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.960
And then when I say this the form goes away.

14
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.410
And now I also have my mini recipe card down here.

15
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.000
Another thing that you can do in this new app is you can delete recipes.

16
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.310
So now I've deleted that one and it's taken out of my state.

17
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.330
So I work on this and will start just by converting our app that used default props and one that uses

18
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.400
state.

19
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.540
So I copied over our solution for the last recipes app using props and I've got that now in a directory

20
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.790
called recipe state.

21
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.250
And in here I've got my recipe app my main app component and it's got a nav bar and recipe list and

22
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.490
the first thing I'm going to do is add a constructor here and then save my state about my recipes in

23
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.020
this component.

24
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.100
You may be wondering why I chose to put state in this component instead of putting it in the recipe

25
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.310
list because after all we had our default prop's here on the recipe list already.

26
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.420
Well that was a strategic move on my part.

27
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.050
I know that in the next video we're going to want to put our state in here and soon you'll see why.

28
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.450
So let's start with that.

29
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:18.840
And now I'll just copy over the state from the default prop's.

30
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.460
Now I've got my state here was some some default so that we can see some data when we first start up

31
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.930
that.

32
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.640
I've also taken away the default props from recipe list because we no longer need them.

33
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:39.900
And one last thing we want to do is pass that state into the recipe list as prop's.

34
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:40.390
There we go.

35
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.950
Now let's take a look at the app and make sure everything works.

36
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.310
Everything looks good with the update and we aren't getting any errors so looks good so far.

37
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.830
Planning ahead there's one more thing I know will need to change.

38
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.650
So far we've been using corrects the code so far on the recipe list we've been using the index of our

39
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.690
array to keep track of the key but that's worked so far because our array hasn't changed.

40
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:16.440
But later on we know that we're going to be able to delete and modify that list so the index in the

41
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.560
array will no longer be sufficient.

42
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:34.020
So what I'd like to do is inside of objects just give every recipe its own ID.

43
00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.270
And now that we've done that we want some way to figure out the next unique idea that we should give

44
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.680
out.

45
00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.240
Once we create new recipe ideas

46
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.830
so I've created another piece of steak called next recipe ID in the next video we'll use that to track

47
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.680
what the next ideal should be.

48
00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:03.580
One other piece of business is back in the recipe list we need to change this from index to the ID.

49
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.340
So now we should be using the ID from the recipe state rather than from the index.

50
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.820
Let's see if that worked.

51
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.730
So it didn't quite work.

52
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.520
I fixed a small bug off camera.

53
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:32.040
So in this state I need to call this recipe's because that's what I use down here and that's also what

54
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.250
my Propp is expecting in the recipe list.

55
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:41.590
So it just makes more sense to call this recipe's.

56
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.480
Now we take a look at our app.

57
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.870
It looks good and we get no errors.

58
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.440
That's it pratting state to our application.

59
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.530
Next up we'll add the form so we can create a new recipe.
