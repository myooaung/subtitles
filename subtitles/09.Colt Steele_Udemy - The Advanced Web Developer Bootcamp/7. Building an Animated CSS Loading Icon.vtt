1
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.490
It either.

2
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.780
So what we're going to do now is actually build a C success loading icon a simple animation like this

3
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.270
one you see here using keyframes.

4
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.690
And the reason we're going to build something like this is well there's two.

5
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:19.830
One is that you may need a loading icon into loading icons are probably the most common application

6
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.480
of CSSA keyframes you'll see them all the time you may or may not pay much attention to them.

7
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.430
It's sort of a signal that you can check out and you know go away for a moment or lose focus.

8
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.410
Usually I just change windows when there's a loading icon.

9
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.740
But if you actually pay attention to it if you inspect it it's almost always CSSA keyframe animations.

10
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.120
So very very common use case.

11
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.530
So we're going to build a simple one.

12
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.110
But before we do that I actually want to show you.

13
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.300
If you go on code pen and you search for loader you could try to load loading.

14
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.800
So far 27000 code penned at the time of this recording.

15
00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.320
And you can explore a lot of these and find some really impressive things some of which will actually

16
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.660
include technologies that you may not be comfortable with like SPG but the majority of which you could

17
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.170
implement using what we've learned so far.

18
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.650
The only complication has to do with the math.

19
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.150
Sometimes you know the advanced trigonometry the curves that the animations are following.

20
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:24.390
So the actual process of creating the animation the syntax is exactly the same the same properties we've

21
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.780
worked with animation name animation duration.

22
00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.380
You know at keyframes and so on.

23
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.530
But then the creativity is where it gets challenging.

24
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.770
And I think that's something I've tried to hit home a couple of times in this section but here's a quick

25
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:45.060
example that I found that has eight loaders and all of these are doable with what you know right now.

26
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.780
Some of them are going to be a bit more difficult to get right.

27
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.370
For example this one here.

28
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:57.030
You know figuring out the timing of growing and shrinking these getting it right can take some experimentation

29
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.650
but something like this is pretty straightforward.

30
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:06.990
You have three circles and all that you're doing is changing the opacity from 0 to 1.

31
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.110
You're animating that and you're doing those in a row basically keeping them in sync or same thing with

32
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.550
something like this here.

33
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.980
Except instead of animate the opacity you're transforming them up and then back down.

34
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:27.000
But we're going to focus on is a more traditional round loader but I recommend if you want to explore

35
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.640
some of this code the way that it's organized.

36
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:36.780
It could be a bit overwhelming but if you scroll down so every voter has it classloader and then an

37
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.490
ID load or dash and then a number loader Dash 1.

38
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.140
So if we want to see that code look for load or Dash 1 and then here's the relevant code.

39
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.830
And here's the relevant animation code as you can see it's not that much.

40
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.450
Some of them do get longer.

41
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.330
OK so I'll leave that for now.

42
00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.040
It's a resource that you can look at as well as just exploring code pen.

43
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.280
There's so many great floating icons on here lots of fun things to be found.

44
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.030
But let's go to the starter code the dredge that up and build our own simple loading icon.

45
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.440
So the starter code just has a bit of tech appear says this page takes forever to load.

46
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.530
You can delete that if you don't care about it.

47
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.750
Everything up until all the CSSA that's currently here is irrelevant to the loading icon itself.

48
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.680
Let's take a look at how it works.

49
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.450
So it's a circle that's rotating but there's two opposing parts that are of different colors.

50
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.820
And then two other opposing parts that are of the same color.

51
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.680
So the way that this actually works it's kind of a little bit of a trick.

52
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.520
Not everybody knows that you can do this but you can assign different colors to the different borders.

53
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:50.800
The left right top and bottom borders of a box and then on top of that you can turn that box into a

54
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.410
circle using border radius.

55
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.890
So this is actually just a div that has two different colored borders and then two gray borders that

56
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.500
we then turn into a circle that we're then animating by rotating.

57
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.600
So let's make that div I already have it here it's called div classloader but there's nothing to see

58
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.360
at the moment.

59
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:18.890
So let's go ahead and style the dot loader loader class and we'll begin by giving it a border.

60
00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.600
Just all the way around 16 pixels solid.

61
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:36.520
You could just Dougray the hex that I have is b d c three C 7 easy 3 C 7 and will give it a with which

62
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.160
will be 120 pixels and the height 120 pixels as well.

63
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.650
OK so now we have this box.

64
00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.950
If we wanted to center it we could do.

65
00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.730
Margin.

66
00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.110
Auto save.

67
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.320
Now that's color the top and bottom.

68
00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:08.380
So border top dash color the color I'm using is 1 A B C 9 C we can save.

69
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:14.790
You can see we get that teal color up top and then we can do the same thing quarter bottom dash color

70
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.880
and that color is 3 4 9 8 D-B and save.

71
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.660
OK.

72
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:25.590
So we're getting there now we need to turn it into a circle so to do that.

73
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:33.260
It's just a matter of shorter radius and we'll just set it to be 50 percent and save and look at that.

74
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.420
We now have a circle where two of the sides are different colors.

75
00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.950
So now we want to animate it.

76
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:45.730
So let's define an animation and we'll just call it spin

77
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.060
and all we want it to do is go from zero rotation to 360 degrees.

78
00:05:53.080 --> 00:06:03.820
So it's a very simple animation at 0 percent will do a transform rotate 0 degrees and just copy this

79
00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:07.390
and change it to be 100 percent.

80
00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.290
We want it to come back to 360 degrees all the way around.

81
00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:18.020
So then the last step would be to assign it animation.

82
00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:19.710
The name is spin.

83
00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.220
Let's go with two seconds linear and we want it to go forever.

84
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:30.590
Infinite that that's all it took to make a simple loading icon.

85
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.910
So there's a bunch of other things you could do to play with this one kind of fun example is to also

86
00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.290
change these colors as they're going around.

87
00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.120
So I can do that now.

88
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:45.090
I'll copy this but I'm going to turn it into spin too.

89
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.910
Let's call it colored spin.

90
00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:54.240
And rather than just having it go from zero to 100 and rotating.

91
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.510
We could also add in let's say 25 percent.

92
00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:00.850
Let's do Forder.

93
00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.340
Top color.

94
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:10.510
And just for demo purposes I'm going to pick an ugly obvious color like red and do the same thing for

95
00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:14.060
border bottom color red.

96
00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:15.540
It will look better by the end.

97
00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:23.240
But first let's assign colored spin just like that.

98
00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:24.180
OK.

99
00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:25.960
So you can see we're getting some color change.

100
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:28.530
It's not ideal the colors that we are actually getting.

101
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.440
But if we duplicate this again.

102
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:35.220
And do the same thing for 50 percent

103
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:39.810
and then 75 percent

104
00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.430
and I'm going to go get some nice colors and replace the red with these nice hex codes.

105
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:49.800
I'll be right back.

106
00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:50.670
OK.

107
00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:51.710
So I'm back.

108
00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:57.160
I put in some hexadecimal codes rather than just using that built in red color.

109
00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.870
It looks a little bit nicer already.

110
00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:05.240
But I kind of think that the color change is happening too quickly compared to the speed of the rotation.

111
00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:10.840
So what we could do is actually make two separate animations one for colored change and give that a

112
00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:15.930
speed of two seconds and make another one for the rotation and give that a speed of 1 second.

113
00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:17.450
As an example.

114
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.430
But the other thing we could do is just change the amount that we're actually rotating.

115
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:31.660
So I could instead of going to be under 60 degrees I could say we're now rotating 720 degrees which

116
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.600
will go twice as fast to start.

117
00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.240
But then I can go up here.

118
00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:39.150
And slow that down to four seconds.

119
00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:44.730
And now that color change it's much more gradual but the rotation is still the same speed.

120
00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:51.210
And if you want to get really crazy we could add in a slight scale so we can have it start at scale

121
00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:54.810
1 and end at scale 1

122
00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:59.280
and then halfway through

123
00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:08.060
Let's have it grow just a tiny bit to scale 1.2.

124
00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:08.670
There we go.

125
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:09.880
And that might be too much.

126
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.920
Let's try 1.1 now.

127
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:18.830
Now I do need to change this number of course to be 360 degrees for halfway through.

128
00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:21.360
You can see now it continuously spins.

129
00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:29.630
Hopefully that makes sense why if I have it rotate 720 degrees halfway through and 720 by the end it's

130
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:35.300
already hit 720 here so it doesn't continue to rotate and you might think I don't need that rotate there

131
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:42.080
but remember that the way that this works is that when we use transform and we estimate it we need to

132
00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:47.870
be specific about every single property and that if we say transform is only scale that overrides the

133
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:49.500
existing animation.

134
00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:51.740
So we need that rotate 360.

135
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:52.600
OK.

136
00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.170
So there's our simple floating icon.

137
00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:57.520
It might even bring it down a little bit.

138
00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:02.300
One point 0 5 had a very slight scale cool.

139
00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:03.900
So that wraps up the loading part.

140
00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:09.380
If you are curious I did have this kind of jokey thing at the bottom that loads a couple seconds later

141
00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.090
that says it actually never load.

142
00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:13.480
You silly goose if you want to see how to make that.

143
00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:15.070
It's very very simple.

144
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:19.020
We can just add in an age to that says it never loads.

145
00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:26.680
You silly goose then Ormand do is animate that and the simplest animation we could do is faded in.

146
00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:31.330
So we'll do at keyframes let's call it a appear.

147
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.770
Zero percent capacity is zero.

148
00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:41.420
One hundred percent opacity is one.

149
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:50.360
Now we just need to go up to our restyling that H2 right here and we'll just add an animation the name

150
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.570
of it which is a peer.

151
00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:58.640
We want it to take let's say one second to appear but we want it to have a delay.

152
00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:00.610
We don't want it to happen immediately.

153
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:06.710
Let's give it a three second delay and the only other thing we need to do is set the initial state to

154
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:09.920
be opacity zero so that we don't see it.

155
00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:16.120
And now wait three seconds and it appears there's only one small problem which is it also disappears

156
00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.600
at the end onset and emission finishes.

157
00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:26.740
So if you remember animation film direction we can just add in four words at the end and save it now

158
00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:29.880
wait for it to happen again and never load you silly goose.

159
00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.210
And it remains.

160
00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:37.240
And if you want it to add a bit more space rather than just doing margin auto on the loader you could

161
00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:42.500
just add a margin top or bottom if you want to have let's say 100 pixels.

One question you might have at this point is how do you actually stop the loader and replace it with

163
00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:50.230
other content that's typically done with javascript.

164
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:56.080
There isn't really a way to do that with SS unless you want to have it on some sort of automatic timer.

165
00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.470
So after 10 seconds it disappears you could NMD that.

166
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:06.550
But if you are actually trying to have it appear until the actual loading of some asset an image an

167
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.990
API call finishes then you need javascript to do that.

168
00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:16.030
But most people do is set the visibility to none or displayed none of this loading icon and replace

169
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:19.040
it with whatever content is behind.

170
00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:19.270
All right.

171
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:23.350
So that was fun to make and hopefully you feel like you have a good grasp of keyframes.
