00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.570
So we left off building a simple form for email and password.

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.910
But it looks like when we tried to put in any information inside of here we're not really getting anything.

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.280
And that's because we haven't implemented our handle change or handle submit.

4
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.500
So let's go implement that handle change function.

5
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.800
So we'll do here is use the experimental syntax but we don't have to do method binding in the constructor.

6
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.120
So instead of just making a function call handle change we're going to use aero functions.

7
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.910
So we can get the correct value of the key word this.

8
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.390
So I'll say this starts at c and inside we'll use a computer property name.

9
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.980
You can look at that.

10
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.480
Yes 20:15 computed property names.

11
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.560
Well the key is that target that name and the value is whatever you target that value was.

12
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.140
This is great.

13
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.160
So we can make a generic handle change for any of our inputs.

14
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.700
We type in here that looks good but when we type in you know password is also changing.

15
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.450
Let's go take a look at these inputs and let's make sure that the names are correct.

16
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.870
So if we look inside of e-mail we can see something is incorrect.

17
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.160
So we can spot it.

18
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.080
Let's first make sure that that has the type of password

19
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.510
so we see that even when we type that in something still missing.

20
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.160
Why is that the case.

21
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.930
Let's go take a look at these value props.

22
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:21.710
So what's the problem there.

23
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.200
We want to get rid of that value attribute for a password.

24
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.160
So if we type this in we see the second one that isn't changing.

25
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.510
And I just want to clear out this email in case there's any private data that you're seeing

26
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.000
so it looks like a copy and paste job done badly.

27
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.600
But we should be fixed right now.

28
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.610
So what happens if we're dealing with a different kind of form.

29
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.510
So we should be seeing some additional fields for image you r l and usery.

30
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.630
So inside of our means yes we're going to pass in another product called Sign-Up and we're going to

31
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:59.030
restructure that inside of our form so we can grab that sign up and here let's read a little bit of

32
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:06.620
conditional logic here we're simply going to say if there is that Propp of Zeina then let's go display

33
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.290
those two additional inputs inside of here.

34
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.480
We'll start with the divx.

35
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.440
Make sure we have that div..

36
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:15.390
Good.

37
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.310
And inside if you're going to grab those two inputs we're copying pasting a little bit dangerous but

38
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.710
make sure that our syntax is correct and a little bit each of these labels shouldn't be for an email.

39
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:31.420
This should be for a user name and a value the user name and that should be an ID to match up with the

40
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.080
HDMI for we don't want to value here.

41
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.250
We want it to be username we want a value to be for user name and instead of a password Albi image you

42
00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.490
are looking at the text of a label for image you are all we want that idea to match up with the force

43
00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.930
or make sure that the idea is image that you are all for the attribute.

44
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.520
We'll call that profile image you are.

45
00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.050
And finally inside of retape we don't need that to be a password we'll just make sure that that's text.

46
00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.950
So add a value attribute in case there are any errors and will pass in that profile image.

47
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:03.610
You are off.

48
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:04.640
Let's see this.

49
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:05.780
Let's go refresh the page.

50
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.370
And if you look at the Senate form we're actually getting e-mail password username and image you are

51
00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.470
allowed to log in.

52
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.480
We don't see that.

53
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:13.270
That's great.

54
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:15.410
So inside of me.

55
00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.000
Yes.

56
00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.800
We just passed in a prop called Sign up and we checked to see any off or on if we don't have that don't

57
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.670
show those other two inputs.

58
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.490
Just the idea of displaying something if it's truthy so it doesn't of is true the display doesn't vote.

59
00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.120
Otherwise don't.

60
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.340
So here we can add a little bit of conditional logic to show those inputs before we take a quick break.

61
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.020
Let's think about what our handle Samit function is going to look like.

62
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.790
We're going have to think about is how to correctly pass in the right function to dispatch and that's

63
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.720
going to be a little bit trickier.

64
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:57.520
So we want to think about is first inside of us what can we pass to each of these off form get the correct

65
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.710
function to sign up or sign in to do that.

66
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.690
We're going to start reading some actions and we'll do that in the next video.
