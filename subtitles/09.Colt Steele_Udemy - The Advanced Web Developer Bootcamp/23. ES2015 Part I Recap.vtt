00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:01.730
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:05.730
In this video we're going to briefly recap what we've learned so far.

3
00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:11.140
We've seen that as 2015 adds quite a bit of functionality to the language but since the last update

4
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.940
came in 2009 it's been quite a while.

5
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:20.420
We also saw that we've named six to 2015 since new features will now be added every year.

6
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:27.100
We saw that as 2015 gives us two new keywords for declaring variables constant unlet constant chores

7
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.050
that we can not redeclare a variable and let gives us block scope.

8
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:38.530
Yes 2015 also allows us to easily evaluate variables in strings and create multiline strings with as

9
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.590

10
20:15 template strings.

11
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.280
Don't forget the batiks.

12
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.890
We saw how to write more concise functions using the arrow function syntax but we also saw that these

13
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.260
functions do not get their own key word this and arguments so we need to be mindful of that when we're

14
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.520
using them.

15
00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.800
We saw how to gather arguments to a function as an array using the rest operator and spread out values

16
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.660
in an array to another function using three dots or the spread operator.

17
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.850
We then saw how to write more concise methods and property names using object shorthand notation and

18
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.620
computed property names.

19
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:18.310
Finally we saw that we can use destructuring to unpack values from objects and arrays for the next exercise.

20
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.350
It's time to take two E.S. five application and refactor it to use.

21
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.640
Yes 2015.

22
00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.640
Good luck and I'll see you in the next video.
