1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,760
It's time to meet our next instructor Tim Garcia Tim doesn't really like talking about himself so I

2
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:07,200
mean to do it for him.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,130
Tim is the most experienced developer on our team.

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,010
He was building web sites before I was in kindergarten and it's now because he's old.

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,470
It's because basically he's a point genius.

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,150
He started building websites when he was in middle school.

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,670
And it's gone on since then.

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,320
He spent five years at Amazon.

9
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:25,040
And what were we doing there.

10
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,600
I was working on a lot of different Kindle products.

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,480
And then you have Amazon to teach.

12
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,360
Yeah I found my way into teaching to general assembly.

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,600
That's how we met.

14
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,330
We got together there four years ago.

15
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,050
Yeah.

16
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:39,670
Four years.

17
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,940
And then we left went to galvanize there together.

18
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,880
And then Tim left to do what.

19
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:45,570
Yeah.

20
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,130
About a year ago we started rhythm school which is where we are right now.

21
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,220
On top of being a really talented developer Tim it's just a really great guy.

22
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,740
Tim you're obviously super skilled developer.

23
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,410
What drew you to teaching.

24
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,870
I think the biggest thing was just helping people.

25
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:05,220
I love seeing people learn and growing and then also teaching the material I'm really interested in

26
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,250
teaching software development to people.

27
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:12,170
So speaking of the material in the book captured we talk together at rhythm here.

28
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,900
There's a lot of stuff they teach.

29
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,280
I mean what three to six months of content.

30
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,130
What's your what's your thing.

31
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,240
What do you prefer to teach and what are you going to teach in this course.

32
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,170
My favorite is definitely reacts.

33
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:27,330
I've grown to really love re-act over the past couple years I've given a lot of conference talks about

34
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:33,320
it and I think it's just a joy to cope with so I hope you enjoy it as well as being humble.

35
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,550
Tim is just a beast with react and you'll see him.

36
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,290
That's going to be kind of a specialty in this course but you'll see him before then as well talking

37
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,050
about some javascript stuff.
