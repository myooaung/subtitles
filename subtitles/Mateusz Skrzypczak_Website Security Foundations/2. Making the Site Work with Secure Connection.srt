1
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:11,350
When you have the certificate already installed, just navigate to your site typing htp as first.

2
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:16,300
This is a preview of how your site will work on the SSL.

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:23,260
Before you officially start using and enforcing the school connection, you need to make sure everything

4
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:23,800
works.

5
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,640
That is, everything looks and works as expected.

6
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:35,590
The padlock in the URL bar is not crossed out, which means there are no mixed content warnings and

7
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,350
you can log into your admin panel if you have one.

8
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:49,260
When you protect your site with SSL, there's completely no sense to have parts of your sites protected

9
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,790
and parts unprotected.

10
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,520
First, do not mix the encrypted and unencrypted content on one page.

11
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:03,660
Using encrypted and unencrypted content from the same domain can, for example, lead to leaking information

12
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,430
from cookies like session IDs or when using secure cookies.

13
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,320
These cookies will not be sent at all to those resources which may be causing errors.

14
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:18,560
Second, don't protect only selected pages on your site.

15
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:24,380
Let's say you protect the log in form only if you don't protect the rest of the site, then you don't

16
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:30,590
protect anything because you effectively let the session I.D. travel through network in plaintext and

17
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:36,690
anyone monitoring the network can act as the logged in use their third.

18
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:42,950
It simply doesn't make any sense and the whole system is pretty much as weak as its weakest component.

19
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,160
If you already have the certificate, do use it.

20
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,790
Sitewide.

21
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:55,350
Especially if you have an already life site before forcing the use of SSL, you first needs to get rid

22
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,000
of any HTP you are.

23
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:05,850
As for all the resources on your site images, scripts, styles, iframes, etc. for all the resources

24
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:12,810
that you keep on your server, ideally switch to relative paths and for other resources from external

25
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,320
domains you need to change HTP to HTP s.

26
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:26,250
So if you had this change HTP to HTP s and of course verify if that works, it must work.

27
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,460
Otherwise, your site will constantly have mixed content errors.

28
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:36,210
You can optionally make your protocol a relative by starting with two slashes.

29
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:44,870
This will perform HTP s request on HTP site and HTP request on HTP site.

30
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:52,460
But since the city is expected to work well on HDP s, there's absolutely no point not to reference

31
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,250
just HDP as you are.

32
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,540
Even if you are still on ATP.

33
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:04,440
If you are not sure which resource is causing the mixed content warning, you can use the network tab

34
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,760
in developer tools to see which resources were requested with unsecure protocol.

35
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,780
In WordPress and possibly in other cases too.

36
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:24,500
If you have any images or internal links in post content, they are absolute URLs.

37
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:31,760
Meaning instead of being a relative path to the post or image, they are absolute with your domain name

38
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,830
and unfortunately the protocol.

39
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,740
Those needs to be fixed as well.

40
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,430
Because otherwise you will keep getting the mixed content warnings.

41
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:47,450
Doing it manually would be a tedious job on the side with lots of content already published, so you

42
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,380
can automate it.

43
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,500
But if you just thought of doing a search, replace on your WordPress database dump, please don't.

44
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:01,670
The reason for that is that part of the content and settings sits in the database in the form of a serialized

45
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,860
objects or serialized arrays.

46
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,510
It looks like this.

47
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:10,340
You are probably well aware about the purposes of serialization.

48
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:17,990
It is to store a non simple type like array or object in a database field which is capable of storing

49
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:21,740
numbers or strings but not be to be arrays or objects.

50
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,980
In this case we have a B array.

51
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:32,660
The key thing about serialization that makes it impossible for us to successfully perform a simple search

52
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:37,010
and replace is that it stores the length of each key and the value.

53
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:45,950
See, the title is preceded by semicolon five semicolon, which means it's a string SW letter with five

54
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:46,640
characters.

55
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:57,050
The same goes for a URL which is a string with 29 chars adding s to change HTP protocol to HTP s will

56
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:02,930
make the word a 30 characters long, so this serialized array will most likely become corrupt.

57
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,190
Now I will discuss the WordPress specific solutions.

58
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,770
So if you don't use the platform, you can skip the rest of this video.

59
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,240
To deal with the problem of legacy protocol.

60
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:25,890
In post content, you can either upgrade to WordPress 5.7, which offers a one click migration mechanism.

61
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:27,990
Use a plugin.

62
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:32,190
However, I am an advocate of using plugins only as a last resort.

63
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:38,760
Or use a WordPress.com online interface which makes the search and replace very easy.

64
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,860
Let's first explore the last option because it's useful anyway.

65
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:50,790
Some hosting companies have CLIA already installed and you can use it on your existing WordPress sites

66
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,590
if you have shell access to the server.

67
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,990
If you don't have shell access, you can install and use the CLIA on your computer.

68
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:05,400
It works well on the UNIX like environments, Mac and Linux and unfortunately has limited support on

69
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:05,940
Windows.

70
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:13,080
Installing WordPress CLIA needs you to use command line of course, but it's easy and you don't need

71
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,160
to install any package managers first, like with many other useful tools.

72
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:25,050
You only need to download the far file, make it executable with smolt and move it to your path.

73
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:32,110
Please refer to installation guide on the wordpress dot org or WB dash CLIA dot org.

74
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:45,210
There is a couple of scenarios in which you can use CLIA directly on the server with Shell locally on

75
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:52,770
your computer, on local copy of your site and database or locally on your computer, on local copy

76
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:56,100
of your site, but directly on the remote database.

77
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,610
The first scenario is obvious.

78
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:06,330
In the second scenario, you need to of course, have the web server software running on your computer

79
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:16,410
map, samp, etc. make a local copy of your site files on your local server, import your site's database

80
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,480
dump to your local database server.

81
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:27,510
For example, using PDB, my admin and finally change the database settings in WP Config PDB so that

82
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:31,740
it will point to your life site's database dump the one that you want to work on.

83
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:42,130
In the third scenario, you can skip step three and just change the database settings in WP config BHP

84
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,860
so that it will point to your remote database.

85
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:52,000
But note that not all servers allow remote connections to database server, so you may not be able to

86
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,440
work in this scenario at all.

87
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:59,990
When you're all set up, here are the next steps to run this search to replace Common.

88
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:07,440
First make a backup copy of your database, whether it's a local copy or the remote database.

89
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:12,720
In case you make a mistake or something goes wrong, you will be able to quickly recover.

90
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,030
If you work on your remote server with still access, connect to your server.

91
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:24,840
If you work on your local computer, open the command line tool, CMD terminal or whatever you use.

92
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:32,430
Then navigate to your site's root directory is the one where your site's WP config file sits.

93
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:37,480
You do that type CWG and the Path or Sydney and the path.

94
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:44,430
If you're working on Mac, it's important because the site relies on the database settings provided

95
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,020
in the WP config file.

96
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,580
Database name.

97
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,190
Log in password and the host.

98
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:59,890
Now run the WP search dash replace command like this of course changing example dot com to your sites

99
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:00,400
you are a.

100
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:10,910
This comment will replace all non-exhaustive tips URLs to 80 tips URLs taking care of serialized objects

101
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,590
and updating the character count.

102
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:19,580
And it will process all tables with matching prefix that is not only WordPress system tables but also

103
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:23,150
those created by plugins if only they have the correct prefix.

104
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,960
We were working on a copy, but if you are still afraid of doing the search, replace immediately.

105
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,180
You can add a dry run flag.

106
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:37,670
It will not do any changes to your database and only return the report.

107
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,770
What it is going to change in a normal run and you are done.

108
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:49,790
If you were working on your computer and local database server rather than on the remote database export,

109
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:53,330
the database would just work on and import it to your server.

110
00:09:55,310 --> 00:10:00,830
There are other options to the search replace tool, including exporting the result to a skill file

111
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,800
which you might choose to do instead of working on a copy.

112
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,550
The documentation is available on WordPress sites.

113
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:14,680
The search replaced.

114
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:21,250
All will help you also in the future to not only ease transition to IDPs, but anytime you need to change

115
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:21,640
this site.

116
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:29,680
URL For example, in staging environment, I usually build a site locally using some custom local domain.

117
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:36,040
Then when I'm about to show it to the client, I need to put it on my server on a publicly accessible

118
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:42,220
domain like site one dot example dot com and is the time to use search replace tool.

119
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:47,140
Then when it's ready, we can publish it under the final domain.

120
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,510
W w w example dot com.

121
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:54,130
Once again, using search replace to change all URLs in the database.

122
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,020
As you see, I need to change the site.

123
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,960
You are a twice during development of a single site.

124
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:04,350
The search replace tool makes it super easy.

125
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:13,690
But I also mentioned that after upgrading to WordPress 5.7, you can use a built in one click migration

126
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:14,290
mechanism.

127
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:20,440
This is a really great new feature because as you just saw, the process of changing URLs in a site

128
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,980
that already have some content desperately needed improvement.

129
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:31,330
So after you get the certificate, you simply need to go to the diagnostic screen and after a while

130
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:34,610
you'll see a notification that the site doesn't use HTP.

131
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:38,380
S protocol with the button that allows you to make a switch.
