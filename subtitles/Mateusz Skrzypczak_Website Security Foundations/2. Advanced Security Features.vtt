00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.700
There's a couple of other things that will enforce your suicide security and they're highly recommended.

2
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.450
Rename a logging page which typically is WP Admin and WP log in BGP.

3
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:27.510
Limit the number of invalid log in trace, implement honeypot and CAPTCHA protection for registration,

4
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.650
log in and lost password forms and block bet queries and requests containing dangerous characters.

5
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.840
But all these are not as simple as putting a line or two in the function speech file.

6
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.000
That's why I used the plug in for that.

7
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.930
All in one word for security and firewall is my plugin of choice, which I used for quite some time

8
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:51.980
and which I trust.

9
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.850
If you prefer, you can use other plug in that you trust more.

10
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:04.550
In all in one WordPress security and firewall, there's quite a lot of options to turn on or off in

11
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:05.230
the dashboard.

12
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:10.220
You have an indicator how many features are on and the status of critical features.

13
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:20.150
When going through settings, I recommend you to turn on whatever you can, if only you understand the

14
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.540
descriptions and potential implications of each feature.

15
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.240
Here are some highlights in settings on the WordPress version info tab.

16
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.820
Enable the option if you didn't choose to manually put the code I showed earlier, which changes the

17
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.440
version numbers into hashes.

18
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.510
In user log in enable the log in logged on feature.

19
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.680
Set a reasonable number of logging attempts.

20
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:46.940
For example five.

21
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.710
The time in which that number of attempts need to happen to log the account and the time for which the

22
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.060
account will be locked out.

23
00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.010
For example, 60 Minutes.

24
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.230
I usually want to be notified by email to.

25
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.970
In user registrations enable as much as is reasonable for you.

26
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.880
If you have lots of legitimate registrations, the manual approval will probably not make much sense.

27
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.780
But honey pot is always a good idea.

28
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.020
In firewall.

29
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.570
Also check as much options as you can from the first two tabs.

30
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.960
I never use XM or PC, so I always disable it.

31
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.470
I used to have attacked attempts exploiting this protocol.

32
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.410
If you use it, at least disable the ping backs.

33
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.350
The addition of the Firewallrules and Six Blacklist Firewallrules snaps feature some of the things we

34
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.000
discussed in earlier chapters.

35
00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.940
Disabling listing of directory contents.

36
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.980
Disabling Trace and tracking methods.

37
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.770
And this six G firewall, you may want to manually implement seven G firewall instead of the six g embedded

38
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:14.460
in the plug in.

39
00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.130
In brute force.

40
00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.410
Use the rename log in page feature.

41
00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.430
Make it something unpredictable if you're the only user of your site.

42
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.680
If you have multiple users, make it something logical but not typical to WordPress.

43
00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.540
For example, sign in.

44
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.050
On subsequent dumps, you may want to turn on capture for a lost passport form.

45
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.330
But turning it on for a log in form might be too annoying for legitimate users.

46
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.140
I would rather turn it on only if your site is under attack.

47
00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.550
Blogging.

48
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.750
Honeypot, on the other hand, is always a good idea because it's invisible for valid users.

49
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.490
In spun prevention, you can capture and block spam bots if you suffer from spam and don't use any other

50
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.020
solution like a casement.

51
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.340
Finally, in miscellaneous, you can enable a couple of features we discussed earlier.

52
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.170
You can enable extreme options ATP Header to prevent click jacking.

53
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.570
And block users enumeration.

54
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.200
You can also completely block the rest API but beware some plugins.

55
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.680
Use it.
