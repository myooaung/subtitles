Energy firewall, currently being the seven G firewall is a quite complex set of rules that creates

2
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.980
a pretty strong firewall for your site is being published and maintained by Jeff Starr from perishable

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:19.700
press dot com.

4
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:28.730
It offers a complex protection against dangerous requests nor injection methods, bad bots, automated

5
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.950
attacks, spam and more.

6
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.530
It's very easy to implement.

7
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.320
Just download the package and copy the text file contents in your site's root HD Access file.

8
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.200
There is a possibility that part of your eyesight may stop working correctly.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.620
Your own requests can be captured by the firewall.

10
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.880
In such case, try to debugging by selectively disabling the firewall rules and seeing if that makes

11
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:19.750
the site work.

12
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.310
For example, I often need to remove the words and code from the list of illegal words in string filter

13
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.460
because I use the component with the word and coder in its name, which gets blocked with certain requests.
