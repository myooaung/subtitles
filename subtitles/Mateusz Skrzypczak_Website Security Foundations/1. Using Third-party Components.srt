00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:12,210
Third party components are all pieces of code that build your project, which you or your team didn't

2
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:19,690
write all frameworks, libraries, plugins or scripts released by people outside of your organization.

3
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:26,680
It's virtually impossible to code everything by yourself in any medium to large project either when

4
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,240
you build a site on the CMS.

5
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:33,280
Use a framework to speed up development or just don't want to reinvent the wheel.

6
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:39,310
But I always try and I encourage you to minimize the number of third party components.

7
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:46,900
Placing a ready piece of code often seems like a fine idea to save some time and have the job done.

8
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,150
But there's a lot that can go wrong.

9
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,960
Third party components are often open source projects used by many websites.

10
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:01,260
Attackers will search for potential security holes in popular libraries and scripts to be able to carry

11
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,810
out the same attack on lots of websites.

12
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:10,940
Some scripts available on the Internet are simply poorly coded, and they can have obvious security

13
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:11,810
vulnerabilities.

14
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:18,700
Also, some people will stop maintaining their projects at some point and any potential security holes

15
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,440
will not be fixed anymore.

16
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:27,610
Also, you need to monitor all your dependencies for upgrades, especially those related to security.

17
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:33,520
And when the new version is released, you need to integrate it in your project and test if it will

18
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,630
still be compatible.

19
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,900
So the more third party components you choose to put in your project, the more potential vulnerabilities

20
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,920
you introduce and the more effort it will need from you to maintain it.

21
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:52,390
Having said all that, I will encourage you in this course to use some third party solutions for certain

22
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:59,080
highly complicated and really difficult tasks where any in-house solution would be simply insufficient.

23
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:07,330
Finally, let me give you a couple of hints how to choose a good third party component, a part of checking

24
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,690
if it fulfills all your requirements and has a proper license.

25
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:17,860
See if it's actively maintained and have an active support when it's free, then at least a decent forum

26
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,170
or community board would definitely help.

27
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,500
Verify the latest release date.

28
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,880
If it's not within 12 months, it might have been already abandoned.

29
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,170
See if people are using it or talking about it.

30
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,610
On PM see the right column.

31
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,490
On GitHub.

32
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,720
Check the issue step.

33
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:58,230
Download it only from trusted sources like author website or unofficial GitHub repository and try to

34
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:03,280
analyze if it's of a good quality security wise, performance wise, etc..

35
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:10,350
This may be very hard to verify on your own, but if you are about to use a renowned popular library

36
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:15,450
which has a lot of active users, then you can assume it's at least of a decent quality.
