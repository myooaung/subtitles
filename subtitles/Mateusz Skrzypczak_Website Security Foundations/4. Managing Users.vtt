If your site is going to have multiple users be subscribers or authors.

2
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.660
There is a couple of things to note.

3
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.980
First of all, don't give out admin access to anyone.

4
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.650
Each person should have their own account with a role limited to what this person is going to do.

5
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:28.160
For example, if someone's responsibility is to manage content, the role of editor would be enough.

6
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.060
However, editors cannot edit menus.

7
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.290
Only admins can.

8
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:40.190
But it's better to only add a single capability to the editor role than assigning admin role to editors.

9
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.070
You can add the capability to the role by using other methods of the WordPress role.

10
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.730
Objects.

11
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.580
This code is adapted from WordPress documentation.

12
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.950
It's a little more complicated than the simple function execution because it will only add the role

13
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:05.000
on theme activation and not on every request because that would be unnecessary and would slow down each

14
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.660
page load.

15
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:14.150
So the function and the edit theme options capability to edit or roll on theme activation and to remove

16
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.790
it from that roll on theme deactivation.

17
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.130
After you put that code in function speech by file, you will need to deactivate and reactivate your

18
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.380
theme for this change to take place.

19
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.020
The editing team options capability will grant access to a number of pages under appearance section

20
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.610
widgets, menus and customize if it's supported by the current theme.

21
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.240
It means editors will gain access not only to menus but also to widgets and some theme options.

22
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.420
But they still will not be able to install or switch themes which is possible with admin access.

23
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:06.290
You may also want to remove certain information from the admin panel from admins to create the wordpress

24
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.650
update.

25
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.020
Nag from non admins.

26
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.140
Use this code.

27
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.290
It utilizes the current user can function which we learned earlier and the manage options capability

28
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.610
specific for admins.

29
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.750
This snippet will also hide the thank you message from the future.

30
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.400
And you can remove it for adding this tool for convenience by removing the if statement.

31
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.800
The last snippet will hide the WordPress version from none admins, which is displayed in the footer

32
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.580
on the right.
