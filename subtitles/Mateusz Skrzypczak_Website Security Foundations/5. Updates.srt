1
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,540
Finally keep an eye on updates.

2
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:15,020
Of course, constant updates of the core and every component is usually a utopia, and simply turning

3
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:20,840
on automatic upgrades of everything on the life site can cause big trouble because certain components

4
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,760
could change over time to a point when they will not be compatible anymore with the rest.

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,300
Luckily, you can get security and maintenance upgrades automatically for older versions too, but only

6
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,590
for WordPress core.

7
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,430
So definitely what for plugin and theme updates?

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,420
They do not have a separate QB for security fixes like coders.

9
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,120
All versions do not receive patches.

10
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,540
If a vulnerability was found, you need to update the whole component.

11
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:54,110
At some point you may realize that the new plugin or theme version will not be compatible anymore with

12
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,700
the WordPress version that you have.

13
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,230
Then you will need to upgrade the core as well or switch to another plugin.

14
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:06,080
It's a good idea to subscribe to WordPress Vulnerability Database.

15
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,390
It's a service that scans WordPress core plugins and themes for security holes.

16
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,870
They offer free and paid plans in the free plan.

17
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:24,140
You have limited access to API and in premium plans you can get more API calls and also instant notifications

18
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,700
whenever something is found.
