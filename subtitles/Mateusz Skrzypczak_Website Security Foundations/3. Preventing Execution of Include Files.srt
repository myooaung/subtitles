00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:12,320
An attacker who knows the filesystem structure of your site could try their luck directly executing

2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,400
BHP files, which are only meant to be included in your site.

3
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:24,140
Such files executed out of your site's intended context could disclose some valuable info oracles errors

4
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,400
to ensure something like that doesn't happen.

5
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:34,310
You can define a global constant in your app before any inclusions and check for its existence at the

6
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,260
beginning of each include file.

7
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,530
The constant name can be pretty much anything

8
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:42,470
now.

9
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:48,290
Anyone trying to directly open the included file will get that direct execution not allowed the message

10
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,970
as a response from the server.

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:57,710
Also, if someone would tried to remotely include your BGP file, don't worry as they would only be

12
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:02,210
able to get the final output of the script, not the script itself.

13
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,950
So your variables, constants, functions, etc. are safe.

14
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:13,400
They are executed on your server and only what they generate as the output can be read this way.

15
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,830
Even if the attacker defined the necessary constant in their file, it will not be transferred to your

16
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:20,280
script.

17
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,700
In order to completely block remote access to your include files, you should either move them out of

18
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:33,860
the document route, move them to a folder where you deny any external access.

19
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,690
Or set strict permissions.

20
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,450
For example.

21
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,300
6400.

22
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:43,030
