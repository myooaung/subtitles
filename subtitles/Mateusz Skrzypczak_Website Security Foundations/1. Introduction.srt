1
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:05,850
Okay.

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,020
Let's first try to organize our thoughts.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,110
What does make a website secure or not, in my view?

4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:19,390
A secure website is the one that doesn't use outdated and insecure software and technologies resides

5
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:26,110
in a work configured environment which protects all of its components, uses encrypted connection for

6
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:33,220
data transfer, thoroughly verifies any data coming from the outside, also from its users before processing

7
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,470
it with methods that can be fooled.

8
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:43,360
Protects any sensitive data and functionalities from unauthorized access, doesn't reveal too much information

9
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,390
about itself, how it's constructed and how it works.

10
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:54,610
Doesn't let any external environments influence itself and is able to fend off any automated attacks

11
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:58,390
that are carried out to break the security systems or disrupted.

12
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:04,410
As you see, the list is quite long and the terms are very broad indeed.

13
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:09,850
In this course we bring up a number of different areas on which a web developer can improve the safety.

14
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:18,100
All of these are involved server configuration, frontend code, backend code, selection of third party

15
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:24,700
components, configuration of quantum management systems if used, and adoption of certain processes

16
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,010
targeted at specific types of attacks.
