Finally, you need to consider your server storage limits.

2
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:16.390
A malicious user can potentially bloat your server with uploads if you don't limit and monitor this

3
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.280
space usage.

4
00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:25.400
So you need to keep your file size limit tight, meaning don't set it to something like 32 megabytes.

5
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.670
If you don't expect such large files.

6
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.600
You don't need to change the IP EU directive.

7
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:40.150
You can enforce the limit in your upload processing script, limit the file, upload capability to registered

8
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:48.040
and verified users only, which will be able to easily block and limit the total size of files a single

9
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.060
user can upload.

10
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:57.100
Also, logging file uploads and looking into these logs or statistics is always a good idea to spot

11
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.830
any unusual activities and react quickly.
