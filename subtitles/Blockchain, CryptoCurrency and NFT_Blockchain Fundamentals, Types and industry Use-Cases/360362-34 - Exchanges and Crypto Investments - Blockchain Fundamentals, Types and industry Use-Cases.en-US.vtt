00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.670
fine.

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:03.760
We have seen whole Blockchain works.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:08.150
Hope it going works how to use wallets to transact going between one another.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.870
What are the art goings available?

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.170
Except so there should be a starting point when you need some big going to transact to

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:16.640
others,

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.190
right?

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.050
What are the ways of getting a Bitcoin in the first place?

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.570
The first option,

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.860
as we have seen already,

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:23.750
is by mining.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.270
When you are a minor,

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.430
the Bitcoin ecosystem and you mine a block,

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.450
you are rewarded with that block reward that is 12.5 Bitcoins currently,

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.720
plus the transaction fee also comes to the minor.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.780
So this answers on a very important question that would be lingering in your mind.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:41.240
By now,

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.900
Bitcoin has been captured 21 million total coins by the year 2000 140.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.100
What happened after that?

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.980
40 miners?

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.230
Because if they might,

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.280
they would not get the block.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.060
We were right.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.150
The answer lies in construction feast.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.550
After that,

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.140
I really think the transaction fee will go high for each transaction so that the miners

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.610
will be watered enough for mining their blocks.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:10.900
Another option is to extend your fear currency in tow Cryptocurrency through exchanges.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.370
So what is fear?

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.880
Currency?

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.980
Feer currencies All our USD cny I in our exit from which we use in the real world feer

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:25.210
currencies are regulated and that's a place control by the garden mint off each nation on.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.520
We need some foreign exchange to convert one Fiat currency to the other in the same way.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.550
If you want to convert your feet currency into cryptocurrencies,

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.650
exchanges will help.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.870
So these are about exchanges that help Can what?

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.630
Fiat currency into cryptocurrencies.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.400
There are two types of exchanges.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.970
One is the first time that we saw there You can exchange your Fiat currency USD or CRE,

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.990
into a workable currency like Bitcoin Narita.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.490
Other one is called Bitcoin Exchange very can convert your Bitcoins into eater or light

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.530
going exactly so initially who will be the people who are selling this cryptocurrencies in

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.670
the exchanges will be the miners themselves because that is the only way to create Bitcoins

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.670
.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:04.820
So if I am a minor,

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.590
I've been getting a lot of Bitcoins because I've been mining a lot off blocks.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.230
What will I do with all the Bitcoins?

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.540
Right,

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.100
So I go to an exchange and then I can sell it for real money from you.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.790
So that's how Bitcoins coming to the ecosystem and we can start using.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.470
I'm trading in because nowadays,

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.650
the difference between these exchanges feared exchanging Alcor in exchange,

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.090
but is becoming quite diminished because every exchange,

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.660
for example,

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.320
by announced,

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.980
is both off yet exchange andan alkaline exchange?

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:31.290
No.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.030
So they are increasing their features to include include board for yet and all clients.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.500
In their extent on bus,

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.450
the difference is becoming quite diminished.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.850
Good enough now that we know how to convert our forget money into crypto currency and how

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.750
corporate cryptocurrencies among each other,

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.200
using out foreign exchanges,

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.060
we need to also look at the risk that is involved in corporate investment.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.900
If you look at a traditional stock investment,

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.750
you have a physical company where you can see that and there is a CEO or chairman who have

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.260
their own annual meetings,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.160
and then they also give out their financial statements for your foot on the stock exchanges

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.510
are all regulated so that there is an upper cap per day.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.100
The stock price can go only by a maximum or 5% and after that there is no trading possible

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.280
for that particular stock.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.940
Same goes work down also,

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.420
so the stock place can go down only up to Viper's and age below,

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.440
which it is not possible.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.030
Right?

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.080
These kind of regulations does not exist in the crypto market,

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.350
So you get a person who wants to invest in Bitcoin as an investment.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.280
It might be very fruitful as in,

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.260
if you had invested something about $41 in 2010.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.560
Now it would be 80 million,

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.140
as we saw in the piece off example right.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.950
But it might go down as well,

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.980
so there is a lot of volatility in one in the crypt of market.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.030
So there is no regulation with sales maximum capital,

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.160
5% for today,

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.670
etcetera.

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:57.170
Hence it can go up from $3000 to $18,000 in a single day,

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.810
and in the contrary,

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.270
it can fall from $10,000 to $3000 on the same day.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.340
So that is the reason for high volatility in the capital investment.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.390
There's also something called liquidity.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.780
Let's say you buy some crypto coins,

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.710
live out all the famous cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin Czar material.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.460
Mexico's the new by something like a George coin or a CIA coin,

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:20.480
which are less alone.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.500
You pay a lot of them and keep it with yourself when you want to sell it and convert that

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.510
into Fiat currency,

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.630
they should be buyers off that right?

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.270
So what if there are no buyers?

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.040
You are investment on your number of cryptocurrencies that you have is not accepted in the

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.900
market or it's not in the daily trading limits at college.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.890
You wouldn't find buyers for your Cryptocurrency,

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.310
and that's when Lee Liquidity gets affected.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:49.280
There is also an extreme hype about this because everyone knows Bitcoin nowadays,

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.480
But nobody knows what is the underlying technology.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.650
Because there is an extreme hype,

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:54.760
the price might be very,

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.340
very volatile and that we need to take care off before we investing any Cryptocurrency.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.390
There is also different regulations in different countries.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:03.260
For example,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.840
US.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:04.300
Canada,

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.810
Russia,

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:05.500
Australia,

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.010
China,

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.610
Japan.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.980
They differ in the Cryptocurrency regulations.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.070
So some look at crypto currencies as an investment.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:18.450
Some look at it as an asset on the charge taxes on the returns that we're getting from

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.230
preferences.

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:23.760
So before you do some crypto investment you need to be aware off the particular regulation

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.100
in that particular country.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.720
There is also a problem off security.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.770
We have seen a lot of cases where cryptocurrencies were stolen from exchanges because

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.980
exchanges are centralised anyway.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.820
So if you are creating an account in an exchange and you have a public and private key,

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.520
that brevity might be compromised too.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.770
Well,

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.700
hacker on when he gets the private key off yours,

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.250
he can take all of your money without your consent because he asked the property and he can

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.770
sign the transactions digitally.

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.530
That is one more thing which we need to keep in mind before we get into crypto currency

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.550
investments always choose an exchange with chance.

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.800
Very high security are just a decent unless exchange that is better.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.460
Having said that,

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.620
I would recommend our lot rectum read Cryptocurrency Investments because I would like to

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.010
stay in new girl in the schools.

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.850
I'm just giving you knowledge about it.

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:16.750
And you are the best church if you want to invest in cryptocurrencies or not.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:21.770
So in this section we saw all about hold the story or cryptocurrencies how to transact with

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:22.680
cryptocurrencies.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.130
What are the different cryptocurrencies available.

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:29.500
How do you convert your feet Money into cryptocurrencies and how to convert

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.010
cryptocurrencies between each other?

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.320
A lot of cryptocurrencies Cryptocurrencies.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:33.590
Right?

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.160
So that is what this section was all about.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.050
Hope you had a good understanding about cryptocurrencies on exchanges.

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:45.150
Let's look at atrium smart contracts and other leaders in the next section off this course

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:45.150
.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:46.750
See you in the next section.
