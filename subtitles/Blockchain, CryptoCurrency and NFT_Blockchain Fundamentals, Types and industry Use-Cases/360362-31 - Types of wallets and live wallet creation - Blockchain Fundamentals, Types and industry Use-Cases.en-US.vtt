00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.550
know that we have seen how wallets work and then improvement over wall.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:04.900
It's called us HD wallets.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.770
Let's look at the types of Cryptocurrency Waller's nights off Cryptocurrency wanted is how

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.150
you access your wallet on done your public and private keep.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.270
So we have different types,

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:16.200
like online wallet,

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:16.560
paper,

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.890
wallet,

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:17.420
hardware,

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.770
wallet,

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:18.450
mobile wallet,

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.190
desktop wanted.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:25.710
Except so an online wallet is just a website where you go sign up like you do in a normal

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.020
social media website and you get your public and private key.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:29.390
There,

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.000
you can start transacting with your cryptocurrencies in their own land.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.410
Upsetting.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.900
There is also mobile wallet,

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.740
which acts as a mobile application.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.760
You can don't know that sign up for it,

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.350
and then you can start with your corporate crypto trading.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:48.600
One thing to notice that the mobile wallet ordered online wallet can only act us light

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.100
loads.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.220
It is not possible for these two wallets to act as a full lord and don't know the entire

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.440
Blockchain or do mining,

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.360
except for the purpose of mining,

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.840
are to get a full node.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.430
People usually get a desktop.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.800
Will it?

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.540
A testable.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.070
It is some A software which you don't know into your desktop,

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.960
and then you sign up in their the stop application to get your public and private.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.270
Keep here.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.750
The public and private key are stored in your software and not on the Internet,

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.030
and hence the stop.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.610
Bullets are more secure than or land on mobile wallets.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.220
They're only and mobile wallets become centralised because you are saving your public and

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.450
private key innocent girls over somewhere.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.030
And hence it for Hacker comes and he can get access to your private key just by hacking

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.120
this central's over in the stop.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.470
Will it?

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.000
It is a bit more secure,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.560
but then,

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.980
whenever you're connected to Internet because of malware and phishing,

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.790
you are always vulnerable.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.250
Then let's look at the hardware wanted.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.650
Ah,

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.370
hardware bowler Looks like a print right?

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.130
Or any other U.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.270
S.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.830
Video is that you plug into your computer only then you'll get access to your private key

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:54.310
on.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.850
You can do transactions with that particular device.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.070
Then comes the paper.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.920
One it paper.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.070
One.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.650
It is nothing,

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:01.800
but in simple terms.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.380
You write your private key,

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.150
initiate off paper and keep it in your physical wallet.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.540
So that's kind of the best,

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:09.600
more security.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.590
But still,

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.210
we have even more secure platform to store our private keys.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.710
That's our brain itself.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.530
So if your memories the entire private key and don't lose it,

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.610
then that's the most secure way of doing so.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.060
What are custodial bullets?

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.890
We saw that in online wallet on mobile wallet.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.700
We save our private key in the central server,

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:31.060
right?

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.930
So they are being custodians off our private case,

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.580
and hence they can be called US custody wallets when you save your private key in a

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.550
different location in a central server.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.600
Now let's go to big going dot org and see what kind of once they are having in their upset

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.600
.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.310
So the new select your operating system mobile,

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.190
the stop hardware,

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.850
our Web,

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.080
they will show you different types of wallets that are available.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.360
So when I click on each and every platform,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.160
there are multiple wallets available on the degree off centralization.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.360
Transparency.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.960
What is a validation level?

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.250
Etcetera has been shown here itself in a graphical manner.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.400
You can also download it that stop.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.550
Will it based on your operating system of that bullet.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.950
Btc dot com All coin hardware wallets,

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.460
a ledger nano pres are very famous.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.950
Hardware wallets You can also get keep key called card or big box.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.550
Let's look at a ledger,

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.350
nano and razor just to get a feel of how the hardware wallets look like.

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:36.880
This is how the general it looks like there's got a ledger Nano is,

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.830
and you can plug this into your computer just like a Pendry to get your private key access

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.550
and transactions and praise our looks like this.

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:54.950
So now let us look at an example Dark coin.

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.680
This is a bit going one it that is a bullet as well.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.860
So let's try and create a new one it and see the process of creating a new wanted on Get

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.120
our public and private key for this particular wallet on.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.570
Hence,

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.310
you will be able to understand in detail how wallets work.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.850
How does Republican Private Key look like etcetera?

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.400
So the name didn't do this and create a new one.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.050
It they asked us to generate a press pass freeze.

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:22.380
A pass phrase looks like this.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.950
It's a 12 word random string that is a representation off your private key.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.810
Remember I told you that your mind is the best place to story a private key.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.410
It is nearly impossible for a person to remember.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.870
The long hex are dismal number in this mind forever.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.900
And that's why the private geese are converted into a past race like this.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.940
And this makes it easier for you to remember this even in your mind,

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.040
Arvin united some of it This past race is also car does anymore,

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.370
Nick.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.180
So give this in mind.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:10.630
A past race are demonic is a word string representation off your private Keep make sure you

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.410
write this Don't are copied somewhere in your notes application so that you don't lose your

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:16.170
wallet forever.

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.770
Renee and others,

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.350
they last for confirmation just to check if you have returned on your pass phrase,

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:47.090
it has also asked for a pin for easier access.

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.650
So I have entered a pin and I have removed that from the video for security purposes.

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.320
So yeah,

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.680
now that we have entered this wallet and created of all it for ourselves,

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.240
this is all we can send money to others.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.430
Remember the Bitcoin address that I told about so you can enter their address,

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:07.270
enter the amount and then the fee is suggested by this website itself.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.770
Renewal convent from you can send money to them.

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.320
This is my wallet actress.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:18.480
So the public e which we spoke about its hashed And this is the hash of that.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:23.400
So this can be called as may Bitcoin artist and I can give this actors to someone else In

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.760
order for them to send me money.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:30.650
I can also exchange Bitcoins into some other Cryptocurrency here.

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:36.610
This is so many history on all the other tokens possible the other coins like Bitcoin.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:42.810
Let's say ethereum light coin can also be used in this one It since you've already logged

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.170
in with your private key Every time you try to send some Bitcoin,

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:49.730
you do not need to enter your private key audio pneumonic minority.

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:51.260
So you're pneumonic aria.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.600
Priority will be just used for logging purposes one.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.790
Once you do that,

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.620
the system understands that.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:57.960
Okay,

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.650
you are a violent person with the private key and hence do the transactions.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:06.220
But your private key on your behalf Now let us look at home to regain your account with

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:13.850
your pneumonic When a sign out off this and they want to open an existing world.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.290
It it just ask for it.

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:15.490
Well,

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:16.680
word past race,

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:17.860
which is our early morning.

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.910
Let me just enjoying my morning here.

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:51.900
So once they endured my past race,

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:55.990
it asked for making the J contender and then get into this.

00:07:55.990 --> 00:08:02.720
No,

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.420
we saw all we can regain our wallet.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.300
Using a demonic are the past race.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.600
This can be done in any system.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.970
If you go to a different desktop order,

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:12.830
different laptop or your mobile,

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:18.750
you can log in using it This far past pressed into any off this kind of space minutes.

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:23.790
This is how wallets are being signed up and can be used for transactions.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:24.900
See in the next video.
