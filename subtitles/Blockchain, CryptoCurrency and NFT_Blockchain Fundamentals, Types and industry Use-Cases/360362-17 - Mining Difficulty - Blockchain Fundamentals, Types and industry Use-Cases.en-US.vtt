00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
looking at this example again.

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.100
We know that the known to us three d 119 to come into the hash,

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.650
which has four leading zeros.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.150
Let's look at the mining difficulty itself,

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:17.750
what happened and biases becoming more and more difficult as increase the number of zeros.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.450
Imagine the same example.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:25.990
The minor would have started by substituting one in the north and then two and three,

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.590
and that's only bootstraps.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.180
Each and every number two go to lets it.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.340
He comes to the non scored 23 this has one leading zero hash.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.110
And then he comes to six,

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.240
which have one leading zero as well.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.850
3768 which has two leading zeros.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.290
4696 which has let a three leading zeros move a four lane eight.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.150
The just three leading zeros as well.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.210
And then he comes to 33119 which has four leading zeros.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.750
Right?

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.230
If I had a difficulty off just one leading zero,

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.770
then he would have got the hash really off.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.980
One.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.390
Leading 006 23 itself If I had the difficulty as to leading zeros,

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.460
probably 376 it was a number,

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:18.950
it is easier to find down 33119 but difficult to find dire 06 or zero gravity.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.660
Then those forces 96 to 5 coordinated in the same way,

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.450
so as to keep on increasing the number of zeros,

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.880
the probably off the soil.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:29.580
Hash values.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.050
Giving a desired hash value reduces,

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.540
and hence it becomes more and more difficult.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.060
I say.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.750
Expect more and more leading zeros in the mathematical puzzle,

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.630
right?

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.050
So bootstrapping costs a lot off on traditional effort.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.380
So can doing with that same idea.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.450
If we have a five digit number which has 100,000 options on,

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.160
and I say that the first did it should always be zero.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:59.810
Then the options reduce to 10,000 and then it can go on Can target off.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.700
Bitcoin is 18 zeros.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:08.280
Remember when we clicked on mine in the website under Starcom that had four leading zeros?

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.270
Has difficulty.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:15.310
It took someone to find the norms probably two or three seconds right for four zeros.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.440
If it is taking that much time for our difficulty of 18 zeros,

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.340
it takes a very,

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.450
very long time on a super fast computer to do that calculation.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.050
The probability that a random hashes valid is here is to the march,

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.140
often ar minus 20.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.620
So that's the kind of probably these we are working.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.060
But when it comes to the coin,

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.350
many the difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:49.560
Bitcoin has this concept offer time saying every block should be mine once every 10 minutes

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.560
.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.350
So this has been set in the algorithm itself.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:58.450
So the big bang core will try to maintain this 10 minutes timeline for finding a block.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.100
But then there is not only one minor.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.500
There are multiple miners in the Bitcoin ecosystem,

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.090
right?

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.380
So everyone will be trying to out of your block because they are getting everyone from the

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.350
because ecosystem when they mine a block.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.430
So what if there are five miners in the ecosystem?

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.680
They will find it difficult in the first place.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.340
But then,

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.020
when five more minor stomach,

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:25.760
then the probability of finding ash with four leading zeros becomes bigger with more number

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.480
of miners,

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.020
and hence that I'm taken also reduces.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.880
What if it comes below 10 minutes?

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:37.850
I saw that big guy ecosystem adjust the difficulty every two weeks that is 2016 blocks.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.180
In two weeks,

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.130
it will check.

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.560
How long has it taken for the miners to find blocks,

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.150
right?

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.640
If to find photos and 16 blocks the time taken most more than two weeks,

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.010
it will reduce the difficulty.

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.360
If the time taken to find 2016 blocks waas less than police,

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.790
it'll increase the difficulties that the self difficulties are just to maintain the time

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.150
off 10 minutes per block.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.640
Also,

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.260
I would like to show you are to off Bitcoin Maine's so that you get an understanding off

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.180
what is required to do many in big.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:17.840
So look at this picture where there are a lot off CPUs and GP use on a six used to mine

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:18.580
Bitcoins.

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:24.880
This is called the Mining Farm because this is all connected together and the hashing power

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.470
has to be so big to mine Bitcoins in the current board because of the 18 leading zeros,

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:36.400
my name is pretty difficult Norris and also see the size of the fans here.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.620
This is the kind of putting mechanism that's required if you want to mind Bitcoin in the

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.960
car.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:48.860
So what can we conclude with this began canto that mining is a difficult process,

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.510
which takes a lot of computational power and hence a lot of electricity and hence a lot of

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.010
heat also is generated.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.900
Leg.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.890
Let's see how the difficulty has increased over a period of time,

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.850
right from January to September 2018.

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.030
This is how the difficulty has increased.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.240
Here you just need something like 15 billion cigar ashes for second toe,

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.190
minor block and then eating kept on increasing.

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.090
And currently,

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.250
in a Super one billion cigar ashes per second,

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.420
remember,

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.660
announces just trial and error by putting in a new north,

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:22.940
we're finding a new house.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:29.250
So these money hashes are being found per second in in total in the Bitcoin ecosystem,

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:35.410
one leading the difficult demand is on and this difficulties keeping on increasing because

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.150
the time off 10 minutes has to be maintained by the Bitcoin ecosystem.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.110
During the money pool,

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:46.550
we saw how big computers and how large farms are required to start that big going mining.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:51.090
It is difficult for individuals so sick of that kind of full form on before,

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.530
only inducers can do it.

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.350
It becomes a centralized ecosystem,

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.860
right?

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:00.720
So if I want to do some big going money and I can only by a small let's say a bad book or

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.700
something like that.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.720
It's a very less competition power.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.750
But I'm interested in joining the Bitcoin,

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:07.150
uh,

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.530
many because it's tough,

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:08.950
right?

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.160
So I would go to my people,

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:11.930
my people,

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.990
people like me combined together and they form of my people so that the combined effort of

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.440
that meaningful get some somebody.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.060
What's in?

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:26.900
The longer that so many loose look below that variety are doing all these things my ar

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.370
minus spending so much money,

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.350
so much computational power to mine Bitcoins in the next video.
