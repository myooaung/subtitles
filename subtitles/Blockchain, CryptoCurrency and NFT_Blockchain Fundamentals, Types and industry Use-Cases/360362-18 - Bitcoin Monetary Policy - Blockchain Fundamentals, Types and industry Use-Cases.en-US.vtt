00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.620
so having seen that it is very difficult to minor block in Bitcoin because of all the

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.550
computational power that is required to find the hash.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.920
But leading zeros I'm finding the norms we need to see my a d minus are doing it in the

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:15.520
first place.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.350
They are really doing it for somebody work from the Bitcoin ecosystem.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.850
This is what has been going itself.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.450
So they never minor remains a block and access to the Blockchain.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.150
They get the water with Bitcoins.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:36.410
It started in 2009 but 50 Bitcoins and then the Bitcoin ecosystem Arctic.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:44.440
Or has this concept called us having that this every 210,000 rocks the they weren't given

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.960
to the minor is hard.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.550
So it started with 50 and after a dozen 12 number,

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.690
it reduced to gratify.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.360
And then by 2016 it reduced WellPoint time.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.370
Currently,

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.860
for every block that this mind,

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.250
the miner gets 12.5 Bitcoins in water.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.350
Why did this concept off having come into the picture?

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.180
So whenever there is an unlimited a playoff,

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.330
any currency beat in the real world or in the triple,

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.720
there will be a problem.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.750
Calmness inflation.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.770
What of the government off U.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:15.060
S.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.990
Or Canada?

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.850
They say toe print out money without us dollars are Canadian dollars and give it to people

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.670
So everyone will receive about $1 million everyone will be rich.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.980
But then the prices off all the commodities on all the products will go up as well because

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.530
I have more spending power.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.440
That shouldn't happen in an economy.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.550
That's why this concept of having came into the picture in big going.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.790
So the big point total number when you look at it,

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.710
the water being hard every four years approximately and then that keeps on going down.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.280
Next will be 6.5 and then 3.15 etcetera.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.650
The total number of Bitcoins will approximately be 21 million by 2140.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.540
So after this,

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.450
there would be no new Bitcoins coming into the ecosystem.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.110
Here is the one leaving off generating new Bitcoins never a block.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:08.670
It's mine.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.100
New Bitcoins are generated.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.290
I'm giving Billy Minor the minor and then sell this Bitcoin in the alcohol to someone else

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.290
.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.410
Bullets Bitcoins on that So it comes into the ecosystem and people can start trading with

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.750
this.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.850
Also the Saudi concept of blood difficulty which is adjusted every two weeks approximately

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.850
.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:33.190
And this is based on the time that given that Steven in the Bitcoin ecosystem Bitcoin has

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.290
every blood mine once in 10 minutes,

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.620
Ethereum infections against ripple.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.750
Another block chill is mining every blanc in 3.5 seconds.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.940
So what does this mean?

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.210
So whenever you do a transaction that it doesn't do the transaction,

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.100
the minor will big transactions added to a block,

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.150
do some work,

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.950
find the house off the block and then tries to add that block to the Blockchain.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.330
So when you lower transaction for that,

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:00.480
get into the Blockchain,

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.630
even Bitcoin it will take about 10 minutes On leading.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.150
You can call your transaction as a valid transactions.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.530
All this is fine.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.850
What is a penalty?

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.550
We spoke about game theory Where be they want someone also penalize someone for bad work?

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.740
What happens when I had a malicious transaction into a block?

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:25.270
Find the hash with the Somali leading zeros and tryingto broadcast doctor the network the

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.710
other people will very fight both the block but leading zeros on all the transactions

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:31.950
within the bloc as well.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.860
When they find that you have a malicious transaction in the block,

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.180
they will reject the block from the Blockchain in this case,

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.200
if they find that block to be invalid.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.480
What I've been losing here I am losing our political tradition of power that I put in to

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.100
find that Malin Block to find a hash but so many leading zeros.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.930
I spent a lot of computational power as we saw home.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.660
Big combining farms are I lose all the competition Obama and hence electricity costs I all

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.350
the money that I put in investor doctors.

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.130
How my necessary water for doing some good work for the ecosystem.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.180
Trying to add blocks into the Blockchain on and penalize for trying to add malicious

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.100
transactions are invalid blocks into the Blockchain.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.050
Next we look at this non strange,

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.390
these other nuances a random number and it is a target.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:27.350
A bit number as well attended a big number starts from zero and goes up to four billion.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:33.450
So the probability of finding a valid hash this one into 10 to the power off minus 10.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:40.250
So this is a lonely are finding a valid hash when you keep on shooting 0 to 4 billion.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.200
So any computer that's trying to do it,

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.320
only one range is not enough.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.410
So if I'm a supercomputer around trying to do some Miley,

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.000
I start from zero.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.650
Every time I start from zero and go up to let just one billion,

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.620
I will lose all the competition are on the time required,

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.790
made a modest minor.

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.180
That's 100 million hashes per second and it takes 40 seconds to recommend if you were

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.860
secret chili.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.600
So 100 million cash is still four billion,

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.060
right?

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.450
So that makes 40 seconds.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.850
40 seconds is very easy because 10 minutes is what I have to mine.

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.160
A block and 40 seconds.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.620
It what it takes for a modest minor to go to the entire page,

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.310
starting from 0 to 4 billion.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.720
Right then it should be easy for any minor toe.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.260
Go through the entire range on.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.170
Definitely there will be able to find it within 10 minutes.

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.110
That's men.

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.470
The concept that we saw earlier called the Pain Stan.

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:32.340
Consider the picture.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.470
Remember the times Time changes every second.

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.730
So are minor who starts from zero on.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.670
Guy wants to go up to four billion does not have 40 seconds,

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:46.850
but only one second because when the pain changes to the next second because of avalanche,

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:47.320
if IQ,

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:53.180
the hash will change and hence he has to come back from zero to find the norms.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.550
This is a recent bite.

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.250
Mine was on mining 100 ha syringe,

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.690
probably if there are five minus.

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.080
The 1st 1 will start from zero on Goto.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.640
One billion.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:09.710
2nd 1 will start from one million on Goto 1,000,000,000 let's say and so on.

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.640
So whoever is lucky or where has the best competition power will find that particular

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.650
neurons in the given time frame.

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.850
Also remember that when we saw this mining difficulty,

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:26.130
we saw that 6 23 37684696 acceptable boards and sequence.

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:32.760
It doesn't necessarily mean that 603 should have one leading 037 did say for 696 should

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:33.780
have a leading zeros,

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:34.370
etcetera.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.220
It doesn't increase that sequence,

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:36.490
really,

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.780
because hashes a random value six could have six leading zeros.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:47.700
4696 could have leading zeros and 33119 could have four leading zeros only so it can be

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:52.390
completely random and helps where you find that nonce completely depends on the hash.

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:57.850
Only on the other transaction data timestamp except Ryan Diplo Tell it doesn't depend on

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:09.500
the lawns number One more thing we need to consider here is that better transaction is

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.190
being requested by a user.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:14.330
It goes into the transaction pulled from their my nose.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:15.450
Pick the transactions.

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:16.220
I'm trying to add.

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.040
It'll block how the defict transactions.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.110
Let's say there in the conception pool,

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.690
we have about 2000 transactions,

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:24.220
right?

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.990
And I can add only 1000 transactions into a block in the Bitcoin,

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.550
not change.

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.120
So I go to the transaction pool,

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.730
sort the transactions,

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:34.970
buying something or less transaction tease.

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:35.870
Here,

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:41.260
we need to notice that the block the water for people coin or 12.5 Bitcoin is not even

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:42.690
really want the minor delegate.

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:45.290
When they try to mine a block in the D block chain,

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:48.450
they will also be rewarded with the transaction fees.

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:52.050
They never do a transaction on the Bitcoin ecosystem.

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:58.580
Let's say I want to send you one Bitcoin I can I optionally a transaction fee so I can tell

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:05.210
that one Bitcoin I'm gonna give a transaction fee off 10.1 Bitcoins this 0.1 Bitcoins will

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:09.550
go to the miner who actually transaction Ebo block Andres to mind the block.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:15.190
Let's say there are 1000 transactions and he each has going to be going as a transaction

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:15.430
fee.

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:20.790
So the minor will get would 12 point favorite coins plus all the transaction fees for

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:27.820
together as everyone That is the reason by minus will sort it in descending order based on

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.330
the transaction fees.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.120
Although the 2000 transactions,

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.700
they're sorted in descending order.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.950
Big D top 1000 transactions,

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:37.560
which has the maximum transactions.

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:40.150
These Andre to mine it with that block.

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:41.430
So yeah,

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:46.150
these are some other details that I wanted to share with you regarding mining off Bitcoin.
