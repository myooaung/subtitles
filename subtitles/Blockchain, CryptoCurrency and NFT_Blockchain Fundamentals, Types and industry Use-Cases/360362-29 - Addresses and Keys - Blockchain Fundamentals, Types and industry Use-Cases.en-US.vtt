00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.260
we have already seen in the previous sections on how good your transaction,

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.500
using digital signatures and how any,

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.070
nor can verify with your public e whether you have the person who also started the

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.720
transaction,

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.320
right,

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.380
let's recap it here.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.050
So let's it is the user and he has a private key office world.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.090
It is in the post box because it should not be known by anyone else.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.890
And this public e has been derived from the private key.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.040
So whenever he wanted transact something,

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.530
a message or some cryptocurrencies,

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.830
he will send the message on add a signature.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.150
The signature will be added by hashing his private key on the message.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.120
The time stamp exit.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.450
So when these three functions called the message signature on public E are put into

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.290
something or as a verification function,

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.910
this throws off the bullion,

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.350
saying yes or no?

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.140
Yes,

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.780
means that this person has signed this with this private key and we are very fire did know

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.780
,

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.870
which means this person does not seem to have signed it,

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.000
and hence we need to reject this transaction.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.890
That's how lords can verify the source off this entire transaction itself.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.510
Finally,

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.680
we have seen one part off this entire thing called private key public ease.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.730
How to verify this digital signature except from But what do you give it to others?

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.820
Let's say you are a person year and I am a person B's.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.670
I need to send you Bitcoins,

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:31.190
right?

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.590
If that is the case,

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.750
instead of flowing your public e,

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.710
I need to know something called as your address and addresses nothing but your public e.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.170
And it is has to buy an algorithm.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.310
It maybe associative off the six architect off just our any other hashing mechanism

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.860
available there so you'll create an address.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.530
And this Bitcoin address is what I will use to send you.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.150
Bitcoins Are any other Cryptocurrency?

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.160
Now?

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.810
Let's look at the other type of wallet and improvement over regular wall.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.270
It's called the Hedge de Waters has dual.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.580
It is hierarchically,

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.750
deterministic wallets where they will be one master private key and one master public E.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.560
And with this combination,

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.430
there will be a lot of privately and publicly combinations and hence a lot of actresses.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.320
So when you want to give this addresses to somewhere,

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.450
you can give wonder Chris after time and everything will come to their heads de wallet

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.020
anyway.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.330
So in this way,

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:33.170
a person will cannot watch water supper to you in the big going public Blockchain and trace

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.440
you back and things like that.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.070
So this is more secure in the sense you have more private keys and more addresses,

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.380
and hence you don't need to reveal your actress every time you want to get a transaction.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.710
So if you are a person using my people transactions and getting and spending a lot of big

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:49.220
kinds,

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.850
you don't want to trigger something in the Bitcoin ecosystem calling.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.870
This actress has been sending and receiving a lot of Bitcoins and then they start

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.860
investigating about that address and looking at your history,

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.890
I don't think your would want that way.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:02.570
So far,

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.190
better security purposes has do,

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.350
wants came into the picture.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.150
No,

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.140
there is something very important that we need to understand having looked at wallets,

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.900
right?

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.830
So they would have seen a lot off crypto hacks that has been happening s o many Bitcoins

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.180
stolen from somewhere.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.310
And then $40 million worth of Bitcoin stolen from bylines exchange,

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.890
etcetera.

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.980
So we would start thinking when we don't know about Blockchain that these air hugs that

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.800
happened in the block units of not really guest Let's say you have your bank of concrete.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.580
So if you lose your password to somewhere on day,

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.120
enter your lead banking account,

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.450
send all the money that you want to their own.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.430
So this does not mean that they have had the bank itself.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.280
They have had your own account,

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.970
right in the same way.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.930
So if I lose my private key,

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.760
you can get access to my account and you can enter my account,

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.940
transfer all the balances that I have to your own wallet.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.000
So this cannot be called us a problem with Dr.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.580
But this is a problem with private keys and public ease.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.330
Private keys should be so,

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.030
so secure,

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.650
and you should keep it very safe because once you lose your property,

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.750
you will not be able to get your grip go back.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.740
There has been a lot off money in terms of crypto that has been lost in wallets because

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.280
they Warner forgot the pirate king.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.030
Imagine you were Bitcoin miner in the initial stages like photos and 10 11 you would have

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.960
done something but because we're not worth anything,

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.630
attacked him,

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.530
so you would have got a lot of Bitcoins.

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:30.050
But then,

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.210
after a while,

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.580
you would have lost interest in that and lost your private GS Will those Bitcoins are worth

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.550
a lot of money now,

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.320
but you cannot access them because you lost your private key.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.920
That's what is happening in the world,

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.400
and millions of dollars have been lost like this.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:50.690
It's This is the reason why there are people who put their private keys Inara Faidley's and

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.000
inserted into their body.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.580
Other person tattooed his private key in this arm itself.

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.880
And this is these are ways in which you can secure your private key.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.090
When we look at the different types of wallets,

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.190
we'll get to know how secure each and every type of wallet is.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.500
We'll see in the next video
