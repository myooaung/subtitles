00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760
know that we have seen the implementation of Blockchain in the real world use case called

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.490
has been going We need to look at other tapes off cryptocurrencies available in the market

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:09.950
as well.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.940
Seven big kind came.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.070
We saw that as an example because that was a very first implementation of Blockchain and

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.910
then looking at Bitcoin success on the wonderful technology behind it.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.230
There were other people and other organizations who can came up with their own

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.750
implementation of the Blockchain.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:27.180
Also,

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.400
for example,

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:35.050
like going ethereum us ripple iota at a few examples which we'll be seeing in this section

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:35.050
.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.090
These coins,

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.180
because there are alternative to the Bitcoin Blockchain are called us.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.550
I'd coins Let's look at this Blockchain called us like going No.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.490
This is similar to Bitcoin and created after seeing the success of Bitcoin in the year 2000

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.700
level by a person called us Charles Lee.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.530
Most of the concept that resigned Bitcoin will also be applicable to light kind.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.740
We can see that there are a few differences in the perimeters that they use and hence this

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.750
become a separate Cryptocurrency by itself.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.130
As you can see the quiet humanist 21 million in Bitcoin where is in light kind of 84

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.540
million?

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.730
I'll go them.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:16.780
Use your is accepted.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.000
Such a proof of the six was a scripted like going mean block Time is an important

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.360
difference that they highlight so mean dark time in Bitcoin is 10 minutes and here it is

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.650
just 2.5 minutes.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.530
Difficulty target is reregister as well.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.020
On block reward is also hard every 830,000 blocks initially,

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.690
what was for people coins in between ecosystem and 50 light coins in the light queen

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:42.290
ecosystem.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.780
But here,

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.820
since the stable is a bit old,

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.550
you would see that there's 25 going rewarded than 50 like 20 work.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.520
Take it with a pinch of salt because at the time you are watching this video,

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.650
it may be lesser.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.350
There are different block explorers for each of the block chains.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.450
Other details you can see here on the market capital also very depending on the market

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.430
price off but going on like coin.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.280
So this is not a fixer number.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.650
Anyway,

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.250
light kind in the crypt oval is also known as the silver in the crypt of word.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.590
So whoever is not able to buy Bitcoins,

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.820
which is the gold standard,

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.820
will very light kind in the same baby saw the block explorer for Bitcoin.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.120
We can also look at a block exploring for like going which explains the height of the block

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.550
and all the details have resigned.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.870
Bitcoin will also be available for like coins.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.880
You are free to go through this website or any other block experience for,

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.850
like coin to know more details about like
