00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.050
Now let's look at the quick Somebody off what we learned alot.

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:10.280
First we saw how traditional systems work on beside religious like single point of failure

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.820
and single point of authority.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.110
And then we wanted to eliminate the central authorities or intermediaries like banks.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:23.200
Hence we came to the concept of a public ledger how our public ligers had some challenges

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.250
that needed a solution.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.400
Challenge one where we had to prevent or not the response actions was working.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.370
Baker Photographic methods like hashing and destroyed signatures challenge to very needed

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.010
validators under consensus between lords were welcomed by combining transactions into

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.120
blocks and linking them to other blocks.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.450
Using cash is still we needed someone to validate the transaction on dad blocks to the

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.950
Blockchain.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.250
That's when these aren't war views off mining.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:57.490
My name is a process in which Lord proves to other lords that it is a valid Lord trying to

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.850
add value transaction so the block chain and get rewarded for doing the same.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.380
There are multiple mining algorithms,

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:09.570
and the most used proof off Morkel Garden will be dealt with in detail in the next section

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.210
on Bitcoin.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:17.610
So now that we understand the basics of Blockchain on publicly.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.810
Just let's look at some properties of blocking that differentiates it from traditional

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:22.650
technologies.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.780
The first property commitment talks about all value transactions being added to the block

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.130
chill within a finding time.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.930
So if I am a valid person trying to do a value transactions in the Blockchain,

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.160
that transaction should should somehow be added to the block and then the Blockchain.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:47.410
Eventually consensus is the property which deals with all notes being consistent and

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.050
holding the same set of data in the same sequence.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:56.110
We saw this as part of mining on the challenge to immutable property of Blockchain is way

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.240
we can't order any data once a distorted the Blockchain.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.860
We saw that how changing some data in the Blockchain makes the entire block in in Bali.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.560
But I will see an authenticity talks about how a person cannot cheat the system by sending

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.280
an invalid transaction and how a person cannot claim that he did not do a transaction once

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.790
he has done it.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.750
The second type is known as non reputation.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.580
This is possible because of this tragic natures.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.870
This means that once I door transaction but says I am sending $30 to you.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.490
I cannot come back later.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.690
I'll say that I did not does transaction because the transaction is signed using my private

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.030
key asset is still signature by now.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.440
I'm sure you have a pretty good understanding off hope.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.270
Public pledges on Blockchain work in general If there are any queries on this section,

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.950
can he pulls the same and I'll be happy to answer them?

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.640
I can't wait to show you hope with Goran works in the next section.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.330
The next section will also be able to clear up any doubts that you now how about logic as

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.350
we're gonna see a real life example of a block chill called by the way,

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.490
I'm sure you know the speed of feature in your Army video player when you click on this one

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.970
next.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.550
But on the video player,

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.360
you'll get a different speeds at which you can play the video.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.070
If you have any issues with me Indian accent or the spirit which I'm talking,

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.840
you can increase our decreases.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.180
Peter of the video with the stool.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.330
I can understand that everyone off you have a different requirement Hell's order to use

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.950
this feature for your advantage.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.550
See you in the next video
