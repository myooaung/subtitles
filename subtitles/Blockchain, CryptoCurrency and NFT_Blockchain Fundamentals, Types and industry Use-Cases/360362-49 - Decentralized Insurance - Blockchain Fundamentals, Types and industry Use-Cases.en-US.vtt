00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
Now let's look at the insurance sector and how Blockchain can help improve the insurance

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.100
sector and decentralize the same in the traditional insurance sector.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.130
There is a lot of problems with respect to security insurance claims,

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:14.650
etcetera.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.350
So what is insurance in the basic terms?

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.950
So if I am a person,

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.340
I have a lot of list that is involved in my life.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.210
If I'm traveling,

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.530
I can lose my baggage.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.410
If I am raising crops that can get damaged because of natural disasters,

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.910
even something will happen to me.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.940
It's a big if I keep playing on insurance,

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.010
I'll be able to get a lump sum of money.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.550
If some unexpected even happens in my life,

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.790
the premium that you pay on the total collector will depend on probabilities.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.390
There's a study called Us Actuarial Science,

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.320
which deals with all of the insurance risk and probability on fixes.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.640
The premium that you pay at what age Except so what happens here is that if I am a person

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.990
who is paying $100 has insurance premium on a monthly basis that will be collected over a

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.320
year $4200 right in the same way,

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.170
there will be millions of people being $100 Parliament.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.430
So this insurance company less I'm paying life insurance to secure my life on If something

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.150
happens to me,

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.050
at least my family will be benefited the insurance money,

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.810
right?

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.620
So there's a remote chance that all of the 1,000,000 people who are paying the 1002 $100.40

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.020
years will you get into work company and something unexpected happens to them because the

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.750
probability will be very low for a person to pass away in that period of time.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.080
The insurance company place with this.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.070
So I'm just paid 1002 $100 for the year to the insurance company.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.290
But the sum insured off or myself,

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.760
will be more than a $1,000,000 on the insurance company will pay,

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.510
maybe premium paid by other people also together because the percentage of this happening

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.810
toe all the one million is very less somewhere,

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.140
they will not get back the premium paid by them to the engines company.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.550
And so this is how the entire insurance sector works for now.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.210
And there is this company for less get risk working on decentralizing insurance.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.710
So something we need to know this year is that it risk is not a company which is a decent

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.030
allies insurance company or something like that.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.860
Interest is a protocol on which you will be able to build applications that has insurance

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:12.550
providers.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:13.810
For example,

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.070
when you see their website,

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.820
they have something.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:16.760
A smallest fight,

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.940
slight delay insurance,

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.020
hurricane protection stripped a wallet,

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.710
insurance,

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:21.860
social insurance,

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.060
cramping Children six Central.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.040
So these kind off applications can be built on interest platform,

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.220
which is a protocol that can be used to build insurance based applications.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.880
They also talk about their revenue model for portable users and crypto investors on their

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:36.470
dipped Okun,

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.050
which they have.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.670
Except I leave a link to this website on the resources section so you can go through the

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:42.580
seat respectful.
