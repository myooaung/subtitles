00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.530
Now let's look at one of the major players in the permission.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.740
The Blockchain space called the hyper religious project Many people misunderstand.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.650
I political be a product of IBM.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.740
Where is it good is that hypothesis of project open source the and develop build in its

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:19.290
foundation.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:24.180
There are many members like IBM Stop JP Morgan at century etcetera,

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.240
who contribute to this open source project called a typology on bill projects.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.070
IBM,

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.720
because it is getting a lot of plans on building projects for them,

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.850
is mainly known for the high politics face.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.790
So I apologize,

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.870
building and crossing the street open standards for distributor legends.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.910
So this Blockchain technology is being harnessed by a lot of enterprises and enterprise

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:45.280
groups.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.270
Also hype.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.240
Religion can be used as abruption on and customers according to their needs for any

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.130
interprets doctrine.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.850
And that is the open standard that they're building for distributor Dillinger's.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.640
When you look at hyper literal War G,

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.710
which is the other plate efficient,

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.220
far right political projects,

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.550
you can see that in the member section they have all the members like premier members,

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.850
general members on and associate members In the entire upset,

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.640
there are a lot of huge competition in the places.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.010
Where are we going to the school?

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.350
On using the pound of Hyperloop fabric in their companies.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.340
When you go over the home page of this website,

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.490
you'll be able to find water all the projects that hyper religious buildings make.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:28.450
High political basil,

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.030
which is a job.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.260
A basic Syrian plan by political borrows,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.860
and IBM,

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.920
which is also knew by politic fabric and high politic composers are very famous in the

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.570
hyper ledger.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.180
Our permission,

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.250
the Blockchain ecosystem,

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.230
my palate.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.930
In these decent Liz identity,

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.280
you don't have concentration,

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.610
more real applications and accept so you can go through each of these projects and take a

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.600
look at what it is focusing on.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.800
So let's take a quick overview of high politics.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.250
Fabric on Heiple isn't one person here.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.510
Travel is in fabric is an implementation of Blockchain technology that is foundational

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:02.950
developing doctrine applications.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.340
So I politic probably has a smart contract logic from census logics,

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.290
confidentiality scalability off the partition deduction.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.310
All of these components Indianapolis If our big has been developed,

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.020
it was released in 2017 but IBM,

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.760
as one of the highest contributors off this school when we look at high politic composer,

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.360
this is an abstraction between the business application on help elicit topic.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.790
We cannot expect any business to have so much development knowledge about hyper legit

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.280
fabric are any Blockchain,

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.320
for that matter and hence high politic came up with a solution for less composer,

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.580
which can be used by any business person who create Be a never.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:42.950
The NFL is business.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.390
It's not a competition where they talk about water components are there in the entire

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.930
collection.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.180
Who will be the players?

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.240
What may be the answer.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.770
Six seconds,

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.040
for example,

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.240
and I am in company will have something like,

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.090
I have a flight.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.810
I have a root for this particular flight.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.880
I have other assets in my company,

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.730
and these will be the players like the supplier render and who will be the ticket seller.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.970
Except so these are will be logics,

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.140
which we've been decorated in the business like protection fight by a normal business

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.490
person who is not a developer.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.840
Also,

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.680
Composer has brought in emphasis on business and click vocabulary for weak solution

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.150
creation,

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.770
which means any business person without development knowledge also will be able to create

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:23.310
this business.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.240
Nickelback Detective.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:30.050
This reduces the risk and increase understanding and flexibility because a business person

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.050
,

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.550
whenever the stands for in the knowledge about this logic,

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:34.270
fully developed.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.760
But there might be some asunder,

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.180
miscommunication or misunderstanding on.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.000
Hence there can be some problems are risk while building applications.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.890
When a billionaire has created and given,

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.360
the developer at Brockton,

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.610
developer will know what needs to be done,

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.090
but that you need to make it work and hence he'll build a fabric application based on the

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.740
Beinecke run.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:53.700
Very the business person.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.740
The features of this is model Your Business Network test in Exports Way I M.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:58.230
P s,

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.030
which means if you're a nominee company I stole before you will create a business network

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.590
in the composer framework.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.860
And there is something called us composer Playground,

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.870
where you can use it as an AP and test your interactions with each other paper.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.550
It is working properly leaks before going toward development.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.240
But will these applications and it also pro it to ups,

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:22.190
wherein you create our business model in composer and hence you can access that through a

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.960
pH sits on.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.020
This is a very important point where they need to integrate existing systems off.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.780
Record any company that you see if it is existing for a long time now they will have legacy

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.970
systems like CRM Czar Sap,

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.830
where they store the data right,

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.090
including my SQL databases on Composer Are high policy fabric.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.620
Are any other permission?

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.080
The Blockchain solution that Thompson should have a way to integrate those systems on going

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.700
to know from their using Rajan's begin on hasn't been entirely scrap.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.240
The existing systems on Take One leader blocked an application from No.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.480
One and use it.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.140
That would be pretty difficult as a migration for any company to do,

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.930
and hence integration with the existing system is definitely required and high politic.

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.380
Composer promotes away for that And as we saw before,

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.560
this is a whole new open source project and probably next foundation.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.950
That's river,

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:13.840
the different actors,

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.350
competence and the transaction floor in the next media
