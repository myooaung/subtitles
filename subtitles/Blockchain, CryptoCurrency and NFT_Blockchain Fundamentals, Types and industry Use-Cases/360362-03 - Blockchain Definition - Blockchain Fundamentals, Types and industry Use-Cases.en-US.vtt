00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.950
high on,

00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:05.060
I think every other course I was inclined to show you the definition of production and

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:05.750
start from there.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.650
But he someone with local knowledge of Blockchain would find it to be Greek and Latin,

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.360
a decentralised computation and information sharing platform that enables my people

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:15.940
authoritative.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.010
The minds will not trust each other,

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.790
co cooperate,

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.950
coordinate and collaborate in the rational decision making process,

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.070
just like Greek and Latin.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.780
For Lehman,

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:25.150
right?

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.910
Just like how the definition of a book will not make any sense when you do not know what a

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:30.500
book is.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.020
I took this from an Indian movie.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.360
Imagine if I don't do ah books.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.880
Definition is like instruments that record analysts summaries are placed debate and

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:42.350
experience,

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.210
a mission which are illustrative only mystery Toe Heart won't paperback jacketed,

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.950
jacketed,

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:47.620
blah,

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:47.890
blah,

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.350
blah has given to the definition.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.940
If I told you this,

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.850
would there be any three more chance as you get this as a book?

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.250
I don't think so.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.030
That's the reason why I do not want to start with the definition but start explaining the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.260
concepts step by step in layman toes.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.770
And once we had a group enough,

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.630
let's revisit the definition on,

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.950
then understand it completely.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.200
