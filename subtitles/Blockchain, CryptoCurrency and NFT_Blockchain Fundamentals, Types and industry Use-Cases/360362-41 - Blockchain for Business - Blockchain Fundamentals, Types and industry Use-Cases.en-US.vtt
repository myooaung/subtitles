00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.560
Hi,

00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:01.070
everyone.

00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.950
Welcome to this section of the course on permission are in preparation chains,

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.020
as we have seen already.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.920
Blockchain is that the same pattern are the base technology made famous by its use case

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:12.850
card as Bitcoin.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.010
But the use cases do not end there from there,

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.640
many people thought of new use cases for Blockchain.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.450
That's when we got eight argument smart contracts and then companies start about it.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.500
They saw this technology and it's wonderful applications and they thought White 100 Make my

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.750
business more efficient.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.710
And that's the reason why enter places are bigger.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.150
Companies are adapting to Blockchain authorities.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.720
The one thing that was missing in the existing traditional systems called trust was brought

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.660
in by crouching,

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.510
and hence that built way to a lot of new diesel interactions.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.150
A new base off making business.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.700
In here,

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:54.100
we can see that Blockchain has a huge variety of use cases on between was the small part in

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.250
the Blockchain ecosystem,

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.290
but many of them still have this with that.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.950
Bitcoin is blocking that need to be broken,

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.820
but that is slowly being changed,

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.470
with enterprises adopting Blockchain for their business efficiency in a very fast pace here

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.430
we can see how glass it transfers between companies are happening in the traditional

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.150
databases.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.160
There's a player render auditor,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.960
regulator,

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.940
company and the logistics person.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.550
All these people have to interact with each other and they make transactions between them.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.800
All these transactions are stand alone because its a player does not want the stories

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.450
records in the any other persons database.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.150
So there is no trust between these people and hence all of these interactions are happening

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.150
.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.750
There may be a lot off miscommunications on reconciliations that are happening on a monthly

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.040
basis on a daily basis.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.050
In these requests.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.140
Imagine that the supplier does not want to store the reports in the company's reports,

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.250
and the regulator would want to see both the company render sir player logistics and the

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.200
auditor's reports.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.250
He has to get separate reports from all these people.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.200
What will happen in this case is that the regulator will face my people databases and one

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.810
people for Max and hands.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.950
It takes a lot of time and cost to bring all this store from pre into manner.

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.980
So why is this happening between these companies which are interlinked together and are

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.150
doing business together.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.950
That's because of one competent called us trust and credibility.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.140
So that is very Blockchain can come into the picture If all of these companies and

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.620
subdivisions are for particular,

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.850
trade are coming together using the Blockchain technology.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.810
They can all store their data basis induction.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.460
But I'm like Ethereum orbit going.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.970
These need to be permission.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.560
That's in the same place Records needs to be sealed for this A player only.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.250
And he can you read or write taxes to Whoever has to read are the particular records.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.970
Since we need a permission system where we need authentication before anyone can view the

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.490
Blockchain reports are at something for the Blockchain.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:55.970
They are Mondays.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.870
Here Is that imagine the regulator wants to look at your record.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.620
Still did all he needs to do us well to the Blockchain Don't know report for all these

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.150
people and he can have a real time report on what is happening in all these companies.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.540
You don't need about months to reconciliations and find out a comprehensive report and see

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.560
if these people are following the rules Property.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.420
Same goes for the auditor render supplier logistics person completed context so Why should

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.100
this a player believe in the Blockchain system?

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.210
And he did not believe the traditional system,

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.650
right?

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.500
So here he has his records in an immutable manner which provides content has between

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.150
companies.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.550
It provides providence in mutability and finality.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.520
So what it means is that the supplier can stories reports he can use this assets and

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.520
mandates because he's getting rid of all the admin work to submit details.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.140
So is auditor to some with details to this regulator,

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.690
etcetera.

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.310
At the same time is the concert also private.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.350
He can to school needs to see what?

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:58.680
And this forms the advantage of Blockchain systems consensus that every party in the entire

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.950
ecosystem agrees to whatever transactions are there in the Blockchain.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.780
Providence is when you can track the entire transaction from the Genesis Blanc who whatever

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:08.950
is happening in the latest,

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.130
this is an important property where you can see a lot of use cases popping up.

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.260
I can say that food is organic,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.420
but do we need it really know where this food is coming from?

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.150
I can find abusing Blockchain.

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.280
In fact,

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.650
IBM one ball mark have joined together to crack Chinese pork from its route through these

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.740
stores Transaction store on the block chain are also immutable asking where this a player

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.420
first rights into the Blockchain that he has sent 10 kg on this particular date that you

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.920
don't be changed Where the supplier I later on comment See,

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:45.540
I have sent 20 years the spinster Afghan Katie on once the company also receives that Okay

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.540
,

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:46.850
I received this place.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.530
They cannot change that saying I did not receive it at all or it was damaged and things

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.820
like that.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.040
So been all of these people come to a consensus in the Blockchain.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.150
It provides a lot of trust between each other and finality is well in the transaction that

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.150
happens definitely gets into the protein and after that it's only a friendly transactions.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.950
Now let's look at the one day just using Blockchain for business as we saw before it is

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.700
upend only the super that system for record shared across businessman What this means is

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.530
that in the traditional data basis,

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:23.100
we have something for this current operations create read update I'm believed but alerts to

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:28.180
case of Blockchain we can only updated I'm created because once created that cannot be

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.650
changed.

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:29.620
For example,

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.340
if I am and bring a transaction value s 1000 even though it is wrong,

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.570
I'm not be able to delete that transaction.

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.990
I need only updated from 1000 to 10,000 on Lake Garda traditional database.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:46.670
This will have with the transactions the original 1000 who put it At what time except and

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:48.120
who changed it at work.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.450
This provides a lot of rest on transparency between the systems.

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:58.350
There is also a lot of security in Blockchain transactions ensuring appropriate disability

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:59.660
transitions are secure.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.250
Our indicator on very favorable.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.730
What time to get That comes only in the case of permission deductions.

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:06.890
Because when a person wants to work,

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:11.310
construction of the election he needs to be authenticated by the Blockchain before he can

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.350
enter on view are right transactions into the election.

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:18.110
The businesses are also using smart contracts in their Rajan,

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.260
so business terms are embedded into the block units.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:28.130
And when a person sense sell it frozen foods to a particular company using I ot and

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.160
Blockchain together,

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.490
you can track how much was the temperature of these photos and foods while the logistics

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:38.030
for suffering and if there is a temperature drop by the transportation was happening.

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:39.820
This company using the I,

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:39.910
O.

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.350
T and Blockchain platform can do this and logistics company.

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:44.780
Are these a player on?

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.300
Put some penalities for the same.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:51.660
This All these details as in how much inflation reduces and what is a proportionate amount

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.680
of finality that means to be Chuy's will be there in this month.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.230
Contracts.

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.450
This makes processes very automated.

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:05.450
We also saw that consensus exists in the business blocking and hence all the parties agreed

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:06.050
with the network.

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:10.260
Different transactions when we look at the transaction will understand who will be the

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:14.580
person who is endorsing the transaction and verifying the same who will be the order and

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.050
all were decided to the Blockchain.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:20.550
So all of this combined together the uses reduced time.

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:22.740
So when we saw the regulators example,

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.070
we can see it in real time.

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:25.700
Whatever is happening with the companies,

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.840
it also removes a lot of paperwork and hence removes a lot,

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:29.390
of course,

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.760
because of automation on digitization.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:37.560
This also reduces risk because whatever transactions are happening in the ecosystem can be

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.690
added to the business logic using smart contracts,

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:43.690
and hence that releases risk between parties and increases.

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:49.020
Just There are a lot of new business models which are coming because of these advantages

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.810
are Blockchain businesses interact with each other?

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:56.740
Even competitors are coming together to join this party platforms because they can harness

00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:02.020
the power of Blockchain at this implant builder bastard network among competitors so that

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:06.750
the regulators for authorities and all of the people involved with this impact connection

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:10.950
are in world of the same Blockchain and creates trust and efficiency.

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:15.130
Let us look at the differences between permission and promotional explosions in the next

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:15.450
video.
