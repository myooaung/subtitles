00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200
hi,

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:06.090
everyone having seen Big Kind and it's working in detail and some of the old coins as well

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:06.090
.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.800
I think it's a good time to look at the history off Blockchain.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.980
The Blockchain is not a new concept that was suddenly developed in 2009.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.850
There were a lot of such is going on even before it started from the year 1979 itself,

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.490
1979.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.330
This person called us Ralph Merkley,

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:24.750
came about the mark lately,

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.280
which is even know used in Bitcoins.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.050
We saw that it's a binary tree,

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.680
which holds hashes as leave notes and leave notes are hashed together to form parent lords

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.680
.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.620
This is continued till we get a root,

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.940
nor with only one hash.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.460
And then,

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.140
in 1991 stored Harbor and Scott's Tanaka came up with cryptography.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.080
Really secure chain off blocks their concept waas time sample distill document and hence it

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.750
becomes very secure.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.550
But then they were all struggling with how to bring up with that consensus mechanism.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.920
From the year 1991 to 2005 nearly there were a lot off cultures mechanisms proposed by a

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.650
lot of professors in college.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.240
These were not really working for our last number off notes.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.260
They were working for probably about 20 to 25 notes,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.000
but not anything more that is well,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.410
Bitcoin came into picture.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:22.080
Bitcoin has implemented a distributor decent life system in a very beautiful manner and

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.370
brought in conferences as well.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:29.510
It is so good that this Bitcoin system is the most secure the super that system in the

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:30.150
world today.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.460
Imagine from two dozen nine when it was launched.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.700
Still,

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.090
no,

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.500
there has been no hacks in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.480
We know that it's a decentralized peer to peer permission less Cryptocurrency completely

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.820
destroyed.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:49.280
Cryptocurrency was a dream before Bitcoin came in and then people saw Bitcoins.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.100
And then from 2009 to 2014 there were a lot of cryptocurrencies coming in because each one

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.030
had a different use case and they wanted to build something.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.440
But Bitcoin was not changeable,

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.250
are flexible.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.290
Bitcoin was not a programmer blocked in as we saw before.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.470
Examples of these alternative cryptocurrencies are like crying,

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.740
etcetera in photos and 14 this person called metallic footprint told that I'm going to pull

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.400
out the technology which is powering this global currency called Bitcoin,

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.950
and I'm goingto build some more on that.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.010
That's some more technology built on Blockchain are called smart contracts.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.820
So people were like,

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.330
Why should I only use Bitcoin for global payments?

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.470
Let me use it for other purposes as well.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:41.080
And invention or smart contracts also gave way to a lot of developers to build decent place

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.050
applications based on Ethereum.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.170
They did not need to build their one Blockchain to implement a new use case based on the

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.410
Blockchain technologies.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.280
That is right.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.620
We've seaquarium us a revolutionary technology which is still very good at building

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.990
decentralized applications.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.850
Let's look at the different types of block chains here.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.080
So what is the tedium?

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.360
These other Blockchain is a technology which is powering multiple cryptocurrencies,

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.020
including but kind and material.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.110
So Blockchain technology can be used.

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.470
Toe build protocols are coins like Bitcoin ethereum new like coin ripple.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.800
Except these cryptocurrencies maybe programmable.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.550
Our own programmable examples have been given here for Bitcoin like coin and ripple.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:27.720
It is non programmable.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.370
But then it even knew have this advantage that you can build smart contracts based on that

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:39.660
and hence decentralised applications tokens like TRX Rep PPT snd.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.290
We're all tokens built on the Ethereum platform.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.800
Same goes for DBC,

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.420
you'll see,

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.680
except which is billed only knew your platform.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.740
Let's say you're a developer who wants to develop an app which has all the beauty off

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.960
Blockchain like decentralization Autonomous Solana.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.350
Nobody,

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:01.000
except this is what's not possible with existing implementations of Blockchain like Bitcoin

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.350
and hence a medium was spoken about a lot.

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.920
Looking from a Blockchain perspective,

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.050
all the concept that we've tried for Bitcoin also exists for a stadium.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:16.860
The difference being be kind only considers transactions as shown in the figure Marissa

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:17.890
tedium can do.

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.880
The same transactions has been going us and also hold smart contracts with it.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.410
We look at what a smart contracts in the next week.
