00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.330
in this video,

00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:05.900
let's look at other smaller improvements in Bitcoin or the public ledger that we saw in the

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:06.450
last section.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.480
First,

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.250
let's talk about transaction pools.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.340
Remember in the public Ledger I don't know that the transaction are grouped into a block

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.970
and the block it's added to the Blockchain.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:17.270
Well,

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.350
they re visualize that transaction directly in cars a block.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.700
However,

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.560
in real world applications like Bitcoin,

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.870
all the transactions from my old inwards interim memory record all this transaction food

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.050
before entering a block.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:36.730
This is necessary because remember that there is one more step called mining before blocks

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:37.950
can be added to the Blockchain.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.190
So consider this.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.650
An intermediate step in transactions has to be added to a block.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.640
The transaction pools are also called as memory pools are in charge.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.600
Meme pools Ah,

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.190
black and Bitcoin Blockchain.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.620
That's not only contained transaction details,

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.970
but also other information like the time stamp on marquetry.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.110
First,

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.040
let's look at the time stamp between uses.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.410
This timestamp called UNIX timestamp,

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.990
which is the number of seconds that has passed from January 1st off 1970.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.580
You know the current UNIX timestamp.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:19.840
You can goto this website called UNIX timestamp outcome I seen on the screen.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:28.320
The current time expressed in unit and UNIX timestamp is 15707 to 8777 This number is the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.340
number of seconds that has passed since January 1st off,

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.250
1970.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.270
Next,

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.080
let's look at the concept of marquetry.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.710
The concept of modernity was introduced by Ralph Markley in the year 1979.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.070
A market lee is an important concept and Blockchain,

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.650
which helps to maintain the order and security off transactions in a block marquetry

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:57.000
commenced the concept of both buying territories and hashing a binary tree is a structure

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.350
in which to leave notes are combined together into one.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.550
No,

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.650
and this continues till we Finally one Lord,

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:10.720
as shown in the figure that this looks like a tree in the mercury to transactions are has

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.060
separately and these two conceptions are hash again to form a parent hash.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.290
This process continues to there is only one has left.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.460
This single hash is called as the Maclay route.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.390
As you can see,

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:31.620
l one l two l three handle four are transactions in a block hash of 00 is the hash of this

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.760
transaction called anyone Hash of 01 is the hash of this transaction.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.250
Cardinal do and so on.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:43.550
So hashtag 00 and hash of 01 are hashed together to form has zero.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.030
Similarly,

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.510
hash one is formed from transactions l three and then four hash of zero.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.150
I'm has won our house together to form the top house.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.610
This is hope the root of a McGeady's.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.680
Remember that we need to transactions to pull from a hash here if the number of

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.850
transactions are are in the last 10 section is has with itself.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.200
That's a markedly his phone.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.250
This market restructure is also part of the bloc in a Bitcoin this Elgin maintaining the

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.550
security and order of transactions in a block.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.260
Imagine if a hacker wants to change the transaction a little.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.270
Then the hash 01 will change and hit zero on top hash.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:32.210
All changes because of that and this will help us find exactly which transaction was

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.820
ordered in the same way hash gets changed when,

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.750
between the order of the transactions as well.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.050
These are the concepts off timestamp and McGary.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.950
