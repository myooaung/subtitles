00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.590
Now let's look at the engine core in offering and the other types of fundraising possible

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:05.140
visually,

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:06.150
Blockchain platform.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.930
So initial coin offering is a boon to a lot of founders who will not find the initial

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:17.580
investment for their project are it is a boon to a lot of fraudsters Also get money from

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.140
the public.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.920
And just finally,

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.650
they look at an example to understand how these are happening.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:28.410
Unlike the initial public offering that's possible for bigger companies to go to the public

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.150
to raise money.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.260
There are no regulations whatsoever in an initial court or not,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.750
and this type of fundraising can be done for.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:36.060
Both.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.150
Doctrine based projects are non Russian based projects as well.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.120
Let's say you're building a Blockchain tomorrow,

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.670
which talks about interoperability,

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.360
sustainability and all the problems that current Rajan's house.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.980
Then you can go to the public as formally explaining your idea,

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.000
and then they will invest your project to an initial cardinal all of your building in

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.990
traditional business,

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.120
like an apartment,

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.480
right,

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.150
so you can also go to the public and us for funds to build that project.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.630
Once the project is done,

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.810
the profit will be shared with all the investors.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.180
This also happens without any relationship.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.550
Now let's look at an example to understand I'd be war,

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:17.950
since I see will never go away.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.640
I hope you have a least a shallow understanding off.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.250
What is an I P O called initial public offering.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.770
If I am a company who has been there for about 10 years and making good profits on,

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.540
I want to expand my business into other job charities or into other verticals off business

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.540
.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.550
I would need more investment to do that.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.780
I would go to the general public in my own country.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.780
And as employees invest in my company,

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.050
showing them the road that I have seen till now and the profits,

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.430
they also get to know the future of the company and then with the trust that they have on

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.410
both myself and the regulators,

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:54.950
they will invest in my company.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.370
Once the English they become shareholders on those shares can be traded on the secondary

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.150
market as well.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.150
So this is a concept of I Peel.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.450
Let's take an example off Apple.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.010
These people called Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak initially will create a company called US

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.420
Apple by putting their own money Dehlin with some work sometime on their initial capital to

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.380
build a complete orders.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.120
Happily and the entire 100% of shares will be wound by these two,

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.150
let's say 50% percentage.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:32.410
So what did they do with this initial capital is to give out a proof of concept.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.760
Let's say this is the prototype off my lap of the end building and,

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.150
uh,

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.350
things like that.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.630
Once they do that,

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.780
they can create products and services for profit so they'll create products like MacBooks,

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.410
iPads and iPhones in a smaller scale.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.240
Lets it like 10 Grand Mac books and 10 ipads in the month,

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.250
and they'll get some profits out of that.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.010
So let's say this keeps on happening for about two years,

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.250
then they want to expand the company globally.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.990
They want to go to the general public and tell them,

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.350
See these army products?

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:07.810
This is how good it works.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.050
I have been making profit.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.150
Please give me enough investment so that I can expand my business on.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.450
You'll get chair simpleton.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.750
So this is the concept of traditional oppose,

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:24.320
having seen that the general public can be anyone starting from kitchen is in the country

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.600
to retail investors to all the foreign investments as well.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.670
So that is how it happens and before an I P O goes into the picture.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.450
It takes at least one year for four years to do all the paperwork for the regulators.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.520
For example,

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.230
in the US,

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.650
the FCC's worked us all the regulations,

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.550
looks at the company financials and looks at the company for Unger's.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.350
Make sure the investors do not lose money on a fraudster are faster company?

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.800
No.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.700
On the contrary,

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.950
let's look at a concert coffin I seal,

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.360
and I feel it's an initial coin offering.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.000
When the in the initial stages,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.050
it just works like a normal company.

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.680
They put some money and work and create.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.850
This company called Has happened.

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.120
They get chairs back,

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.750
and then this company three excellent products and make some profits as well as we saw in

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:11.150
the I P.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.260
O.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.850
Example.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.350
So here is where the differences,

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:20.520
when they want to get investment from the public instead of giving them shares and getting

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:26.720
cash and greater devolution tokens and get cash in the form of Bitcoin on deter into the

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.150
company.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.850
So what is the difference here.

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.940
When these people have shares,

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.160
they can be traded in the secondary market.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.810
Also,

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.930
they can work for the company if they have enough ships in the concept of icy will,

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.050
that is not possible.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.570
Here they get tokens.

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.220
They did not get working rates,

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.450
but these tokens are called US utility brokers.

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.610
Your ability tokens,

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:50.810
as the name suggest,

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.350
is some broken that you can use in the company.

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:54.770
So in this case,

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.440
when I create a Mac book are on iPad or an iPhone,

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.850
these investors who have spoken can buy these products for me once the product is ready.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:11.160
And hence it's like the public investing in a company so that they could buy their products

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.680
because these investors were not interested in the shares of the company but their products

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.350
so they can use these tokens to buy the products of that particular country.

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.850
So again,

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:21.240
be so.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.620
What is the difference between a night you and then I see you in the last example.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.850
Let's look at what I see was indeed a.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:31.350
So let's say there is a lady who wants to create one million see Balkans,

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:36.430
see tokens of cinema Balkans in this case because I'm going to explain this with the cinema

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:37.360
Tater concept.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.950
Right?

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:43.710
So she creates one million tokens and has fire under K tokens for herself on fire under K

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.950
tokens she wants to distribute to the public.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.620
So these finders Casey Bogans,

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.660
go for a nice you.

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.310
And as we saw earlier,

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.200
these people will pay cash on get back tokens.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.280
Cash will be in the form of with Corrina return.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.250
Are you neither priority that the founders juices?

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:04.170
So when she gets all the money $2 finder K tokens will be about one million.

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:05.870
And she builds the cinema creator.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:06.250
Right?

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:11.250
So this public very interested in watching movies and hence they invested in the company.

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.000
Once this minimize ready,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.380
they will give these tokens in the cinema,

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.250
cater to watch the movies.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.570
Now that said,

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.290
there is an interesting movie that's running,

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.450
and many people are interested was the movie.

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.440
They can only watch the movie if they have these tokens,

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:26.850
right?

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.280
So what they do in the secondary market,

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.750
they can go get these tokens from these investors.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:38.260
And since these investors know that the demand has increased with more people now they will

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:43.760
not be selling at the same price at $2 they'll be selling these tokens at $6 for broken,

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.010
making a profit off $2 for Holder.

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.610
So these people are happy that they got tokens to watch the movie.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.890
And these people are happy that their investment got appreciated.

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:55.210
And these days,

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:55.580
who,

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:01.020
by talking to the secondary market for $6 will also go meditator and pay the same token to

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:01.950
watch the movies.

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:03.950
Here comes the interesting part.

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:10.150
So this stater has been getting tokens from these initial investors on these people who are

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:11.920
brought it on the secondary market as well.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.120
So it has been collecting a lot of tokens from these people.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:20.150
What will the data do with these tokens when it knows that more and more people want this

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.620
talking to watch movies and they're really to buy it in the secondary market?

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:27.550
They'll tell these tokens in the secondary market and get money,

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:31.050
and this will be the prophet that tickles me.

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:34.120
Also remember that this lady,

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.850
when she created one million tokens,

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:38.540
she only went for find Casey tokens in the I.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:38.950
C U.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:43.150
That is 500 Casey Bogans are with her for a warning Messman.

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:45.030
So if I undertake tokens,

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:49.310
if she says everything off this in the secondary market at nine Point Open,

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:51.710
she'll believe put $4.5 million.

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:56.810
That will be the focus in Cento for creating such a equal system where people can come

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.270
watch cell opens in the secondary market.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:03.350
Except imagine how difficult wants this in an ideal.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:07.890
So before building the day that she would have never imagined that because she can go to

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:10.850
the public to raise investment for our project.

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:12.060
Brockton.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:13.370
And I see you made it possible.

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:15.150
Even without the need regulations,

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:16.680
I said only before.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.690
If I am a startup and I want to start something on my wall,

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:25.740
I need to run behind Angel investors or venture capitalists to invest in my company before

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:31.070
I suppose came into the picture that has been issues became a boon for founders who are who

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:36.270
don't have to create a lot of interesting cos they were able to raise money from the global

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:37.970
public into their company.

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:40.030
That's the reason it was called a bull.

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:43.700
But then it also helped this camp source run away with this money.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:50.280
Imagine this lady after getting do no less for Pocono 500 k that's about one million.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.950
See Lana V and did not.

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:52.980
Will the cinematic correct?

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.980
All Because there are no regulations to save these people.

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.550
They lose all their investment.

00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:00.470
That's what has been happening in a lot of cases.

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:07.360
And I CEOs 2017 and early 2018 bear the years where a lot of scamps were happening in the

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.150
icy over.

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:09.950
If you look at the largest,

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:10.780
I feel scam.

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:15.740
That was about $660 million by an Internation company called Been Coin.

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:21.620
And I fan you can read about been going arrive and more to know about what kind of scams

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:22.250
are happening.

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:26.360
I want to show you on the other website,

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:31.670
which shows you what kind of upsets these cancers were using who will only attract

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:36.490
investors and invest in the company even though they were not willing to raise the project

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:36.490
.

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:39.600
They just want some investment and run away with that money.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.050
Right?

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:43.620
So what these people did was create a fancy in upstate,

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:44.580
as shown here,

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:45.920
This is called les eight.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.550
Another icy order Come in which if you go,

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:51.020
it'll just randomly generate something for you.

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:51.660
Toe.

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:57.750
Have a look at what kind of upset they were building toe attracting Leicester's So here

00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:58.070
they say.

00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.760
First wise,

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.180
they want decent place application for year I.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:04.150
And then how many days are left to invest in the icy War?

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:09.150
Except they were also talk about the product in a lot of fancy manner.

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:15.750
And they'll say that people from large companies that's the hunger of Ethereum and other

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:17.610
people are a part of the team.

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:23.490
So companies they were working with and all the team members also these,

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:24.740
interestingly,

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:28.150
were on Linden profiles are some professors from Fortune Media.

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:33.070
When these people did not know that they were a part of such a team on the names also might

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:34.150
be completely different.

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:36.730
Axum.

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:39.530
Our bases are some members in the media,

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:44.860
some marketing some link and give a roadmap early investors so that they get load by what

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:46.040
you are saying in the website,

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:46.550
right?

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:48.950
So once they say it open disinflation.

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:52.990
This is what is happening and all the white paper and stuff like that.

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:57.740
Investors got so much interested in these things that they started investing in brilliance

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:58.800
into these companies.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.150
That's why we saw a lot of issues.

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:07.920
I suppose it's Mark something like $30,000 investment since it is amenable to the global

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:08.350
public.

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:12.730
Investments came and poured into these companies as in billions and billions,

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:17.200
as we saw the biggest ice awas for $4 billion in a company partners blocked,

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.490
but one which is building the US platform.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:22.600
Interestingly,

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.790
Ethereum,

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:25.030
Godineaux except parent,

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:27.250
all the auctions also went for a nice.

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:31.920
Even with the addition stages Ethereum bagged about $6 million investment that I know about

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:36.090
$65 million investment Mentor so in this website.

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:38.930
So every time you create this generator of the race,

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:41.450
you it will create another ice your concept for you.

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:47.560
So I can't say first year over the years platform for year t accept so it will contain

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:51.520
different team members and the website will look really fancy.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.050
And surprisingly,

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:56.630
this looks like the actual websites that were generated during the ice.

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:57.750
Your scam tens.

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:58.850
So yeah,

00:11:58.850 --> 00:11:59.210
well,

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:01.700
bit what this high civil and how it works,

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.980
why it is good for fungus to raise money and why it is good.

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.190
First camp stirs to make some scams as well.

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:10.060
That's when people saw or guys.

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:14.730
He was not really a big thing because regulations are not there and investor money is not

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:15.650
perfected here.

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:19.460
That's when a lot of other dates or fundraising came into the picture,

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:20.050
right,

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:21.240
Like security open,

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.330
offering equity broken,

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:24.070
offering initial exchange offering itself.

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:26.700
So when I want to go for a nice evil,

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:28.790
I can create some stupid company.

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:31.350
Are Francique upside and just say yes.

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:36.700
I'm gonna promise all these things on with these promises without any regulators in between

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:36.700
.

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:37.810
The misters were real.

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:39.030
It'll invest money in me,

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:42.810
and I can either deliver God's promises are on of it.

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:45.850
Nobody can actually find me because it didn't was up.

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:47.050
So Don Imus platform.

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:51.760
And also remember that the example that we saw earlier we're called us you believe people

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:52.210
opens.

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:58.410
There is also a constable equity building which are similar to an ideal where you invest.

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:00.050
When you get chairs of the company,

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:05.040
you get morning rates and begin sell those tokens in the secondary market to gain your

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.140
profit on investment.

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:06.560
Right?

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:09.450
That is equity broken offering and then game.

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:13.750
Initial exchange offering Munition exchange offering Isman on exchange.

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:15.750
Make finance are big Bread's stole.

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:16.670
Okay,

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:18.510
if a person is going for my civil,

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:20.990
let me find out if that person is a scam.

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:22.670
Stir our Is it illegitimate?

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:23.210
I see you.

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:26.850
So the exchange will come Look at the company,

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:30.150
the hunger's research about it and find the report.

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:30.840
Okay,

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:34.360
these phone doesn't legitimate and they are going to do something with the investment that

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.000
we are doing.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.800
And hence you can invest in these companies.

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:43.090
So with the research that was done by a exchange on believe in the exchange and trust that

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:44.150
the exchange offers,

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:46.660
people really do invest in these companies.

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:49.410
So this was a slight improvement over issues,

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:51.000
then games.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.070
Security token.

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:56.250
Offering a security token offering isn't regulated offering,

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:58.980
but a global payment in there.

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.010
The regulators from the U.

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:01.280
S.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:02.150
Called a C C.

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:07.350
Takes for the icy will on these people will do a lot of research and there is a lot of

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:12.870
paper working for the group of the SEC that I am a legitimate company and I want investment

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:17.820
from the public using the Blockchain back from so the SEC will do a lot off background

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:19.880
checks on give you a certificate that,

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:20.430
yes,

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:22.150
this company can be invested in.

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:23.290
But yeah,

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:28.200
this security token offering is booming nowadays because of the regulations backed by it.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.690
But then a new folder.

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:31.530
Unless he has enough credibility,

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:34.870
he will not be able to raise funds using security token offering.

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:38.390
But a midsize company for expansion can definitely do it,

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:42.050
and this is the best way to invest in companies through the doctor platform.

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:43.790
So here in the diagram,

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:48.420
we look at steps that is involved in the fund raising process so the company issues

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.320
disturbs locals for its stocks.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:55.500
People partition past these tokens around every transactions recorded on the Blockchain and

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.440
Blockchain and tokens provide stop ownership.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:01.510
I'm information company automatically determines the waiting payments through that

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:02.150
information.

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:06.060
Dividends are share of the profits that the company pays to the shareholders.

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.170
Let's say you have a duty to open offering.

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:13.350
I have the shares of the company's on die can either trade that in the secondary market are

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:15.310
wait for the company to pay me dividends.

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:17.570
What happens in the evidence is that it?

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:20.260
The completes making one million off for profits.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:27.190
It can give out about 100 k So the investors under split it between all the investors that

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:28.610
whole shares thought that company,

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:32.990
the rest 900 kids will go back into the company for expansion purposes.

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:37.910
So this is how that religion like your works and is this sending home I see was also

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:39.150
working the Blockchain platform.

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:44.420
So I hope now you have a particular understanding about the Italian platform medium and gas

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:45.070
architecture.

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:46.680
Er the smart contracts,

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:47.410
folks,

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:52.970
that happened Heart folks off for contemporary folks on the page of fundraising on the kind

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:54.910
of scams that can happen in front facing,

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:58.230
Let's look at permission to block change in the next section of this course.

00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:59.550
See you in the next section.
