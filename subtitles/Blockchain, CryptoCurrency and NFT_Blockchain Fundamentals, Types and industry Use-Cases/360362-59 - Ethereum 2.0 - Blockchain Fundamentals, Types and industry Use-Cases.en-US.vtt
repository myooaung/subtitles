00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.510
the next currently hot topic in the margin ecosystem is a Syrian 2.0,

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:09.620
we've been working on Italian 1.0 from the time it was released in the year total 16 for

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:10.380
the public,

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.550
the smart contract layer,

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.010
right?

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.870
So it did him 1.0 by the founders of a tedium itself is considered a supporter.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:21.580
They had to release something very fast for the world to know that smart contracts can be

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.120
developed on the Blockchain platform and they have really proved it.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.220
But all the taps and dowels that we're looking at in the world right now.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.460
But there are a lot of issues with the tedium.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.300
As you saw,

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.410
there is a lot of scalability issues with the tedium,

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.280
with only 30 transactions per second maximum that can be done in the Italian Blockchain.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.930
Right?

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.280
So they have been working for a long time now to improve the scalability issue on bringing

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.140
a lot of improvement.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.270
So,

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.750
ethereum,

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.400
I make it a simple point.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.570
The 1st 1 will be they will be moving from this consensus algorithm called us proof off.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:50.930
What proof of stake,

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.000
as we have seen in the Bitcoin and Ethereum Blockchain.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.670
They use this consciousness mechanism called us Proof off.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.110
Look,

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.170
what is proof of work the minor.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.350
If he has to prove that the network that is a valid manner on,

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.510
he has something to lose,

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.930
that is the definition of poverty.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.240
He needs to calculate by trial and error a stupid number Carla's nuns and put it in the

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.550
block so that the Bloods hash has some leading zeros.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:14.240
This,

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.030
as we have seen,

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.620
consumes a lot of electricity,

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.250
and that has a lot of environmental problems in the world.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.210
Tens people were suggesting proof state for a long time broke off.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.710
Steak is where Let's say I have 100 litre and I can stake those coins.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:28.910
Just likes taking in the case,

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:29.240
you know,

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.370
and saying Let me minor block And if you'll find that the block is fine,

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.240
give me the reward.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.490
Now they re warders.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.410
I've staked my coins and when a minor valid block you are gonna reward me with new returns

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.410
.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.430
What is the penalization process here?

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.580
Is that whatever I have steak if the block is found to be invalid Or in other words,

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.950
if you find me Toby,

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.910
a hacker then my steak.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.170
The clients will gold off me and helps.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.450
Money isn't list here.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.650
That's the reason why proof of status Spencer to be better than proof off work in a lot off

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.470
base because it doesn't have the settlement business off.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.600
Prove off work like using a lot of computational power.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.900
The 51% attack,

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:05.410
etcetera,

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.830
then shouting is also being implemented.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.870
Unitarian Pulpit shouting as we saw It's a contract where you split the entire Blockchain

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.270
in two my people shots and hence eating consist throughput.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.410
There's also this Italian virtual mission,

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.190
which runs in every full Nordoff ethereum on.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.090
This is the place where all the smart contract Corgan's.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.310
There is a lot of bottlenecks with the existing idiom and helps.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.670
It is being replaced by something called a ribosome,

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.850
which is a W three c open standard,

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.050
And many big companies like Microsoft are involved in this process.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.010
So in a presentation,

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.920
baby tell equipment,

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.350
he himself said that take it to him.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.220
One point will let Xavi can make about nine transactions per second.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.240
If I implement charting into the ecosystem and chart the entire Ethereum network in 200

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.680
charts,

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.890
I can increase the throughput by 100 times,

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.320
so that becomes 900 transactions per second.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.250
On If I include proof of stake algorithm that can increase May transaction to put by

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.450
another 100 times,

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.630
and hence the number of transactions that that can be handled became human Only.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.890
Shouting and proven steak is about 90,000 transactions,

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.770
which is even more higher than Visa and MasterCard's of the world.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.220
And hence these two are definitely going to be a breakthrough in the Algerian world.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.050
Are the Blockchain will completely?
