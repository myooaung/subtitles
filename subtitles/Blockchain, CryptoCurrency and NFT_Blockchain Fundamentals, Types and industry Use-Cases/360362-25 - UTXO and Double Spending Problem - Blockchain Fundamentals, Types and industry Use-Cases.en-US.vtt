00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.790
Now let's look at the last concept in Bitcoin transactions and you'll be exhaust.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.750
This is a concept which differs from the traditional banking system I Bitcoins you d accept

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:10.750
.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.750
It is an important difference to understand and that helps in solving a very important

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.650
problem in peer to peer networks.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.250
Let's say Andrew Bob,

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.510
Catherine on Daniel.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.650
Send me one Bitcoin three but going six Bitcoin and seven Bitcoin each.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.790
This will be unspent transaction inputs for me.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:34.370
Let's say I want to spend these Bitcoins on a car for five Bitcoins,

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.860
right?

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.220
What do you do with the traditional banking system?

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.540
Is that the addition off all this one plus three plus six plus seven,

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.440
which comes to about between 16 and 17 Bitcoins,

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.460
I'll have a dazzle account balance and from that 17 Bitcoins,

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.950
I live five Bitcoins and have the rest well,

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.250
with myself in Bitcoins.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.050
It doesn't work in that way.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.760
So when I want to transfer this fight Bitcoin I take one transaction.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.550
Let's say Catherine six Bitcoin transaction I I'll try to give it to the car dealer five

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.550
Bitcoins But then with this transaction off six Bitcoins,

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.650
I am spending only five Bitcoins The rest one Bitcoin I need to send it to myself back.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.090
And this is called us Utx source.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.330
I'll have inspired transaction inputs on time spent transaction outputs Every Bitcoin has a

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.850
history So one Bitcoin Bennett answer from me to you That would have a history that first I

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:33.490
was the owner.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.750
And then you are the winner of that particular Bitcoin.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:44.290
There is no concept off calms and balances in Bitcoin so these two will be like you take So

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.550
for the car dealer on this will be the utx So for me again.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.850
And then my Bitcoin wallet will show balances like this.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.230
Andrew has given me one Bitcoin Bob Daniel On the last transaction,

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.270
I said to myself one Bitcoin came from the previous transaction.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.320
They bought a car for five Bitcoins.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:09.050
Right now let's say I want to do a letter transaction toe by a guard for 11 Bitcoins 11

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.580
Bitcoins.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.850
I think that will be a really expensive car anyway,

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:19.260
So they inputs I'll pick your is boss three Bitcoin Daniel seven Bitcoin on one Bitcoin

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.870
which isn't my to myself in the last transaction.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.850
So all this campaign together from 11 Bitcoins which I can transfer to the car dealer.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.230
We're missing an important concept here called the transaction fees.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.260
So we saw that whenever we do a Bitcoin transaction,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.480
we need to add some fees so that the minor can get it as everybody.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.150
So that also can be added along with this.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.930
So why do we have this concept of utx So unlike an account under balance,

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:48.490
right?

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.730
So we saw that you take so has a history for each and every Bitcoin that is coming to me

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.190
and that I'm spending so everybody kind that you take has the whole of history.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.150
There is this problem called us double spending that happens in the peer to peer network.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:10.110
Let's say I'm a person who wants 10 Bitcoins Ashley balance and I transfer 10 Bitcoins toa

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.180
person called a year I before that gets updated in the Blockchain,

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.890
I transfer the same 10 Bitcoins to another person.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.050
This is known as a double spending problem.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.970
Now with the concept of beauty exhaust the first transaction Very cento a person Cartier

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.950
will be valid because I have done Bitcoins which are unspent transaction inputs on when I

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.900
try to do an output that has the history.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.010
So I am the owner and I can transfer that to another person.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.630
Well,

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.480
its sent second transaction comes in that does not have a history on the wanted as myself.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.330
And hence this will be invalidated by the Lords in the Blockchain.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.700
And this is how these all the problem after spending.
