00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960
you in the digital era now that all the countries we're talking about making their sippy

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:05.580
smart,

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.630
but I really risers and smart manufacturing and what nots.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.650
Let's look at what the competent off smart cities first.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.310
Smart cities include smart manufacturing's more government ability and WiFi everywhere.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.390
Smart and visitors,

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.130
citizens open data smart held and all of these smart things that we're talking about these

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.420
are possible using I'll be devices right.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.300
They cannot talk to each other and then bring in data on a laser on make the cities smarter

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.250
and smarter as they bring more data.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.380
But then,

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.400
whenever there is a huge amount of data,

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.640
there is a problem of hacking,

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.210
and this data will be so vulnerable that any hacker would want to have this data because

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.370
this contains the date off all the citizens in that particular city.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.180
Remember when we saw centralization is not so secure,

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.190
we can conquer the centralization and used not in for the same,

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.380
especially when you use,

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.750
I hope he realizes there's a report with taste.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.030
60% off work data.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.220
I only use old is being had,

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.670
and it's not ask 20.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.500
Let's also look at how to make good citizens out of Blockchain.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.680
So I'm sure you all know the concept of working and elections,

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.040
right?

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.210
So whenever you do a ballot working on a chip working on something,

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.340
we don't really trust the system because you're just giving a sheet of paper are in during

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.420
your digital world,

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.420
which goes to a central party again.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.250
If the party has a lot of political influence,

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.280
then they can actually manifest the result of the whooping and hence the fate of the entire

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.980
country itself.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.530
It is because of this lack off prince that most of the citizens born girl and what for the

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.640
people they want to they think you want.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.130
If I were,

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.350
it's not going to help because it's not a very time spinning process.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.670
Imagine bringing,

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.660
working with locked in.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.540
Everyone can have their private key to work,

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.150
and hence there will be any problems off for forgery in working.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.160
And the calculation is all done using smart pointers.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.330
So there cannot be any third party intervention in this case,

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.250
and and it can be very transparent for the citizens and will make them work as well.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:04.110
Imagine another situation where you want all the citizens of your country to go green and

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.000
start using public transportation or carpooling on made in the city clean except whatever

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.110
rewarding them with.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.440
Even they are trying to do it.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.480
The seven.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.080
They're not foreign tropicals.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.040
You're penalizing them with pay tickets.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.890
But what if the person is doing good things following all the rules,

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:20.990
working properly,

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.100
paying his taxes,

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.130
so he does not get any water at all way?

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.410
And that's the problem.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.020
But bringing in closeness towards his one country so Blockchain can your polkas to bring

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.240
citizens hasn't.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.640
When you're going to office from Monday to Friday,

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.900
you can take a car pooling our public transport.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.250
When you do that and you pull the your gun it,

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.010
you can get green points in which you can get three off course.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.320
Public transportation during Bacon's are some drink point very.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.040
Get a discount on your electricity bill ending signup.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.140
So this way we can keep on the warning people who do good things for the environment,

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.610
anti country and hence Luxan can play a major role in transforming the entire world to be

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:59.450
good citizens.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.960
So I hope this section or news cases a production which included both permission.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.190
Less use cases are in permission to use cases will pull up your mind.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.260
And after understanding the features of the technology and how it works,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.100
this can be an eye opener for you to visualize.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.230
All this can be useful in various industries.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.680
Right?

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.920
I would have given you about the use cases and don't do that.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.700
This is how it is going and I can make a 10 are really about all the use cases.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.350
But then that is not the real object to off this entire calls it.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.870
I want Toto teach you Blockchain and want you to visualize the future prospects of lotion

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.400
on water can be possible but in the doctor,

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.550
because currently Brompton is a baby and it doesn't longer to go.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.270
It is because of people like you and me who need to think out of the box and come out of

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.170
the traditional use cases on bringing more use cases,

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.820
bringing more decentralization into all the industries.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.470
And hence I leave it here.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.260
I want to give you some assignments on some industries which you can go through research on

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.650
yourself and hence understand the topic visualize yourself,

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.180
and after that I would really,

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.320
really want you to come up with your own use cases so that you can form a company off your

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.550
will.

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.060
On the hardest thing right now in the investor market is Blockchain,

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.620
and hence,

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.840
if you are coming up with a very good use case,

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.720
you could definitely bag a good investment and be an entrepreneur.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.250
A funeral.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.180
So in that sense,

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.860
I think this use cases were kind of started working for you to think about your own use

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:27.280
case and do a lot more research to understand about the other industry use cases We'll see

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.150
about the future of luncheon in the next section of this course.
