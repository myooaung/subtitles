00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.310
in this video,

00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:02.880
let's talk about social networks.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.990
We already saw some centralization issues with Facebook and Google and the baby use social

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:09.470
networks social,

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.370
likable to like Facebook and Twitter.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.170
Collect all our data and they also try to manage.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.750
Let us with the kind off ice that they're providing us.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.850
One is that we are being a product when we're not paying for them.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.490
And the 2nd 1 which we need to discuss about is that Let's I post a very good content on

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.170
Facebook and everyone likes it on comments it and I get a product bay the entire world.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.010
But then what do we make all comfort in terms of monetary value?

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.250
I do not make anything out of whatever a post on the social media except the fame that I

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.250
get who is finally benefiting from.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.340
This is a Facebook,

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.350
a company itself.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.260
So don't you think Blockchain can be a solution for this?

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.450
Absolutely it can.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.830
That's why a company called this team is working on different social networks that can be

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:59.460
built on its platform On steamer dot com and edu are examples off this steam.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.520
It is a social media platform where you can share your posts on whenever someone

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.600
contributes to the post by liking are committing on it.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.780
You get real money,

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.650
you get paid in steam tokens and that can be converted into USD with any of the exchanges.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.950
Let's take a quick look at steam it dot com,

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.700
so you get an understanding about what I'm talking.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.440
So this is the home page of steamer dot com,

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.270
where you can see this person when he posted This has got a ports about 4 69 and there are

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.450
30 comments on the same,

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.300
and he has made about $61 by posting.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.520
This same goes for the other post here.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.070
$82.56 dollars,

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.630
etcetera.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.910
So steam it is a separate Blockchain platform by itself,

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.630
which is built on social media.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.590
They have their own steam tokens,

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.950
which that provided to these people who are contributing to the ecosystem that is the power

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.650
of decentralization serving decentralization.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.350
And does this or two million it work.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.620
It's beautiful that the power is going back to the content creators.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.910
So if I am a person who is on Facebook,

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.400
I'm not need to depend on the IRS revenue that they give me are my business is making out

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.760
of that.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.270
If I'm pushing good country,

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.150
I should be paid directly by the country viewers itself.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.110
And it also eliminates a lot of censorship because censorship is done by the pier sitting

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.200
on Laker Central,

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.550
a party called Facebook.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.250
We'll also take a look at the tube here.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.150
Did you have your just looks like you do,

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.450
because this is just decent list you do.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.290
So when a person post video on YouTube and many off them seeing like it,

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.620
what did the person get paid is that the ad revenues that Google is making a part off it

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.160
will be given to the content creators.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.790
So that's what we talk a lot about getting subscribers and getting more legs and viewers

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:40.550
for a video.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.100
So why should there be something like,

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.220
I create content?

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.980
People watch pendant when people watch content.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.570
There are advertisements that are shown to people you do makes a lot of money on the part

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.250
of it comes to the content creators.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.720
That shouldn't be the case,

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.510
in my opinion,

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.130
because the uses our bomb down with a lot of our traditions on because you do was playing a

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.600
middleman.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.550
Here we are losing a lot of fees.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.420
Do the middle man in this process.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.980
That's why did you tells you that there are no advertisements here.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.820
The person posts a video,

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.300
someone watches it and contributes by commenting and validating it.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.810
They get paid immediately.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.940
What the content creators on the country borders are paid with steam tokens.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.450
That's the power off decentralization and social networks,

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.230
and that's what steam was tryingto you can.

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.600
Also,

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.430
when you are content,

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.710
steam it dot com to start with you horrible journey in the recently social networks.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.680
If you give you a public and private key using which you can post content on,

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.050
get contributions for the same,

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.530
I hope that gives a good understanding off.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.610
Whole social networks can be decentralized using Blockchain.
