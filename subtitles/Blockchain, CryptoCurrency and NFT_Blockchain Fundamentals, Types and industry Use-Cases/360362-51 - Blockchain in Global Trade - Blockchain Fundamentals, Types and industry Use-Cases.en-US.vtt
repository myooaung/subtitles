00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.290
so previously we have seen what is a permission.

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.360
Reproduction on by enterprises are looking at permission to block change to make their

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.590
business more efficient.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.090
Importantly,

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.480
Hyper Ledger Project from Lenox Foundation.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.050
It's being spoken about in all the enterprises and all the industries.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.150
Let's look at the example of global trade in this video.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:27.040
So global trade is when you want a chance for some goods from one country to another

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.060
country in the world.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.460
That cargo could go through any of the logistics methods like your rail.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:32.950
Our ship.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.910
There is a cargo part which takes the actual goods from one country to the other,

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.050
and there's a document.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.590
But were you submit all the documents,

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.540
the bill of lading,

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.480
letter of credit,

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.070
everything toe the customs department,

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.930
the port authorities,

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.010
the regulators,

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.340
the shipper exporter,

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.090
his bank,

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.990
your bank,

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.700
everything.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.160
And it takes a long,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.150
long time to get signatures and all this and approvals for all of the documents.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.770
Once the documents are signed by everyone,

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.460
there is a person who carries the stock physical documents by an airplane,

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.660
go to the other country to settle them.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:13.170
It is said that the cargo path takes let sometime down the document part in the earlier

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.590
case.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.360
That's why IBM came up.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.000
But this concept offer trade links with this company called Us Mosque Most the largest

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.310
shipping logistics company in the entire world.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.110
So they say that bringing in Blockchain into the global trade it is going toe reduce about

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.260
15% age cost in there are career for customs paperwork.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:38.550
$27 billion is being saved by using just an electronic documents instead of paper documents

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.550
.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.000
Why are we not trusting the digital form off?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.200
All the documents in a scandal format previously is that it can be tamper.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.620
Various documents stored on the Blockchain cannot be,

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.760
and that's the reason.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.450
And that's the reason why we were not able to believe in those can copies.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.950
But in blocks in it is definitely testable.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.820
If all the countries improved,

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.020
brought an administration and transport and communication infrastructure to even half of

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.540
the global best practice,

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.400
it could mean a one trillion increase in global exports because we are improving the

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.550
efficiency off all the companies in the world of the global tree by a large extent,

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.050
So think about it.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.340
Ah,

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.080
global trading,

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.330
Wealthy exporter's bank,

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.480
the exporter himself,

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.610
Export authority port off loading port of entry,

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.170
import,

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.580
customs importer and the Importers Bank.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.380
All these people have to get a sort of documents they need to go through,

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.050
verify,

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.880
approve it,

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.480
and then the next person have to do the same process again and again.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.780
So when all these parties come together in a Blockchain platform,

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.020
which is immutable and trustworthy,

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.140
they can all believe in the transactions that are there in the Blockchain,

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.020
and one person need not do the same redundant verification process that the other person

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.260
did.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.080
Also,

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.660
the tracking can be real time,

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.560
and hence the same.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.160
A lot of costs in trying to drag these goods from one place to another.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.170
Blockchain can be used in global traits because of features like secure data exchanges,

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.190
tamper proof documents and e signatures did still an automated workflow.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.550
So real time visibility and analytics.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.820
Let's look at an example off trade Linds,

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.860
built by IBM and most together,

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.750
trailing is a distilled platform that empowers businesses and authorities.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.630
Merced and IBM together started this,

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.760
but then they don't have any control over what this trade links Blockchain.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.050
No,

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.030
it is kind of an industry standard that they're building for logistics companies in the

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.440
beginning,

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.980
What happened?

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.550
Waas Most visualize this concept off trade winds,

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.820
bringing everyone into the Blockchain platform,

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.240
including the exporter,

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.750
the Port Authority's customs regulators,

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.430
everyone into the Blockchain and the competitors off mosque who were very small in volume

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.880
compact,

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.860
more risk did not agree to enter the Blockchain because they thought that their data is not

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.400
security for put on a Blockchain.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.900
But then they saw advantages off Blockchain farmers.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.810
Their goods were being approved early and being passed on into deport very easily than

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.410
their coats and health.

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.140
They understood the part of logic on the security part off it as well.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.610
If you see the permission,

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:03.670
the Blockchain platform,

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.870
they have security called channels.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.830
So people in one channel cannot beauty legitimate and the other channel and so on.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.010
So they understood that even if I store my data in D Block till it is not going to be

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.150
publicly visible and the computer will not be able to look at mine,

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.260
the rest the regulators will be able to look at all the players in the industry,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.490
get real time Data Analytics on whatever they are doing.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.500
This bear away for a beautiful thing toe happen.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.300
The competitors are in the same Blockchain,

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.600
and they're all your blessing.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.030
The part off locked in together where they are increasing their own business efficiencies

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.020
on the overall industry together.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.780
That's the example of trade Lands and Hope Lodge in made it more efficient.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.020
There's a good video about trade glints on YouTube,

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.690
which I'll share with you in the resources so that you can go through that and understand

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.150
plane lands in the more we should be.
