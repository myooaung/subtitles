00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160
in this video we look at what is the Dow,

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.850
how old our works and the dour tackles.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.480
So let's first look at a traditional organization in which you are me.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.750
Where are working in flight.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.840
A tradition organization will have a director or a Chapman,

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.350
and then he'll have executives under them mostly see X source.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.760
City will see,

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.350
will accept,

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.900
and then they will be managers under them,

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.330
which will have teams on.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.890
Then the last person will be the employees in the Empire,

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.020
three off the organization,

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:30.650
right?

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.030
So the problem with this kind of traditional organization started centralize.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.970
The decision making authorities are within the company,

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.130
and it's all made by the shareholders.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.410
Are the employees off the company when this is happening?

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.980
There is a problem of central authorities that is,

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.530
the employees managing the organization taking bad decisions that are not in the interests

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:51.450
of the shareholders.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.350
Are you in this?

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.750
Our players are the customers of the company might get the satisfied with one day polite.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.500
That is,

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.550
when we get into the concept of decentralised autonomous organizations.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.250
The that was force up.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.150
Since you have seen smart contracts and hope for these are in the Italian Blockchain.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.890
Can we think about a situation where there are contracts which are gaining the entire

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.840
organization with the an example next so that you understand it better,

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.050
but for no Imagine that the manufacturing division,

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.040
also particular companies are separate Smart contract,

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.050
which takes care for all the manufacturing operation side off the entire company.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.900
There is an I D smart contract that's takes care of all the technological requirements off

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:34.550
the company.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.060
There is a decision making smart contract where people can water and make decisions for the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.500
entire double on.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.250
There are smart contracts which are trading the smart contracts as well.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.020
Right?

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.950
So this is all this mark on track organization will look like.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.900
How is this possible is because there's a lot of automation happening in the entire world,

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:53.730
and hence,

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.250
an organization that runs way itself is definitely a possibility.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.430
You already know an example.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.460
Offer decently Autonomous organization called us a Bitcoin.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.360
Is there anyone who is getting the Bitcoin called the CEO Chapman of someone?

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.010
Nothing with the founder of Bitcoin,

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:11.780
Mr Sarkozy be able to change anything in Bitcoin.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.750
Currently are actor system not possible once it is out of the world.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.000
It is the appears in the Blockchain that will make decisions on behalf of deduction and

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.050
health that lack that's autonomously.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.990
Let's look at some decentralised economist organization examples so that we understand the

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.580
concept up that I was in Africa,

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.850
right?

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.440
So we already stop it,

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.350
Cornet Sadaharu.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.650
And then let's look at a labour as an example Here,

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:37.680
currently,

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.870
uber is a centralised organisation.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.910
Big flavors on customers get connected with each other,

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.140
get trades and paid it.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.700
I waas.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.950
Now the payment goes to uber and then comes through the papers.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.450
There are a lot of problems with uber and its management off the papers,

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.240
so whenever I pay doesn't go directly for that,

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.260
they were on the reserved like Plus,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.050
there is a features bio but as well the fees.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.000
So Haider's.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.550
There is a lot of protests happening against uber by the drivers.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.070
Why is this all happening?

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:12.460
Is because the decision that being made having to pay for the drivers on did what kind of

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.390
fees that they need to charge both with the customer.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.940
Ondas.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.650
A commission for the driver is decided based center look are we call a super.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.250
What of this entire organization they sent out?

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.170
Imagine,

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.110
since we have self driving cars.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.440
No.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.250
Those are part of the organization called Les de Over Decentralised economists over.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.420
So there is a car which runs the total driver is there in this concept?

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.370
Callers Dow.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.110
Then the Dow look and learn autonomously told any man powerful.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.410
They say I'm a user who is using an application in my phone Call,

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.820
dear.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:47.310
Over,

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.430
I can tell you,

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.650
but that I want to go from point A to point B.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.760
The smart contract which pits may request but you tell it to the nearest car available with

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.480
a good rating that go to this particular place and pick up this person go from point A to

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.060
point B.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.760
The central in car will take the instruction from this mark contract Come to me,

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.950
picked me up and then dropped me at the location.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.270
Once they confirm that I have reached the place,

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.520
the smart contract will to take money from my ago and translate it to the dollar.

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:21.350
So this person on let's say the car keeps on going like this.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.600
What of the Guard needs some intelligence repaired right,

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.060
so that we go to our mental shock.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.570
The maintenance truck on this double will have an agreement that for this particular

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.170
maintenance does this work It'll charge and hence the car will be repaired.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.060
I'm only repaid from the smart,

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.170
contracted self moody maintain and shop.

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:40.350
And then the cardinals.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.780
Same guns up a place for gas as well.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.830
So the car was goes to the gas station,

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:45.640
get filled,

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.750
or electricity gets filled,

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.300
and then the smart contract will pay the gas station for whatever gas that is gas use all

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.450
the electricity consumption.

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:58.570
All the money that goes into this double will be collected in a smart quarterback and also

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.290
used for maintenance and new,

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.980
bleak our expansion or any other activities that the company is doing when there is some

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.430
leftover profit that will be shared with the investors who have invested in this company

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:10.850
called us the day ourselves.

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.900
This is definitely a possibility in the future,

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.250
and we can expect something like this to happen very soon.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.390
It's also look at another application called us.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.900
The decent,

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.270
less autonomous Aws Aws,

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.000
as we know,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.200
is the cloud solution off Amazon in the entire world of cloud computing.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.120
I think Amazon wants about 60% age off the entire globe now,

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.250
and hence that is a huge organization.

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:38.530
Imagine the kind of course that interviews would be spending to raise the infrastructure.

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.340
Have so much manpower on technology,

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.090
plus security toe.

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.950
Bring the clung together to build this infrastructure and made it right.

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.760
So when did that act isn't decentralised autonomous organization?

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.700
What did happen is Versailles.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.710
Every so many petabytes of data,

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.570
and there are more customers coming in.

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:02.070
It will detect the increase in storage accordingly and buy clothes stories automatically by

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.470
this month.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:03.250
Contract itself.

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.450
There is no human intervention in born in this kind of a place.

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:07.620
All right,

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:12.790
So imagine another example where there are decently storage concepts.

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:14.780
There is a company called a Storch,

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.250
which is not contract built upon ethereum Blockchain.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.710
Let's say you have some stories left in your laptop,

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:21.970
like about 10 TB,

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:23.750
30 GP for three GP etcetera.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.830
That is like I really in your laptop.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.450
It's is so you can use this pace and rented out the others.

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:31.590
The other people.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:33.050
You can use your space,

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.850
encrypt their information,

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:36.180
store it in your space,

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.600
and by doing this you can get money off.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.390
I hope you have a letter that our example sinking in your brain.

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.650
Let's look at the Dow attack next.

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:49.250
So before understanding that I work that we need to understand what is the double first,

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:50.100
the damn.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:54.030
You might be confusing because we saw a generic term called Decentralized Autonomous

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:58.090
Organization called us the double before the That was a company,

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:02.360
which is found in 2016 by a Germany based company for less stopped art I t.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:08.230
So this deductible he's a venture capital fund aimed at collecting money from investors and

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:09.670
investing in start up projects,

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:13.140
just like a traditional regional capital does just that.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:17.050
Here we are eliminating demented capital and the management partners itself.

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:21.630
So what happens in a traditional venture capital is that in most of from all around the

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:21.930
world,

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:22.870
who are high net worth,

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:27.250
individuals will come together and pull their money into over Jack Cafferty.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:32.310
This venture capital will have a management which will look at other start ups and bigger

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:34.470
companies which are very future ready,

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:36.320
and they see a good growth potential.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:36.950
In fact,

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:41.080
they will sell it a few startups and invest in those start ups are companies,

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.460
so that when the start of gross and value,

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.220
they can either sell the stock up to a bigger company,

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.050
are still there shares in the public to get the money.

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:51.130
And when they see this profit,

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:56.310
when the sort of gross this profit will be shared among the mistress after directing a

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:59.150
management fee for managing this entire venture capital,

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:01.140
that's the concept of venture capitalists.

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:06.830
So having seen the double concept and seeing how a company can autonomously do all these

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:07.750
things by itself,

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:12.710
we can understand that the investors are the only people required they can invest in plus

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:17.540
mark contract when startups coming that can go forward among the investors itself.

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:20.150
If it gets more than 50% of the work,

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:23.870
then investment can be done into the start of this can be a possible use case,

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:24.150
right?

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:26.950
The exact same thing was built for the NatWest Well,

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:30.950
so they called it and enlisted that it could venture capital firm right.

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:37.050
They went for a nice IWILL and in May 2016 many and misters were very interested about this

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:42.140
concept offer double which is a venture capital firm on the misprint chart up to 1 $50

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:43.650
million in May 2016.

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:47.210
In June 2016 there was a problem,

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:53.600
but this smart contract cord itself hiker found this problem in the corps Carla's three

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:59.360
entrance E and started hacking this dog because the quarters immutable and it is there in

00:08:59.360 --> 00:08:59.950
the Blockchain.

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:01.110
The developers,

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:03.260
even though they found that this person was hacking,

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:07.050
was not able to change it are Stop this from happening.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:08.930
What did available data Boss?

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:10.530
There is a parent contract,

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:11.930
and there was a child contract,

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:14.370
which looks exactly the same as a parent contract.

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:16.610
The tiny country or the child I will.

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:19.350
It's a place where minority shareholders have their money.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:24.090
So if there is a start of project coming into the venture capitalist system and there goes

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:25.830
a work for everything right,

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:27.390
being a minority shareholder,

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:28.190
the venture capital,

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:31.970
if I am working for idea and that is not being invested upon,

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:33.940
then I will get my money back.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.330
That's the concept of parent,

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:36.170
the one child.

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:36.840
Are you in this one?

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:37.530
Take a pitiful,

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:38.720
simply speaking.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:42.930
When the money wasn't done from the bottom that would be the child of the money was

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:43.360
returned,

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.710
but the balance was not updated immediately.

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:49.040
There was a lag between when the money was returned on.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:54.180
The balance was a bigger So the hacker found this out and used this look cool.

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:58.550
Transfer a lot of money to himself before the violence got updated for the cycle.

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:04.410
And this way he had nearly $50 million out of the 1 $50 million that this mark contract.

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:06.250
Now there came the problem.

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:11.550
The all are talking about decentralization and in mutability being very good things.

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:12.640
But in this case,

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:17.980
the hacker was able to take that as an advantage on hacker parts of $2 million from a

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:18.490
double,

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:20.050
which is supposed to be very secure.

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:24.860
Since this entire ethereum Blockchain is immutable and decentralized with Alec Baldwin,

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:27.150
the founder himself could not do anything about it.

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:31.100
He proposed toe doing small software update toe cancer.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:35.720
These changes are doing some 51% are back in the Italian Blockchain to cancel these

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:40.550
transactions being happening etcetera that I love her here is gorgeous rock.

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:44.180
If I am a person who believes in the blocks Indyk quality Andi.

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:45.110
I am very impersonal.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.960
The Blockchain technology on whenever a heart captains,

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:51.780
if you're doing a 1% are back on the block chain itself all.

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:53.180
If you're doing some software update,

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:54.840
I wouldn't be very happy because,

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:59.150
according to me called Islam and nobody should be able to control the Blockchain.

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:01.620
The other half thought that see,

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:03.160
this is a mistake in the core,

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.520
nothing can be done about it.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.370
And we cannot let the hacker walk away with this so much money.

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:11.620
And hence there is a dilemma in between the North in the stadium.

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:12.350
Rock tentative.

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:15.770
That's when it didn't split into two insert.

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:17.550
Because of this one problem,

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:22.150
it seems pretty into buildings called us Ethereum Classic and Italian researchers,

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:23.860
people who are agreed upon.

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:24.190
Okay,

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:28.900
we need to reverse these transactions that the hackers don't went one way and the people

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.450
who did not agree to it went the other way.

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:32.680
Anyway,

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:33.880
When they split happens,

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.670
we'll see in the next section are off working happens.

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:41.630
This was called as a hard fork and and after this heart told me I could walked away.

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:46.880
But $67 million in Italian Classic we have already seen this concept in Bitcoin.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.960
But I would like to reiterate the same here,

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.770
Having discussed did at work,

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:54.380
this was not an attack on the Ethereum Blockchain,

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.150
not the security off the A T induction itself.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:02.650
This was a problem with the court order This not contract on top of the Italian doctor and

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:08.140
hence it needs not be confused that a medium junction was hacked the cord and had a problem

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:08.740
on leaked,

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:09.340
executed,

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:10.150
not properly.

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:14.350
The hiker found a loophole in the court and hence he was able to hack the system.

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:19.190
There is an interesting article on the Internet that appreciating with you on the resources

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:20.110
section or future me,

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:24.980
those who are interested about the tower can go through that you know about what is the Dow

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:24.980
?

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:26.850
Why did that have a problem?

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:29.020
What All proposals were made and finally,

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:33.350
what happened with the dollar attack that also has some technical details about the cord

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.750
itself?

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:35.550
What was the loophole etcetera?

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:37.630
You can go through if you are invested.

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:40.550
Let's look at different types of folks in the next video
