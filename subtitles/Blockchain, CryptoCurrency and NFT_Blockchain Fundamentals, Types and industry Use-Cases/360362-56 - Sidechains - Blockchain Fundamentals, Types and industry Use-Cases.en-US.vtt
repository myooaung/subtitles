00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.540
So we're looking at the future concepts off Blockchain and whatever is being worked on by

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.010
developers and startups to solve the problems of scalability in the current Blockchain

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:10.510
ecosystem.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:11.030
Right?

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.890
So these are this concept of shouting in the last video.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.610
Let's look at site change in this video.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.450
So what s eighteen's?

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.830
So we have this main Blockchain policy ethereum on.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.080
We have a lot of side chains which goes in parallel with the main Blockchain and follows

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.190
all the protocols of that critical elections.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.200
But it has a specific use case.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.090
For example,

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.720
in material which is smart contracts transactions and also lets a dancer pressure.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.490
Right.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.780
So the main doctrine can almost 18 with days.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.690
This one lead conducts fast transactions as in on account to an account,

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.640
either construction.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.290
Then whatever happens in the smart contract to deploy the contract are to change any state

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.140
of the contract.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.440
There will be another cell change.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.540
It's just that there will be the specially transactions which going to side chancy.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.620
Why did this concept came into the picture?

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:57.800
To give you an example,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.000
that is a game on the ethereum Blockchain called Astra per kitties,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.860
which is a yeti 7 21 poker built on top of Italian When the game was launched.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.490
People were so interested in this game that most of the construction that the transaction

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.450
will have in the Italian block change.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.930
They're based on cryptography transactions,

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.380
so a normal transaction.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.350
But I want to transfer money to you who are stuck in the transaction pool for a long time.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.470
Either I have to pay a lot of transaction piece for the minor toe pick me transaction are

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.970
wait till all the other transactions with off crypto kitties going the Blockchain and

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.680
generally my Granderson Mitigator.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.780
So this is a serious problem because one particular game called us the Ducatis drunk the

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.050
entire transition list of the other users.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.770
That's what when this agent comes in,

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.800
it increases the efficiency of the Blockchain on transactions per second by a large extent

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.800
.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.450
So how will the site and work as a concept,

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.580
we have this main Blockchain and let it be,

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.790
have,

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.980
say,

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.950
10 year B and C you're researching will have an interface with the main lodge.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.990
In the interface will be a tube a layer for no.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.020
Let's call this interface as a simple payment verification called us SPV.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.290
This payment verification will be like whenever there is an interaction between the main

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:10.640
block in and this a change.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.030
There will be this interface,

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.990
which connects the stupid auctions this interface well,

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.210
they were for currency transactions,

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.380
which need to be converted.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.060
Let's say,

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.470
let's say Bitcoin and Ethereum are two different side chains on it was building that way.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.570
There will be an interface between these on when they say converts so many Bitcoins into

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:28.110
ethereum,

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.760
the single payment verification.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.900
Will you plant that from Bitcoin and convert that into Ethereum?

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.520
It will also have the conversion rate at that point in time.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.210
That's the use of simple payment verification asset believe end of this but site A still no

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.110
are in theory,

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.370
but none of it has been put into practice because there's a lot of problems,

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.440
as in charging with side change as well and hills people are working on it,

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.750
and it might come in the future
