00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.170
in the beginning off the tsunami course.

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.160
We quickly saw the definition of Blockchain,

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.450
and they said that that will revisit this once we go through step by step all the

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.450
components off the block chain ecosystem.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.790
I think it's good time to revisit the definition.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.710
I understand completely these other.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:17.630
It is a decent place,

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.990
computation and information sharing platform that enables multiple authoritative domains

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.250
who do not trust each other to cooperate,

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.450
coordinate and collaborate in a rational decision making process.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.550
No,

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.450
let's break it up.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:35.380
You know what a decentralized system miss because of this peer to peer distributed system

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.650
without a central party,

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.050
remember the eliminated banks in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.850
It also says that it's an information sharing platform,

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.350
very transfer transactions and ownership off money.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.580
I really say multiple authoritative domains who do not trust each other is because it's a

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:55.730
crustless environment.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.350
Notes which do not trust each other can trust among themselves as they trust the system.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.450
It also sees that it's a rational decision making process.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.280
The decision making process lies in the Proof off world consensus where they stay on a

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.120
consensus and make sure that all nodes have the same set of data at all the times Now I

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.980
hope that you understand the definition of Blockchain completely as promised.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.470
I've made you understand step by step all the concepts related to Blockchain and hence the

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.350
definition itself.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.850
See you in the next video.
