00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.840
Yes,

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.300
I understand enough of mining theories.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:03.970
Let's look at that.

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:06.210
Actually got a bit going Minerd us,

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.790
right a bit Going,

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.100
Maynor process and confirm transactions.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.990
Using proof off work until December,

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.220
lives improve of world.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.010
If you remember,

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:16.880
the Lord needs to solve a cripple.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.450
Practically difficult math problems.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.350
The group of the other north that is a valued nor trying to add value transactions.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.210
It is a wanted man,

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.250
but going for the same.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.650
So the definition of a minor can be like The role of a minor is to build a Blockchain of

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.770
records that from the Bitcoin letter these are going access a public ledger.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:37.250
Right?

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.850
So what does this complex mathematical I'll go out of them that despite it needs to solve.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.100
We look at it in the life.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.380
The move in under circle.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:52.650
So I have a black Your what is the block number?

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:58.080
Which is one The data which can contain all the transaction later data and the hash of the

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.450
block is calculated using all these inputs.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.460
What is this magic number?

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.650
Call this Norris.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.250
A norms can be considered as a random number for now.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:15.750
So I want to add a transaction which is a gives B some 30 Bitcoins,

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:16.650
right?

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.080
Let's say this is the transaction I want to actually block.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.050
I'm I don't know the Blockchain,

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.380
but then,

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.350
as you can see the color off this block 200 why is that the case?

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.250
It is because off the hash itself,

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.150
when you look at the initial state of this block,

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.950
we could see that this hash has four leading zeros.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.950
The same goes with other examples off these blocks,

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.550
as in four leading zeros and four leading zeros for leading zeros.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.250
Every block has four leading zeros in the house that it has.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.820
The thing is,

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.400
in Bitcoin these leading zeros data mine.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.150
If the block is valid or not,

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.700
What is these four leading zeros?

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.950
Me.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.910
Imagine If I tell you,

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.150
you need to find two prime numbers which are,

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.650
uh,

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.490
my people together who are American number,

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.970
right?

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.070
And if I give you a large range,

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.450
let's 0 to 1 million,

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.420
then it will be probably easier for you because the probability of finding two numbers

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.050
between zero and one million is very high.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.070
But then,

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.360
if I reduced in number,

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.750
let's say only between zero and 1000.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.460
Then it becomes much more difficult for you to find these tuna first,

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.950
because the probability of finding our blueprint numbers between zero and 1000.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.700
It was very less compact to the problem.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.550
T between zero and one million back seconds above my knee.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.330
So here we say,

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.030
When you want to add this transaction school,

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.450
it'll be gives 30 Bitcoins.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.650
The hash has to start with four leading zeros.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.870
The hash is also a number.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:56.850
It's just excited.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.010
So when they say the 1st 4 digits have to be zero,

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.450
then we are eliminating a lot of possibilities.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.250
We are reducing the probability off it being zeros for this particular transaction.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.050
What can be done here?

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:16.950
This is where the norms comes into the picture announces and random number,

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.850
which can be ordered by the minor.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.150
Don't bring the hash of the block with four leading zeros.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.450
Let's say I change the norms off this block to one.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.460
Let's look at what is the hash?

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.550
The high changes.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.750
If I change to do that's something different.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.070
I can change it.

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.850
The three to find that the house changing completely.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.870
Remember avalanche effect,

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.450
any small change the input will definitely change the hash by a large extent.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.850
If I keep on doing this,

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.570
I will agree with the hash with four leading zeros.

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:50.740
At some point in time,

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.690
it can be anywhere between zero and a 1,000,000,000.

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:55.640
Right?

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.950
So this is what is done in my name.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:04.540
You can also call this concept of bootstrapping because you can start from one and then go

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.850
on,

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.120
keep on trying.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.940
It's a trial and error method where you try to find the number big satis face are given

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:12.420
conditions.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.420
In this case,

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.450
the condition is for leading zeros.

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.050
What happens when I click on this mine?

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:27.520
You can see that the non snow was 6035 and the hash of the entire block has become 0000 as

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.450
we wanted and then starts with the acceptable number,

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:31.250
right?

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.250
What does the minor done here?

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:40.500
He has gone from 1 to 6035 my 80 each and every number and found this months.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:49.300
So this is when the block becomes valid and this bootstrapping going from 1 to 6000 are 1

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.550
to 1 billion is the complex mathematical puzzle that the minor needs to solve.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.450
Finding the lawns is the work off the minor.

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.650
Once he finds the nonce,

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.910
he can say that I have formed a valid block.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.050
Please accept this block to the other Lords.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.550
I hope this is clear.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.250
Let's look at this site again.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.410
So as we can see here,

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:12.160
block number one.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.210
But no one is not a valid hash block number.

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.570
Okay,

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:18.390
This should be too.

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.150
But the non story is not a valid high soul also,

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.350
but when they have,

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.610
they don't like it to be used $100 B to see if study dollars.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.150
Sito di use $80 as transactions in this block.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.710
And I have a norms off.

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:34.900
3311 night,

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.050
which is on Babel stopping.

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.550
I have a hash with starts with four leading zeros.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.670
This block can be considered as a valid.

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.360
I hope this mining concept has become clear.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.950
Do you know we look at some more concept off this morning In the next video
