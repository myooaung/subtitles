00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.520
Not only does the WooCommerce plug-in and theme,

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.815
it was the chance to build a fully customizable e-commerce store.

00:00:09.815 --> 00:00:12.600
It also provides us with a lot of the essential tools,

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.525
which we need to run an e-commerce business,

00:00:15.525 --> 00:00:17.640
and most of these options are available in

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.895
the dashboard underneath the WooCommerce option.

00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:23.670
First of all, before we go live with any store,

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.980
we first need to check all of these settings,

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.650
and we also need to set up our payment provider.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.685
Of course, it's essential to have our address details all set,

00:00:32.685 --> 00:00:34.920
and most this has already been settled for

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.860
us from when we went through the installation wizard.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.665
For the address, we also need to filter down

00:00:40.665 --> 00:00:45.655
the shipping locations if we only ship to certain countries or areas.

00:00:45.655 --> 00:00:47.420
We can enable coupons,

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.135
and we'll take a look at how to create these in just a moment,

00:00:50.135 --> 00:00:53.995
and also, make sure that the currency options are all correct too.

00:00:53.995 --> 00:00:57.920
As well as the currency, we can also add the separator and the number of

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.235
decimal places so we can fine-tune how our pricing will look on our store.

00:01:03.235 --> 00:01:07.650
The products, most of these options are self-explanatory.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.585
We can change the units of measurement,

00:01:09.585 --> 00:01:13.250
we can enable or disable reviews and ratings, and also,

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.260
if we have our product on a different page,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.620
we can also change this here too.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.040
The shipping options or something which is very specific to your country,

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.680
and also the country which you want to be shipping to.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.440
We can set up various shipping zones,

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.170
where we're going to catch a certain area and apply

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.465
various shipping methods or prices to this one specific area.

00:01:34.465 --> 00:01:38.390
For example, if it was a hard-to-reach area with a certain zip or postcode,

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.600
we could add a list of these regions inside here,

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.715
and set up a dedicated shipping method for this particular zone.

00:01:45.715 --> 00:01:48.375
Then down at the bottom, we add our shipping method,

00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:50.240
and we can choose from a flat rate,

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.490
which is a fixed price.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.715
We can add free shipping to this particular area or restrict it to be only local pickup.

00:01:57.715 --> 00:02:02.270
Of course, the payments is something which is really important in an e-commerce store.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.430
Unfortunately, WooCommerce allows us to link

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.685
too many payment providers using different plug-ins,

00:02:07.685 --> 00:02:10.285
or we can choose from these default options.

00:02:10.285 --> 00:02:12.700
We can take payments via direct bank transfer,

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.150
we can take checks,

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.105
cash on delivery, or also,

00:02:16.105 --> 00:02:17.735
set up PayPal too,

00:02:17.735 --> 00:02:19.865
which is simple to do.

00:02:19.865 --> 00:02:22.685
All we need to do is to go into the setup section,

00:02:22.685 --> 00:02:25.205
and then set up our PayPal email address,

00:02:25.205 --> 00:02:29.200
begin to take our payments. Save these changes.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.720
We have an accounts area where we can do things like setting up

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.520
a guest checkout so the user doesn't need to register before placing an order.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.400
We can configure the way accounts are created,

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.125
and also change the wording for our privacy policy too.

00:02:44.125 --> 00:02:49.115
Emails, this is where we configure the notifications,

00:02:49.115 --> 00:02:52.040
which you use, I guess, at each stage of the checkout.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.170
So if they have placed a new order,

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.580
if the order has failed,

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.990
if it's been refunded,

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.250
we can configure the message,

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.290
which is then sent to the user.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.625
By default, WooCommerce already has some simple messages in place,

00:03:04.625 --> 00:03:07.895
but this is how we can change these messages if you would like to.

00:03:07.895 --> 00:03:12.950
The integration tab is a way to add geolocation services to our store,

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.985
and you can configure them with this link just here.

00:03:15.985 --> 00:03:19.105
Finally, there's also an advanced section too.

00:03:19.105 --> 00:03:21.695
We've already looked at some of these options in the past,

00:03:21.695 --> 00:03:23.930
such as changing around our pages.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.700
We can use these if we want to create

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.100
our own custom pages and assign them to certain functions.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.740
As well as all of these settings,

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.610
WooCommerce also provides us with the ability to fully manage an e-commerce store.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.230
As you would expect, we have the chance look through orders.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.610
This is the page where all of the orders will come in when we've made a sale on our site.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.410
If you wanted to, you can also manually add an order.

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.310
For this, we just add our customer's details at the top.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.895
Then we can place in different items from our store.

00:03:55.895 --> 00:03:59.285
So product, we can do a search,

00:03:59.285 --> 00:04:03.475
select any of these, and then add them to our order.

00:04:03.475 --> 00:04:08.045
We can create this order and also send this to the customer's email address.

00:04:08.045 --> 00:04:12.440
We can manage our customers from this link just here and we can see all of the customers,

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.020
which have been registered to our site.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.670
We have lots of data on each one of the customers such as their order values,

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.755
their regions, and also the address details.

00:04:22.755 --> 00:04:26.495
Coupons. We can create and manage

00:04:26.495 --> 00:04:30.110
coupons to give our users a discount off certain products.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.090
This is also really flexible.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.845
We can fine-tune exactly what products this coupon will apply to.

00:04:36.845 --> 00:04:40.640
We can set obey fixed price discounts, a percentage discount,

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.875
a discount off a particular product or of the total shopping basket.

00:04:45.875 --> 00:04:48.170
This coupon can also be used to allow

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:52.165
free shipping and we can also place an expiry date too.

00:04:52.165 --> 00:04:56.810
In the restrictions, we can place in a minimum or a maximum spend,

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.265
for this coupon to apply,

00:04:58.265 --> 00:05:02.320
or also only apply it to certain products or categories too.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.220
Down at the bottom, this can also be restricted to certain customer emails too,

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.400
if we didn't want this to apply to every user on our store.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.290
Finally, the usage limits.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.800
This one is pretty simple. We can set up how many times we want this coupon to be used,

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.445
and also limit the number of times a particular user can use this coupon too.

00:05:21.445 --> 00:05:24.170
Also finally, when your store is up and running,

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.505
we also want access to as much information as we can.

00:05:27.505 --> 00:05:30.170
We have a report section where we can find out lots of

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.900
information such as our total sales.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.390
We can display this by the last week, the last month,

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.335
the last year, or a custom date too.

00:05:38.335 --> 00:05:41.750
This data can be downloaded into a spreadsheet format.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.565
We can check our sales by product,

00:05:43.565 --> 00:05:45.020
the sales by category.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.210
We can check out how coupons are used.

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.700
The "Customers" tab will show us how many orders for

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.480
a registered customer versus a guest.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.790
Also, we have a stock tab where we can manage

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.980
our low stock levels if we have enabled this inside of the product.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.145
As you can see, WooCommerce is more than just building a e-commerce store.

00:06:04.145 --> 00:06:07.205
It can be used to manage our full e-commerce setup.

00:06:07.205 --> 00:06:10.310
Also if it's missing some specific functionality,

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.855
which you need, there is often a plugin available too.

00:06:13.855 --> 00:06:16.625
This is the end of our e-commerce project,

00:06:16.625 --> 00:06:19.740
and I'll see you now in the next section.
