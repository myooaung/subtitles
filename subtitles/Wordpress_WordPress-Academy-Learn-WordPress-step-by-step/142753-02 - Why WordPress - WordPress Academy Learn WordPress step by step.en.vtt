00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:06.210
WordPress originally began life as a blogging platform and it's now grown

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.515
into the most popular content management system available today,

00:00:10.515 --> 00:00:14.850
which also powers some of the world's most popular websites.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.125
WordPress is completely free to use, free to download,

00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:21.120
and it's also built by hundreds of

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:27.090
community volunteers along with all of the great features which WordPress provides.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.850
We'll find out about these during the course.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.220
One of the things I really love about WordPress is that it has something for everybody.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.495
If you are a non-technical person or a beginner,

00:00:39.495 --> 00:00:42.390
you can buy some simple web hosting,

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.475
use a one click installation,

00:00:44.475 --> 00:00:50.105
select your theme and you have your very own website or blog in under half an hour.

00:00:50.105 --> 00:00:55.810
For web designers or developers or general people who want to jump in a bit deeper,

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:01.430
there is also many great things you can do technically to make a really powerful website.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.350
You can call your own themes and also plugins to make

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.420
WordPress look and function exactly how you want it to be.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.469
WordPress is also under constant development too, its always improving,

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:20.795
whether that's a security fix or a new feature to keep WordPress from becoming outdated.

00:01:20.795 --> 00:01:26.905
Also the creators of WordPress have made these updates really easy to apply too.

00:01:26.905 --> 00:01:31.475
You don't need to worry about complicated updates and installations.

00:01:31.475 --> 00:01:34.160
These updates are generally performed from

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.775
the WordPress dashboard and often just involve the click of a button.

00:01:38.775 --> 00:01:43.370
As you can also see from the WordPress homepage which is wordpress.org,

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.690
there is also many different themes you can choose.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.590
If we go into the theme section we can see there is

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.590
over 7,000 different themes are present.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.570
These will allow us to build almost any type of website which we want to create.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.910
When we actually create a WordPress website,

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.190
all of the content stays exactly the same,

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.670
and we can then switch between different themes to give

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.040
our content or our site a completely different look and feel.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.980
On the first set of WordPress some of the themes will be pre-installed,

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.970
or we can search through any of these themes from wordpress.org.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.585
These are free themes to set up our projects.

00:02:20.585 --> 00:02:24.600
Along with these free themes there is also premium themes available too,

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.430
which you can also buy on websites such as ThemeForest,

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.260
but we'll look at this in more detail as we progress through the course.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.055
The WordPress core which we are going to download is really simple yet very powerful,

00:02:37.055 --> 00:02:39.670
and also packed with lots of features.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.315
However, if there is some functionality missing which your app or website needs,

00:02:44.315 --> 00:02:49.270
then this functionality is more than likely going to be available as a plugin.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.720
Plugins are pretty much what they sound like.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.130
They are something you can download to plugin and extend the WordPress core.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.200
They add functionality and features which are usually

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.050
simple to install as clicking on a few buttons,

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.415
but again we will take a look at plugins in more detail later in the course.

00:03:07.415 --> 00:03:11.980
Some of the other WordPress benefits are that it's really search engine friendly.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.099
By using WordPress, many SEO best practices

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.485
are already taken care of for us behind the scenes.

00:03:18.485 --> 00:03:22.575
If you want to take it even further there is also some great plugins too,

00:03:22.575 --> 00:03:25.545
which well take a look at it in the plugins video.

00:03:25.545 --> 00:03:28.690
Lastly, WordPress has a really useful mobile app

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.170
for iOS and Android which is free to download.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:38.585
The app allows you to write WordPress contents and also update your website on the move.

00:03:38.585 --> 00:03:42.320
It can even upload photos, manage blog posts,

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.555
manage all comments, and also edit pages as you go.

00:03:46.555 --> 00:03:50.630
These are some great reasons for choosing WordPress.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.390
Of course, there are many more and I'm sure you'll find

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.380
your own reasons for using WordPress as you progress through this course.
