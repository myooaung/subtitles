00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.660
We have a child theme now sets up inside of our project.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.550
WooCommerce, as we looked at earlier on,

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.165
gives us lots of different options which we have inside the sidebar.

00:00:12.165 --> 00:00:14.640
Have all of these options here and we've set up some of

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.485
the basics when we first installed the plugin.

00:00:17.485 --> 00:00:22.215
We're going to go through some of these options in the upcoming videos, but for this one,

00:00:22.215 --> 00:00:24.240
we want to focus on the products and all of

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.365
the additional information which you will need to add to our products.

00:00:28.365 --> 00:00:32.670
If we click on this, we can see a list of all the sample data which we brought in,

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.110
in a previous video,

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.370
needs to know all the sample products which we see inside of our shop.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.870
So in the next video,

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.480
we're going to get to work on adding our own products and how we can edit them.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.550
For this video, just before we do this,

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.890
we're going to take a look at how we can add all of

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.130
the extra information which we need to add it to our products.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.529
This includes adding new categories,

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:55.584
new tags, and also attributes.

00:00:55.584 --> 00:00:58.090
This is going to mean all of this information is ready to

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.115
select when we add our own custom product.

00:01:01.115 --> 00:01:03.090
First into the category section,

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.570
we can see over on the right,

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.755
we have a list of all the categories which had been brought in with our sample data.

00:01:08.755 --> 00:01:11.890
This is just a way to categorize our products,

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.495
so we can put them into certain groups.

00:01:14.495 --> 00:01:17.980
We can also use them for filtering our products on the front-end.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.560
It's really useful to have all of these set up into the bulk actions.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.735
If we select this top checkbox here,

00:01:24.735 --> 00:01:25.930
using the bulk actions,

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.330
we can select this checkbox and delete all of the contents from the sample data.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.880
Then go ahead and create our own over on the left.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.360
First, we give this category a name and I'm going to go for T-shirts.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.695
This is the main category for our store.

00:01:42.695 --> 00:01:46.700
The Slug, which is a URL friendly version of our name.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.640
This name is usually lowercase and contains only letters, numbers, and hyphens.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.995
Let's go for t-shirts and this is going to appear at the end of our URL.

00:01:57.995 --> 00:02:00.425
So if we click on the t-shirts category,

00:02:00.425 --> 00:02:04.360
this would be our URL with forward slash t-shirts on the end.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.375
The Parent category.

00:02:06.375 --> 00:02:08.450
When we create categories for our products,

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.110
we can either put these into a parent or a child category.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.540
A Parent category is the top level,

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.935
and then we can have various sub-categories nested inside.

00:02:17.935 --> 00:02:19.935
Let's leave this as a top-level.

00:02:19.935 --> 00:02:22.595
We can also add a optional description if we want to,

00:02:22.595 --> 00:02:25.015
and then also set the display type.

00:02:25.015 --> 00:02:28.235
For example, if we were to click on the T-shirt category,

00:02:28.235 --> 00:02:30.230
we want to set what we can see inside

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.550
the browser and we see a list of all the products which fall under this category.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.900
We see a list of all these subcategories if this is a Parent category.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.705
So for example, if we had two sub-categories called child t-shirts and adult t-shirt,

00:02:44.705 --> 00:02:46.985
would we see the sub-categories on this page,

00:02:46.985 --> 00:02:50.875
which we can then click on and be taken through to the appropriate products?

00:02:50.875 --> 00:02:55.610
Or instead, we could even show the products and also the categories on the same page.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.670
I'm going to leave this as the default and then add

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.450
a thumbnail image and then go into the Media Library.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.005
We could choose any of these images which we'll have just on here.

00:03:06.005 --> 00:03:10.160
I'm going to go into the Shirt Store images which are provided with this course,

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.440
and drag these into the media library.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.790
Like the t-shirts and the old text,

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.750
then use this image for our category, let's add this.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.170
If you wanted to, you can go ahead and add multiple categories,

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.240
but since this is a t-shirt store,

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.390
I'm just going to keep this as a single main category.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.405
Next, down to the Tags option.

00:03:36.405 --> 00:03:40.730
A tag is just a way to add some additional information to our product.

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.830
So we could tag it with certain information such

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.275
as if it's a summer range, a winter range,

00:03:45.275 --> 00:03:46.550
if it's for male,

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.170
female, if it's unisex,

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.450
if it's branded, and lots of additional information which we may need.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:58.690
The first one, let's go for summer, also the Slug.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.390
The optional description, let's add this.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.580
We don't have any other tags over on the right,

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.365
so these are all our own.

00:04:07.365 --> 00:04:10.210
Next, winter.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.570
Click this, then we'll go for branded.

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.200
Let's go for unisex.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.120
Then finally, we add male and female.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.970
This is enough for now and all of these options will be available when we create

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.615
our own custom products. Down to the attributes.

00:04:43.615 --> 00:04:48.250
Attributes is just some additional information to describe our product.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.415
Over on the right, we can see we have the color and the size already set up.

00:04:52.415 --> 00:04:55.000
This means we can create multiple versions of

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.395
the same product but the only variant could be this attribute.

00:04:58.395 --> 00:05:00.060
We can have a t-shirt,

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.725
and rather than creating a t-shirt in small, medium, and large,

00:05:03.725 --> 00:05:06.590
we could just create the same single t-shirt and

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.665
create three different versions based off these attributes.

00:05:09.665 --> 00:05:12.215
Let's see an example of how we can add this.

00:05:12.215 --> 00:05:15.950
We already have the color and the size which are useful for our store.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.230
Let's add something else which is the sleeve type.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.030
The difference between our own custom one and these two which have been added,

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.950
is these terms over on the right.

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.870
The color has these various options.

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.490
We have various sizes,

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.585
but we don't have any terms for our sleeve type.

00:05:37.585 --> 00:05:41.960
For this, we click on configure terms and add our own custom options.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.545
For the sleeve type, let's first go for long sleeve,

00:05:45.545 --> 00:05:53.830
then Slug, and add this to our attributes and also the short sleeve.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.205
Add this.

00:05:59.205 --> 00:06:02.075
Now, if we go back to our attributes,

00:06:02.075 --> 00:06:08.075
our additional terms, and now alongside our attributes, let's go for one more.

00:06:08.075 --> 00:06:17.040
This one let's go for the style and then into our terms.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.755
This first one, we'll say plain.

00:06:19.755 --> 00:06:22.450
Well, this is for all the plain shirts,

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:31.450
printed, and last of all, stripes.

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:40.195
Back into our attributes, style is now there with our terms alongside.

00:06:40.195 --> 00:06:42.290
This is all I'm going to add for this video.

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:43.925
You can add more if you prefer.

00:06:43.925 --> 00:06:45.290
You can obtain the categories,

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:46.745
the tags, and attributes,

00:06:46.745 --> 00:06:48.560
and all of these are going to be available in

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.470
the next video when we create our own custom products.
