00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:09.090
In this video, we're going to focus on this homepage and reconstructing it using widgets.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.525
We did take a look at using widgets early on in this course,

00:00:12.525 --> 00:00:14.100
in the other project.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.525
Widgets, if you remember,

00:00:15.525 --> 00:00:19.260
is like a self-contained piece of content which we

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.685
can drag into a particular location inside of our theme.

00:00:23.685 --> 00:00:26.600
With the spacious theme, we do also have access to

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.365
some custom widgets which had been supplied with this theme.

00:00:30.365 --> 00:00:33.320
Also supplied alongside these widgets is

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.195
a homepage template which is going to allow us to rearrange this homepage,

00:00:38.195 --> 00:00:43.490
look more like it did when we first checked out this theme on WordPress.org.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.765
Now to do this, we're going to move all of this blog section,

00:00:47.765 --> 00:00:49.235
all of our blog posts,

00:00:49.235 --> 00:00:52.015
over to the custom blog page.

00:00:52.015 --> 00:00:54.800
Then this is going to leave us some space to create

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.720
a new homepage where we can add this new template.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.345
Let's begin over inside of the dashboard.

00:01:02.345 --> 00:01:06.050
We're going to go down to pages and add our new homepage.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.605
So the title of Home.

00:01:08.605 --> 00:01:10.795
Then over on the right,

00:01:10.795 --> 00:01:13.835
inside of the page attributes section,

00:01:13.835 --> 00:01:16.915
we can select a template which we want to use.

00:01:16.915 --> 00:01:20.145
At the moment, we're just using this default template.

00:01:20.145 --> 00:01:24.510
But we can see, we have some other templates which are being provided with this theme.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:30.660
The one we're going to use for this homepage is this business template, publish this.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.270
If we refresh, we see our homepage up at the top here.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.220
But as we mentioned just before,

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.005
we're going to make this our actual homepage when we visit the root of our project.

00:01:42.005 --> 00:01:46.070
The way to switch around our pages is to go back to the dashboard,

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.320
down into the settings.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.650
We need to head into the Reading option.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.110
Instead of our homepage,

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.715
is bringing our latest posts,

00:01:53.715 --> 00:01:58.700
we're going to switch this to be a static page which is the newly constructed homepage.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.615
Then move all post over to our custom blog page.

00:02:02.615 --> 00:02:09.085
Save our changes. Let's check this has all taken effect inside the browser.

00:02:09.085 --> 00:02:10.940
Good. There's our homepage.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.500
We don't have any content just yet,

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.530
but we'll come back to this, the blog.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.790
We'll see our blog posts have now been moved to this blog link.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.350
To construct this homepage,

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.290
we're going to add some widgets.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.920
Just like earlier, we go to the Appearance into the Widget section,

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.745
and then we can drag over any of these available widgets into the themes widget areas.

00:02:34.745 --> 00:02:38.135
This particular theme also has some custom widgets,

00:02:38.135 --> 00:02:40.910
will have all of the custom widgets beginning with ATG.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.345
We know which ones are supplied by this actual theme.

00:02:44.345 --> 00:02:47.810
We have the social media icons which were supplied by the plug-in,

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.890
and then most of the ones above are just general WordPress widgets which

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.940
are always available until you construct this homepage.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.590
This was the business templates.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.280
We're going to make use of these four business sections.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.975
Starting with the business top.

00:03:02.975 --> 00:03:05.765
The middle section is split between the left and right,

00:03:05.765 --> 00:03:07.705
then we have a bottom section.

00:03:07.705 --> 00:03:10.060
From the top, open this up,

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.345
and we can see which type of widgets are suitable for this area.

00:03:14.345 --> 00:03:16.865
The one I'm going to use is this TG Services.

00:03:16.865 --> 00:03:21.460
As you can see, this is used to display some pages as a service.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.045
Drop this into the top section,

00:03:24.045 --> 00:03:27.620
and then we're going to link this to free new pages.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.760
We don't currently have any pages which displays the website services,

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.940
so what we're going to do is to go over to our pages,

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.875
add three new pages.

00:03:36.875 --> 00:03:41.820
The first one is going to be for web design and development.

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.455
Then we'll just add some simple text just below.

00:03:46.455 --> 00:03:55.509
I'm going to say we create stunning responsive designs using WordPress.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.765
You can place in any text which you would like inside of here,

00:03:59.765 --> 00:04:01.250
and you can also see at the bottom,

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.855
we have a social media section which had been added using the plug-in.

00:04:05.855 --> 00:04:09.430
This is a premium feature so we're just going to ignore this.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.695
If you want to remove this, you can click on these settings at the top,

00:04:12.695 --> 00:04:14.510
go down to the preferences,

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.030
and then we can close off the social media panel.

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.490
Now, back to our page,

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.880
we're just going to add a featured image for this section,

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.775
then placing the WordPress icon.

00:04:29.775 --> 00:04:31.860
That is our featured image,

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.270
and then publish. This is all we need to do.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.610
Now, if we go back to our pages,

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.095
add a new page,

00:04:40.095 --> 00:04:43.290
and this second one is going to be for branding.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.460
Then some texts in the block just below,

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.430
I'm going to say let us take care of all your branding needs.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.060
The page section has the featured image.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.145
This is the pencil icon.

00:05:01.145 --> 00:05:03.925
Set this and then publish.

00:05:03.925 --> 00:05:08.240
The third and final page is going to be for the mobile development service.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.060
Add a third page with the title of Mobile Development.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.605
Then some text I'm going to say,

00:05:15.605 --> 00:05:20.699
we create stunning custom mobile applications for all devices.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.680
Back to the page tab on the featured image,

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.085
this one is going to be for the Android Icon. Published this.

00:05:33.085 --> 00:05:37.170
Now, if we go back to our Widgets under Appearance,

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:41.985
we can add these three new pages to our TG Services.

00:05:41.985 --> 00:05:44.685
We have the web design,

00:05:44.685 --> 00:05:47.430
we have the branding,

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.495
the mobile development, and then we can save this widget.

00:05:51.495 --> 00:05:54.710
Before we go any further, let's just refresh the homepage.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:06:00.260
Click on Logo. We'll now see our three pages in this widget area.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.900
Just below this, we're going to next a Call To

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.175
Action section which is going to prompt the user to get in touch.

00:06:07.175 --> 00:06:11.830
To do this, we have a call to action widget which is just over here.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.915
Drag this below and inside the same section.

00:06:14.915 --> 00:06:17.540
The Call To Action main text is going to be,

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.640
"Need to speak to somebody about your ideas?"

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.915
Then the additional texts of,

00:06:24.915 --> 00:06:27.070
"Get in touch today."

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.040
This is going to also have a button which the user

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.875
can click on and will say, "Get in touch."

00:06:33.875 --> 00:06:38.825
Then we also want this button to redirect to a certain link.

00:06:38.825 --> 00:06:40.635
Now, just before we do this,

00:06:40.635 --> 00:06:41.990
we're going to save this.

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.380
We'll want this to link to the Contact Us page.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.510
To get the link to the Contact Us page,

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:52.350
we need to go over to the Pages tab, into Contact.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:55.785
Then we can grab the permalink from the sidebar.

00:06:55.785 --> 00:06:58.035
This is all of this section just here.

00:06:58.035 --> 00:07:05.529
If we click on this, we can then grab the URL back over to the widgets in the sidebar,

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:09.520
then paste in our permalink.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.585
Save this and let's test this out.

00:07:15.585 --> 00:07:18.150
Refresh. We've got our Call To Action.

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:22.350
Click on the button, and this now links us to our Contact Us page.

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:24.740
Remember, this will have a contact form later on,

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.680
but for now, this is all working fine.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:32.950
Next up, we have the middle section which is split into the left and the right sections.

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:36.140
To the left, I'm going to add some recent testimonials,

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.245
and the right is going to feature a single page.

00:07:39.245 --> 00:07:43.235
Let's start with the left which is TG Testimonial.

00:07:43.235 --> 00:07:47.880
Drag this in. The title of Recent Testimonials.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:52.785
Then the description at the bottom.

00:07:52.785 --> 00:07:56.970
Place in any testimonial description inside of here.

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:07.055
We can then place in a name just below,

00:08:07.055 --> 00:08:13.335
and the byline which is CEO. Save this widget.

00:08:13.335 --> 00:08:17.675
We can also close down these sections and then we'll go to the middle right section.

00:08:17.675 --> 00:08:23.205
This one is going to be the single featured page. Drop this in.

00:08:23.205 --> 00:08:27.410
This one is going to feature any one of the pages on our site.

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:32.815
For this example, I'm going to put the focus on the mobile development section.

00:08:32.815 --> 00:08:35.760
The title which will appear next to this are Read More

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:39.130
About Our Mobile Development Services.

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:47.390
Then we also have the option to remove the featured image if we want to,

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:49.775
but I'm going to leave this as it is.

00:08:49.775 --> 00:08:54.785
Finally, we have the business bottom section which is going to be for a featured widget,

00:08:54.785 --> 00:09:00.025
and this will allow us to add some case studies. Drag this over.

00:09:00.025 --> 00:09:03.550
Title of Case Studies.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:08.270
Then we can add a description, I'm going to say, Here,

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:09.860
we take a deep dive into some of

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:16.200
our most recent projects to show you what goes on behind the scenes.

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:25.820
Then below this, we can link to various pages.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:29.915
Now, we could go ahead and create three new pages with some case studies.

00:09:29.915 --> 00:09:34.470
We could add in some texts to some images and create these pages if you wanted to.

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:36.620
However, though, just to save a little bit of time,

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:41.090
I'm just going to link to three existing pages which is the Web Design,

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:44.815
the Branding, and also the Mobile Development too.

00:09:44.815 --> 00:09:46.610
You can create these if you want to,

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:50.680
but I'm going to save this widget and check this out over in the browser.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:54.270
Refresh. We'll have our top section which you've already seen,

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:55.835
we have the middle section,

00:09:55.835 --> 00:09:58.895
and this is split with the left section for testimonials,

00:09:58.895 --> 00:10:02.030
and then the featured Mobile Development page on the right.

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:05.635
Then finally at the bottom, we can link to some case studies.

00:10:05.635 --> 00:10:07.410
This one is all complete,

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:10.805
and you can have a play around with this if you like and make it more personal.

00:10:10.805 --> 00:10:12.440
Just before we finish this off,

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:17.345
I'm going to remove the additional links which are being added to our menu automatically.

00:10:17.345 --> 00:10:20.699
I'll go to the menu section on the appearance,

00:10:20.699 --> 00:10:24.315
we need to select top navigation,

00:10:24.315 --> 00:10:27.370
we can remove the home link,

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:31.630
and also the three additional pages.

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:40.850
Save menu. Our homepage is now set up.

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:45.240
In the next video, we'll take a look at how we can create our footer.
