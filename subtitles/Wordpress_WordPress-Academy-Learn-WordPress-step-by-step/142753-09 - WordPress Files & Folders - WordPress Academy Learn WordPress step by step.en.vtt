00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.225
On the first setup a WordPress project.

00:00:03.225 --> 00:00:05.775
We download the WordPress core.

00:00:05.775 --> 00:00:09.675
The WordPress core contains all of our files and folders,

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:12.735
which's what a person needs to function correctly.

00:00:12.735 --> 00:00:17.294
Now, we don't need to know the exact roles of each one of these files and folders,

00:00:17.294 --> 00:00:20.475
since there is a lot of code inside of these.

00:00:20.475 --> 00:00:24.210
But understanding the basics will really help us.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.030
To find all of the files and folders,

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:32.205
this will depend on whether you're using local or MAMP to set up your project.

00:00:32.205 --> 00:00:34.050
If you were using the local,

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.605
you need to go to the Start screen and click on this arrow.

00:00:37.605 --> 00:00:42.780
This will then open up a window with the location of our projects.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.865
If we go into here and then inside of our app then public,

00:00:47.865 --> 00:00:53.180
this is all of the core files and folders which is needed for WordPress to function.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.730
If we use a MAMP,

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.400
just like we've seen before we need go to the htdocs and then into our project folder,

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.759
and then we are presented with the same files and folders,

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:06.680
which is what is called the WordPress core.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.750
The WordPress core is not intended to be edited,

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.540
so we generally leave these as they are.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.800
One of the main files which we have is the wp-config,

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.020
which is a PHP file.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.720
This file is where we tell WordPress all of

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.910
the database settings which we'll have for our projects.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.040
This file can be created manually,

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.495
but in our case,

00:01:29.495 --> 00:01:33.700
this file was set for us when we created our site using local.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.825
Or if you chose to use MAMP for this project,

00:01:36.825 --> 00:01:41.260
this file was created when running the installation script earlier.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.445
Just below this we have the wp-content.

00:01:44.445 --> 00:01:48.905
This is probably the location where we'll spend most of our time.

00:01:48.905 --> 00:01:54.235
This is an important folder since it contains everything which we'll use for our site,

00:01:54.235 --> 00:01:59.180
and any images or videos which will be stored in the uploads folder.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.600
You may also often see a upgrade folded too,

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.840
which is a temporary folder used by WordPress when updating our site.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.960
You may also see a languages folder too,

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.195
if making use of other languages for your theme.

00:02:14.195 --> 00:02:16.535
If we open up the themes folder,

00:02:16.535 --> 00:02:21.580
by default, WordPress provides some default themes for us to get started with.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.230
Over on the left here,

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.770
we can see the default theme,

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.855
which is currently 2020,

00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:29.710
and we can change this inside the dashboard.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.840
We can also download new themes and drag them into

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.595
this folder and then activate them that way too.

00:02:36.595 --> 00:02:39.315
We also have the plugins just above,

00:02:39.315 --> 00:02:42.680
and this is going to be the location where we store our plugins,

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.085
either via the dashboard or by downloading them and adding them to this folder.

00:02:48.085 --> 00:02:51.185
If we want to make some modifications to our themes,

00:02:51.185 --> 00:02:53.495
we can drag our theme folder.

00:02:53.495 --> 00:02:55.910
For example, 2020.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.700
We can drag this over to a text editor

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.315
and we'll do this in one of our projects later in the course,

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:05.985
including creating our own page templates.

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:09.950
This is a quick overview of some of the main files,

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.715
and we'll jump into this folder as we need to during the course.

00:03:13.715 --> 00:03:16.505
Now, we understand a bit more about WordPress,

00:03:16.505 --> 00:03:20.160
let's move on to creating our first project.
