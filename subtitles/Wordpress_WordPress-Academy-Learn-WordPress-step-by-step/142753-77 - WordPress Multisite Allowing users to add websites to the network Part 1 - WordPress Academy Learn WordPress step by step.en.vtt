00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.320
In this video, we're going to take a look at allowing users to

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.010
register to other onsite to our network.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.490
If we go to one of our websites in our network, and again,

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.105
just like in the last video i have got two web browsers open.

00:00:15.105 --> 00:00:18.990
I've got Google Chrome on the left-hand side,

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.800
and we're logged in as the multisite super administrator.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.620
On the right-hand side, I've opened Firefox.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.285
I'm logged into the laptop shop as a standard administrator.

00:00:30.285 --> 00:00:36.040
If we go over to the actual laptop shop and visit site,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.455
one thing you'll notice if we scroll down on the sidebar,

00:00:40.455 --> 00:00:42.145
down in the matter,

00:00:42.145 --> 00:00:47.945
we have the option to login and logout and go to things such as the admin screen,

00:00:47.945 --> 00:00:52.495
but we don't have the option to register as a new user.

00:00:52.495 --> 00:00:56.300
This is a default WordPress networks settings

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.735
and is something which we can easily change.

00:00:58.735 --> 00:01:02.240
So back over in the super admin screen,

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.050
if I go to my sites and into the network admin,

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.060
and then down to settings,

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.315
there should be an option for registration settings.

00:01:14.315 --> 00:01:18.700
If you just scroll down, this gives us four different options.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.140
The first one is registration is disabled.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.795
This means that new user accounts cannot be created when a user visits our website.

00:01:29.795 --> 00:01:34.645
The second option is to allow accounts to be registered.

00:01:34.645 --> 00:01:39.750
If we change this and then go down to save.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.710
Then if we go over to Firefox, and,

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.330
if we log out and

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.510
then you just go over to the website and scroll down to the sidebar.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.660
Now, we've got the option to register as well as login.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:08.345
The third option is to allow logged in users to create a new site on the network.

00:02:08.345 --> 00:02:12.115
This option restricts new websites to be created,

00:02:12.115 --> 00:02:15.565
but only by logged in users who have an account.

00:02:15.565 --> 00:02:19.480
This means as a super admin we have the option to only give

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.640
accounts to authorized people to set up new sites on the network.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.410
Then lastly, we have the option to allow anybody to

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.560
register as a user and also to create a website on our network.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.210
This last option is one which we are going to be

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.830
using to allow anybody to join our network.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:47.539
Make sure the last option is clicked and then go down to save changes,

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.530
and then back to Firefox.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.755
Now, if you go ahead and register as a new user.

00:02:59.755 --> 00:03:03.420
If you add a username and also an e-mail address,

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.085
which you have control over,

00:03:05.085 --> 00:03:09.925
because you will need to click on an activation link to enable the new user.

00:03:09.925 --> 00:03:13.655
You'll also have the option to create a new network site.

00:03:13.655 --> 00:03:17.405
But for now if you just click on the option just to create a new user,

00:03:17.405 --> 00:03:20.210
we'll go ahead and create the site once you comeback.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.750
Go ahead and create a new user and come back in a few moments.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:31.760
Hopefully you've registered a new user and activated the e-mail.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.870
If you go ahead and login as your new user accounts.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:42.260
Then you go over to your profile by clicking on the username in the top corner.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:48.140
I'm taken to the dashboard and you'll see that the dashboard doesn't have many options.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.530
There's no option to add your own sites.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.125
If we want to add our own site,

00:03:54.125 --> 00:04:01.290
we need to add wp-signup.php right at the top after

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:11.210
the URL and this takes

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.360
us to a screen where we can add a new site to

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.590
the network by adding an extension to the URL and

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.980
also adding a site title and of course

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:27.199
not many users will know that we need to add this onto the end of the URL.

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:30.350
So to make it a little bit more user-friendly,

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:36.160
I'm going to add a link into the top navigation to register a new site.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.600
There's also many ways we can do this,

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.165
such as creating widgets and adding links to various parts of the page,

00:04:43.165 --> 00:04:46.250
but I'm just going to go ahead and add a menu link.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.860
As the administrator, we need to do this in the main site of our network.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.970
So I'll go to my sites and then multisite,

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.430
which is the main network sites,

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:04.010
and then to the dashboard and then if we go to the appearance,

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.660
then down to menus,

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:13.019
I'm going to add a new menu called navigation.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:24.155
Create the menu. We need to add this menu to the primary location for your theme.

00:05:24.155 --> 00:05:26.525
In the case of the theme which I'm using,

00:05:26.525 --> 00:05:29.965
it's called top menu. So select that.

00:05:29.965 --> 00:05:32.600
Then if we go over to the left menu,

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.790
to the custom links,

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:40.340
let's add a new menu button called audio sites.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.900
Then the URL is available just in the top there.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:52.420
Copy that and then paste it in and then add this to the menu.

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:58.380
There's our button which has appeared under the menu structure.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:03.290
Let's save that and let's refresh

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:11.265
Firefox and [inaudible] our options to other sites.

00:06:11.265 --> 00:06:17.860
If we just go over to the main website as our logged in user,

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.535
you can still see that this option is there.

00:06:20.535 --> 00:06:24.840
So now we can click on this and then go to the sign up page.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:30.905
This is going to be the default sign up page that registered users can see.

00:06:30.905 --> 00:06:35.120
If we go to Chrome and we visit our site as

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.935
the super admin and if we go down to add your sites,

00:06:39.935 --> 00:06:44.720
you see it looks similar, but we do have one or two little differences,

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.140
such as it's alerting you to the fact that we're currently allowing

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:52.820
all registrations so anybody can create a site and

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.090
it also gives us a list of sites which we already a member

00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:01.610
of and then the same options to other sites and also the site title.

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:08.435
So now our website is all setup to allow registered users to add sites to the network.

00:07:08.435 --> 00:07:11.750
We'll leave this video there and continue in the next video,

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:16.890
where we'll go ahead and register a new site to our network.
