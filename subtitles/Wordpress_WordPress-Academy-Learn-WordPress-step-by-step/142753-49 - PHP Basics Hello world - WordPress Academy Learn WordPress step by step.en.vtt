00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:06.420
Okay guys, so this video is all about getting started with PHP.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.065
We're going to take a look at the basic PHP syntax,

00:00:10.065 --> 00:00:13.920
the way it's wrote out, and do a hello world example.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.310
To get started, we're going to go over to the ht-docs inside your local host,

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.070
and then create a new folder.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.420
I'm going to call this folder the PHP basics.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.630
Then drag this folder into your text editor.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.810
I'm going to use brackets by Adobe, and then drag that into there.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.985
To get started, I'm going to create a PHP page to start working with.

00:00:46.985 --> 00:00:52.430
Create a new page, with Command or Ctrl N, inside the brackets.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.570
First of all, I want to save this page as hello-world,

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.595
and make sure it's got the PHP extension at the end.

00:01:03.595 --> 00:01:06.885
Save that inside PHP basics.

00:01:06.885 --> 00:01:11.375
Then we need to create a basic HTML skeleton to begin with.

00:01:11.375 --> 00:01:14.425
I'm using the Emmet plugin.

00:01:14.425 --> 00:01:17.760
If you're not using that you'll need to type this out manually,

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.455
but if you do download Emmet,

00:01:19.455 --> 00:01:25.580
all you need to do is type in HTML colon 5, and then hit the tab.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.145
Then that fills in all the HTML:5 skeleton for you.

00:01:30.145 --> 00:01:33.580
Let's call this the hello world.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.415
Now let's get to work within the body section.

00:01:39.415 --> 00:01:41.780
To work with PHP,

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.455
we need to provide a opening and closing tag.

00:01:45.455 --> 00:01:48.605
The opening tag in PHP looks like this,

00:01:48.605 --> 00:01:50.770
it's the angle brackets,

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.315
question mark, and then php.

00:01:54.315 --> 00:01:58.115
This indicates the PHP code is about to start.

00:01:58.115 --> 00:01:59.720
Then at the end of the php,

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.580
we need to add a closing tag,

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.555
which is the question mark on the right angle brackets.

00:02:05.555 --> 00:02:08.915
All the PHP code goes in between here.

00:02:08.915 --> 00:02:13.855
The first thing we want to do, is just print some text to the browser.

00:02:13.855 --> 00:02:16.950
I'm going to do that with a echo.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.890
Type in echo, and then because this is going to be text we need

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.090
to put it in quotations, so, "Hello World."

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.200
Then at the very end, we close a statement with a semicolon.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.990
Save that. This is how we print something to the browser, using PHP.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.270
Go over to your browser,

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.620
and then type in the local host.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.675
Then go to the file that you've put inside the ht-docs.

00:02:51.675 --> 00:02:57.150
It's php-basics, and then hello world. There we go.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.860
Displayed in the browser is our text that were just echoed of Hello World.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.250
We can mix and match PHP in amongst the HTML.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.745
Instead of having the title as typed in there,

00:03:12.745 --> 00:03:15.095
we should have what is called hard-coded.

00:03:15.095 --> 00:03:19.750
Instead of typing on to there, we can open up the PHP,

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:26.680
and then do the echo, Hello World.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.945
Make sure the PHP is closed off,

00:03:30.945 --> 00:03:35.505
with the question mark on the angle brackets. Save that.

00:03:35.505 --> 00:03:37.825
Then if we, "Refresh",

00:03:37.825 --> 00:03:41.405
we should now see that the title at the top of Hello World,

00:03:41.405 --> 00:03:44.255
is now being produced with PHP.

00:03:44.255 --> 00:03:50.280
Just make sure we'll type in PHP, and then, "Refresh".

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.500
Now we all see this is being generated with the PHP.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:01.150
We can mix and match the PHP in amongst the HTML as we only have the opening PHP tags,

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.685
and the closing PHP tags properly set.

00:04:04.685 --> 00:04:08.975
Comments in PHP is similar to lots of other languages.

00:04:08.975 --> 00:04:11.855
We can comment out some code that we no longer need,

00:04:11.855 --> 00:04:17.160
or we can use a comment to type in some notes for our self,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.040
or of the programmers that we want the program to ignore.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.830
For example, if we no longer wanted to display this,

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.035
and we wanted the program to ignore it,

00:04:27.035 --> 00:04:29.315
we could use two forward slashes.

00:04:29.315 --> 00:04:33.170
You can see the text editor makes the line go gray.

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.935
We can tell that's being commented out correctly.

00:04:35.935 --> 00:04:40.540
If we "Save" that, and then "Refresh", that should disappear,

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:46.085
because it's no longer being processed. Let's just remove this.

00:04:46.085 --> 00:04:49.700
Comments are also useful for creating notes.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.740
We can make a note to ourselves,

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:59.840
saying display Hello World to the browser.

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.350
This is what's called a single line comment.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.385
If we just want to comment out a single line of code,

00:05:07.385 --> 00:05:10.295
we just use the two forward slashes.

00:05:10.295 --> 00:05:13.010
If we want comment out more than one line,

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.895
we can use that with a multi-line comment.

00:05:15.895 --> 00:05:18.985
It's a forward slash, and a star.

00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:21.965
Then we can comment out more than one line.

00:05:21.965 --> 00:05:26.345
We'll paste in Hello World two or three times,

00:05:26.345 --> 00:05:30.960
and end that with a star and a forward slash.

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.800
This is how we comment out one line,

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.040
and this is how we comment out more than one line.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.320
In this whole PHP section,

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.665
only the single echo of Hello World will be displayed in the browser.

00:05:44.665 --> 00:05:49.635
Before with the title, we looked at adding PHP in amongst the HTML.

00:05:49.635 --> 00:05:54.000
We can also add HTML tags in amongst PHP.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.060
These will be displayed in the same way as if they were HTML.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.090
For example, in the echo Hello World,

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.060
if wanted this to be a HTML level one heading,

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:11.235
we could put the HTML tags of h1 before the text,

00:06:11.235 --> 00:06:15.660
and then we could put a h1 closing tag after this.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.785
Then instead of being displayed as normal text,

00:06:18.785 --> 00:06:21.505
this will now be a level one heading.

00:06:21.505 --> 00:06:24.715
If we "Save" that, and then "Refresh",

00:06:24.715 --> 00:06:29.090
we now get Hello World as a heading in the larger font size.

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.920
You could put in any targets that you want.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:39.600
We can do the same, while this has a h2 and "Save",

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.340
and let's go over to the browser,

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.835
and there's our level two heading also.

00:06:44.835 --> 00:06:47.710
That's basic PHP syntax.

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:51.185
That's how we can echo or print texts to the browser,

00:06:51.185 --> 00:06:57.000
and also how we can comment out code as well as combine PHP with HTML.
