00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.370
Previously, we added two new products,

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.855
which was the same t-shirt in both the small and the medium size.

00:00:09.855 --> 00:00:12.990
To do this, we needed to create two separate products,

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.340
and this could be a lot of work.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.625
You will have lots of different variants of the same item.

00:00:17.625 --> 00:00:22.290
To help with this, WooCommerce provides a valuable product option.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.260
This means we can add one base product.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.064
Using this example, this would be a ninja t-shirt,

00:00:28.064 --> 00:00:29.475
short sleeve in gray,

00:00:29.475 --> 00:00:31.200
and then we would use the attributes,

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.370
which is the size,

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.775
to create two separate versions of the same products.

00:00:35.775 --> 00:00:38.610
In fact, it would also create a large version too.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.770
This would save a lot of work,

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.945
but see this in action over in our dashboard.

00:00:43.945 --> 00:00:46.780
First of all, let's add a new product.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.775
I'm going to go for the same item but this time in a different color.

00:00:51.775 --> 00:00:58.100
The ninja T-Shirt, short sleeve,

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.630
and this time, this one is going to be in green.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.165
Let's also copy over the description,

00:01:06.165 --> 00:01:11.415
from the full description from here. Paste this is in.

00:01:11.415 --> 00:01:14.800
Previously, we've just used this simple product,

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.960
but this time we're going to go down to the variable product.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.795
For the stock keeping units we'll remove the size and changes to be green.

00:01:24.795 --> 00:01:27.545
I'm not going to enable the stock management for this one.

00:01:27.545 --> 00:01:30.515
We can leave the shipping, the linked products.

00:01:30.515 --> 00:01:32.360
But this time for the attributes,

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.100
we'll go down to the size.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.470
At this, select all of our values which is small, medium, and large.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.260
But this time we want to use these four variations.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.575
This means you will create free versions of the same product in small, medium, and large.

00:01:47.575 --> 00:01:52.505
Give us a save. Next, down to the variations option.

00:01:52.505 --> 00:01:56.390
From here, we can fine-tune the details for each one of our variations.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.850
So our small, medium and large.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.245
Or if we wanted to, we could create a variation from all of our attributes.

00:02:03.245 --> 00:02:06.880
For our smallest, go ahead and add a variation.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.645
The variation will be the size.

00:02:09.645 --> 00:02:12.950
Then if we click on this, we get a drop down option.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.625
We can customize all of the options for the single product.

00:02:16.625 --> 00:02:21.720
We need a price for this,19.95.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.555
This is going to be, in fact, the same for all of our three versions.

00:02:24.555 --> 00:02:27.020
But you could make this different if you wanted to.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.850
We can fine-tune things like the stock,

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.950
the weight dimensions, and also the shipping in class too.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.735
Save this. Then go to add variation.

00:02:36.735 --> 00:02:40.000
This time, this is for the medium.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.325
Click on this, the dropdown.

00:02:44.325 --> 00:02:47.350
This will also need a price too.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.530
Save our changes. Then finally for the large,

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.330
this is just now done.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.285
We can also copy the short description,

00:03:03.285 --> 00:03:05.760
paste this at the bottom.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.370
Put an image. This one was green so select the green version.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.300
Since we have not selected a individual image for our free variance,

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.930
this is going to be the default image.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.385
Select the t-shirt category,

00:03:19.385 --> 00:03:24.940
and then we can publish this product to our store or to our site.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.890
This is the green version which you just created.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.380
Instead of directly adding this to the cart,

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.275
like we can see with the other products,

00:03:33.275 --> 00:03:36.220
we now have the chance to select our options.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.485
We can choose a size, we have small, medium, and large.

00:03:39.485 --> 00:03:40.820
Then after selecting this,

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.640
we can then go ahead and add this to our cart.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.300
If we did go ahead and change the details for each one of these versions,

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.920
such as a different price,

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.600
all this information will be updated when we select a different version.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.990
Scrolling down, we also have the generic description for all of

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.680
these variants and also somewhat related products too. There we go.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.695
This is how we can add variable products to our store.

00:04:04.695 --> 00:04:06.290
It can really save us a lot of time,

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.380
we will have lots of different versions of a similar product.
