00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:07.680
There's no point putting in lots of effort to make our site look really good and have

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.250
lots of amazing content if no users can find it from search engines.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.730
We mentioned earlier in the course that WordPress by

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.240
default is pretty search engine friendly.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.185
However, like everything, there is always room for improvement.

00:00:22.185 --> 00:00:26.505
In this video, we will be covering a great plugin called Yoast SEO,

00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:30.555
which takes our core WordPress SEO to another level.

00:00:30.555 --> 00:00:33.165
If you want to shoot of what SEO is,

00:00:33.165 --> 00:00:36.465
it shall fall search engine optimization.

00:00:36.465 --> 00:00:39.710
It's basically the process of optimizing our content on

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.515
our website to appear higher in the order of search engine results.

00:00:44.515 --> 00:00:47.630
We optimize keywords, descriptions,

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.420
and also optimize things like our blog posts.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.710
The more relevant in search engines is plugin really helps by

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.510
highlighting all of the things which we're doing

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.555
good and all of the things which we need to improve on,

00:00:59.555 --> 00:01:02.180
such as all of our keywords, our descriptions,

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.589
the length of our content,

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:05.750
and the images alt text.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.915
It can also help too with something called metadata,

00:01:08.915 --> 00:01:13.565
which is the information about our sites made visible to search engines.

00:01:13.565 --> 00:01:16.745
You can also generate sitemaps and submit them to Google,

00:01:16.745 --> 00:01:19.270
along with so many other things.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.325
Let's head over to the plugin section where we can search for this particular plugin.

00:01:24.325 --> 00:01:27.770
Go to add new. There's a very good chance

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.500
that this will be appearing inside the popular section.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.280
If not, you will need to do a search for Yoast SEO in the search box up at the top.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.850
This is what we need. Its compossible with our version of WordPress.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:47.920
Let's install this, activate this.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.910
This will also leave us with a SEO option in the menu too.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:02:00.205
You can see an overview of our configuration along with any problems on notifications.

00:02:00.205 --> 00:02:02.950
But generally a lot of the things which are going to be dealing with

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.440
Yoast is going to be actually inside of our content.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.895
For example, if you go to any particular page,

00:02:09.895 --> 00:02:12.820
I want to go for the web design one.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.520
If we now go back into the edit screen,

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.860
yours will now provide a new section inside of this edit screen.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.720
From the top, the first thing we need to do is to provide

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.240
a focus keyphrase for this page.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:31.010
A focus keyphrase is the main keyword which you want to focus on for this page.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.305
This is a web design page.

00:02:33.305 --> 00:02:37.240
I'm going to set the keyphrase to be web design.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.355
Enable all of this, we've seen a preview of how

00:02:40.355 --> 00:02:43.070
outside will appear inside of a Google search.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.230
We can also check this out for the mobile and also the desktop result too.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.800
If we wanted too, we could also play around with the SEO title and also insert

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.735
different variables to change the order and the look of how all of this data will appear.

00:02:56.735 --> 00:02:59.150
We can also change this slug if we wanted to.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.825
[inaudible] this is web design and development.

00:03:01.825 --> 00:03:04.665
We can see this over in the permalink too.

00:03:04.665 --> 00:03:09.360
A meta description if we wanted to override all of the description for this preview.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.020
We could also change it inside of here too.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.740
As you can see, this will automatically be updated in our preview.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.535
This is how it will look in a Google search.

00:03:18.535 --> 00:03:19.820
I'm going to leave this empty,

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.105
but it is a good idea to do this on all live web pages.

00:03:23.105 --> 00:03:26.615
We can also insert variables too such as the site title,

00:03:26.615 --> 00:03:30.190
the page's title, and also the categories too.

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.960
Below this we have an SEO analysis,

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.140
which is going to be a really important part to go for you.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.630
This will tell us what parts of our pages are good for

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.180
SEO and which parts need some improvement.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.925
On the bottom we see we have these green light.

00:03:43.925 --> 00:03:45.440
This is the good section.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.675
We have a good land off of keyphrase.

00:03:47.675 --> 00:03:52.355
This key is also unique and not used in any other pages or blog posts.

00:03:52.355 --> 00:03:54.475
We have the keyphrase and the title.

00:03:54.475 --> 00:03:57.980
If we go to the top, we see this is web design and development.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.245
We'll have our keyphrase just here.

00:04:00.245 --> 00:04:03.665
If we were to switch this around,

00:04:03.665 --> 00:04:08.520
just like this, then update and refresh.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.524
Back down to the analysis,

00:04:11.524 --> 00:04:15.970
we then see this is missing and it's also now a recommended improvement.

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.820
The other recommended improvements are the image alt text.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.015
We're going to amend this over inside the sidebar.

00:04:23.015 --> 00:04:26.535
Under the featured image, we click on this.

00:04:26.535 --> 00:04:29.835
We can then add the keyphrase into the alt text.

00:04:29.835 --> 00:04:32.025
This was web design,

00:04:32.025 --> 00:04:36.085
update our page, refresh.

00:04:36.085 --> 00:04:39.140
This problem has now been removed.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.450
We'll also revert this page title too.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.690
Back down to the improvements.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.345
We then have a red section which is the more serious improvements which we need to make.

00:04:52.345 --> 00:04:57.290
A lot of this is down to the fact that we don't have any content on this page.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.250
We just have a title and a very short description just below.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.520
It is also recommended to add a little more content such as the text length.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.640
Currently we only have seven words,

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.225
although the recommended minimum is actually 300.

00:05:11.225 --> 00:05:13.000
We could also make use of some of

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.390
this descriptive text and also place this in the meta description too.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.880
If we don't do this, as we'll see below,

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.310
the search engine will automatically grab a section from this page for us.

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.210
This section which it grabs may not be

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.255
the exact piece of content which we want to display.

00:05:29.255 --> 00:05:33.890
All this text should also contain our keyphrase in the opening paragraph.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:38.485
It's also recommended to have some internal and external links too.

00:05:38.485 --> 00:05:41.210
We should add some links to other pages on

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.860
our own site and also ideally link to some other websites too.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.040
After this, once we've gone through all of these improvements,

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.225
we'll then have a related keyphrase.

00:05:52.225 --> 00:05:55.665
This is a secondary keyphrase which we want to add.

00:05:55.665 --> 00:05:59.270
But this is only available for the paid version of this plugin.

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.180
I'm going to leave this section.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.765
Next, we have the cornerstone content.

00:06:03.765 --> 00:06:06.365
For any one of our pages or blog posts,

00:06:06.365 --> 00:06:08.600
we can switch this on or off.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:14.795
A piece of cornerstone content is the most important piece of content on our site.

00:06:14.795 --> 00:06:19.100
For example, if your WordPress site is famous for chocolate brownies,

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.970
the chocolate brownies page should be marked as the cornerstone content.

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.660
But this is something for you to decide based on your content.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.980
Finally, we have an advanced tab down at the bottom where we can set,

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:34.295
if we want, this particular page to appear in these search engine results.

00:06:34.295 --> 00:06:36.020
We're going to leave this as yes.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.165
Well, we could also turn it off too.

00:06:38.165 --> 00:06:40.880
You'll want search engines to follow links on this page.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.350
We can select yes or no.

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:45.470
We have a meta robot advanced section where we can

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.330
fine tune how we want our meta robots to behave.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.480
We're not going to cover any of these advanced settings,

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.590
but you can have a Google search and find out more about meta robots.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.460
Finally, we have the canonical URL.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:02.335
A canonical URL is a way to deal with duplicate content on our site.

00:07:02.335 --> 00:07:05.505
For example, if we had an e-commerce store,

00:07:05.505 --> 00:07:08.930
we had two identical products listed on our site.

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:12.605
We need to tell these search engines which one they should use.

00:07:12.605 --> 00:07:16.910
If we don't do this and we have lots of pieces of duplicate content,

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:19.340
search engines will believe we're trying to game

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:23.875
the system by just duplicating things rather than creating new content.

00:07:23.875 --> 00:07:26.390
If we had an e-commerce store, for example,

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:29.290
and we had a blue t-shirt.

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:32.330
We'd maybe have a product name just like this.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:37.040
For the URL, we may have this inside of the shirt section.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:42.050
We'd have our e-commerce name and then the URL which looks just like this.

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:49.000
But what about if we happen to put this blue shirt also into a blue category.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.655
We could also have the same shirt inside of a cell category.

00:07:52.655 --> 00:07:57.725
Now we have three of the same products in three different sections on our site.

00:07:57.725 --> 00:08:00.080
Of course, we're not trying to trick search engines

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.960
by providing duplicate content in this way.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:08.180
We need to mark one of these pieces of content as the main you want to display.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:12.735
For this, we need to leave this empty for the main piece of content.

00:08:12.735 --> 00:08:15.070
Then, for the other two sections,

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:18.355
which was the blue category and also the sale category.

00:08:18.355 --> 00:08:21.400
We'll then need to point back to our URL,

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:25.490
which was the shirts/blue-shirt.

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:29.350
Just to clarify, the main piece of content is empty and

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:33.590
then we'll point all duplicate pieces back to the main URL.

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:35.490
This is all of the options.

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:37.065
We'll update our sites.

00:08:37.065 --> 00:08:43.570
We can also repeat this process for all of our other pages as well as all of these pages.

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:47.105
We can also do the same too for all of our blog posts.

00:08:47.105 --> 00:08:49.320
If we had inside here,

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.505
over on the right, we also know have this SEO score.

00:08:52.505 --> 00:08:57.650
We have a readability score and also the number of links from this page too.

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:00.540
If we go into any of these,

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:04.410
we get the exact same SEO section which we

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.625
can go through over each piece of content on our site.

00:09:07.625 --> 00:09:10.400
This is how we can use the Yoast SEO plugin

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.745
to improve our positioning in search engine results.

00:09:13.745 --> 00:09:16.070
It's something which you really should be aware of,

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:18.830
even if you just use it to target the quick wins,

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:21.890
such as optimizing your pages and posts.

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:24.260
There are, of course, other SEO plugins,

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.000
which also do a good job too.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.195
But this is a really popular one which I personally use.

00:09:29.195 --> 00:09:32.160
It's also very effective too.
