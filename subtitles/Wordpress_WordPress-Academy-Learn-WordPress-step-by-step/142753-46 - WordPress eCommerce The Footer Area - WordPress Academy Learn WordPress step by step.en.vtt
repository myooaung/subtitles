00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.940
The final contents, which we need to add to

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.810
our site is down at the bottom inside of this footer area.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.160
We can add up to four separate sections into our footer,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.160
placing four separate pieces of content.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.750
The first section over on the left and the fourth section will be over on the right.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.110
We can place inside it lots of content such as widgets.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.480
We can place menus, bestsellers,

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.250
top-rated products, and everything else we have access to in the widget section.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.100
To do this, over to the Dashboard and into the Appearance, then and Widgets.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.740
The first menu location of Footer Column 1 is going to be two separate menus.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.060
We already have these menus created from the previous video.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.360
We can reuse this inside of a widget too.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.975
To do this, drag over the Navigation Menu,

00:00:53.975 --> 00:00:58.645
and then select the Navigation Menu which you want to place in this location.

00:00:58.645 --> 00:01:01.710
First, User menu, Save this.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.630
We can also add our Navigation Menu too.

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.830
We do this in the exact same way.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:14.145
Drag this over, select our second menu and then refresh the page.

00:01:14.145 --> 00:01:16.545
There's our first section.

00:01:16.545 --> 00:01:20.860
The second section, this is going to be for the address information.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.795
It's going to be a lot like our Contact Us page.

00:01:23.795 --> 00:01:27.940
Column 2. This is a text widget.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.315
Drag this into Column 2.

00:01:30.315 --> 00:01:33.735
Just like we did with the Contact Us page, the text,

00:01:33.735 --> 00:01:40.950
You can find at, and then add some sample address lines inside here.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.815
Copy. Add the same a couple more times.

00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:50.450
If you wanted to, you could also change this into a list,

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.265
but I'm just going to keep this as regular text. Save this.

00:01:54.265 --> 00:01:57.960
Then just below, set up a second text block.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.075
Just like the Contact Us page,

00:02:00.075 --> 00:02:02.815
this will contain our useful contacts,

00:02:02.815 --> 00:02:07.670
the title, and then our text,

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.250
which will be the email and also the URL.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.680
We can grab this from our Contact page.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.580
These is our two links down at the bottom.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.670
Paste this in and save this widget.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.830
We can check if this is working okay,

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.705
back to the Home page.

00:02:26.705 --> 00:02:29.390
Scroll down to the footer, which is fine.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.105
Now we can move on to Column 3.

00:02:32.105 --> 00:02:34.875
Our Footer Area number 3,

00:02:34.875 --> 00:02:38.440
I'm going to drag over the Products by Rating,

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.680
which is a list of all top rated products,

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.405
and the default of five is fine.

00:02:44.405 --> 00:02:47.840
We load. This is just a shortened version

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.190
of each one of the products in order of the top-rated.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.930
Generally, these widget areas are often enough for

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.670
our needs because if we have a much more complex use case for each one of these sections,

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.850
you can also make use of the page builder,

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.325
just like we used for the Contact Us page.

00:03:04.325 --> 00:03:07.055
The page builder also has a widget too,

00:03:07.055 --> 00:03:10.415
and it's contained inside of this Layout Builder widget.

00:03:10.415 --> 00:03:15.190
Into Footer Area 4, we can drag this over.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.655
This widget area can be laid out exactly the same as one of our pages.

00:03:19.655 --> 00:03:22.460
We can split up our content into various rows and

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.685
columns to give us a really flexible layout.

00:03:25.685 --> 00:03:28.100
I want to close this down and remove this widget,

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.780
but this is a really flexible way to control the layout of our sections.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.000
Placing an extra column if you want to,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.200
but I'm going to leave this here.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.425
This is now all of the content on our store.

00:03:39.425 --> 00:03:42.980
In the next video, we're going to finalize this project by

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.070
looking at all of the additional settings which comes with e-commerce,

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.865
such as adding coupons, creating reports,

00:03:48.865 --> 00:03:50.880
adding different payment methods,

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.240
and also the integrated order stream inside of our dashboard.
