00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.760
Welcome back. In this video,

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:08.875
we're going to get to work on hooking our menu into WordPress.

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:12.635
Currently, we've got a couple of links at the top,

00:00:12.635 --> 00:00:17.460
which you just basic HTML list items, and if we click on them,

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.560
they would actually link anywhere,

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.375
because the links are looking for the blog.html page,

00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:27.210
or the about.html page,

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.680
from our static site.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:37.015
So to fix this, we need to replace our HTML list items with WordPress menus.

00:00:37.015 --> 00:00:40.420
So if we go over to the WordPress Codex,

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.570
and if we search for navigation menus,

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.160
and this is link that we need,

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.880
so we can see that the first thing we need to do,

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:04.370
is to register the menu inside the themes functions.php file.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.925
If we were doing this from scratch,

00:01:06.925 --> 00:01:08.785
we need to copy this function,

00:01:08.785 --> 00:01:10.810
and then paste in manually.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.035
But because we're using the underscore starter theme,

00:01:14.035 --> 00:01:16.930
if we go into the function.php,

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.540
and we're going to to do a search for register_nav,

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.620
and this is what we need, register_nav menus.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.205
So the starter theme that we're using already has registered

00:01:34.205 --> 00:01:40.695
a primary menu and we can use this as our main menu in the header section.

00:01:40.695 --> 00:01:43.350
So back over to the Codex.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.395
If we scroll down a little bit further,

00:01:45.395 --> 00:01:49.990
there's a section called display menus on the theme.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.130
We need to use a PHP function called wp_nav_menu.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.815
So we need to paste this inside our theme,

00:01:57.815 --> 00:02:00.925
exactly where we want the menu to appear.

00:02:00.925 --> 00:02:03.420
So I'll copy this section,

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.260
and then our menu is in the header.php,

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.950
and we find the list items for the blog,

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.935
on the about us page,

00:02:14.935 --> 00:02:18.670
let's just delete these two list items,

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.220
and I'm going to paste in the function,

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.085
that we just copied and this function needs to be surrounded in LI tags.

00:02:27.085 --> 00:02:31.360
So I'll put one set of list item tags inside there,

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.955
and then paste in the function that we just copied,

00:02:34.955 --> 00:02:39.090
and then all we need to do is to delete header menu,

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.595
and changes to be primary,

00:02:41.595 --> 00:02:46.750
which is the same as our functions file, just here.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.055
I'll just make sure you that's saved,

00:02:53.055 --> 00:02:57.250
and then let's visit the sites, and refresh.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.290
So now our menu is being replaced with a WordPress version.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.150
We've got the homepage,

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.525
and also the default sample page.

00:03:09.525 --> 00:03:11.985
I'm going to go over to the dashboard,

00:03:11.985 --> 00:03:14.710
and then down to menus.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.225
To begin, I want to make this the primary menu.

00:03:20.225 --> 00:03:23.070
So make sure that's selected,

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.420
and I'm going to also, automatically,

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.810
add new pages to the menu, once we create them.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:37.840
So I'll save that. We can also remove the sample page,

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.115
and in fact, our finished website doesn't have the homepage link.

00:03:43.115 --> 00:03:51.060
So let just remove both these links, and then save that.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.850
It's actually removed all the menu link so we don't need,

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.525
but at least we know the menu is working.

00:04:01.525 --> 00:04:05.580
So when we come back in the next video I'll create the blog page.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.930
The new blog page that we add will be automatically added to the top navigation.

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.630
So that's our WordPress menu now added to the theme.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.430
So I'll see you in the next video.
