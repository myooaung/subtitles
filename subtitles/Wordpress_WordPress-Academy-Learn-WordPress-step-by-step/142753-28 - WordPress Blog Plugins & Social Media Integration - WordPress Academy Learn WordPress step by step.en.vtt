00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.600
Welcome back to this video on plugins.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.645
Plugins are a really important part of WordPress

00:00:10.645 --> 00:00:13.915
and they allow us to extend the WordPress core.

00:00:13.915 --> 00:00:16.900
Now by that, we mean that we have a WordPress

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.940
downloads when we initially setup any of our WordPress projects.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.230
Then we can extend it to provide lots

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.980
more different features and a different set of functions.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.280
So we could include things such as contact forms.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.320
We could add tools for SEO.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.970
In this particular video,

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.220
we'll take a look adding a plugin to add

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.415
some social media icons from the wordpress.org homepage.

00:00:41.415 --> 00:00:43.560
We can go into the plugin section,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.145
just like we did early on with the themes.

00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:53.015
We can see currently we have over 50,000 available plug-ins to extend our WordPress site.

00:00:53.015 --> 00:00:55.640
We have things such as booking calendars,

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.060
we have galleries, we have contact forms.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.800
We can add anti-spam protection,

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.170
the ability to backup our site and if we didn't like the new Gutenberg editor,

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.720
which is applied on version five and above,

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.445
we can also revert back to the classic editor if we prefer.

00:01:12.445 --> 00:01:16.805
To add these plugins and to also see what plugins are available for our site,

00:01:16.805 --> 00:01:19.460
we can go back over to the dashboard,

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.150
make sure that any changes are saved in the customizer.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.065
We have a dedicated plugin section.

00:01:26.065 --> 00:01:30.845
Click on this. Currently, we have the word pressing policy, which we used earlier.

00:01:30.845 --> 00:01:34.175
This was activated when we installed the sample data.

00:01:34.175 --> 00:01:38.300
Logins are really simple to add we just click on the add new button.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.915
Insulation is very similar to a theme.

00:01:41.915 --> 00:01:44.330
We can see all the featured and also

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.130
the popular plug-ins and we can directly install these from the screen.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.750
Or as we've seen,

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.000
there is so many differents plug-ins available

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.555
we may also need to search for the desire to want to.

00:01:56.555 --> 00:02:00.695
In our case I'm going do a search for social,

00:02:00.695 --> 00:02:04.010
fill up all of the social media icons.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.245
The one I'm going to use is this one,

00:02:06.245 --> 00:02:07.910
which is by ultimately social.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.245
It's also really important to note that when installing any plug-ins,

00:02:12.245 --> 00:02:16.490
it's worth checking when there were last updated to make sure that these are regular

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.520
maintained and also make sure these are

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.165
also compatible with your current version of WordPress.

00:02:23.165 --> 00:02:24.845
Usually, the reviews is

00:02:24.845 --> 00:02:28.850
a good indication of whether you are installing a useful plugin or not.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.705
All we need to do is click on Install,

00:02:32.705 --> 00:02:35.795
which will download this plug-in and then once this is done,

00:02:35.795 --> 00:02:39.630
we can then activate this to use it in our site.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:50.015
Activate this plugin. Once we allow this plug-in we can then see from the sidebar,

00:02:50.015 --> 00:02:53.185
we now have a new icon inside the Dashboard.

00:02:53.185 --> 00:02:54.930
We can click on this.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.600
We take into our options,

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.720
we'll need to run through the setup of our plugin.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.825
We're going to close this down and then run through some of the required settings.

00:03:04.825 --> 00:03:08.675
We have three different settings which we need to configure up at the top.

00:03:08.675 --> 00:03:12.680
The first one is which icon to want to show on our site.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.360
This is completely up to you.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.975
I'm going to go for Twitter and also YouTube.

00:03:17.975 --> 00:03:20.120
Keep this pretty simple.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.280
We'll just confirm the activation.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.245
Also the RSS feed, we can remove this.

00:03:28.245 --> 00:03:31.550
If you do have any accounts with any of these other providers,

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.270
you feel free to check these buttons too.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.810
Save our first option.

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.855
Next option two is what do we want these icons to do?

00:03:40.855 --> 00:03:42.650
For example, with Twitter,

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.705
when the user clicks on the Twitter icon,

00:03:44.705 --> 00:03:47.110
you want them to visit our profile,

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.865
you want them to follow us or you want to tweet about the particular page.

00:03:51.865 --> 00:03:54.170
In my case, I'm going to set this to be,

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.625
follow me on Twitter.

00:03:55.625 --> 00:03:58.410
Then add in my Twitter handle.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.570
Down to YouTube we can also insert the YouTube URL,

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.970
which you're going to link to your YouTube page.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:12.430
You can also allow people to directly subscribe to your channel too, save option to.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.335
Then the third one is where will these buttons be displayed?

00:04:17.335 --> 00:04:21.130
We could allow them to be floated over the website pages.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:27.385
We set the position of these icons to be in the top corners or in the center of our site.

00:04:27.385 --> 00:04:31.585
We could also add some margin in the top right, bottom or left.

00:04:31.585 --> 00:04:36.080
This is some spacing which will push over the icons from any particular side.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.940
This is maybe useful if these buttons are covering

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.430
up a certain piece of content and we just

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.975
want to fine-tune the layouts so they don't cover up any important pieces of information.

00:04:46.975 --> 00:04:50.740
We can also check as many of these options as we would like.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.340
If you want to, we can also place these buttons into a widget.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.850
This will allow the social media widget to

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.435
be dragged into any one of our themes, widget areas.

00:05:02.435 --> 00:05:05.585
I'm going to uncheck this since we don't need it.

00:05:05.585 --> 00:05:09.520
The next option is to place via a shortcode.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.870
We've not covered a shortcode just yet,

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.690
but this is a small snippets of code which you can

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.875
place into any one of our blog posts or pages.

00:05:17.875 --> 00:05:21.140
We will also look at this later on, but for now,

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:25.960
we can insert this by copying the code inside of these square brackets.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.530
By copying this section,

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.280
we can place our widgets into any one of all pages or posts.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.830
Let's see this in action by saving.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.200
We can go over to one of our pages,

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.460
select any of these and go into edit.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:47.895
Then all we need to do is to paste this into a text block update.

00:05:47.895 --> 00:05:53.490
Then we can check out our about us page inside the browser.

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.350
Go down and below all of our texts we can now see

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.940
these social media icons have been inserted with this shortcode.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.780
This is really useful if we want to include this on one particular page,

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.060
on a particular blog post.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.240
I'm going to leave these icons on this about us page since it may be

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.390
useful for the user to share this page with others.

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.870
Back to the dashboard, click on the WordPress icon.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.910
Back into our icons we can now finish the setup.

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.965
The location, I'm going to place mine in the top right.

00:06:26.965 --> 00:06:29.105
We can leave the shortcode in.

00:06:29.105 --> 00:06:31.290
If you wanted to you could also place this in

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:35.150
the theme's header and also show this after all of our posts.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.250
There is also some optional settings just below too.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:42.550
For example, if you want to play around with the design and animation of these,

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.624
you can change the look and the feel of all of our icons.

00:06:45.624 --> 00:06:49.030
We can add a counter next to each one of these icons and

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:52.820
generally tailor how these will act on our website.

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:58.900
I'm going to leave all these options and save our plugin over to the website.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.960
Now we can see if we visit any one of our pages,

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.110
we have these icons appear on over in the top right.

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.310
We can click on the Twitter icon,

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.065
which is a follow button,

00:07:09.065 --> 00:07:14.015
where we're instantly taken to our profile and we can directly follow this user.

00:07:14.015 --> 00:07:19.730
We also have a YouTube link which probably won't work since we have not added a URL,

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.910
but you can go ahead and add your own URL into here,

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:26.215
or any other social media icons if you would like.

00:07:26.215 --> 00:07:30.980
Good, with our social media icons now all in place and set up.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.280
Next, we're going to move on to modifying

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.530
this homepage and also introducing some widgets.
