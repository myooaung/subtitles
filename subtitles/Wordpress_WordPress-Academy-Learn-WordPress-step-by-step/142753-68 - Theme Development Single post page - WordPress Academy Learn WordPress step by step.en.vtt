00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.420
Hi everyone. In this video we're going to take a look at the single post page.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.055
When we my view on our blog,

00:00:08.055 --> 00:00:10.620
we can click on the title of

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.945
the individual posts and we're taken to a page which displays

00:00:15.945 --> 00:00:20.130
only this blog post and nothing else and

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.390
this view is controlled by a file called the single dot PHP.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.605
We've not done any work yet inside the single dot PHP file.

00:00:31.605 --> 00:00:36.975
If we make the website a little bit smaller and we stretch out the content,

00:00:36.975 --> 00:00:42.420
you can see that the header is centered and also the footer.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:52.315
But the actual single dot PHP content is not aligned inside a container. Let's fix this.

00:00:52.315 --> 00:00:57.740
Let's go over to the single dot PHP and add the containers.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.290
We can grab these from our index dot PHP.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.825
Crop the div with the class of row,

00:01:05.825 --> 00:01:07.915
and also the medium eights,

00:01:07.915 --> 00:01:10.135
which is the containers.

00:01:10.135 --> 00:01:15.070
Copy that and then paste these in just

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.650
below get header and then if you scroll down to the bottom of the page,

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.515
just above the open-end PHP tag,

00:01:23.515 --> 00:01:28.980
we can close off these two divs just like that.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:36.180
Let's save that and then refresh and now when we make the page full width,

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.790
we can see that the blog posts are all centered in the middle of the page.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.105
Now our content looks a lot better.

00:01:46.105 --> 00:01:50.200
Now let's add the sidebar to be on the right-hand side.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.840
Let's go back over to the index page and

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.990
let's copy the sidebar section from down the bottom.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.880
Copy the div with the class or medium three.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.515
Then go back over to the single dot PHP,

00:02:08.515 --> 00:02:12.150
because we want the sidebar to be still within the row.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.620
Place this between the two divs or the two closing div tags that we just added,

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.790
making sure it's just above the closing div for the row.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:31.680
Save that and then refresh and we should get the sidebar, which is great.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.550
If you look at the blog post,

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.704
you can see that we've still got the shortened version or the excerpt,

00:02:38.704 --> 00:02:41.915
rather than the five photographs of Lorem Ipsum,

00:02:41.915 --> 00:02:44.030
which you put into the block.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:50.075
I want this page to display the full content rather than just the shortened version.

00:02:50.075 --> 00:02:52.460
Just like in the index page,

00:02:52.460 --> 00:03:01.255
the single dot PHP pulls the content of the blog post from a file called content dot PHP.

00:03:01.255 --> 00:03:03.870
Let's go and see our file now.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.575
We've already told this template to display

00:03:06.575 --> 00:03:10.945
only a shortened version with the excerpt function.

00:03:10.945 --> 00:03:16.265
How can we change this to be the full content when showing the full post?

00:03:16.265 --> 00:03:19.370
Well, we can do this by using conditional statements,

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.015
like we looked at in the PHP section.

00:03:22.015 --> 00:03:24.335
Using a if else statement,

00:03:24.335 --> 00:03:29.470
we can show the shortened or the full version depending on what page we view in.

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.790
Let's see how we can do this in WordPress.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:42.240
I'm going to go over to Google and then do a quick search for WordPress conditional tags.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.080
Look for the codex under conditional tags.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.640
Okay. The conditional tags can be used in

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.240
your template files to change what content is displayed,

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.055
and how that content is displayed on a particular page.

00:04:03.055 --> 00:04:05.400
That's exactly what we want.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.440
Let's take a look further down.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.700
We can display content depending on if the page is home,

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.740
if the page is the front page or for example,

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:22.400
if it's admin, if we're in a single page,

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.800
which is exactly what we want.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.325
If the template is a single page,

00:04:28.325 --> 00:04:31.170
we want to display the full content.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.550
If the template is home,

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.144
we want to just display the excerpt,

00:04:37.144 --> 00:04:41.765
and the home is where the blog page is being displayed.

00:04:41.765 --> 00:04:46.015
Let's go back over to the content dot PHP.

00:04:46.015 --> 00:04:51.800
Okay, so let's start by creating our if-else statements and making a little bit of space.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.865
We want to display the excerpt if the page is home,

00:04:55.865 --> 00:04:58.895
meaning that the page is the blog.

00:04:58.895 --> 00:05:06.060
Let's do that by opening up the PHP tags and then begin a if statement.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:16.935
So if, then lets crop this home function and paste it in the brackets.

00:05:16.935 --> 00:05:20.485
If the page is the homepage,

00:05:20.485 --> 00:05:23.455
and open up the brace,

00:05:23.455 --> 00:05:30.920
then display the excerpt and then we need to close calibrates off.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.665
Open up the PHP.

00:05:33.665 --> 00:05:38.730
Close the brace off and close PHP.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.370
Now, we should only get the excerpt if it's the blog.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.475
If we go over to the site and refresh,

00:05:46.475 --> 00:05:48.725
we then lose the excerpt,

00:05:48.725 --> 00:05:55.410
so they should only be displayed when we go to blog, which is just there.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.195
Let's now create a l section,

00:05:59.195 --> 00:06:04.020
to display the full content if using the single template.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:13.230
We put in the PHP, create the else statement on the opening curly brace and in fact,

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:18.545
we can just copy this line and paste it in.

00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:20.450
But instead of the excerpt,

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:27.600
we can use the content and then close off

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:35.895
the else statement with the closing brace, there we go.

00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:39.230
Let's take a look at the site and see this in action.

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.465
Hopefully this should all work.

00:06:41.465 --> 00:06:44.630
Refresh. In the blog section,

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.260
so we'll get the shortened version and then let's

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.290
click on the post title and there we go,

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:56.810
so there's the full content inside the single file,

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.780
which is the five paragraphs, of Lorem Ipsum.

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:04.480
Starts working just like we wanted it to.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.420
Okay, so that's how we can work with the single page template,

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:14.699
and also how we can work with conditional statements and conditional tags in WordPress.
