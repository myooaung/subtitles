00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.185
Okay. So before we start this video,

00:00:04.185 --> 00:00:06.810
we should be all wind WordPress.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.345
We should have all installed on our local host and also the database and all ready to go.

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:16.170
You should have already downloaded the static template,

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.180
the pro-headphones website, which is being supplied with this course.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.824
In this video, we're going to download a WordPress starter theme called underscores.

00:00:27.824 --> 00:00:31.650
So I'm just going to go over to Google and then will search

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.420
for underscores starter theme.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.255
Then this is the URL we need, which is underscores.me.

00:00:44.255 --> 00:00:47.930
So underscores is not like the themes we'll find on

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.785
theme forest or the themes that we find on the WordPress homepage.

00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:55.375
These are all complete themes which basically ready to

00:00:55.375 --> 00:00:59.885
go and ready to start adding your own colors and you own touches.

00:00:59.885 --> 00:01:03.455
However, start theme is exactly what it sounds like.

00:01:03.455 --> 00:01:05.585
It's a base to start building on.

00:01:05.585 --> 00:01:08.900
It includes all the WordPress required files and

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.950
folders and includes many WordPress best practices.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.585
So we can think of it as a quick stuffy theme.

00:01:16.585 --> 00:01:20.480
Many of the top themes out there on sites such as

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.260
theme forest is built on top of the underscore start theme.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.380
So it's a really solid foundation to build on.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.390
So if you take a look on the homepage,

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.900
you can see all the things it's included,

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.420
such as the style sheets,

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.445
different layouts, things such as custom headers, 404 templates.

00:01:40.445 --> 00:01:43.915
So it just basically saves us a lot of work would stand out.

00:01:43.915 --> 00:01:49.565
So to begin, all we simply need to do is to generate our theme.

00:01:49.565 --> 00:01:52.980
So I'm going to call this the pro-headphones-wp

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:01.750
and then click on "Generate" and then you should set off a download.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.090
So let's open that up and then unzip

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:15.660
the package and this is going to be our new theme folder for us to begin working on.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.360
So let's open up a New Finder Window.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.960
Then I'm going to head over to

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:29.290
our MAMP folder and then let's find out WordPress folder inside the ht docs.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.195
So pro-headphones and then we need to add this into the theme section.

00:02:34.195 --> 00:02:42.120
So WordPress content, themes and then just drag this over into the theme folder.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.170
Let's open and look inside.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.990
So inside there is everything we need to begin working with for our new theme.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.150
There's various page templates and things such as the 404 page,

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.170
the functions and all the basic pages that we need,

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.270
such as the index.php,

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.515
the page.php, the layouts folder,

00:03:09.515 --> 00:03:12.420
folder for adding languages,

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:18.975
JavaScript and also neatly organized we have the parts templates.

00:03:18.975 --> 00:03:28.290
So we're good to go. So I'm going to go over to the WordPress Dashboard and then go

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:36.900
down to Appearance and then Themes and then there's our pro-headphones theme.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.125
So let's activate this and of course you can change the image if you like.

00:03:42.125 --> 00:03:46.500
So just activate that and then let's visit the site.

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.035
It's very basic at the minute,

00:03:49.035 --> 00:03:51.920
but it's meant to be a starter theme for us to build on.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.480
So we'll begin in the next video by adding the header and the footer sections.
