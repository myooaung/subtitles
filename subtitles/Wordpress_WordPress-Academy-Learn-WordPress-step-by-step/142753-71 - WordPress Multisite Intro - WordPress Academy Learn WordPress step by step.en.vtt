00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.175
Welcome everybody to this new section.

00:00:11.175 --> 00:00:17.550
This section is all about introducing you to the WordPress network or Multisite feature.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.600
This is really useful if you want to create more than one site,

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.725
or allow other people to create a site as part of your network.

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:30.505
All these sites are controlled by the same WordPress installation.

00:00:30.505 --> 00:00:34.840
So you could administer all the sites from the same dashboard.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.200
One or two things just to make you aware of before we continue.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.980
The first thing is to use a Multisite feature,

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.175
you do need some form of live web posting,

00:00:46.175 --> 00:00:52.075
because the WordPress Multisite feature doesn't play well with the local host.

00:00:52.075 --> 00:00:55.370
There is a work-around available,

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.850
and I want to place a link on the screen to a guide,

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.555
if you do want to try and give that a go.

00:01:01.555 --> 00:01:03.665
However, if you can possibly do it,

00:01:03.665 --> 00:01:06.305
I would recommend using a live web server.

00:01:06.305 --> 00:01:08.090
The next thing is, of course,

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.680
when using a live web server,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.145
you also will need your own domain name.

00:01:12.145 --> 00:01:16.895
We can pick up a domain name and also some host in quite cheaply,

00:01:16.895 --> 00:01:19.695
if you just want to use it for the section.

00:01:19.695 --> 00:01:22.160
However, don't worry if you enable to complete

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.950
this section because you don't have the hosting.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.010
You can always come back to this section in the future if you

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.600
want to set up a Multisite on a live server.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.425
For the rest of this section,

00:01:33.425 --> 00:01:37.475
I'm going to be using a hosting provider called Bluehost.

00:01:37.475 --> 00:01:40.715
This is available from bluehost.com.

00:01:40.715 --> 00:01:44.420
You can use any web hosting provider which you prefer.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.570
I'm not affiliated with Bluehost in any way.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.560
I just find that they are really good for WordPress and

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.735
they're even recommended on wordPress.org. So that's it.

00:01:55.735 --> 00:01:57.610
If you do have some web hosting,

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.740
let's go ahead and continue with the rest of the section.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.985
Again, don't worry if you can't complete this section because you don't have to hosting,

00:02:04.985 --> 00:02:08.260
this section will always be available for the future.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.010
Let's now move on to the next video,

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.490
we'll take a look at what a Multisite is,

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.610
some good use cases and examples,

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.660
and also some cases of when to avoid using the Multisite.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.970
Let's move on and take a look at that now.
