00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.170
Welcome back guys. I'm sure you're all eager to get

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.185
started we're creating your own WordPress theme.

00:00:07.185 --> 00:00:10.170
As usual, like the previous couple of projects,

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.970
we're going to get started by setting up

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.080
the database and also downloading the WordPress folder

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.235
from wordpress.org Let's begin by making sure the MAMP is all up and running.

00:00:23.235 --> 00:00:26.100
Then if we go to the start page,

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:32.860
we can then begin setting up our database inside "phpMyAdmin."

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.785
Under "Databases," we want to create a new database;

00:00:40.785 --> 00:00:42.600
this is going to be called

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:51.095
"pro-headphones," which is the name of our static website that we are going to convert,

00:00:51.095 --> 00:00:56.745
then hit create and that's all we need to do inside there.

00:00:56.745 --> 00:01:01.050
Then next we're going to go over to wordpress.org.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.335
As usual, just download WordPress,

00:01:04.335 --> 00:01:07.720
then select the latest version.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.710
I'm sure a few seconds to download.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.350
Into the downloads, and then unzip the package.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:32.175
I'm going to call this "pro-headphones" and then save that.

00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:38.730
Then open up the "htdocs;" I'm going to open a new window,

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:45.555
then go into the "Applications," and then "MAMP," the

00:01:45.555 --> 00:01:53.230
"htdocs," and then drug over our new website inside there.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.520
I'll just close these down.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.300
Then you should know what to do next by now;

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.090
we need to go into the local host,

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.450
then into our new pro-headphones folder,

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.540
then we'll start by going through the country;

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.450
so select your country of choice and then we can go to the installation script.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:29.370
So let's go, the database name was "pro-headphones," username again

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.120
was "root," root password: the

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.960
"localhost" and the table prefix I'm going to leave as default.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.500
Then run the installation.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.700
The site title is of course,

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:54.045
"Pro Headphones," the username:

00:02:54.045 --> 00:03:00.300
"proheadphones-admin" or your username of choice.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.065
Of course, just for demonstration purposes,

00:03:03.065 --> 00:03:06.450
I'm just going to call this "proheadphones."

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.080
Confirm you use a weak password; that's fine,

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.310
just for this demonstration,

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:24.730
and set an e-mail, and then install, and then login.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:38.715
I'm going to check "remember me," and then click "login." We're good to go.

00:03:38.715 --> 00:03:43.425
So that's a database and also WordPress installed.

00:03:43.425 --> 00:03:47.805
Good. Make sure you get to the stage where it's all working before we move on.

00:03:47.805 --> 00:03:50.470
I'll see you in the next video.
