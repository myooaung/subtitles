00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.750
Earlier when looking at the customizer,

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.570
we added a different color to our background.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.850
This is the color which surrounds all of these darker content in the middle.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.429
We did this over in the customizer,

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:21.585
the dashboard, into the appearance and customize.

00:00:21.585 --> 00:00:25.440
On the global options, we had a background option just here,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.095
and this is where we set this background color.

00:00:28.095 --> 00:00:32.070
Another thing we mentioned was we could also change the background image.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.530
We can select any image which we would like to place in

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.560
the background or even a background texture.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.510
Supplied with the images for this of course is a gray texture color,

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.425
which I'm going to apply to this background.

00:00:44.425 --> 00:00:49.640
We can see straight away that this texture has applied all around our project.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.610
We have various presets where we can repeat the image,

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:53.975
we can fill the screen,

00:00:53.975 --> 00:00:56.000
but we can currently see our image is already

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.660
filling the screen because this is repeated.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.390
Even though the supplied texture is just a small square,

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.075
if we uncheck the Repeat Background Image,

00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:08.755
we can see we just have this small square up in the corner.

00:01:08.755 --> 00:01:11.900
This is placed in the corner because of the image position.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.420
I never had a different image which you wanted to

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.540
place in any particular corner or even the center.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.480
We could change the location with these buttons.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.765
The size of the image can also be updated too.

00:01:23.765 --> 00:01:26.000
Another feature we have down at the bottom is

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.815
the ability to scroll the background image with the page.

00:01:29.815 --> 00:01:32.290
What this means is if this is checked,

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.770
and if we scroll down,

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.790
we can see the background image is pushed up with the rest of the content.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.980
If this, however, is unchecked just like this,

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.150
the background-position stays in a fixed location.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.150
I will not scroll with the rest of the content. I prefer it the other way.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.510
I'm going to click on the Scroll with Page and

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.355
also repeat this so it covers the full background image.

00:01:54.355 --> 00:01:59.375
Many of these options are not really useful when using a small texture just like this.

00:01:59.375 --> 00:02:02.375
Just repeating this is usually fine for our purposes.

00:02:02.375 --> 00:02:04.685
However, though, if you are using a different image,

00:02:04.685 --> 00:02:07.330
a lot of these options will be much more useful.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.145
Click on "Publish" to save our changes,

00:02:10.145 --> 00:02:15.720
refresh the browser, and the changes have now taken effect.
