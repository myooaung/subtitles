00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.125
For this upcoming section, we're going to take a brief look

00:00:04.125 --> 00:00:07.080
at some PHP basics and how we can write

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.230
some code which is got to help us in the upcoming sections where we're

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.265
going to begin to create our own custom WordPress themes.

00:00:14.265 --> 00:00:17.115
Now, we don't need to be a PHP expert,

00:00:17.115 --> 00:00:19.620
all we need to do is to have some basic understanding.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.680
This will really help us to understand what is going on behind

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.675
the scenes and how we can apply PHP code to our WordPress sites.

00:00:27.675 --> 00:00:29.850
Remember, in the course early on,

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.470
we mentioned that WordPress is wrote in the PHP programming language.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.450
As we've already seen, if we just want to use pre-built themes and pre-built plugins,

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.015
we don't need to know any PHP code.

00:00:42.015 --> 00:00:44.100
But we're now going to learn some of the basics which is

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.615
going to help us with our theme development.

00:00:46.615 --> 00:00:50.660
PHP is a language which runs on a web server.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.790
So Just like early on when we set

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.515
our WordPress which also requires a web server because of this.

00:00:56.515 --> 00:00:58.815
We also had two different option videos.

00:00:58.815 --> 00:01:01.845
We had option one, which uses local,

00:01:01.845 --> 00:01:07.985
and local sets up a web server and a database that allow us to build our WordPress sites.

00:01:07.985 --> 00:01:11.420
Now, local is really great for hosting WordPress sites,

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.700
but it's not so great at just letting us play around with some regular PHP.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.510
For this upcoming section,

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.730
we have a couple of different options.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.460
Early in the course, as an alternative to local,

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.350
we also looked at how we could set up a WordPress site using MAMP.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.470
If you have come with this option,

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.055
you can go into the htdocs where you will have also installed your WordPress sites.

00:01:34.055 --> 00:01:37.205
You can go ahead and create the PHP files in here,

00:01:37.205 --> 00:01:39.910
just like we did with the upcoming videos.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.860
Or alternatively, if you were not using MAMP,

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.800
if you have continued with this course using local,

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.570
you can use an alternative which is an online playground.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.380
This is one of them, which is T-E-H and then playground.com.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.365
This is a quick and easy way to write

00:01:56.365 --> 00:02:00.755
our PHP code and see the result over on the right-hand side.

00:02:00.755 --> 00:02:03.840
In the upcoming videos, we'll we write our PHP code,

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.415
which will start just like we have done here.

00:02:06.415 --> 00:02:08.845
Instead of writing it inside of the text editor,

00:02:08.845 --> 00:02:12.830
like we do in the videos, you can instead write the code in here.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.340
We'll be doing something like this.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.190
We'll be setting up variables so we could store our name,

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.740
such as Chris, and we'll echo this name.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.580
Don't worry if this doesn't look familiar,

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.565
we are going to be covering exactly what this does in the upcoming videos.

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:30.970
Once we've wrote our PHP code,

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.890
just like we do in the videos, click "Save and Run".

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.830
Then we'll see the outputs over on

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.870
the right-hand side instead of what we do in the videos,

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.590
which is to run this inside of the browser.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.150
Just to recap, for this upcoming section,

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.620
we need to run a webserver to run our PHP code.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.080
If you've been following along,

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.140
so far we had using local.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.130
The two options which you have to continue is to either install MAMP or

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.485
you could use a online PHP playground just like we see here.

00:02:59.485 --> 00:03:01.640
Alternatively, early on the course,

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.515
if you chose the MAMP option,

00:03:03.515 --> 00:03:06.470
you can also continue using this if you prefer.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:12.030
Let's jump into the next video where we'll take a look at our first PHP code.
