00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.615
So far in our WordPress version of the website,

00:00:03.615 --> 00:00:09.090
we've got the footer area and also the header area, pretty much completed.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.960
In this video, we're going to continue working with the front page by

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.265
creating a new page template called the front page.php.

00:00:17.265 --> 00:00:20.280
If we go over to our underscores template,

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.595
you can see there's various different page templates,

00:00:23.595 --> 00:00:27.795
such as the page.php.

00:00:27.795 --> 00:00:30.750
If you take a look at a topic and see that this is

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.785
the template that displays all pages by default.

00:00:34.785 --> 00:00:37.535
This will be the page template which is used

00:00:37.535 --> 00:00:41.620
unless a more specific page template is created.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.950
Let's take a little bit more of a look at WordPress page templates.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:55.410
Head over to Google and just going to do a quick search for codex templates hierarchy.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.090
What we need is the Theme Developer Handbook.

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.015
Once we're in the template hierarchy section,

00:01:08.015 --> 00:01:11.810
we can see that this explains all the different page templates.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.165
It shows us which template controls which individual page.

00:01:17.165 --> 00:01:20.750
First of all, we've got the visual overview,

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.090
which you can click on and see how the templates are arranged.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.200
If you scroll further down,

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.840
we can begin with the homepage display.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.835
We've looked at so far and it's caused

00:01:31.835 --> 00:01:37.900
the WordPress blog posts by default displayed on the home page.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.540
These are controlled by either the home.php template.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.385
If this doesn't exist,

00:01:44.385 --> 00:01:48.300
WordPress then looks for the index.php.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.870
We'll go on to using the index page,

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.525
the blog later on in this section.

00:01:53.525 --> 00:01:59.135
In this video, we're going to focus on the front-page.php template.

00:01:59.135 --> 00:02:04.930
This is the template file used to render the websites from page.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.005
You can see below the priority of page templates.

00:02:09.005 --> 00:02:12.485
The main one is from page.php.

00:02:12.485 --> 00:02:14.130
If this doesn't exist,

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.065
WordPress looks for the home page template and then if that doesn't exist,

00:02:19.065 --> 00:02:22.750
it uses the default page.php,

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.030
which we looked at before in a template.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.735
Then lastly, if no other page can be found,

00:02:29.735 --> 00:02:33.580
it uses the index.php template.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.250
Of course, feel free to scroll further down and

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.489
take a look at more information about the single pages,

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.540
single posts, and also how we can create

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.190
different page templates for different categories and tags.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.025
But I'm going to get to work with the front page.php,

00:02:54.025 --> 00:02:58.420
head over to the WordPress theme.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:06.700
I'm going to create a new file inside this one's going to be called fronts-page.php.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:17.350
To begin, I'm going to copy all of the contents from the page.php,

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:24.230
select all and copy and paste this into our front page.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.590
We don't need the comments at the top because this is

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.875
the default page template for displaying the front page.

00:03:33.875 --> 00:03:37.660
Will also going to be including our own html from

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:44.545
the static website deletes all of the html from the medulla.

00:03:44.545 --> 00:03:49.120
You can also delete the sidebar and save that.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.740
This is because our Finnish version doesn't have a sidebar on the front page.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.810
Now we need to go over to

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.145
the WordPress Dashboard and we need to actually create a new page,

00:04:01.145 --> 00:04:04.700
go to "New" and then "Page."

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.235
This is going to be a page where we can link

00:04:07.235 --> 00:04:11.550
our front page template to. Let's call this home.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.740
All we need to do is hit publish,

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.815
and then go over to the settings,

00:04:18.815 --> 00:04:21.055
down to the reading tab.

00:04:21.055 --> 00:04:25.715
We need to change our front page to display a static page.

00:04:25.715 --> 00:04:29.910
The one we need to display is home,

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:36.600
and then save that, so let's visit the site.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:48.425
Now this is the front page and all we've got is the heavy section on the photo section.

00:04:48.425 --> 00:04:51.455
This is because in our front page template,

00:04:51.455 --> 00:04:55.150
we've only got the header and the footer function.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.590
Now we can drop the main page content from our static website.

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:08.300
Go over to the Pro headphones and then the index.html.

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.950
We've already included all of the header section.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.070
We've already included the feature section.

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.760
I've got little bit further down when it copy the main content.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.210
Everything from the section with the ID of range,

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:33.900
all the way down to the footer area, copy that.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.800
Then go back to our WordPress version,

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.775
and then paste this in just below the header,

00:05:41.775 --> 00:05:45.790
and then save that, let's take a look.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.590
Now there's our content section in between,

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.680
the only thing really missing is the images.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.370
Now let's correct the image file paths,

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.095
just like we do in the header.php.

00:06:02.095 --> 00:06:05.055
I'm going to copy all the php function,

00:06:05.055 --> 00:06:10.710
grab everything between the image source between the quotations,

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:21.150
copy all that, and then back to the front page and then we need to find the free images.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.745
The first one is in the images folder,

00:06:23.745 --> 00:06:26.610
and it's called 1.jpg.

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:31.500
Let's just delete that and then paste in

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.915
the WordPress function and then images folder needs to be changed to you.

00:06:35.915 --> 00:06:42.310
Number 1, 1.jpg so change that.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.830
Then do the same for the second image.

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:50.780
Delete the image source based in the WordPress function.

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:56.430
Then just change the name to be number 2.jpg.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:00.360
Then scroll down to image number 3.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.465
Advice to any changes to

00:07:02.465 --> 00:07:11.930
image number 3.jpg,

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:13.390
and save that.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:16.150
Let's give that a refresh.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:22.130
That's looking pretty good, let's take a little look up and down.

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:27.510
It should look exactly the same as our Finnish version.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.890
Yes, everything looks good on them.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.880
We'll hope that went well for you and we're done for finishing the from page,

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:43.620
and next we're going to move on to convert in the menu to be integrated with WordPress.
