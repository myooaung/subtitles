00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.605
So earlier on the course when we create the t-shirt Store.

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:08.295
We created a child theme of the storefront theme.

00:00:08.295 --> 00:00:10.260
So when we create a child theme,

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.550
we created it manually,

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.650
by creating the new theme folder.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.630
We added things such as the functions file and also the custom style sheet.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.505
So in this video, we just want to show you

00:00:20.505 --> 00:00:25.905
a quick and easy alternative to creating child themes by using a plug-in.

00:00:25.905 --> 00:00:29.385
If we go over to the dashboard,

00:00:29.385 --> 00:00:34.150
and then go down to plugins, and then add new.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.930
I'm just going to do a search for child themes.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.080
There's various different plugins which we can select.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.760
But for this course, I'm just going to use the easy child theme creator and click install

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:58.450
now, and then activate.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.780
So like we had many other plugins,

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.405
we got an option in the dashboard.

00:01:09.405 --> 00:01:13.345
So what we need to do is go to easy, child theme creator.

00:01:13.345 --> 00:01:16.580
Select up and create a child theme,

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.620
just click on the create child theme tab.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.850
All we need to do is,

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.330
first of all, select a parent theme.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.205
The parent theme that we want can be any of the installed themes,

00:01:30.205 --> 00:01:32.665
such as the storefront theme.

00:01:32.665 --> 00:01:34.780
We can give it a title,

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.845
such as storefront child two.

00:01:38.845 --> 00:01:43.690
I'm just going to leave the theme details as they are and click create.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.610
So that's it, child theme created successfully.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.550
If we go to the appearance,

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.335
and then themes, I'll let you check that's being installed.

00:01:55.335 --> 00:02:01.120
There's our store front child two that we just created, hit activate.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.960
Then let's visit the site and see how it looks.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.470
There's our child theme of the storefront.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.210
Now can go about customization in the usual way,

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.440
without affecting any of the functionality of the parent theme when we update.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.184
If we go into the customizer,

00:02:26.184 --> 00:02:29.635
we can just double-check that we're working with the right child theme.

00:02:29.635 --> 00:02:32.350
If we look at the active theme section,

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.670
we can go ahead and change any of the details like we have done previously.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.550
So that's a quick and easy alternative to creating child themes.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.040
Thank you for watching, and I'll see you in the next video.
