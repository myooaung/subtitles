00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.725
As we've discovered in the previous video,

00:00:07.725 --> 00:00:09.390
each time we add a new page,

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.230
it is automatically added to our menu and also,

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.600
this menu is already been created for us.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.285
We haven't done anything to create it ourselves.

00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:23.685
This particular menu has been added when we created the sample data in the early videos.

00:00:23.685 --> 00:00:27.060
But of course, we don't want to rely on the sample menus.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.505
We want to know how to create our own.

00:00:29.505 --> 00:00:31.550
As with everything else in WordPress,

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.784
we need to go over to the dashboard,

00:00:33.784 --> 00:00:35.840
and then into the main options.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.405
To create or manage our new menus,

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:40.060
we need to go to appearance.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.005
This has a dedicated menu's link.

00:00:43.005 --> 00:00:45.830
At the top, we have a drop-down menu with all of

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.080
the available menus which are being provided with the sample data.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.110
Currently we have all pages selected and at the moment we see we have

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.340
some errors inside of this menu and these have all been changed to this pink color,

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.260
so we know there is an error.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.340
Each one of these pink blocks is going to be a menu link.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.430
We have a blog page,

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.660
we have the front page,

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.120
we have the about the tests and these all are

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.645
sub pages which are nested just below this page too.

00:01:11.645 --> 00:01:14.510
The reason why we see these errors is because we have

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.025
removed all of the unused pages from our site.

00:01:18.025 --> 00:01:20.810
This is just WordPress's way of warning us that we

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.995
no longer have access to any of these pages.

00:01:23.995 --> 00:01:27.350
We could go ahead and remove any one of

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.545
these links or could also remove the full menu too.

00:01:31.545 --> 00:01:35.375
Same for any of these existing menus, we can select them.

00:01:35.375 --> 00:01:40.355
We can go to "Select." Then we can also remove any of these unused menus.

00:01:40.355 --> 00:01:42.890
But at the moment, I'm just going to go ahead and create

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.195
our new menu with this link just here.

00:01:46.195 --> 00:01:49.370
This menu is going to replace our one at the very top.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.560
I'm going to give this a title of top navigation.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.870
Create our menu and then we can select some options from the settings just below.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.195
The first option is to automatically add new top-level pages to this menu.

00:02:05.195 --> 00:02:07.130
This means just like in the previous video,

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.455
that each time when we create a new page,

00:02:09.455 --> 00:02:12.530
this will be automatically be added to our menu.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.630
This theme already comes with three different locations where we can place our menu.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.815
This is going to be the primary menu. Let's click on this.

00:02:20.815 --> 00:02:22.670
We could save this and check it out,

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.675
but we don't have any pages to display in our theme just yet.

00:02:26.675 --> 00:02:28.570
What we need to do is to go to add

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.245
menu items and then we can select what content we want to place in this menu.

00:02:33.245 --> 00:02:36.140
Under the Pages tab, I'm going to select all,

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.120
add this to our menu,

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.865
and now we have our three menu links.

00:02:40.865 --> 00:02:44.390
We can also choose various blog posts which you want to add.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.975
We can also create custom links to go to external websites.

00:02:47.975 --> 00:02:50.690
For this, we just add a URL which you want to link to,

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.395
and then some texts which you want to display for our menu link.

00:02:54.395 --> 00:02:57.170
Finally, we also have categories where we can select

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.935
different categories where we want to provide a direct link to.

00:03:00.935 --> 00:03:04.510
But for now, all three pages are fine so let's save this menu.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.765
It's all sized and refresh.

00:03:06.765 --> 00:03:09.170
There's our three links in place.

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.795
We could leave this structured exactly how it is.

00:03:11.795 --> 00:03:14.210
Or if you want to have a sub-menu just like we've seen

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.190
before where the contact is placed underneath the About Us link,

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.710
we need to go back to our pages and then the child link,

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.315
we need to click on, move this over to the right.

00:03:25.315 --> 00:03:29.285
Pop this in place and this is now classed as a sub item.

00:03:29.285 --> 00:03:32.420
If we want this again to be moved to the top level of our menu,

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.145
we could either drag this back over,

00:03:34.145 --> 00:03:38.780
or go into our item and click on the Out from under About Us link.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.925
Save this, reload.

00:03:42.925 --> 00:03:46.070
I want to hover with drop down menu in place.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.530
Let's also go ahead and add one more menu,

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.635
which is going to place down inside of the footer area.

00:03:51.635 --> 00:03:55.685
This will be placed alongside our text over on the right-hand side,

00:03:55.685 --> 00:03:57.875
into our menu's option.

00:03:57.875 --> 00:04:02.570
We could either create a new menu and place this into the footer area or instead,

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.430
if we go to manage locations,

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.380
we can reassign different menus to different locations.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.385
The footer menu, let's go for the preexisting social menu.

00:04:13.385 --> 00:04:15.430
Save our changes.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.405
Now if we refresh,

00:04:17.405 --> 00:04:20.900
we see our social media links are placed down at the bottom.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.185
If we want to rearrange the order of each one of these links,

00:04:24.185 --> 00:04:27.175
you just need to select the menu which you want to edit.

00:04:27.175 --> 00:04:29.360
For example, the social menu.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.365
Select this and then we can reorder each one of our links.

00:04:33.365 --> 00:04:36.590
Also, if we want to amend this in a more visual way,

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.565
we can also go into the themes customizer,

00:04:39.565 --> 00:04:41.970
I select new customized link,

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.570
and the customizer will give us a visual preview

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.195
of all the changes which we made to our site.

00:04:47.195 --> 00:04:50.180
It has a menu section where we can access

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.225
all the locations and all of the existing menus.

00:04:53.225 --> 00:04:55.970
For example, the social menu, we can click on this.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.770
We can also amend our links and these all change in real time.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.485
If we change one of the labels and then go down to the bottom,

00:05:03.485 --> 00:05:06.665
we can see this has been previewed inside the browser.

00:05:06.665 --> 00:05:08.540
This is how we can add menus,

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:09.980
how we can delete menus,

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.240
also how we can edit,

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.220
and rearrange them and in

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.745
the upcoming section we're going to get a lot more familiar with this customizer.

00:05:16.745 --> 00:05:22.620
I got for you lots of the available customizing options to make this theme more personal.
