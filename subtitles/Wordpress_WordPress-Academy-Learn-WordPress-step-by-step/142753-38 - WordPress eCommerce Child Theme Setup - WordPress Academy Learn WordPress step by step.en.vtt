00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:05.160
We now know what a child theme is,

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.575
and what the benefits are of setting one up.

00:00:07.575 --> 00:00:11.870
For this project, I'm going to create one for the storefront e-commerce store.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.555
Before we go about making any changes to this parent theme,

00:00:15.555 --> 00:00:17.760
setting one up is pretty straightforward.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.940
The first thing we need to do is to go over to our project folder,

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.175
so I'm going to open up Local,

00:00:23.175 --> 00:00:25.800
and then find the location of our folder.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.680
We can click on this "Shortcut" button just here,

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.860
and then into the app, into the public,

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.610
the content, and then into our themes directory.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.745
Here, we can see our storefront which we downloaded alongside

00:00:38.745 --> 00:00:42.720
the default themes which we downloaded when we set up WordPress.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.675
If you are using MAMP, go into the htdocs,

00:00:45.675 --> 00:00:49.165
and follow the same steps to get to the themes directory.

00:00:49.165 --> 00:00:51.560
We're going to create a new theme,

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.515
and we're going to do this inside of a text editor.

00:00:54.515 --> 00:00:57.530
You don't need to know any coding to get started with this.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.530
All we need to do is follow a few simple steps.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.990
First of all, we'll create a new folder which is the new theme folder for our project.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.830
We can call this any name which we want. Give this descriptive.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.485
I'm going to call it the storefront-child,

00:01:12.485 --> 00:01:16.465
so we can easily recognize this inside the dashboard.

00:01:16.465 --> 00:01:19.910
You can use any text editor which you want to edit this.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.050
I'm going to use a coding editor called Visual Studio Code.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.900
You can download it from the link on the screen just here.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.855
It's free to use on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

00:01:29.855 --> 00:01:33.220
I'm going to use it to create our required files for this child theme.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.900
If you don't have a text editor, pause this video,

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.970
and go ahead and download from this link,

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.435
and then come back when this is set up.

00:01:40.435 --> 00:01:45.560
I already have this installed, so I'm going to open this up inside of a new window.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.815
All we need to do to get started is to drag over our project folder.

00:01:50.815 --> 00:01:54.710
We can see from the dashboard that this opens this up in the sidebar,

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.280
and then we need to create two new files.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.160
The first file which we need to create,

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.585
if we hover over the sidebar,

00:02:00.585 --> 00:02:02.940
we can click on this "New File" icon,

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.010
or we can go to File and select a "New File" from here.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.940
This one will be called the style.css.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.355
CSS is a way to add any styling and layout to your website.

00:02:15.355 --> 00:02:18.525
We won't be adding any custom CSS to this project,

00:02:18.525 --> 00:02:21.470
but what we need to do inside of this style.css

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.115
file is to add some required WordPress information.

00:02:25.115 --> 00:02:29.110
This information contains some settings which we need for our theme.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.075
To do this, let's go over to the browser,

00:02:33.075 --> 00:02:35.850
and head into this link up at the top.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:42.260
We need to go into developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.665
and then into the child theme section.

00:02:44.665 --> 00:02:48.110
From here, we see the information which we've seen in the previous video.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.000
Then if we scroll down a little bit further,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.520
we'll see how to create a child theme.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.220
The first step is create child theme folder,

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.350
which we've already done so we can skip this,

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.425
and go down to Step 2.

00:02:59.425 --> 00:03:02.790
Step 2, we've already created our style.css,

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.375
and then we'll see a sample of this declaration which we need to add into this file.

00:03:07.375 --> 00:03:09.915
After this, we'll "Command or Control C".

00:03:09.915 --> 00:03:12.740
Just before we paste this into our text editor,

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.305
we see that the following information is required,

00:03:15.305 --> 00:03:16.715
such as the theme name,

00:03:16.715 --> 00:03:18.485
which we're going to add at the top.

00:03:18.485 --> 00:03:20.530
Then also a template.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.800
This template section is really important.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.715
This will point to our parent theme which we want to inherit all the information from.

00:03:27.715 --> 00:03:30.870
Back over to Visual Studio Code,

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.430
paste this in at the top.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.780
Step 1, we'll change the theme name.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.430
This is any name of our choice.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.650
We can also add a theme URI,

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.005
which is the location of the theme's website, if we did have one.

00:03:47.005 --> 00:03:49.710
We don't have one, so I'm going to leave this empty.

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.830
The description of storefront child theme.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.390
The author, place in your name.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.740
You can add your website if you would like,

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.980
followed by this important template just here.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.560
This is going to inherit all of the functionality from the storefront theme,

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.270
so make sure this is correct.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.275
We can also add a version number for our theme if we want to, and a license.

00:04:18.275 --> 00:04:20.885
Then at the bottom, we see some sample tags.

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:24.470
These tags includes any features which are available with this theme,

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.750
such as if you have any light and dark modes,

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.250
if it's a two-column layout,

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.185
if it includes any sidebars,

00:04:30.185 --> 00:04:33.050
if it's a responsive layout, if it's accessibility-ready.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.550
Since this one is just a demo,

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.325
I'm going to remove all of these sample tags.

00:04:37.325 --> 00:04:40.190
If you want to add your own tags into this theme,

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.590
we can head over to this URL just here.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.505
We could see all of the available theme tags.

00:04:45.505 --> 00:04:48.500
We can just go ahead and create any tags which we want to.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.425
We have to use a selection of the tags from this page.

00:04:51.425 --> 00:04:53.270
For example, the theme subject,

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.385
we can select a maximum of three of these,

00:04:55.385 --> 00:04:57.695
such as if this is an e-commerce store,

00:04:57.695 --> 00:04:59.675
if it's a food and drink store,

00:04:59.675 --> 00:05:01.240
if it's a portfolio.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.505
Then scrolling down, we have lots of other sections.

00:05:04.505 --> 00:05:07.110
If we have a certain layout, which is a grid;

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.930
if we have a number of columns,

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.270
if you have sidebars on the left and right.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.810
We can place any of these tags to let the user know exactly what

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.545
layout options is included with our theme. The features.

00:05:18.545 --> 00:05:21.410
Many of these features, you will already know from the customizer,

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:22.970
such as custom colors,

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.830
custom backgrounds and headers,

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.095
custom menus, if it supports featured images.

00:05:28.095 --> 00:05:31.765
We can add as many of these into our theme as we would like.

00:05:31.765 --> 00:05:34.835
If this theme is just for your own personal use,

00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:37.325
the tags really don't matter that much,

00:05:37.325 --> 00:05:38.795
but when they do matter,

00:05:38.795 --> 00:05:45.479
is if you plan to publish this to the theme directory over on the wordpress.org websites,

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:47.330
into the theme section.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.005
If we go into the detail of any one of these themes,

00:05:51.005 --> 00:05:54.380
this is the location where all of the tags will be displayed.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.985
This is where the user can tell exactly what features is included with your theme.

00:05:58.985 --> 00:06:01.010
Back over to Visual Studio Code,

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.585
and the last thing we need to take care of is this text domain.

00:06:04.585 --> 00:06:07.305
The text domain is an important feature.

00:06:07.305 --> 00:06:09.985
It's a unique identifier for our theme,

00:06:09.985 --> 00:06:13.280
and it's also used for translating our theme too.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.500
This must also Match the folder name for our project,

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.570
so we need to change this to be storefront-child,

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.560
and then give this file a save.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.795
The next file which we need to add inside of our sidebar, click on the "New File".

00:06:26.795 --> 00:06:32.040
This is the functions.php.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.880
We're not going to add anything inside of this file at the moment.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.860
This is a file which contains all of

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.300
the custom functionality which we want to code into the theme ourselves.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.680
The PHP extension just means that this file

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.215
will be wrote in the PHP programming language.

00:06:46.215 --> 00:06:48.805
We'll take a look at what this is later on.

00:06:48.805 --> 00:06:53.975
The final thing which we need to add into this child theme is a custom theme image.

00:06:53.975 --> 00:06:58.655
Provided with this course is some images which we can use for this project.

00:06:58.655 --> 00:07:02.195
One of them is the screenshot.png.

00:07:02.195 --> 00:07:05.420
It also includes a site icon which we can use in the browser,

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.360
and also a couple of different images which we'll use in

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.620
the e-commerce slider as we go through this section.

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:14.085
To include this in our project,

00:07:14.085 --> 00:07:18.830
what we need to do is to drag over these screenshot into the sidebar.

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:23.455
This will place this alongside our functions and our style.css.

00:07:23.455 --> 00:07:26.940
This is now the bare minimum which we need for our child theme,

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:31.400
so the last thing to do is to actually activate this over in the dashboard,

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.915
so down to the Appearance and the Theme section.

00:07:34.915 --> 00:07:37.845
Here's our storefront child theme, just here.

00:07:37.845 --> 00:07:40.310
We see this name of storefront child,

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:44.240
since this is what we set inside of our style sheet, just here.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.535
Also, we see our image,

00:07:46.535 --> 00:07:51.790
which was the screenshot.png. Let's activate this.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:56.150
Now, over to the frontend of our site and refresh.

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:59.035
We're going to see pretty much the exact same site because we've

00:07:59.035 --> 00:08:02.135
not added any customizations to the theme.

00:08:02.135 --> 00:08:05.060
As you can see, it looks exactly the same as it did with

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:10.420
the storefront theme since it does inherit all of the styling and functionality.

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:15.200
Just to confirm that we are using the child theme rather than the parent,

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.605
we can go over to the style.css.

00:08:17.605 --> 00:08:20.645
We don't need to know any CSS for this to work.

00:08:20.645 --> 00:08:23.420
I'm just going to add in a simple few lines of code,

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.990
just to check this is all activated.

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:28.115
First, we'll select the body section,

00:08:28.115 --> 00:08:30.935
which is the main content of our page.

00:08:30.935 --> 00:08:33.845
Then, in-between the curly braces, just like this,

00:08:33.845 --> 00:08:38.065
we can set the background color to be equal to red.

00:08:38.065 --> 00:08:42.215
Now, if we save this file and refresh the browser,

00:08:42.215 --> 00:08:44.540
this change has now been applied.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.885
Just to confirm that this is only applied to our child theme,

00:08:47.885 --> 00:08:49.130
we can go back to the dashboard,

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:51.305
and activate the parent them.

00:08:51.305 --> 00:08:55.790
Refresh. This is now only applied to this child theme.

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:57.490
Since we now know this is working,

00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:59.635
we can remove this body section,

00:08:59.635 --> 00:09:03.165
and then reactivate the child theme.

00:09:03.165 --> 00:09:06.470
We can now safely make changes to this child theme.

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:08.980
Know it's not going to affect the parent.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:10.680
This is now all set up,

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.175
and we can now move on with the rest of our project,

00:09:13.175 --> 00:09:15.875
but just one quick side before we move on.

00:09:15.875 --> 00:09:18.305
Back over in the child theme section,

00:09:18.305 --> 00:09:20.390
there is also a Step 3,

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:23.215
and this is to enqueue a style sheet.

00:09:23.215 --> 00:09:25.310
Inside of our child theme,

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:27.890
we've created the style.css.

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:30.095
Since this is a required file,

00:09:30.095 --> 00:09:33.290
our storefront parent also has one of this too,

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:37.610
so Step 3 is a way to load up this style sheet from the parent.

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:41.390
This is something which we generally need to do when creating a child theme.

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:46.885
We have some functions just here which we can paste it into our functions.php.

00:09:46.885 --> 00:09:49.170
However, when using the storefront theme,

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:52.605
this is something which will automatically takes care of for us.

00:09:52.605 --> 00:09:54.270
You don't need to head into this link.

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:57.340
I just want to show you that this is already been loaded for us,

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.540
so we can leave this out of our theme.

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.475
We can see here we don't need to add this enqueue function

00:10:02.475 --> 00:10:05.850
since this storefront theme has already done this for us.

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:08.595
This now leaves our child theme all set up,

00:10:08.595 --> 00:10:12.540
so we can now move on with the rest of the project.
