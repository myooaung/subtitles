00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.850
Welcome back guys. In this video,

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.190
we're going to be setting up our index page to display our latest blog posts.

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:12.945
We're going to convert our blog in two stages.

00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:17.190
This video will focus on bringing over the pages containers,

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.470
the CSS classes, and general page layout from our static site,

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.140
which is the blog.html.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.400
If we go down to the blog section,

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.695
and then locate the blog post,

00:00:34.695 --> 00:00:39.660
we're basically going to be copying everything surrounding these blog posts,

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.960
such as the containers and the rows.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.005
In the next video we'll be concentrating on the individual blog posts.

00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:53.475
I'm placing these inside a file called Content.php.

00:00:53.475 --> 00:00:56.730
Let's begin in the WordPress dashboard.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.625
We're creating a new page.

00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:03.225
This is going to be our blog page.

00:01:03.225 --> 00:01:07.990
Let's call this a Blog and then publish.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.895
Then we need to set this page to display our blog posts.

00:01:13.895 --> 00:01:19.590
So go to Settings, and then Reading.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.970
Then the Posts Page,

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.860
select the blog. Then save that.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.245
Now when we visit the site,

00:01:36.245 --> 00:01:41.450
the blog page has been automatically added to the menu, which is good.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.225
Because this is now a WordPress menu,

00:01:44.225 --> 00:01:46.130
if we click on the link,

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.970
we should be taken to the page which displays the blog posts,

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.020
which we do and there's our Hello world blog post.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.845
As we already know, the page template,

00:01:58.845 --> 00:02:03.885
which controls the blog is the index.php.

00:02:03.885 --> 00:02:10.710
Go over to the theme folder and locate the index.php.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:18.460
Scrolling down, we can see that there's a PHP while loop.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.135
If you remember from the while loops video,

00:02:22.135 --> 00:02:25.730
a while loop will always run while a condition is true.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.664
In the case of WordPress,

00:02:27.664 --> 00:02:31.195
while is blog posts available.

00:02:31.195 --> 00:02:35.035
We can then display the blog posts on the web page,

00:02:35.035 --> 00:02:38.285
which is included in the content file.

00:02:38.285 --> 00:02:44.100
Everything that we'll put in-between this while loop we will run for each blog post.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.010
We'll work with the loop and individual blog posts in the next video.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.700
For now, we just want to set the page up to

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.150
the same containers and the same divs as the static site.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.955
Basically, we're going to copy over everything surrounding the blog posts.

00:03:00.955 --> 00:03:09.770
Go over to our static site on the desktop and then go into the blog.html.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.370
First of all, let's open this up in the browser and take a look.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.300
Just below the header section,

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.850
we've got a callout section which is welcome to our blog.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.055
Let's copy this over to the main site.

00:03:27.055 --> 00:03:31.730
Go into the blog.html.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:40.165
Copy this callout section and all the way down to the div with the class of medium eight.

00:03:40.165 --> 00:03:43.255
Basically, all the way to the blog post.

00:03:43.255 --> 00:03:48.710
Copy that back over to our theme.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.065
Because this is just below the header section.

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:56.215
The callout is just below the header image on the finished website.

00:03:56.215 --> 00:04:00.380
We need to paste this, just below the header section.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.940
Paste and save.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.560
I'll just clean this up a little.

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:17.840
Then back over to the static site into the blog. Then scroll back down.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.725
The areas that we just copied is the row and the div with the class of medium eight.

00:04:23.725 --> 00:04:27.700
Click on the div class row and then scroll down

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.045
to locate the closing div, which is just here.

00:04:32.045 --> 00:04:36.295
It's the last closing div tag just after the sidebar.

00:04:36.295 --> 00:04:43.160
I'm going to copy this and go all the way up, including the sidebar.

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.860
Copy that. Make sure you got the full area,

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.010
including all the sidebar and the closing div,

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.665
just above the medium free section.

00:04:53.665 --> 00:04:58.340
So copy and then back over to the theme,

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.570
scroll right down to the bottom,

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:09.795
and then paste this in just after the primary section, and then save that.

00:05:09.795 --> 00:05:14.880
We've copied the content from before and after the blog posts to keep

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.570
our page containers and the CSS classes exactly the same as our static site.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.440
The only difference is we replaced

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:29.380
the HTML blog posts with this WordPress loop, which is just here.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.345
This means that WordPress can generate the blog posts,

00:05:34.345 --> 00:05:37.280
which we can create inside the dashboard.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.045
Save that page and then go back to the site,

00:05:42.045 --> 00:05:45.250
and then click on the blog.

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.065
The blog post will begin working with in the next video.

00:05:52.065 --> 00:05:55.445
We've got our sidebar down the right-hand side,

00:05:55.445 --> 00:05:57.815
which is one that we just copied over.

00:05:57.815 --> 00:06:02.640
We've also got a second sidebar, which is down the bottom.

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.080
It's being pulled in from our index page.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.900
From down the bottom, we'd get sidebar.

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:14.030
We'll tidy up the side bars in a few videos time,

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.070
but for now let's move on to setting up

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.940
the individual blog posts in the content.php file.
