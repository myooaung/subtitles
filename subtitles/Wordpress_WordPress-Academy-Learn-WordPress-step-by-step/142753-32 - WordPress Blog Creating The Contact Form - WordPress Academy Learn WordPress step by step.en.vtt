00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:07.470
Hey, welcome back. Early on when we created our pages up at the top,

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.450
I'm going to hover the About us page.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.570
This will then reveal a Contact us page.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.920
We did say early on that we just put in some sample address lines just

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.185
here and then we're going to come back to this page and add a working contact form.

00:00:22.185 --> 00:00:25.185
Well, this is what we are going to do in this video.

00:00:25.185 --> 00:00:30.090
This will be made available by adding a plugin called Contact Form 7.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.830
This will allow us to add as many different fields as we would like inside here.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.690
This will capture the user's input such as the username, the e-mail address,

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.460
a message, potentially any addresses or telephone numbers,

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.925
and this can all be submitted with this form.

00:00:46.925 --> 00:00:50.240
You guessed it, let's go back over to the Dashboard,

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.860
and from here we'll head into the plugin section.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.180
As you can imagine, there's lots and lots of

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.460
different plugins which can do contact forms,

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.765
but I'm going to use a popular one called Contact Form 7.

00:01:02.765 --> 00:01:06.415
We can add this as a new plugin up at the very top,

00:01:06.415 --> 00:01:09.080
then if you want to maybe available in some of

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.690
the tabs such as a popular one which you see here.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.920
If not, you will need to search for it with the search box up at the top.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.230
This is the particular contact form I'm going to be using,

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.085
so let's install this.

00:01:21.085 --> 00:01:24.140
As we can see, it's been regularly updated and

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.925
also compatible with this current version of WordPress.

00:01:27.925 --> 00:01:35.465
Activate, and this will now give us a dedicated option inside the sidebar.

00:01:35.465 --> 00:01:38.210
Click on this and this will then reveal all of

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.155
the contact forms which we currently have available for our site.

00:01:42.155 --> 00:01:45.830
We just have this one which is being created automatically for us,

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.945
and we can go ahead and add as many different contact forms as we would like.

00:01:49.945 --> 00:01:53.480
We can have a different one for different sections of our site,

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.119
and each one can collect different information.

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:57.410
Instead of editing this one,

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.930
I'm going to add new up at the top and then give this contact form a descriptive name.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.210
I'm going to say Contact Us form,

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.260
then below this, we'll have the layout of our form.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.765
Now, if you don't know any coding and this looks a bit crazy,

00:02:14.765 --> 00:02:16.310
don't worry at the moment.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.655
If we take a closer look at each one of these fields,

00:02:19.655 --> 00:02:22.450
it shouldn't be too difficult to understand.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.240
Each one of these is a different form input.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.150
For example, if we want to collect the user's name, user's e-mail,

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.345
and we have a section for the subject of the e-mail,

00:02:32.345 --> 00:02:36.830
and then we have the message which is going to be sent to the administrator.

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.465
This one, for example,

00:02:38.465 --> 00:02:41.270
like the rest of them is surrounded in the label and

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.040
then the text which is going to appear next to each one of these inputs.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.135
This one is also optional unlike the three above,

00:02:48.135 --> 00:02:51.990
meaning this form can be empty when this is submitted.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.480
Then inside the square brackets,

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.455
we have the type of form input which is currently being used.

00:02:57.455 --> 00:03:00.620
Don't worry about all this since we can generate each one of these

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.090
automatically by using these options up at the top.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.880
For example, if we wanted to create a new text input,

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.985
collect an e-mail address, if we want to gather a telephone number,

00:03:10.985 --> 00:03:13.820
a date, a text area, checkboxes,

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:19.345
or radio buttons, these can all be generated by clicking on these buttons just here.

00:03:19.345 --> 00:03:20.780
Finally, for a form,

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.705
we also need the ability to actually send this.

00:03:23.705 --> 00:03:26.660
When all of the data just above has been entered,

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.210
we then need a button to actually click on,

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.005
and send this back to the site administrator.

00:03:32.005 --> 00:03:35.310
This is what this Submit button does here.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.080
I'm going to leave pretty much all of the defaults just here.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.815
Let's add in one extra field.

00:03:41.815 --> 00:03:44.780
This field is going to be a checkbox where we

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.190
can ask the user how they heard about our site.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.310
So I'll click on the checkbox and then all of the options which we add inside

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.705
here will then result in a generated form input like we already have.

00:03:58.705 --> 00:04:01.480
First, we want to know if this is a required field,

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.500
so the user must enter a value inside here before the form can be submitted.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.365
The name, we can leave this as default.

00:04:09.365 --> 00:04:12.245
This is just a generated unique name.

00:04:12.245 --> 00:04:17.740
For this particular field, we can add multiple options where we add one option per line.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.680
Each name which we're adding inside here will generate a new checkbox.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.785
The first one I'm going to add is for search engine.

00:04:24.785 --> 00:04:28.865
Remember these options do describe how the user heard about our site.

00:04:28.865 --> 00:04:31.710
We can also say a recommendation.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.030
On the next line, we'll say use previously,

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.415
and then the fourth and final one is for other.

00:04:41.415 --> 00:04:44.205
I want to leave all these default settings just below.

00:04:44.205 --> 00:04:49.040
I'm going to also add an optional ID or class attribute to this input.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.220
This is just so we can target this we added some CSS.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.785
If you wanted to apply some additional styling, we don't need to do this,

00:04:56.785 --> 00:04:59.305
all we need to do is to click on "Insert"

00:04:59.305 --> 00:05:03.245
and then we have generated our new checkbox section.

00:05:03.245 --> 00:05:06.820
Save this and then once this is done,

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.415
we then see a shortcode up at the top in between these square brackets.

00:05:11.415 --> 00:05:15.125
This again is a shortcode just like we used in a previous video,

00:05:15.125 --> 00:05:20.615
where we looked to adding the social media icons to any one of our pages or blog posts.

00:05:20.615 --> 00:05:22.700
The same applies to our contact form.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.610
We just need to copy this and then we can go all to

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.910
our pages and insert this into our contact form.

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.690
Pick on this section,

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.870
and I'm going to remove this particular block,

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.085
just below, paste this in as a text block.

00:05:39.085 --> 00:05:42.630
We can then choose which one of our contact forms we want to display.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.585
This is the contact, so this is completely fine.

00:05:45.585 --> 00:05:51.120
Update our page or to the browser and refresh on the Contact Us page,

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.820
I will now see our form has appeared.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.430
We have a name input,

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:56.540
we have an e-mail,

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:57.845
we have the subject,

00:05:57.845 --> 00:06:00.615
and then our custom checkboxes which we added in.

00:06:00.615 --> 00:06:05.735
So the user can say how they heard about us or have the optional message at the bottom,

00:06:05.735 --> 00:06:08.960
and then they can submit this back to the administrator.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.610
Of course, it's a little bit pointless having

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.145
a Contact Us form if the message is optional.

00:06:13.145 --> 00:06:17.110
So we're going to quickly change this back over in the Dashboard.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.990
Back into the Contact section,

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.165
we'll edit our new form.

00:06:21.165 --> 00:06:27.380
All we need to do is to remove this optional text just here and then save this.

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.945
This has now been removed,

00:06:29.945 --> 00:06:32.830
as well as actually creating at the contact form,

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.110
there is also some options which we can change too.

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.420
We have various terms up at the top such as mail.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.860
These is some of the options to change the layout of our e-mails.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.670
If any which is placed inside of

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:48.545
these square brackets is effectively some data which can change.

00:06:48.545 --> 00:06:50.925
So it's a little bit like a variable.

00:06:50.925 --> 00:06:54.235
These are all the sections which WordPress will inject dynamically.

00:06:54.235 --> 00:06:56.934
So when we receive an e-mail from the end-user,

00:06:56.934 --> 00:06:58.630
we see things like the site title,

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:02.545
so we know exactly which one of these sites this e-mail is sent from.

00:07:02.545 --> 00:07:05.770
We will then receive the subjects and this will be pulled

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:09.395
in from the subject field along with all of the other sections,

00:07:09.395 --> 00:07:11.370
we'll also get the user's e-mail,

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.740
which will be pulled in from the e-mail field and we can then construct

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:18.670
the message body down at the bottom or change this around if we wanted to.

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:22.270
I'm not going to make any changes to this since it's well laid out.

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:24.805
We have the From field with the name and e-mail.

00:07:24.805 --> 00:07:30.245
We have the subject in the correct field and then the message inside of the body section.

00:07:30.245 --> 00:07:34.480
Once we're happy with this, we can also go to the Messages tab and from here we

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:38.675
can amend all of the default messages which are sent to the user.

00:07:38.675 --> 00:07:42.775
For example, when the user has successfully posted the message on our site,

00:07:42.775 --> 00:07:45.095
it will then see this message just here.

00:07:45.095 --> 00:07:47.250
We see message sending failures,

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:48.955
we see validation errors.

00:07:48.955 --> 00:07:51.025
This is when a particular field hasn't been

00:07:51.025 --> 00:07:54.800
entered or the incorrect data type has been used.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:59.110
For example, if we have a number field and somebody tries to enter some text,

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:01.370
this would cause a validation error.

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:05.750
We also see things like the maximum and minimum length of the input,

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:10.630
which is allowed, and lots more other options to change all of the default text.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:13.670
Finally, we have the additional settings where we can go over to

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:18.140
the contact form website and pull in any additional options if we want to.

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:21.850
I want to leave this as this is and save our contact form,

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:26.105
but this is a really useful plugin for collecting information on our site.

00:08:26.105 --> 00:08:27.500
Remember, you can create

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:32.400
multiple Contact us forms and place these in different sections too.
