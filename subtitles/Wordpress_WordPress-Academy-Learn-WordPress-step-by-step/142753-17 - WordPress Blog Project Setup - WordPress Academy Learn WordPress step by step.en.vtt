00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:09.370
Let's get going with our next project which is going to be a WordPress blog.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.840
Now, a blog was traditionally what WordPress was well known for in the early days,

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.280
though it has grown and expanded to be able to

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.655
build any type of website which you want to create.

00:00:20.655 --> 00:00:25.590
To get started, I'm going to begin with local to create the sites.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.205
Below we'd just like in the set of videos for the last project,

00:00:29.205 --> 00:00:33.060
it can also choose [inaudible] if you prefer to.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.950
Once Local is open,

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.145
if you do already have a existing website open,

00:00:38.145 --> 00:00:42.300
you may need to click on the "Stop Site" button in the top corner,

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.535
although I don't have any projects currently running,

00:00:45.535 --> 00:00:51.730
though we can click on the green plus icon to begin with a new project.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.155
As ever, let's give this a site name,

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:58.150
and let's call my new webdev-blog.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.790
We don't need any of these advanced options,

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.060
so we can continue on with the preferred setup 2.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.605
Next the login details for the admin.

00:01:09.605 --> 00:01:11.945
First of all, the username.

00:01:11.945 --> 00:01:16.610
We want to go for blog admin, a password,

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.200
and I hope yours is stronger than mine,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.040
and also a email address too.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.070
We can add the sites and just give us a few moments to setup.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.590
Just like with the last project,

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:27.770
if you're using local,

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.090
you may also need to add in the administrative password if you're using a Mac.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.080
Okay, good. Mine is all now setup.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.420
I'm going to log into the dashboard with the details which you just provided.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.730
It was blog-admin and also a password too.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.910
We all signed in and we can open up the front-end of our sites.

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.510
I'm going to see what WordPress looks like with the default theme.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.560
Back over to the dashboard, the only change we're going to making in

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.130
this video is to introduce our new theme.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.095
To do this, we go down to the appearance on into the theme section,

00:02:17.095 --> 00:02:20.165
and we can add a new theme with this button.

00:02:20.165 --> 00:02:23.990
Now, just like with any project inside of this course,

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.430
you can choose any theme which you like for your project.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.630
However though, if you are a beginner,

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.125
I would recommend you stick with the same themes which I am using.

00:02:33.125 --> 00:02:37.995
You saw things like the same options that are available so you don't get too confused.

00:02:37.995 --> 00:02:41.930
The one I'm going to use is going to be spacious.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.155
I'll type this in and we can search for this.

00:02:45.155 --> 00:02:47.570
This is the theme just here.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.050
You can preview if you would like to see how this would look,

00:02:51.050 --> 00:03:00.310
but I'm going to click on the "Install" button and then activate this once ready.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.010
With this now as our active theme,

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.050
we can go back over to the front end.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.120
If we reload the page,

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.630
you will now see a different setup for all projects.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.860
It has the exact same content.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.365
We have the Hello world example blogpost,

00:03:16.365 --> 00:03:18.729
we have some sample comments,

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:21.380
and also a sample page about the top 2,

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.210
but this is just being covered up with a completely different theme.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.645
It's this theme which we are going to work with in the rest of this project.

00:03:29.645 --> 00:03:31.400
Starting in the next video,

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.370
we're going to pull in some sample data so we can see

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.700
exactly how this theme would look with a lot more content.
