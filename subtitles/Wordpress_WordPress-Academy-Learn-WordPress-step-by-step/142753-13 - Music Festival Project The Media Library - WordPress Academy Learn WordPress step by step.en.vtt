00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.675
Sooner or later you will have the need to upload different types of media,

00:00:07.675 --> 00:00:10.405
such as images, your project.

00:00:10.405 --> 00:00:15.115
WordPress provides us with a really simple and easy to use solution,

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:17.400
which is the Media Library.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.315
The Media Library is a central location where we can place all of our assets,

00:00:22.315 --> 00:00:25.000
such as images, video clips,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.190
and audio, or even files too.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.750
It then gives us access to this media library when we create

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.650
things such as new blog posts or new pages.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.930
Let's take a look at how we can use this now.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.785
From the dashboard, we have this media library option from the sidebar.

00:00:44.785 --> 00:00:46.790
If we click on this, we can see any of

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.555
the existing assets which we have inside of our project.

00:00:50.555 --> 00:00:53.000
This media library is not just the images,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.135
but also other types of media such as videos, documents, and audio.

00:00:58.135 --> 00:01:03.800
You can use these same images as me for this project which are available as a download,

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.965
or you can also select your own if you prefer.

00:01:06.965 --> 00:01:08.900
From this view, we can either click on

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.040
the Add New button where we can drag and drop any [inaudible] files,

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.500
or we can select files from our machine.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.375
Over on the left, I have a folder which has all the images for this project.

00:01:20.375 --> 00:01:24.290
We can either drag over each one of these individually or instead,

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.565
we can simply drag over the full folder.

00:01:27.565 --> 00:01:29.390
Once these have been imported,

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.330
we can click on any of these individually.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.970
It's also recommended if you are pushing this site to

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.194
production to also fill in the additional details,

00:01:38.194 --> 00:01:40.075
especially the alt text.

00:01:40.075 --> 00:01:41.910
We can also edit the title,

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.865
the caption, the description,

00:01:43.865 --> 00:01:45.350
alongside the file URL,

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.790
which we can link to in any web blog posts or pages.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.810
Since this is a demo project,

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.215
I'm going to leave all of the additional image information empty,

00:01:54.215 --> 00:01:58.325
but do be sure to fill in this additional information if you are using a live site,

00:01:58.325 --> 00:02:01.895
which will help with search engines and accessibility.

00:02:01.895 --> 00:02:05.435
Now, these images are included in our media library,

00:02:05.435 --> 00:02:09.470
we can now access them in our pages or blog posts or

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.655
our pages if we go into our home section, click on "Edit".

00:02:13.655 --> 00:02:18.980
We can directly add images into our page by adding a image block,

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.435
and we'll take a look at how to do this in the next video.

00:02:22.435 --> 00:02:24.320
Now, although we're just going to go into

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.175
the document section and then sets our featured image.

00:02:28.175 --> 00:02:32.810
I'm going to select this one and then set this as our featured image.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.090
A featured image is an image which represents our blog post or our page.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.975
The page is featured image can be displayed in a number of locations.

00:02:41.975 --> 00:02:44.100
In our case, the themes author,

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.195
you set this to be inside the header.

00:02:46.195 --> 00:02:50.790
Now if we update this and refresh our site,

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.585
we now see that this has been placed in the header.

00:02:53.585 --> 00:02:57.550
We can see here we have some white space over on the right-hand side.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.160
This is because for this course project,

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.170
we keep the image file sizes down.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.760
I've not included any huge images.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.850
We'll have a few different ways we can fix this.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.240
We can either upload a larger image or if we wanted to,

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.865
we could also adjust the CSS.

00:03:12.865 --> 00:03:17.360
We can add our own custom CSS by going over to the Dashboard,

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.080
down to the customizer,

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.410
then we have a Additional CSS section.

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.890
We can target our HTML image,

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.250
which is "img" Then inside of the curly braces,

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.695
we can set the width of the image to be 100 percent.

00:03:33.695 --> 00:03:39.235
Refresh our site, and now our image has been stretched to the full width of the browser.

00:03:39.235 --> 00:03:42.080
This is the featured image for our page,

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.825
but if we were to add a featured image to a blog post,

00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:50.015
these often displayed alongside each blog post on the blog page listing.

00:03:50.015 --> 00:03:54.515
Also as a side note, these featured images used to be called post thumbnails.

00:03:54.515 --> 00:03:57.049
These were in early versions of WordPress,

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:03.115
so you may still see some references to this in the documentation or also some guides.

00:04:03.115 --> 00:04:04.800
Back over to the customizer,

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.935
I'm also going to set the site icon.

00:04:07.935 --> 00:04:12.579
Back into the main menu and from the Site Identity,

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:14.875
we can select the site icon.

00:04:14.875 --> 00:04:18.050
We want to go for the same image,

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:22.565
select this, then we can also crop this to be a smaller size.

00:04:22.565 --> 00:04:24.830
I'm going to go for the image,

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:30.910
the hands, crop this, publish our changes.

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.710
We can now see the site icon inside

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.190
the browser tab has been updated with our new cropped image.
