00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.130
In the last video we looked at

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.800
if-else statements and how we can use them to tell the program what to do,

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.935
based on if a certain condition is met.

00:00:13.935 --> 00:00:17.685
Now we're going to move on to look at a switch statements,

00:00:17.685 --> 00:00:19.380
which is a great alternative to

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.335
the if-else statements if we need check against many conditions.

00:00:24.335 --> 00:00:29.970
I'm going to get started by creating a variable called favorite food,

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.800
I'm going to set this to be a string of pizza.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.865
Then we're going to use a switch statement to check many different types of

00:00:42.865 --> 00:00:48.430
food and then check if there is match up with the variable of favorite food.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.735
To begin a switch statements,

00:00:50.735 --> 00:00:53.580
we use the switch keyword.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.480
Then inside a set of buckets,

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.269
we then pass in the variable,

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:03.280
I want to check against.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:10.160
Place that inside there. Then just like the if statement that we used before,

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.210
we then use a set of curly braces.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.960
Then within these curly braces,

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.860
we can put in all the expressions that we'll want to check

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.220
against and then also provide a outcome if this expression is met.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.570
With switch statements, we check against different cases,

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.995
so we use the case keyword.

00:01:29.995 --> 00:01:36.050
The first case we could check if the favorite food is a curry.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.260
Let's test if this is equal to curry.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.735
Then we need to use a colon,

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:44.330
and then once we've done the colon,

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.100
we can then provide an outcome if this is a match.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.215
I'm just going to use a echo and then I'm just going to say,

00:01:52.215 --> 00:01:57.195
"I love curry, " with a semicolon at the end.

00:01:57.195 --> 00:02:00.170
Then after each one of these expressions,

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.430
we need to use the break keyword with the semicolon.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.515
This breaks out of the switch statement if this is true,

00:02:09.515 --> 00:02:13.530
and if not, we just move down to the next case.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:21.085
We use the case keyword again and this time I'm going to check if the case is Chinese.

00:02:21.085 --> 00:02:27.840
Again, the colon and the echo of "I love Chinese."

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:37.010
Then just like before, we use the break keyword, and then one more.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.180
Case and this time "Pizza."

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.660
Echo, "I love pizza."

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.630
If this is true, we can break out of the switch statements.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.945
That's how we layout a switch statement.

00:03:00.945 --> 00:03:05.345
There's one more piece we need to add into here before we test it.

00:03:05.345 --> 00:03:07.715
We need to write a default case,

00:03:07.715 --> 00:03:12.400
just in case any of these expressions above don't match.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.985
This is more of a backup,

00:03:14.985 --> 00:03:17.765
so default and then the colon,

00:03:17.765 --> 00:03:23.620
and then I want to echo, I don't know.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.765
Let's save this and test it.

00:03:30.765 --> 00:03:33.305
You can probably work out what's going to happen here.

00:03:33.305 --> 00:03:35.990
We've got our favorite food, say it's pizza,

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:42.420
so we should get the case of pizza matched up and then echo "I love pizza."

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.580
How'd we do? Let's just change this to be

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:54.219
Chinese and that should change to "I love Chinese."

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:04.305
Then curry, that works fine, I love curry.

00:04:04.305 --> 00:04:06.210
Now we'll test the default,

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.620
so we can change this to be "Pasta."

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.285
We don't have a case for pasta,

00:04:11.285 --> 00:04:14.640
so we should get the default of "I don't know",

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.680
which we do, so that's good.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:26.100
That's how we can use a switch statement in PHP to test against multiple outcomes.
