00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
One of the things which you get asked quite a lot is once we concluded

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.910
our sample data or of our theme test data into a project,

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.030
how can we then go ahead and remove this?

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.675
The theme text data with all the information which you downloaded inside of an XML file.

00:00:18.675 --> 00:00:21.750
This gives us some sample content to work with,

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.680
such as some sample blog posts and also

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.470
some images with various things such as different offers as well.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.960
If we go into a blog post,

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.640
we can see these different comments on it.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.195
There various archives, as well as different categories and tags too.

00:00:42.195 --> 00:00:46.820
The majority of this information is added with the XML file,

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.500
as well as one or two blog posts and pages which were added to0.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.710
In fact, there was even some menu links which were also included with the sample data.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.950
Well, the way to remove the sample data,

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.025
in fact there is two different ways.

00:01:03.025 --> 00:01:07.385
The first way is to manually go through all the posts,

00:01:07.385 --> 00:01:10.220
all the menus, all the pages,

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.889
and also all the other things such as the media,

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:18.675
the images which have all been added and remove these manually one by one.

00:01:18.675 --> 00:01:22.760
Of course this takes time and it's very repetitive.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.900
There is also a plug-in we can use to remove all this data.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.064
A word of warning though before starting.

00:01:30.064 --> 00:01:33.590
This will remove all the content which you've added to the sites,

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.015
not just the theme test data which were added with XML file.

00:01:38.015 --> 00:01:43.020
Also all of our pages and posts too will also be lost.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.720
This is basically a reset the cycle of theme back to how we started.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.960
I'm going to install a plugin.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.750
[inaudible] plugins and then add new.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.820
Under plugin I'm going to search for is, WordPress Reset.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.070
The one we're going to use is just here and

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.235
it's one called WordPress Reset by Matt Martz.

00:02:18.235 --> 00:02:21.380
Let's go ahead and install now.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:29.420
This WordPress Reset will reset our WordPress database back to it's default.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.250
All the customizations and content as we just mentioned, will be gone.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.290
Once that's installed select "Activate" as usual.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.320
Once that's done, we should now see under the tools option,

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.085
we now have a reset menu icon added.

00:02:48.085 --> 00:02:53.535
Select this and then to complete the reset we need to type reset

00:02:53.535 --> 00:03:00.375
inside the input box down the bottom and then click, "Reset."

00:03:00.375 --> 00:03:02.615
Again, beware this will delete

00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:06.740
all the database contents and restore back to it's defaults.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.105
Only follow along and hit reset if this is what you want to do.

00:03:11.105 --> 00:03:14.280
I'm going to click on, "Okay."

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:24.520
This a moment just to clear all the database entries and now I'm go to, Visit site.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.610
We've taken it to the default theme.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.925
If we go back to dashboard and then Themes,

00:03:31.925 --> 00:03:36.215
we can still see that our spacious theme is still available.

00:03:36.215 --> 00:03:38.315
We can Activate this.

00:03:38.315 --> 00:03:41.095
All of our themes is still preserved.

00:03:41.095 --> 00:03:47.935
Visit the site and this is how our site looks as a fresh install.

00:03:47.935 --> 00:03:50.724
If we go back to the dashboard,

00:03:50.724 --> 00:03:52.985
as we've just seen there in the sites,

00:03:52.985 --> 00:03:56.855
all the posts and pages which were added we removed.

00:03:56.855 --> 00:04:02.110
We just have the default hello world as we did when first installing.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.350
This is how we can remove all the sample data and all the content

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.070
from our WordPress database to give us a fresh start to work with.
