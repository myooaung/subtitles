00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.640
Welcome everybody. In this video,

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.510
we just want to take a few moments before we start our WordPress theme.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.790
Just to look at the differences between

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.860
traditional HTML websites and how WordPress deals with themes.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.720
This is a pretty standard look in index.html

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.555
page would often have a header and a footer section at the top and bottom of the page.

00:00:23.555 --> 00:00:29.900
It's quite common to have a sidebar if it's something such as a news or a blog website,

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.710
and of course a main content section in the middle.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.040
Usually all the contents or all the HTML for

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.400
these websites are all stored inside the same file,

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.825
but we often find with HTML websites in certain areas,

00:00:44.825 --> 00:00:47.750
particularly the header and the footer area.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.705
We have the same code on every page.

00:00:50.705 --> 00:00:53.220
The header and the footer is often the same,

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.830
and the index page,

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.120
the About Us page,

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.105
and the contact page.

00:00:58.105 --> 00:01:02.640
We end with quite a lot of duplicate code from the website.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.865
WordPress deals with things a little bit differently however.

00:01:07.865 --> 00:01:12.385
On the left-hand side we've got our traditional index.html,

00:01:12.385 --> 00:01:14.030
and on the right-hand side,

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.910
we can see how WordPress or PHP in

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.880
general can be used to split the various sections of the website.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:28.045
Each one of these sections can be placed in their own file with the PHP extension.

00:01:28.045 --> 00:01:30.155
As you can see at the top of the page,

00:01:30.155 --> 00:01:33.590
the header, we code the code out the header section,

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.930
and we place it in its own file called header.php,

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:46.060
and this can also be done in WordPress with the sidebar.php and also the footer.php.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.225
The content area is often done a little bit differently however.

00:01:50.225 --> 00:01:55.070
There can be more than one template file which controls the view for each page,

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.215
or even the WordPress loop,

00:01:57.215 --> 00:02:01.620
but we'll look at these in more detail as we go through this section.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.740
Once we have all of these PHP files

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.025
or each one of these areas saved into their own templates,

00:02:10.025 --> 00:02:16.015
we can then populate the WordPress page by using various WordPress functions.

00:02:16.015 --> 00:02:21.320
For example, the header.php file that we just saved can then be

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:27.145
included inside the WordPress template by using the get_header function,

00:02:27.145 --> 00:02:32.850
and is also the get_footer and get_sidebar functions amongst many others.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.455
Once again the content is dealt with in a slightly different way,

00:02:36.455 --> 00:02:40.910
and you learn more about this again as you go through the rest of the section.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.680
This is what it looks like actually in code.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.225
On the left-hand side,

00:02:47.225 --> 00:02:53.000
we've got a code editor and a fairly common layout for WordPress page.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.705
At the top, you can see the get_header function,

00:02:56.705 --> 00:03:02.280
which pulls in all the contents of our header from its own separate file.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.180
The content, and in the case of this particular file,

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.665
it's being pulled in from a pop sound play called page,

00:03:11.665 --> 00:03:16.355
and its varies over ways of including content into WordPress websites.

00:03:16.355 --> 00:03:19.990
We'll look at one or two of these techniques as we go along.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.340
Further down the page, we've got the get_sidebar function.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.120
Then at the very bottom, we've got the get_photo function.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.220
Doing it this way has many benefits.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.905
For example, if we wanted to change one area of the header,

00:03:35.905 --> 00:03:40.480
such as adding a menu link rather than go into the About Us page,

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.015
the index page, the contact us page,

00:03:43.015 --> 00:03:45.935
and change the link on every single page.

00:03:45.935 --> 00:03:50.670
In the case of WordPress would just need to go into the header.php file,

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.720
change it once, and this will change the header on every page of the website.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.390
I hope this overview gives you a slightly better idea of

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.130
how WordPress deals with pages and page templates.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.520
Now let's move on to the next video,

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.495
we'll create the header and the footer.php files,

00:04:09.495 --> 00:04:11.330
and then we'll bring over the content from

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.390
our static website and add these to the new files.
