00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.950
By now we should have the Multisite network enabled,

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.885
with your hosting provider.

00:00:06.885 --> 00:00:12.225
If you don't have the My Sites option available on the top navigation bar,

00:00:12.225 --> 00:00:17.310
do make sure you go back and complete the steps before continuing with this video.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.435
So we know this one will hover over the My Site icon at the top,

00:00:21.435 --> 00:00:23.610
we've got the Network Admin,

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.690
and we've also got our WordPress Multisite website,

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.820
and this is the one and only website we have available on the network.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.355
This is the main site for the network.

00:00:34.355 --> 00:00:38.740
Let's get to work on adding a new site to our network.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:44.685
Within the dashboard, click on "My Sites", Network Admin,

00:00:44.685 --> 00:00:47.680
and then down to Sites,

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.310
and then once that loads up,

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.050
click on "Add New" at the top.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.910
We've got the option to add a subdirectory,

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.415
which we enabled in the last video.

00:00:59.415 --> 00:01:02.435
For the purposes of this demonstration,

00:01:02.435 --> 00:01:04.715
I'm going to create a phone store,

00:01:04.715 --> 00:01:07.010
and also a laptop store,

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.545
two more network sites.

00:01:09.545 --> 00:01:11.580
So for the phone-shop,

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.635
let's add the URL extension of phone-shop.

00:01:16.635 --> 00:01:20.650
The site title also is Phone Shop,

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.245
the language of your choice,

00:01:24.245 --> 00:01:27.030
and then add in an e-mail.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.265
So you may have just noticed there when typing the e-mail,

00:01:34.265 --> 00:01:38.585
the WordPress has recognized this is a existing user,

00:01:38.585 --> 00:01:42.735
or a existing administrator, and therefore,

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:47.475
the phone-shop we've added to the admin panel for this user.

00:01:47.475 --> 00:01:49.665
Just like it says blow,

00:01:49.665 --> 00:01:54.079
if a e-mail address is entered which is not recognized,

00:01:54.079 --> 00:02:00.140
WordPress will automatically create a new user for this admin e-mail address.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.970
Click on "Add Site".

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.830
Now if we go back over to My Sites at the top.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.209
Again, we have the Multisite,

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.995
which is the website that we had from before.

00:02:15.995 --> 00:02:19.850
Also just below, since I created myself as

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.925
a user by entering my e-mail for the phone shop,

00:02:23.925 --> 00:02:28.885
it also appears in my list of sites which we have control over.

00:02:28.885 --> 00:02:31.665
Let's go ahead and create one more.

00:02:31.665 --> 00:02:34.230
So again in the Network Admin,

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.980
add Sites, go to Add New.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.020
Then the third website is going to be called the laptop-shop.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.944
At the site title,

00:02:52.944 --> 00:02:55.905
put this time inside the admin e-mail,

00:02:55.905 --> 00:02:58.605
I'm going to add a different e-mail.

00:02:58.605 --> 00:03:01.365
For now, I'm just going to make one up.

00:03:01.365 --> 00:03:08.890
So test@test.com, and then click on "Add Site".

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.370
There's our third website created.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.210
If we go back up to the top on My Sites, unlike before,

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.865
we don't have the laptop shop appearing in

00:03:22.865 --> 00:03:28.125
our admin because we added a different admin e-mail for this one.

00:03:28.125 --> 00:03:31.940
In the next video, we'll take a look at users and we'll also

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.705
log into the admin screen for the laptop shop.

00:03:35.705 --> 00:03:39.965
But for now let's just go over to our URL,

00:03:39.965 --> 00:03:44.240
and just check the two extra sites are working correctly.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.710
We've got the react academy course.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.550
First of all, let's check out the phone-shop.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:02.109
Then lastly, let's go over to our laptop-shop,

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.680
and then hit "Enter", and there we go.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.690
So there's our laptop shop and our free network sites are all enabled.

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.605
So that's how we can add different sites to our network,

00:04:18.605 --> 00:04:20.570
and I'll see you now in the next video.

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:21.590
We'll take a look at

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.550
different user permissions and also the super admin. So we'll see you there.
