00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.420
Welcome back to this video called Users and the Super Admin.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.575
To begin with, we want to head over to the dashboard.

00:00:10.575 --> 00:00:13.200
If we go over to My Sites,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.825
and within the Network Admin,

00:00:15.825 --> 00:00:18.460
click on the dashboard.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.250
Then if we go down to the Users option,

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.190
so we notice that, as well as our username.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.890
We've also got the laptop-shop admin,

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.540
which should have been automatically created by WordPress when we end today.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.440
A different email address for our laptop shop.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.715
One thing you may notice is your own User may have the word Super Admin just after it,

00:00:47.715 --> 00:00:51.390
and this is different to the administratoral which we're used

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.605
to when we create a single WordPress website.

00:00:55.605 --> 00:00:58.810
Let's head over to Google.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.750
If we go to the codex, and then roles,

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:15.330
and then capabilities, you should be taken to this link of the WordPress codex.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:23.340
So we scroll down, we can see a summary of the various roles within WordPress.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.860
So far, in this course,

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.330
when building the project,

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.960
we've had the administrator as the top role.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.035
The administrator is somebody who has access to

00:01:34.035 --> 00:01:38.895
all the administration features within a single website.

00:01:38.895 --> 00:01:48.120
However, now have a new role which is the super admin.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.000
The super admin is somebody with access to

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.820
all the site network administration features and also all other features.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.445
So effectively, the super admin looks after the whole network of sites.

00:02:02.445 --> 00:02:08.175
This also means the administrator role does not have exactly the same privileges,

00:02:08.175 --> 00:02:10.935
which it does within a single website.

00:02:10.935 --> 00:02:15.255
This is related to things such as themes and plug-ins.

00:02:15.255 --> 00:02:18.405
We'll look at these in more details in the next video.

00:02:18.405 --> 00:02:22.905
But for now, let's head back over to the dashboard.

00:02:22.905 --> 00:02:27.255
If we look at the second user which is for the laptop shop,

00:02:27.255 --> 00:02:30.100
if we click on the user,

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.480
we've got all the usual settings for editing a user.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.300
The first thing you notice is, if you scroll down,

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.820
the username has been set,

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.055
and it cannot be changed.

00:02:44.055 --> 00:02:49.590
We do have the option to grant the user super admin permissions,

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.100
if we want to, but the first thing we want to do

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.210
is scroll on to the bottom and then create a new password.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.590
To keep this simple, I'm just going to call this multisite-laptop,

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.500
and then confirm the use of the weak password, and then update that.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.905
Then I'm going to go over to our login.

00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:23.265
So log out, so the super admin is now logged out.

00:03:23.265 --> 00:03:26.295
Now I want to log in as laptop shop,

00:03:26.295 --> 00:03:28.930
then it as multisite-laptop.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.705
So now we're logged into the administration area for the standalone laptop shop.

00:03:42.705 --> 00:03:46.185
If we go to My Site at the top,

00:03:46.185 --> 00:03:50.130
now we're on the one-site control by this user,

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.720
which is the laptop shop,

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.895
none of the controls which we had as super admin,

00:03:56.895 --> 00:03:59.850
such as the ability to add extra sites.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.220
However, we click on the users,

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.215
we see that our user has the role of the administrator,

00:04:10.215 --> 00:04:15.660
so we can perform most of the usual site admin tasks that we viewed before,

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.445
such as adding pages,

00:04:17.445 --> 00:04:21.225
changing settings, and also managing comments.

00:04:21.225 --> 00:04:24.600
However, there are a few things that are missing such

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.930
as the ability to add new themes and plug-ins,

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.500
and this is something we'll take a look at in more detail in the next video.
