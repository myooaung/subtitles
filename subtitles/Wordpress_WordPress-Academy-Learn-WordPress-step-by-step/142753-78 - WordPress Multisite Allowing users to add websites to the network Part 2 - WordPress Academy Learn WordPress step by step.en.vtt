00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.050
Welcome back to the second part of how to

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.965
allow registered users to add websites to our network.

00:00:07.965 --> 00:00:14.235
In the first part we changed the settings as a super administrator to allow

00:00:14.235 --> 00:00:21.030
new users to register and also to create a new website as part of our network.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.880
On the right-hand side, I'm logged into Firefox as our new registered user.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.310
If you haven't already done so, click on,

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.960
Add your site button and you'll be taken to this screen.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.080
The first thing we need to do is to add our site name.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.780
This is going to be the URL extension after the main URL for our network.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.265
I want to call mine WordPress Multisite Guide.

00:00:45.265 --> 00:00:49.660
Let's give it a URL of multisite guide.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:56.320
The site title called WordPress Multisite Guide.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.525
Then we have the option to allow search engines to index.

00:01:02.525 --> 00:01:04.295
So I'm just going to keep as Yes.

00:01:04.295 --> 00:01:06.660
Then click on "Create Site".

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.060
It's as simple as that. So we can see the full URL which takes us to our site.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:20.700
Now if we go over to our Profile and then over to the Dashboard,

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.255
we've now got a more familiar looking dashboard with the site admin options.

00:01:26.255 --> 00:01:28.205
This is all the things which we're used to,

00:01:28.205 --> 00:01:30.815
such as the ability to add posts,

00:01:30.815 --> 00:01:34.885
pages, and all leave a general administration options.

00:01:34.885 --> 00:01:38.170
If you go over to the top on Visit Site,

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.155
this is our new website which we just created with our site title.

00:01:44.155 --> 00:01:48.485
There's not much to at the minute because we haven't added any customizations.

00:01:48.485 --> 00:01:52.615
But now we should build see if we go back to the super admin,

00:01:52.615 --> 00:01:57.840
if we go over to the Dashboard and then down to Sites,

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.225
we should get now the multisite guide listed as our fourth website.

00:02:03.225 --> 00:02:07.520
Of course as a super admin we also have the options to edit the website.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.825
We can also even remove it if we want to.

00:02:10.825 --> 00:02:14.300
We still have full control over any third party sites.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.380
So when allowing new uses to register sites to our network,

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.655
we may also want to customize things such as registration e-mails and settings.

00:02:24.655 --> 00:02:27.195
If we go over to the Network Admin,

00:02:27.195 --> 00:02:29.830
and then down to Settings,

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.995
as well as the registration settings which we looked at before,

00:02:34.995 --> 00:02:38.625
we have some new options related into the multisite.

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:42.045
We can customize the New Site Settings.

00:02:42.045 --> 00:02:45.020
This includes things such as the Welcome Email,

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.915
which is sent to the registered users once they create a new site.

00:02:49.915 --> 00:02:56.450
Same with the user e-mail and various other things such as new posts or new pages.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.455
We can add names inside here,

00:02:59.455 --> 00:03:01.435
separated by a space.

00:03:01.435 --> 00:03:06.310
This will block any registered user from creating the website with these names.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.820
So we can reserve them for ourself and of course,

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.230
things such as admin is obviously blocked because we need that to login.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:20.395
That's how we can allow a registered user to create a new website as part of our network.

00:03:20.395 --> 00:03:24.620
So I do hope this video and section has been useful for you.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.090
If you don't already have a useful multisite you may need in the future,

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.355
and it's useful to know how to do it.

00:03:31.355 --> 00:03:34.200
So thank you and bye for now.
