00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:09.780
So far we've created our own blog post with some simple text and we

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.195
can really bring our blog post to life by

00:00:12.195 --> 00:00:15.330
adding the various pieces of media such as images,

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.480
video clips, and also audio too.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.220
Now, to do this, we're going to first begin by adding a featured image.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.465
We've already looked at adding featured images in the first project,

00:00:27.465 --> 00:00:30.225
where we added them to our pages.

00:00:30.225 --> 00:00:34.710
With this project when adding them to our blog post, in this theme,

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.515
the featured image will display alongside

00:00:37.515 --> 00:00:42.015
our blog post except just inside of this blog post listing.

00:00:42.015 --> 00:00:45.575
If we scroll down to our sample blog posts,

00:00:45.575 --> 00:00:48.265
we can see the featured image just here.

00:00:48.265 --> 00:00:51.170
Let's add these if we go into

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.690
our blog post or can also directly accesses from our dashboard too,

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.750
we can also go into the edit post link.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.225
Over on the right, we have

00:01:02.225 --> 00:01:07.130
the featured image section from the menu where we can set this for our blog post.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.355
You can either select your own image to upload or directly access the Media Library.

00:01:13.355 --> 00:01:17.450
All of these images have been provided when we downloaded the sample data.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.375
So we have some images to work with for this project.

00:01:20.375 --> 00:01:23.050
Select any of these and

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.870
conveniently we also have things like the alt text already filled in for us.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.180
We can just set this as our image,

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:36.495
Update, then back over to our project, visit site.

00:01:36.495 --> 00:01:38.930
We now have an image for our blog post.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.570
Now, this is a great way of adding an image

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.840
when we display a list of all our blog posts like this.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.905
But what about if we click on this to see the full blog post?

00:01:48.905 --> 00:01:54.535
We want to also sometimes add images in between all this blog post content too.

00:01:54.535 --> 00:01:58.550
Now, to do this, I'm actually going to go back over to the Dashboard View,

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.835
and let's just refresh this so we have the updated version.

00:02:01.835 --> 00:02:04.970
Images can also be added as a block.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.300
We can hover over the area where we want to add a new block.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.950
Click on "Add".

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.415
This image block is currently at the very top or we can also search. Click on this.

00:02:15.415 --> 00:02:20.390
Then we can also upload a new image or select one from the Media Library.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.290
Just like before, we've taken it to all of our images which we currently have.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.665
We can select any of these,

00:02:26.665 --> 00:02:31.410
update our post, and also to the front end of our site, we can refresh.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.490
We now see our image has been inserted.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.650
As with most of these content blocks,

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.970
we can also click on these or hover over and we can see eight options menu.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.060
We have lots of different options such as cropping the image,

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.235
we can link to different URLs.

00:02:46.235 --> 00:02:48.410
We can also rearrange our content to be

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.560
above or below different blocks and also over on the right,

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.060
we have some options too.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.465
We can play around with the style of our image by rounding the corners,

00:02:56.465 --> 00:02:57.890
we can change the alt texts,

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.405
we can change the size,

00:02:59.405 --> 00:03:01.940
and as well as I adding a single image like this.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.530
We can also upload multiple images in the form of a gallery.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.790
A gallery is also a content block too and

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.085
we just need to select a location where we want this,

00:03:13.085 --> 00:03:15.820
do a search for the gallery.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.800
Then from here, we have the familiar options of uploading

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.520
new images or also accessing the Media Library.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.990
Once we stick with the Media Library,

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:30.870
we can select multiple images to display inside this gallery and choose any of these.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.370
We want to select these five. Click on "Create."

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.060
Just before we insert these into our gallery,

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.940
we can also drag and drop these images to rearrange.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.110
Once we're happy, insert these.

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.580
These gallery images can also be linked to URLs too,

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.610
and we can also change the number of columns which you want.

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.250
This is really flexible to use.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:01.780
Update this and over to the website and refresh our blog post.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.745
First, we see our image has the rounded corners.

00:04:04.745 --> 00:04:06.740
If we go to page 2,

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.245
we now have a nice image gallery.

00:04:09.245 --> 00:04:12.920
As well as images, we can also insert different types of media,

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.710
such as video clips.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.505
This is inserted in pretty much the same way if we go back to our edit screen.

00:04:19.505 --> 00:04:25.820
Then if we find any location where we want to add any block, click on "Add."

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.610
Search for the video.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.285
If you already have a video clip saved on your computer,

00:04:32.285 --> 00:04:34.700
you can, of course, use this too.

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.805
I'm going to go to pixabay.com.

00:04:37.805 --> 00:04:39.440
If you click on the dropdown,

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.785
we can search for videos.

00:04:41.785 --> 00:04:47.725
Hit "Enter." It will give us a list of all the videos we can select from this site.

00:04:47.725 --> 00:04:53.280
This one looks fine. Click on this "Downloads."

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.850
I'm just going to go for the smallest version for now.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.880
Then once this is finished,

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.040
remember this one isn't currently inserted in the Media Library,

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.500
so we need to go to Upload, into the Downloads.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.080
Select this clip, and uploading this will

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.535
automatically place this into the Media Library 2.

00:05:15.535 --> 00:05:18.380
Over on the right, we have various video options,

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.450
such as we can loop this video,

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.765
we can mute it when it's initially loaded,

00:05:22.765 --> 00:05:25.745
we can also add the control such as play and pause,

00:05:25.745 --> 00:05:27.745
and also play too.

00:05:27.745 --> 00:05:32.330
A poster image, this is a still image which will display when the video is not playing.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.705
This is a really handy feature to have too.

00:05:35.705 --> 00:05:39.815
Again, you can also rearrange these blocks and change some of the options.

00:05:39.815 --> 00:05:42.750
Once you are happy, click on "Update."

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.520
We can check if this is working by refreshing our blog post.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.360
We have the controls at the bottom with the time.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.805
Click on "Play" and this all works fine.

00:05:56.805 --> 00:05:59.880
Next, you may also want to add audio clip into

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.180
your blog post and this place this down at the very bottom.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.605
Click on the "Insert Block."

00:06:06.605 --> 00:06:10.470
As you might expect, this is called the audio block.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.465
To grab an audio clip, I'm going to go over to bensound.com.

00:06:15.465 --> 00:06:19.025
This will give some free audio samples which you can download.

00:06:19.025 --> 00:06:22.090
Or you can also use your own if you prefer to.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.310
Click on the Download button for any of these and we

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.565
can download a free version to use with attribution.

00:06:28.565 --> 00:06:33.635
Attribution means we need to credit benson.com with this audio clip.

00:06:33.635 --> 00:06:37.655
To do this, we just need to copy this example at the bottom.

00:06:37.655 --> 00:06:43.845
Download this. Just as we did with the video clip,

00:06:43.845 --> 00:06:46.420
back over to the post,

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.220
select this from our downloads.

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.880
This audio clip is now inserted.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.695
We have the Play button and we can also change the audio settings on the right too.

00:06:57.695 --> 00:06:59.390
These defaults are fine for me.

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:04.925
I'm just going to click below this audio clip and then insert the attribution.

00:07:04.925 --> 00:07:07.505
Update this blog post,

00:07:07.505 --> 00:07:12.660
refresh the browser and we can test if this is working.

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.490
You maybe you can't hear this from your end,

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.485
but this is all working fine.

00:07:18.485 --> 00:07:22.580
If we take a look through all of the different types of blocks it also varies over

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:27.280
types of blocks in media which you can insert into these blog posts too.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:33.215
The final thing I'm going to show you is how to insert some media directly from a URL.

00:07:33.215 --> 00:07:36.660
For this, let's place in add image block,

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:42.514
and then we can use the third option which is insert from URL.

00:07:42.514 --> 00:07:46.055
But this, of course, we need a media URL to link to.

00:07:46.055 --> 00:07:50.420
A good place to grab on these is the Wikimedia Commons website,

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:54.760
which is available from Commons.Wikimedia.org.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:59.765
You can search through the huge library of free images to select.

00:07:59.765 --> 00:08:02.590
All I'm going to select this image of the day.

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:06.920
Click on this and then we're taken to the full-size version where we can right-click.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.415
We could save this image and add this to the Media Library.

00:08:10.415 --> 00:08:14.000
But instead, I'm going to copy the image address and

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.895
then paste this as our URL. Hit "Enter."

00:08:18.895 --> 00:08:21.690
There's a preview of our image.

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:25.845
Update, reload.

00:08:25.845 --> 00:08:31.280
This is just a different way of adding images rather than using the Medial Library.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.890
Our images also now displayed at the bottom.

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:40.530
This is just an alternative way of adding images rather than accessing the Media Library.
