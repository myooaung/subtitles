00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.160
To begin, we're going to install a new theme for our project.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.865
I'm going to choose a free theme from wordpress.org,

00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:14.130
but this is completely up to you.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.340
I would recommend if you are a beginner,

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.025
to stick with the same theme which I'm using,

00:00:19.025 --> 00:00:21.470
since if you do choose a different theme,

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.490
it may come with some different options or may have a different look or feel,

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.705
or it may also have some extra options too.

00:00:28.705 --> 00:00:32.975
If you are a beginner, I would recommend you stick with this same theme,

00:00:32.975 --> 00:00:35.330
or if you want to play around with things afterwards,

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.225
you can take a look around and choose a different theme too.

00:00:39.225 --> 00:00:43.375
Let's jump into installing our WordPress theme.

00:00:43.375 --> 00:00:46.730
At the moment, we just have the basic default themes which we

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.760
included when we set up a WordPress originally.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.150
We can see these if we go to the visit site button

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.980
or I still have mine already available inside the browser.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.370
This is the default theme which is included

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.460
and we can see this if we go to the dashboard,

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.630
and then into the appearance and theme section.

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.005
From here we currently have three different themes installed,

00:01:08.005 --> 00:01:11.130
and we're using the 2020 theme at the moment.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.355
We can also hover over any of these different themes,

00:01:14.355 --> 00:01:16.465
and also activate these too.

00:01:16.465 --> 00:01:20.870
This is how the 2020 theme currently looks, and by default,

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.355
we'll first set up WordPress,

00:01:22.355 --> 00:01:25.925
all of the blogposts are displayed on the homepage.

00:01:25.925 --> 00:01:29.195
At the moment, we would just have this simple Hello World blogpost

00:01:29.195 --> 00:01:31.985
and also this sample comment just below.

00:01:31.985 --> 00:01:34.560
We also have a Sample Page too,

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.970
and we can also rearrange the contents for any of

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.745
these pages from the WordPress dashboard.

00:01:39.745 --> 00:01:43.330
For example, we can move all of the blogposts which are currently on

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.060
our homepage to be on a dedicated blog page.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.000
To start off with this project,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.190
we're going to install our new theme.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.570
From wordpress.org, we can go into the theme section and we can include any of

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.290
these available themes to make our site look as different or personal as we want.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.160
The options which you have to install a theme is we can

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.010
either select any of these and click on the Download button.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.050
This file which we downloaded,

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.550
we drop this into

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.000
the theme section from all files or folders that we looked at previously.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.680
Alternatively, and probably a more simple way is to go back over to the dashboard,

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.160
and we can click on "Add new".

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.140
This project I'm going to be using a theme which is called Asura.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:33.725
We can do a search and the Asura theme is going to be this one which we see just here.

00:02:33.725 --> 00:02:38.674
To install, we simply click on the Install button and then once this has been downloaded,

00:02:38.674 --> 00:02:42.330
we just need to activate this as our current theme.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.330
Once it is activated,

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.630
we then have the option to customize our theme.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.290
The customizer gives us the options which are on the left and we can see

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.120
a live preview of any of the changes over on the right.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.950
For example, if you go into the site identity,

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.790
we can change our site title and also the tagline too.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.045
We can include a logo and a site icon and we have

00:03:05.045 --> 00:03:09.205
lots of different options to change the look and feel of our theme.

00:03:09.205 --> 00:03:11.780
Just because we're using a pre-built theme,

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.260
it doesn't mean we just stick with the exact look which is provided.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.175
We'll make use of many of these options as we progress through the course,

00:03:19.175 --> 00:03:23.815
and we can also now see our active theme if we reload the front end.

00:03:23.815 --> 00:03:27.290
It does currently look a little different how it looked in the pictures,

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.835
but this is just because we don't have the same content set up as the demo.

00:03:31.835 --> 00:03:37.710
The job of a theme is just to provide a skin or color scheme for our content.
