00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.220
In the previous videos,

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.070
we've already had a brief look at the customizer,

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.835
which is available from the Appearance tab inside the dashboard.

00:00:11.835 --> 00:00:15.960
The customizer is a way to make changes to our theme and see

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.440
a live preview of these changes before saving them and making these apply to our project.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.020
We're now going to revisit the customizer and make

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.720
some changes to the look and feel of our site.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.720
Over my desktop, I have a Images folder for

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.015
this project and this is included with this course.

00:00:34.015 --> 00:00:38.090
You can download this yourself and use the same images as me.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.500
Or instead, if you prefer,

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.380
you can choose your own and use these instead for

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.545
the media library. We have these available.

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:47.950
Let's go into the medial library now,

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.280
and then we can drag over the full project folder,

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.710
and drop this inside of here.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.800
You have various logos and images,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.060
you have some icons,

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.215
and also a texture which we'll use soon.

00:01:02.215 --> 00:01:05.630
With this now in place, we can now go back to

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.440
the appearance and then into the customize option.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.115
Some of these options will have dedicated videos coming up.

00:01:13.115 --> 00:01:16.580
We're not going to go through every option right now in this video,

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.920
but we're going to start off at the very top inside of

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.450
the header section and begin by adding a logo.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.710
We can do this inside of the Header option,

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.735
and then into the Site Identity.

00:01:28.735 --> 00:01:33.050
From here we're going to add a logo which is going to appear next to our site title.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.945
You can choose any logo, of course.

00:01:35.945 --> 00:01:40.980
I'm going to use this one which is included with the course like this.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.335
We can also crop this if we prefer.

00:01:43.335 --> 00:01:46.320
I'm going to make this the full size.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.080
You can crop. At the moment,

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.710
we don't see any changes appearing inside of our preview.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.010
This is because if we scroll down,

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.705
we also have a third option,

00:01:56.705 --> 00:01:59.870
whether we want to show the logo, or the texts,

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.290
and we can actually select both,

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.530
so these appear side-by-side.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.690
Beside title, this is automatically being set when we created a WordPress site early on,

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.850
and you can change this if you like to.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.320
I'm going to leave this as it is,

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.735
but I am going to change the tag line just below.

00:02:14.735 --> 00:02:18.150
This is going to be all things web development.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.100
We can see as we're typing,

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.935
this is automatically updated inside the preview,

00:02:24.935 --> 00:02:29.240
and the last thing I'm going to update in the section is going to be the site icon.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.730
This is the small image which appears inside of the browser's tab.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.940
We can select an icon,

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.500
I'm going to go for this one, below this.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.600
We see this is automatically being applied to our top.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.690
If you'd like to, you can also change the header text color too,

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.245
but I'm happy with the color,

00:02:48.245 --> 00:02:50.485
which is supplied as default.

00:02:50.485 --> 00:02:53.870
A couple of other things to note too here is we also have some options

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.220
to see how the site looks in different screen sizes.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.500
Down at the bottom, we are currently on the desktop view,

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.235
we can also preview the look and feel of this in a tablet.

00:03:04.235 --> 00:03:06.200
We can click on the middle button to do this,

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.665
and also the smaller screen mobile view too.

00:03:09.665 --> 00:03:12.230
This gives us a good chance to preview how things would

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.095
look if we maybe upload an image which is too big,

00:03:15.095 --> 00:03:16.880
awesome text which doesn't quite fit,

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.375
but generally a lot of these themes which you uploaded to the Theme Store,

00:03:20.375 --> 00:03:22.540
are generally fully responsive.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.415
We can't publish our changes once we're happy,

00:03:25.415 --> 00:03:29.480
and these will also be reflected inside of our site.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.250
Back into the customizer,

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.725
we do have lots of different options inside here.

00:03:33.725 --> 00:03:36.395
We do see some shortcuts over on the right.

00:03:36.395 --> 00:03:40.685
We can click on the pencil icon next to any of these editable areas,

00:03:40.685 --> 00:03:43.250
and then we taken straight to the customizer section,

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.655
where we can make our changes.

00:03:45.655 --> 00:03:47.810
Back to the main menu at the very top,

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.830
we have this global option where we can apply some settings for different colors,

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.760
our typography, and also our layouts and background too.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.950
If you wanted to, you could change all of the colors.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.890
We have a primary color set by the themes offer,

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.435
and we can change this so it applies to all of the green areas of our sites.

00:04:05.435 --> 00:04:08.540
You can also change this to be a dark mode too.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.760
If you prefer this for your blog,

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.520
the typography option will give us a chance to

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.595
change the standard fonts which we're going to use for our project,

00:04:16.595 --> 00:04:20.360
and we can change this to be either some of these supplied standard fonts,

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.730
or one of the selected ones from Google too.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.865
What's changed both the body and the heading tags to be Roboto, publish this.

00:04:29.865 --> 00:04:33.020
The background color, we can select

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.975
any different background color which applies to outside of our main content area.

00:04:37.975 --> 00:04:41.070
Currently this is a light gray color bars you can see.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:46.480
We can move the color around to any one of these colors and change the feel of our site.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.340
If we wanted to, we could also upload a background image

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.385
or a texture to replace this standard color.

00:04:52.385 --> 00:04:56.540
Layout, this will give us a chance to set the width of the content,

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.415
which is this dark, gray color.

00:04:58.415 --> 00:05:02.255
We can either have a box just like we see here with a certain width,

00:05:02.255 --> 00:05:04.640
or we could have it to be the wider layout and then we're going to

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.535
boxy content into the center.

00:05:07.535 --> 00:05:10.920
Alongside when we amend our pages to from this customizer,

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.660
we can also change the positioning of the sidebar from here if want to

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.060
have a play around and see how this feels with different layout options.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.500
This is the default layout to begin,

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.575
which will apply to all of the pages,

00:05:23.575 --> 00:05:29.600
and then we have a layout which is more specific to pages and also to blog post too.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.550
Maybe on this blog post listing,

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.385
we don't want any sidebar at all,

00:05:33.385 --> 00:05:35.445
so we can select this view,

00:05:35.445 --> 00:05:37.700
and then when we click on to any of these blog posts,

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.280
to be taken into the full post view.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.705
We can then reintroduce a sidebar onto any side which we want to.

00:05:44.705 --> 00:05:47.030
Again, this can also be different for all pages,

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.130
so if we go into the "About us" page,

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.770
we'll still see a sidebar inside here,

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.780
and we can also remove this too.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.855
I'm going to publish these changes,

00:05:55.855 --> 00:05:59.780
and then click on the site logo to be taken back to our homepage.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.300
If I could just make this a little bit narrower.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.050
Yeah, that looks better, publish this. Back up to the top.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.385
We will have dedicated videos for a lot of these options,

00:06:10.385 --> 00:06:15.020
but just one last thing I would like to show you is the additional CSS download button.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.970
If you do know how to use CSS,

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:18.785
this is a place where you can add it.

00:06:18.785 --> 00:06:21.665
But don't worry if you don't know any of this code,

00:06:21.665 --> 00:06:24.440
is just going to be an example of what we can do.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.340
For example, if we want to target any of the text,

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.440
which is an EP elements,

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.950
we could apply our custom CSS just like this,

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:38.945
given as full control over all of the styling and layout for our theme.

00:06:38.945 --> 00:06:41.170
Don't worry if you don't know any of this,

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:44.945
this is just something extra which you can maybe use in the future.

00:06:44.945 --> 00:06:49.465
This is the customizer and also one thing to remember when using the dashboard,

00:06:49.465 --> 00:06:54.490
some of the options inside here will also link us back to the customizer too.

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:59.600
For example, if you go to the appearance and then down to the header link,

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:04.060
this will take us to the header section of the customizer.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.700
I'm going to leave the site as it is for now and you

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.430
can make some additional changes if you prefer,

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:13.565
using the customizer without the need to apply any coding.

00:07:13.565 --> 00:07:16.390
We'll leave this video there because we'll be covering the rest

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:19.910
of the options as we move on through this section.
