00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.235
As we discovered in the last video,

00:00:05.235 --> 00:00:10.125
WordPress by default will display our blog posts on our home page.

00:00:10.125 --> 00:00:14.115
We can change this to display these posts on any other page,

00:00:14.115 --> 00:00:18.375
but first we need to create a new page to display these on.

00:00:18.375 --> 00:00:20.400
Over to the dashboard.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.280
From here, we have the pages option over on the left.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.230
If we click on this, we can add and manage all of the pages which are on our site.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.860
I'm going to leave a place the privacy policy which is already setup,

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.515
but we can remove the sample page.

00:00:34.515 --> 00:00:37.875
Let's remove this, and then we can add a new page,

00:00:37.875 --> 00:00:40.260
which is going to be our home page.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.720
The first thing we need to do when creating a new page is to add the page title.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.435
Then we can add all of our content below.

00:00:47.435 --> 00:00:50.075
We're going to cover adding our page content on

00:00:50.075 --> 00:00:53.585
the content editor in more detail in the next video.

00:00:53.585 --> 00:00:57.499
We also have some options to either publish this page immediately,

00:00:57.499 --> 00:00:59.990
or we can schedule a list for a later time.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.500
We have a permalink section where we can set the link to this page.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.824
For example, this would be our URL,

00:01:05.824 --> 00:01:07.250
and then forward slash home.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.780
If you had a blog section this will be forward slash blog and so on.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.630
We have a featured image which is the main image,

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.925
which we can use when at least in this page.

00:01:16.925 --> 00:01:19.010
We can link this by clicking on this button,

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.550
and this will be uploaded to our media library.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.630
Have the discussion section where we can allow comments for this page,

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.565
and also any attributes which you want to add,

00:01:28.565 --> 00:01:31.790
such as the order which this page will appear.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.770
Also included with this theme,

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.140
is some options where we can lay out the sidebar.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.375
We can have the sidebar on either the left or the right or no sidebar at all.

00:01:41.375 --> 00:01:45.380
These sidebar layout options have been coded by the creator of this theme.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.835
Yours may be a little different if you chose a different theme.

00:01:48.835 --> 00:01:52.220
Now with our site title in place what we need to do is to click on

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.720
"Publish" and then "Confirm" and this home page is now live.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.870
Back to our front end of our site and refresh.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.960
I want us to have access to our home page, click on this.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.685
This is the permalink which we've seen before which is forward slash home,

00:02:07.685 --> 00:02:09.595
and then our page title.

00:02:09.595 --> 00:02:12.245
We don't have any page content just yet,

00:02:12.245 --> 00:02:14.165
but there is a couple of things to note.

00:02:14.165 --> 00:02:16.940
First of all, this homepage title is displaying,

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.515
and it's pretty bold, so you may want to keep this in place depending on your project.

00:02:21.515 --> 00:02:24.580
But I'm going to remove this from the dashboard.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.835
Back over to your page.

00:02:26.835 --> 00:02:30.125
Then down at the bottom where our layout section is,

00:02:30.125 --> 00:02:33.080
we can go to the disable elements section.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.025
From here we can check the content title,

00:02:36.025 --> 00:02:37.620
close the section down.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.075
We now have access to an update button.

00:02:40.075 --> 00:02:43.750
Then refresh the page to confirm this has been removed.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.115
The second thing is we actually want this home page to be the home page for our site,

00:02:48.115 --> 00:02:51.035
rather than the blog post which we currently see.

00:02:51.035 --> 00:02:53.845
To change this we can go over to the dashboard,

00:02:53.845 --> 00:02:56.315
and if we click on the WordPress icon,

00:02:56.315 --> 00:02:59.180
will then take it back to the main dashboard section.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.560
In the settings section,

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.880
we can go into reading.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.585
From here we can change what the home page will display.

00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:09.220
Currently, this is set to display the latest blog posts,

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.660
but we're going to change this to be a static page,

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.050
where we can select our new home page. Click on "Save".

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.110
Now if we reload the project,

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.360
we now see our empty home page.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.370
If we had a dedicated blog page,

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.555
we could also set this too but we're going to look at this in a future video.

00:03:26.555 --> 00:03:28.850
Just before we move on to adding more content,

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.310
we can also set up the site title,

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.590
and also the tagline for this project.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.305
As to this back over in the customizer,

00:03:36.305 --> 00:03:39.660
which is available under the appearance section.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.490
We've already looked at how we can change the site title and also

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.910
the tagline using this site identity section.

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.465
The tagline doesn't matter at the moment because we've already got this hidden,

00:03:50.465 --> 00:03:53.735
but if we wanted to we could also add a logo to the header.

00:03:53.735 --> 00:03:56.825
But I'm going to leave this and add this directly to our page.

00:03:56.825 --> 00:04:00.440
We can also set a site icon which will appear in the browser tab.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.575
We want to do both of these in the next video.

00:04:03.575 --> 00:04:05.585
Back to the main menu.

00:04:05.585 --> 00:04:08.420
We'll use a lot more of these options throughout the course.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.840
But next, we can also make use of the social media links,

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.045
which have been provided with this theme.

00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:18.595
From this section, we can add the links to all of our social media profiles.

00:04:18.595 --> 00:04:22.880
Just as an example, I'm going to add my Twitter URL.

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.990
If we now publish this, as tests are,

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.700
we can close down the customizer and refresh the browser.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.890
Click on the Twitter icon,

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.050
and this will only take us directly to our social media link.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.550
With this first page now setup,

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.260
let's move on into the media library where we can add some images to our project.
