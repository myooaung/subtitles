00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:02,320
Hello, guys.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,080
Welcome back to a new project.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:14,970
So in this project, we will create a basic system to block unwanted sites for they data focus.

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,670
We will also provide an option to dos for experts to let you through to adverted sites.

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:28,380
I have provided the basic manifest and a basic pop up file, which you must be pretty familiar with

6
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:28,980
by now.

7
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,280
So we're going to use this as a starting point.

8
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,630
I'm pretty sure you must understand what all this stuff means.

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:42,000
But if you don't, you can just look at the previous projects and you'll be ready to go.

10
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,900
So.

11
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,860
Here we have used the starting point.

12
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,860
Now let's upload our extension.

13
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,840
As you can see, our study help Ascension is running.

14
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,020
Now let's see what we have to know.

15
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:18,940
We go up to the corner and this is our ascension.

16
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,440
We've been at Ascension so that we can access it when we want.

17
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:26,600
Uh.

18
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,780
So when we click on it.

19
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,140
So this is what we have written now.

20
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,080
It's pretty basic HTML and we haven't written any actual JavaScript code right now.

21
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,310
So we get started out right away.

22
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,370
You can have a quick look at our manifest.

23
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:59,780
We have other achievements and we have our source folder and assets include everything, including icons.

24
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,270
So let's get started.

25
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,900
I will provide the GitHub folder as well.

26
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:22,030
So in case you want the starting code, you can access it as well.

27
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,500
I'll also provide the finished code so you don't have to worry about anything.

28
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:37,050
So I'll remove this high property because when I open my pop up, it makes it bigger than it needs to

29
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,890
be and said, what we can do is.

30
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:43,980
Yeah.

31
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,930
Yeah, that looks better.

32
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,880
But does it do anything because we have it written in the code.

33
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:55,480
So ready to specify essentially a script that will do something interesting.

34
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,500
Let's specify our script tag.

35
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:05,380
And yeah, now let's add the JavaScript file.

36
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,160
Up one level into our source folder and we'll call it toggle notice.

37
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:30,900
So those two dots, two dots are important to say that we are it is one level up in the file hierarchy.

38
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,380
You must know this by now.

39
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,050
But even if you don't, I've just got it up for you.

40
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,770
So we create a JavaScript file together.

41
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:39,460
JS.

42
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:55,600
So JavaScript, you must be fairly familiar with the Vero, but if you don't, it is a scripting language

43
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:01,360
which is like the muscle for any website or any extension that it uses.

44
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,000
So you'll notice the pop up.

45
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:21,750
You have a button and the button will listen for an action.

46
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:28,260
So will want to specify what you want to do when that button is clicked.

47
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:33,540
So the first thing we need to do is we get a reference to our element.

48
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:42,000
So let's call it toggle button and we'll call this one down here mode level.

49
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:54,280
And you'll notice that we don't have a specific type here because that sort of script works.

50
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:01,450
So consent means that it's not changing.

51
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:09,030
So if you can make something more subtle, it's usually a good idea to use cones instead of lit.

52
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:16,620
So let's get document.createelement by ID, and now we specify what the element of that idea was and

53
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,000
it was toggle button.

54
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:26,110
So essentially what we're doing here is we're saying document, get, element priority.

55
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:32,020
So access the document and get the element which has the ID toggle button.

56
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,020
So we'll do the same thing down here.

57
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,750
And now we have mode level.

58
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:48,100
Now we have reference to both those variables, both those elements.

59
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:58,210
So let's create a variable called study mode and set it to false, which will specify whether study

60
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,680
mode is on or off.

61
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:06,040
So what you want to do is when that button is pressed, we wanted to do something.

62
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:13,750
So we'll create an image listed for that button, which we triggered when we click it.

63
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:16,210
So our event listener.

64
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:31,800
So it's a click event and after that he will specify what it will do.

65
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,820
So now we'll specify our function on what we want to do when it is clicked.

66
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:55,000
So let's start with the function keyword.

67
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,920
Let's click handler.

68
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,570
I can't think of any parameters that we need to add right now.

69
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,110
Let's include one parameter which includes details of the event.

70
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,550
But we can leave it blank right now.

71
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,080
So.

72
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:33,530
So we want to set study mode to whatever it currently isn't.

73
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,630
And we need to find a way to store this.

74
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:50,560
So Chrome has APIs that lets you access storage within Chrome itself.

75
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:58,210
If anyone has worked with asynchronous functions before, you know that it's a little bit tricky because

76
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,480
you don't have access to the results of those functions right away.

77
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,810
So

78
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:17,520
there a lot of synchronous code in Chrome, but there is also a lot of asynchronous code.

79
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,980
So accessing storage and writing storage are asynchronous functions.

80
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:25,960
So it will take us first.

81
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,250
I was news and then it will come back to you.

82
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,430
So storage.

83
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,750
So what did you want from here?

84
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:46,740
So we can specify same process which will be sent across all Chrome devices for the same Google ID.

85
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:55,180
So we can set or we can get.

86
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,660
Right now we can we want to set our study mode.

87
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:00,400
So.

88
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,250
These two properties you want in here?

89
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:15,100
So we can either specify an object or we can specify a callback function.

90
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,370
So very exciting things here.

91
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,580
We don't really care about what we want to do.

92
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:34,550
Like, we can log console if you want to, but we don't necessarily need a callback function, right?

93
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,090
So we just specify the object that you want to set.

94
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:50,510
So we set the key to be the mode and we're going to give it a value whatever study book currently is.

95
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:58,240
So notice that in the manifest we specify everything as a string here.

96
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:04,240
We don't have to do that if you're writing an object like this.

97
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,490
If this is a variable, it would be trickier.

98
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:16,300
But since it isn't, we can just write it without a string.

99
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,160
So we went ahead at the dart and.

100
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:34,540
Now we want to update the label in the pop up that tells us what is currently on or off.

101
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,930
So we'll set up a date label.

102
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,460
We can call or click harder here.

103
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:55,750
So click.

104
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,730
Here is a callback function.

105
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:01,720
So we are passing it as an argument.

106
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,540
So we don't need a parenthesis here.

107
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:16,520
So another thing we can do is we can just write the function in place here.

108
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:27,370
So we can just put it here instead of specifying the function because we don't have to use it again

109
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:28,150
and again.

110
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:34,150
So we don't even have to name it anymore and we can take this out.

111
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,060
Okay.

112
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,490
So we have a function here.

113
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:50,950
We need to specify the update level function that we have called.

114
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,640
We don't need a parameter in here.

115
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:05,640
What we actually need to set this mode label and we need to set its value to text value to.

116
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:17,220
So ready to change it to the same prefix that we had previously.

117
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:24,630
And then we're going to concatenate some things in here using a ternary operator.

118
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,320
So if study mode is on.

119
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,130
Then we're going to put it on.

120
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:37,630
And if it's soft, then we're going to put off.

121
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:48,970
So

122
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:54,100
and then will put an exclamation point.

123
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:00,360
So we got our day table here.

124
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,420
So we'll call it a date label once at the very bottom, which means page pages being brought up for

125
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,290
the first time.

126
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:16,620
We want it to show the steady mode of.

127
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:35,070
So when the script is read for the first time, we want to update it.

128
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,680
Let's test it and see if it works.

129
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,460
The extension is already loaded.

130
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:54,720
You can always remove it and add it again if there is an issue or you can just click the refresh button.

131
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:01,620
So the planet and open it.

132
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,070
So I started with this off by default.

133
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,030
And you can see that what we did is working just fine.

134
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:22,670
So we also set the value, but we didn't get the value, which is something that we should do right

135
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,240
now.

136
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:36,830
So we're going to get what are our values currently in study mode.

137
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:40,540
So we often open it previously said it to be true.

138
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:44,210
We want it to be true when we open it now.

139
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:48,830
So we said, So start, get.

140
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:56,730
And we have the same two parameters here, the object and the callback.

141
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,320
So what do we want?

142
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,480
And once we get it, what do we want to do?

143
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:10,230
So we get the mood key and it has to have a value.

144
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,780
So are different values going to be false?

145
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:27,100
Function has to have a parameter called result.

146
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:34,000
And this is going to hold the data about.

147
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:41,860
What do we do now with a desert so sturdy moat is equal to desert mode.

148
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:46,180
So desert holds all the values that we qualify for.

149
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,030
And then we get what the value we want.

150
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,110
So which is food.

151
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:52,740
So we are willing.

152
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,580
So.

153
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:13,930
This function will take all of its time, get it things and then it will update it.

154
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:16,390
So it is asynchronous.

155
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:32,680
So that is why we have to put stuff in the callback and not in a normal function.

156
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:38,730
Because it will work after we have retrieved our data.

157
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,140
So we are getting some of this.

158
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:41,730
Let's see.

159
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:50,070
Oh, I didn't put sink here.

160
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:50,740
You have to.

161
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,460
What kind of stories it is?

162
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,560
So we saved this file.

163
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:03,350
Clear and very fresh.

164
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,020
So starting this off by default.

165
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:07,880
And then we turn it on.

166
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,240
Let's leave it on and close the pop up.

167
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:15,220
Now, if you open it again, it gets it from storage.

168
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:17,330
And so we can see that it is on.

169
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,740
So we can close and open it and it will stay.

170
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,600
So this is persistent storage.
