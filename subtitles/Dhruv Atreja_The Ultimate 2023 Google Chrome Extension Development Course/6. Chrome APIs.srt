00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:02,710
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,490
Welcome to level two.

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,840
I'm glad you made it.

4
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:10,010
It's completely reasonable that you might have some doubts at this point.

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,640
Like, how do I use a service worker or anything like that?

6
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:16,760
But don't worry, that's completely reasonable.

7
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:21,150
And as we keep progressing in this course, everything will become clear.

8
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:22,460
So just stick with me.

9
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,860
Even if there might be some doubts in your mind.

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,020
So now we'll start Chrome APIs.

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,730
So water from API is.

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,940
Simply put, they are APIs that allow extensions to interact with the Chrome browser and perform various

13
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:40,660
tasks.

14
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:49,120
So they are an essential part of the Chrome extension ecosystem as they provide the tools and resources

15
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,140
that extensions need to interact with browser and web pages.

16
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,900
There are many different Chrome APIs available and they can be used to perform a wide range of tasks,

17
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,710
such as modifying the appearance and behavior of web pages.

18
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:09,340
The Chrome APIs provide access to the DOM of web pages, allowing extensions to modify the content and

19
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,950
layout of pages, or to add new elements.

20
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,060
Interacting with the browser's runtime and storage.

21
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:23,450
The Chrome APIs provide access to the browser's runtime and storage, allowing extension to store and

22
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,420
retrieve data or to interact with the browsers lifecycle.

23
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:33,020
The Chrome APIs also provide access to tabs in the Chrome browser, allowing extensions to create,

24
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:37,190
update and close tabs or to navigate to specific URLs.

25
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:44,840
Also, the Chrome API provide tools for intercepting and modifying network requests made by the browser

26
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:52,190
or web pages, allowing extensions to block or redirect requests or to modify the request or response.

27
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,280
This is precisely how ad blockers work.

28
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,510
Also, they could only be provided tools for sending and receiving messages between the extension and

29
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:06,740
other components, such as the background script, content scripts or other extensions.

30
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:15,230
So to use the Chrome APIs, you need to specify the APIs that the extension will use in the permissions

31
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,240
field in your manifest file.

32
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:24,440
For example, as you can see, tabs and web navigation and storage are APIs.

33
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:32,000
Also, when you want to use an API, it will be very similar to using an in-built function in JavaScript.

34
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:37,220
That being said, in a fit theory, let's get started with some coding.
