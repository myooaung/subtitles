Guys, I understand all this is boring, but I want you to understand the key concepts.

2
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.650
So bear with me, please.

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.590
This will all pay off, I promise.

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:18.600
So the structure of economics extension consists of a manifest file and one or more HTML, CSS, and

5
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.690
JavaScript files.

6
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.490
The manifest file is a decent file that specifies important information about the extension, such as

7
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.040
its name version and permissions.

8
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.770
It also specifies which files make up the extension and how this should be executed.

9
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.300
The HTML, CSS and JavaScript files contain the code that provides the extensions functionality.

10
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.820
These files can be used to add new features to the browser, modify the appearance and functions of

11
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.370
web pages and interact with the user.

12
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.770
So you may think that manifest is sort of the skeleton.

13
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.710
And JavaScript is the method.

14
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.340
Chrome extensions work by adding new functionality to the browser, either through the addition of new

15
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.920
features or the modification of existing ones.

16
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.330
When a user installs an extension, the manifest file is read and the extension is added to the list

17
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.310
of installed extensions in the browser.

18
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.270
The extension is then executed whenever the user performs an action that triggers it, such as visiting

19
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.320
a specific website or click on clicking on a button in the browser.

20
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.740
In addition to adding new functionality to the browser, extensions can also interact with the web pages

21
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:36.880
that the user is viewing.

22
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.790
This is done through the use of content scripts, which are also JavaScript files that are injected

23
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.320
into the web page and can modify its content or interact with its elements.

24
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.290
Don't worry, we will cover these again later on.
