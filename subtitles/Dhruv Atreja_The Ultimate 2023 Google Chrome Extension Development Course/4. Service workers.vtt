00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.280
Okay, so this is the most important component functionality wise.

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:11.760
Service workers are a type of web worker that run in the background of a Web browser and can intercept

3
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:19.800
data requests, access the cache and handle push messages include manifest version three Service workers

4
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.110
can be registered and controlled by an extension, allowing the extension to perform various actions

5
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.280
in the background, even when the extensions user interface is not visible.

6
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.820
To use service workers in the Chrome extension, you need to specify them in the background field of

7
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.660
the manifest file.

8
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:43.860
You can also specify the service worker field to specify the JavaScript file that will be used as the

9
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.640
service worker.

10
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.050
Once the service worker is registered, it can intercept the requests made by the extension or web pages,

11
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.750
allowing the extension to modify the request or response, or to serve a response from the cashier.

12
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.180
The service worker can also listen for push messages, which are messages sent from a server to the

13
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.110
extension and perform actions in response to those messages.

14
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.170
I know this sounds very theoretical, but don't worry, we will do an example very soon.

15
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.670
It will all become very clear.

16
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.370
Service workers are also useful for extensions that need to perform tasks in the background, such as

17
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.060
monitoring changes to a web page or synchronizing data with a server.

18
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.760
They are also useful for improving the performance of an extension by allowing it to cache resources

19
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.830
and serve them from the cache when possible.
