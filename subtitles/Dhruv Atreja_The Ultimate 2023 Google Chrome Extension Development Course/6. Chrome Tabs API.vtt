1
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.940
So in order, manipulation is very easy.

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.360
We are going to move the response to all tabs here.

3
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.520
So all tabs push.

4
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.220
And we are going to push the response.

5
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.770
Let's make it as late.

6
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:32.320
And after that, we can use all types equals to response.

7
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.470
So now we have.

8
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.410
So here all the tabs will be added.

9
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.540
So we are going to run a for loop now.

10
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:58.000
So we are going to run a for loop from the response on the spawn start for each.

11
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.830
And we need the index of time as well.

12
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.070
So we we will have to create an element for each tab, Right?

13
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.390
So we will create an element of a list.

14
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.450
Swords textually without of the title and.

15
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.800
Then we will this will make that app active whenever we click it.

16
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:58.590
So now again, we are using Chrome Tabs API and we are using the update method of that API to make that

17
00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.490
TAB active.

18
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.700
So if TAB is active, then we will add the class active to it.

19
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.540
So.

20
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.050
So we need the index as well.

21
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.500
So index plus one.

22
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.190
And here we have the active class now after the fourth loop.

23
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.950
What we're going to do is we have to append those tabs.

24
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.510
Sorta sorta pentile type element.

25
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.750
So now we have appended the list.

26
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.440
Now let's update.

27
00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.230
We have the error that is properties of NULL.

28
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.880
So it is not able to find this OECD tabs.

29
00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.780
So now what we are going to do is start.

30
00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.900
So instead of that, I will get the tabs here.

31
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:36.570
Let's see.

32
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.010
Okay, so we are still getting the signal.

33
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.770
So now let's change one thing.

34
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.500
Let's go to the manifest and let's change the dates.

35
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.510
So we cannot this here as well.

36
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.590
Rogers.

37
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.360
Okay.

38
00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.760
So it is hard working because this content will return when the document will start, but we don't want

39
00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:38.480
to do that.

40
00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.090
So as you have implemented here.

41
00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.540
So we only want to read Rent when the dome is loaded, right?

42
00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.300
Not when it starts.

43
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.930
So now when I read updated, it should work.

44
00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.440
No, we don't have any other.

45
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.330
And we have extensions.

46
00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.740
So we have our extension ID as well as we have the name of those stubs.

47
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.710
And you can see that whenever I click it, it will make that tab active.

48
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.640
So now that side styling with the help of CSS.

49
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:35.190
So first of all, let's since I'm using let's remove the index because we are already using ordered

50
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.850
lists.

51
00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.400
So that's updated.

52
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.490
And now you can see that it has removed the index, which is looking a lot better.

53
00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:53.600
So.

54
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:08.210
Yeah, I've added some CSS now so that this can look a little better.

55
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.330
So now when I updated, you can see those changes here.

56
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.510
I have just updated the cases.

57
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.380
So let's remove any tab, Right.

58
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.930
So we have to remove those tabs as well.

59
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:38.210
So I will add the functionality for that that whenever the user will double click on it, it will remove

60
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.310
that tab.

61
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:56.600
I won't be focusing on the UK mostly, but I will focus on the facility.

62
00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:02.960
But you can, you know, change the user interface as you see fit.

63
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:16.240
You can add badges as well here or buttons here or crosses to remove the active tabs, but here I'll

64
00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.650
simply do it with a double click.

65
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.610
Because we are not focusing on the user interface, we are focusing on the functionality.

66
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:33.290
So the single click is making the tab active and double click will remove the tab or we can't do it

67
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:35.990
alternatively so.

68
00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:41.450
So when you click on an inactive tab, then it will make it active.

69
00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.020
But if you click on an active tab, it will make it inactive.

70
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:46.760
Let's make it that.

71
00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.040
So I tried the functionality for double click.

72
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:07.720
So tab element dot event listener.

73
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.530
So here it will be double click.

74
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.940
Sort of looks like we'll be there.

75
00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:39.980
We will be having the function and in that we are going to remove the tab, the active tab.

76
00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:47.290
And our tabs start to move tablet ID.

77
00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.750
But we don't want to close the window here.

78
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:01.920
But if you want, you can close it.

79
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:09.990
So that means that for everywhere clicking here, that is closing this window.

80
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:12.630
So let's click on Update.

81
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.900
Now let's remove this tab.

82
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:17.700
Double click here.

83
00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:24.820
Sort of click.

84
00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:28.710
Okay, It is not working.

85
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:30.420
So let's troubleshoot.

86
00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:33.930
Let's do this.

87
00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:34.650
Save this.

88
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:35.200
And.

89
00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:42.910
And now you can see that friend double clicked on this one.

90
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:44.680
So it is moving the tab.

91
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.010
So let me check again.

92
00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.630
Let me open that up again.

93
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.620
And here I will double click on Wikipedia

94
00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:57.740
and.

95
00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:11.970
So double click on this one and you can see that Wikipedia is critically removed.

96
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:16.900
So you can make this user interface a bit more simple.

97
00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:29.860
So when you click on the active tab or the active badge or the button, so you can use whatever user

98
00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:30.850
interface you want.

99
00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:50.890
So before closing this project, let's do something more.

100
00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:55.570
Let's create an element as well.

101
00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:58.810
Let's create a paragraph element.

102
00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:02.650
So not an index will be like this.

103
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:10.110
And we are going to add one more thing here.

104
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:10.920
That is.

105
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.970
So let's create a close element.

106
00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:29.340
Let's hit a button.

107
00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:41.740
So when you click on the P, so instead of tab element, the user click on the P element.

108
00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.930
I'm going to add the P element here.

109
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:49.130
So when the user will click on the P element.

110
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:53.550
Then only there was a really big star back there.

111
00:11:53.570 --> 00:12:00.110
So that means that when you click on the P tag, it will be the that objective.

112
00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.760
So instead of this one.

113
00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:13.600
So I will implement the pointer cursor in the tag.

114
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.660
So here I will add a button.

115
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:22.390
So the event will be on the button to remove.

116
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:28.780
So.

117
00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:36.800
We are going to first append in our text as well.

118
00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:44.470
So butter not value is equal to, let's say, close.

119
00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:00.970
So now let's reload this as we consider changes here.

120
00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:04.840
And we can see that we are getting a button here.

121
00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:12.910
You can see that when you click on this tag, it will be that active that will bring Wikipedia again.

122
00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:18.680
And when I click on that sentence, you can see that we are going to extensions.

123
00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.700
And when I click on the button, it will remove it.

124
00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.060
Let's add in our text for the button.

125
00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:32.810
So as you can see now, we have closed that button.

126
00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:41.620
So when we are clicking on the closed tab, it will make that tab closed.

127
00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:56.070
So let's do one more change.

128
00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:56.550
Uh.

129
00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:05.790
So we just do the simple type element or remove.

130
00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:22.530
And let's make this interactive and now let's close Wikipedia so now we can close inactive tabs as well.

131
00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:32.640
So that's it for this video.

132
00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:34.310
I hope you learn something.

133
00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:38.340
And don't worry, we will be making fun more complex projects later on.

134
00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:43.380
This was just a primitive project to get you familiar with the basics of Chrome extension.
