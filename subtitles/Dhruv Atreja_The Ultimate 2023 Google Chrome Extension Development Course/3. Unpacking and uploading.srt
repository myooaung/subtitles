1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:01,680
So

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,560
I will now tell you how you can add the up pop up as well.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,970
So but first, let's check the background file.

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,980
And then here we are going to write Indexed JS.

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,590
That is for the content script.

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,670
So here we are not going to write a thing for now.

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:27,990
Let's go here.

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,750
Now, simply go to the browser and go to the Chrome extensions.

9
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,820
So this interface will be there.

10
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,930
If you are not getting this, you can just click here, go to settings.

11
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,930
And under that, just click on this extensions view.

12
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,860
Now, now, here what I'm going to do is that you can see the developer mode.

13
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,710
So now we have to load the impact instance and just click on the developer mode.

14
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,320
And you can see the load and packed option.

15
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,530
And now you can see that I am under the folder.

16
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,400
So you can choose your folder here.

17
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:20,100
And you can then upload it so you can see that we have to manage tab extension version 0.1.

18
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,800
So this extension allows you to manage your tabs.

19
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,600
Everything is coming there.

20
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:31,110
So now you can see that we have the inspect you as well as we are under the development mode.

21
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:40,680
So you can see that the service worker and you can see that we have the unpacked extension sign as well.

22
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:46,460
So now that it is already enabled, let me pin this here.

23
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,210
You can see that we have this fun upon clicking on the icon.

24
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:59,500
But it can't change the data.

25
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,560
Also, we can manage our extension.

26
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,940
No, but I will inspect this.

27
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,740
You can see that.

28
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,390
Just go to console.

29
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:18,700
And in the console, nothing is coming because we have loaded the extension successfully.

30
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,110
But we don't have any errors.

31
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,770
But we haven't added in the content script yet.

32
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:31,120
So all the things that are also in the console or in the particular web page that will be done by the

33
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,900
content script, which will be injected into those web pages and all the other background functionality

34
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,760
will be done by the service worker.

35
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,330
So now let's move forward and let's start creating an extension.

36
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:54,160
So before that, let's install this pop here.

37
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,380
Let's show one pop up page so that we can create the user interface first.
