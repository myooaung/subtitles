1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:04,110
So without wasting any time, let's get into the coding part.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,090
I have already opened the empty folder in VTS code and you can see that the folder name is project.

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:16,590
So now first of all, we have to create the manifest JSON file in Manifest or Jason.

4
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,080
Our whole data of the extension is there.

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:26,550
So what files we are going to be using and all the information about the extension will be in the manifest

6
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:27,480
audition file.

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,530
And this one is the most important file of the Chrome extension.

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,330
We have to create this manifest or JSON.

9
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,650
First of all, we have to mention the name of the extension.

10
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:01,300
Then its version will be, let's say, 0.1.

11
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:10,410
Then you have to mention a description about what this person will do.

12
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,480
So for particular widows, it will show.

13
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:35,930
You will be able to see the widows and you will be able to choose the active tabs and manage those tabs.

14
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,490
So we are the manifest version.

15
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,720
So we are using the latest version, which is the manifest version.

16
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,680
So we have to use our service worker here.

17
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:57,520
So instead of background, we are going to use the service workers, our service workers backgrounds.

18
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:01,810
And after that, here we have to mention the permissions.

19
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:05,110
And now let me tell you what is a service worker.

20
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:13,430
So this service worker will be independent of all the tabs and webpages as we have used the background

21
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,030
or JS in previous versions.

22
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,700
You can understand that this will run in the background.

23
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,960
So we have the background key.

24
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:27,400
And for that background we will have a particular service worker.

25
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:31,630
And now we can get all type of permissions.

26
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,760
So we have to pass that in the array.

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,330
So permissions can be tabs or it can be web URL or it can be downloads.

28
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,590
You can ask any type of permission you want.

29
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,990
You can ask for storage permission as well from this.

30
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:50,260
But for now, we are just going to use tabs here.

31
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:56,790
So now the last important thing, we have to mention the actions as well.

32
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:01,200
But I will tell you about this later as to why we need the action here.

33
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,100
So first of all, let's add the content script.

34
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:14,120
So that will depend upon the particular web page and the particular tab.

35
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:20,830
So this will manage all the front end, all the DOM manipulations.

36
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:27,950
So as you can understand that this content script, so it will manage all the content of her Chrome

37
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:31,580
extension or the web page so we can add popups here.

38
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:35,750
So what is a pop up like when you click on that particular extension?

39
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,700
So one web page will open.

40
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,500
One page will open.

41
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,660
So let me show you.

42
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,170
So we have this extension, React Developer Tools.

43
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,080
As you can see, this is the pop up.

44
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,030
So as you can see that this page doesn't appear to be using that.

45
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,680
So this pop up is there.

46
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,040
Now, this pop up is here.

47
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,660
So this is the content script.

48
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,880
And that is a default pop up.

49
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,660
So it can change automatically according to the content script.

50
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,120
Now will enable this fun.

51
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:16,120
And you can see that here it is not having any pop up.

52
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,480
So that action is for the pop up.

53
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,690
And then we have the content script as well.

54
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:28,840
So content script is to manage everything, but here it is taking the help of dev tools.

55
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,240
So that's why it is not having any content script.

56
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:38,320
Okay.

57
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:42,560
So that just means we have matches here, right?

58
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,690
So we can have many content script.

59
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,030
Some matters.

60
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,920
Much as we can.

61
00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:01,700
They present the US in which this transcript will be injected into.

62
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,930
So I mentioned here all the URLs.

63
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:12,760
So that's why this code will be inserted into all the web pages.

64
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:21,760
And here we have to mention all the kinds of JavaScript files and how it will run.

65
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,610
For example, this will detect documents start.
