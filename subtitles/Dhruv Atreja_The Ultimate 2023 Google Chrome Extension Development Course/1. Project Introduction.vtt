Hello, guys.

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.570
Welcome back to the course.

3
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.980
And today, we will build another room project.

4
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.180
And we will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

5
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:23.090
So today we are going to make a color picker so that we can pick the color from any website we want.

6
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.780
So let's your demo first.

7
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.320
So we had Accenture and Tab here.

8
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.350
And here you can see our color picker extension.

9
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:38.300
So whenever you click on it, you can see this pop up and you can see this button.

10
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.960
So when you click on it, you can see now we have this color picker.

11
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.270
And with the help of it, we can

12
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.940
see the color of any webpage.

13
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.650
Nor just a web page, any kind of window.

14
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.210
As you can see, we can see the color that you have picked.

15
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.570
And it is also stored in the clipboard of the computer.

16
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:24.240
So if I press control V, you can see that it was copied to our clipboard.
