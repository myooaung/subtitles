If the name itself contains manifests in it, then it must be very critical for the extension, right?

2
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:08.520
Correct.

3
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.070
A manifest file is a decent file that provides important information about the Chrome extension.

4
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.920
It is the first file that the Chrome browser looks for when an extension is installed.

5
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.980
So open up the template that I've given you in a previous lecture.

6
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:35.460
So the manifest file contains details such as the extensions, name, version, number and description.

7
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:41.100
It also specifies the permissions that the extension requires, as well as the resources it needs to

8
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.790
access.

9
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.300
The manifest file also specifies the service worker script, which is a JavaScript file that runs in

10
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.920
the background of the Chrome browser and allows the extension to perform certain tasks.

11
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.830
This script can be used to modify the behavior of web pages, communicate with other web services,

12
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.450
and to perform other actions in addition to the service worker.

13
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:10.950
The manifest file can also specify contain scripts which are JavaScript files that are injected into

14
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.740
web pages and can interact with the pages.

15
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:21.660
DOM Content scripts can be used to modify the appearance or behavior of web page or to extract information

16
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:22.290
from it.

17
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.940
Pretty cool.
