Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:08,220
OBERING Well, I'm Dhruv Raja, and in this course, I'll cover everything you need to be ready to create

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,360
or work upon the latest version of extensions and the old.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:18,930
Now, most of the material that you will find on the Internet has been outdated due to Google's radical

5
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:26,340
change from manifest version two to version three, including API structure and functionality changes.

6
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:32,970
But don't worry, as I said, I'll teach you everything you need to be ready to create or work upon

7
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,210
the latest versions of extensions and the old.

8
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:43,950
I have talked about this topic in various seminars and workshops and I will cover the topics in four

9
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:49,680
levels of expertise and I promise by the end of it you will have everything you need to start working

10
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,370
on your own.

11
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,100
One of the primary benefits of extension development is the low barrier to entry.

12
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:02,850
And unlike other types of software development, which often requires significant resources and expertise,

13
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:09,210
extension development is relatively simple and can be done by anyone with a basic understanding of web

14
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,140
technologies.

15
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:16,890
This means that it is possible to get started as an extension developer with minimal upfront investment.

16
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:21,060
If you know the basics of JavaScript and HTML, you are good to go.

17
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,170
Even though it is simple, it is highly profitable.

18
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:31,860
And I personally have three extensions on the web store which make more than $3,000 per month.

19
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,140
And a simple search on LinkedIn will tell you how in-demand these job profiles are.

20
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,640
That being said, let's get started with the course outline.
