00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:01.200
Okay.

2
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.690
Finally, we get to the interesting stuff.

3
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:10.110
Content scripts are JavaScript files that are injected into the web pages and can interact with the

4
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:10.500
pages.

5
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.760
DOM Which means that you can modify the appearance or behavior of a page and you can extract information

6
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.420
from it.

7
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.770
To include Java to include content scripts.

8
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.900
In a Chrome extension, you need to specify them in the content scripts field of the manifest file.

9
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.820
You can specify the matches field to specify the units of the web pages.

10
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.880
So here, if we get a GitHub.com page, then we will inject our script into it.

11
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.250
Now, if you know anything about the illustrations, this expression will match any website.

12
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:53.830
So instead of GitHub, now we can inject our foreground or script into the web page of any website.

13
00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:00.010
As you can see, we access the body of that web page and then we set its background color to red.

14
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.720
Let's see if this works.

15
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:09.640
Keep in mind that whenever you update the manifest of an extension, you have to delete that extension

16
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.980
from your chrome and then re upload it.

17
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:20.290
Now, as you can see, we have changed the background color of all the web pages content scripts may

18
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:26.050
have limited access to the Chrome extension API, but they can interact with the web pages dom and send

19
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.750
messages to the extensions background script.

20
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.480
They can also listen for messages from the background script that is the service worker and perform

21
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.920
actions in response.
