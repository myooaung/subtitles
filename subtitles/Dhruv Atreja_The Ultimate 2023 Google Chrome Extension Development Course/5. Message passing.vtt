00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:05.760
Let's not focus too much on the UNO.

2
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.940
So I'll be using our tags here and here I'm going to use ID.

3
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.070
So that would be extension tabs.

4
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:34.700
And here we will venture all the tabs so we can do that with the help of DOM manipulation and with the

5
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.500
help of popular Jews.

6
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.770
Now let's see if you have access to any tabs by using Chrome tabs, which is an API.

7
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.110
So as you can see, currently we are not getting the tabs.

8
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.050
Okay.

9
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.590
But now first, let's see that.

10
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.340
Do we have access to the window?

11
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.040
So if content is loaded, what function would be there?

12
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.060
So we have to add Chrome tabs here for that.

13
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:29.560
First of all, I'm writing the console here to check if we are getting access to the window.

14
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.790
So as you can see, we are getting down fully loaded.

15
00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.960
So we do have access to the window and we can check if the dome is loaded.

16
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:49.540
Now let's try chrome dot tabs again, or even just chrome.

17
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.200
Oh, so now we are getting load times, rain times, etc..

18
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.510
So right click here and this can change on all sides.

19
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.900
So we have site access.

20
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:11.710
That's great.

21
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.890
So let's get the oil from this one.

22
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.200
So that will be documented.

23
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.100
Senator.

24
00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:29.890
And we have to select.

25
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.430
And we have to select from ID.

26
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.980
So we will use a hashtag and we will select the oil element.

27
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.700
So now we have to get all the tabs here.

28
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.360
So we will present all the tabs in an array.

29
00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:01.140
And now we will push the query here for the Chrome tabs is a Chrome API, which I have covered before.

30
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.210
So.

31
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.790
For console lot log all tabs.

32
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.500
As you can see, we are still getting a letter which is cannot read properties of undefined.

33
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.920
This means that we are not getting access to this chrome dot tabs.

34
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.010
So let's see how we can get access to columnar tabs.

35
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.360
So the solution is pretty obvious.

36
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.150
It is because we don't have the necessary permissions yet.

37
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:07.740
So we are going to send the message from pop up to background noises because we cannot use chrome tabs

38
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.270
from the background script.

39
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:17.970
So we will access Chrome tabs from the pop up file and we will send them to the background file.

40
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.300
So in the transcript we have six written, so it means that we are applying cases globally.

41
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.730
So that means we are applying sources to all the other websites as well.

42
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.100
But this.

43
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.990
Yes, I should work only for a pop up, but it should not work for all other websites.

44
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:04.980
So we will remove the CSS from the content script and we will use the CSS just for our pop up.

45
00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:20.570
So when we update this and now we can see that our SIS was not is not affecting the webpage.

46
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.340
So now let's send a message to background this and let's get a list of all the tabs.

47
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.650
Now let's see how we can do it.

48
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.450
We have to go to poverty.

49
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:40.020
Yes.

50
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:44.820
And instead of this, what we're going to do is we're going to remove the soil.

51
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.520
And here I'm going to send one message here.

52
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.010
So how we can send a message?

53
00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.400
We will send the message with chrome and time.

54
00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.700
So we're going to use Chrome and time dot send message.

55
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.280
So send message is also an API and runtime is also a Chrome API.

56
00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:22.000
So this is our default syntax for sending messages in Chrome between different files.

57
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.820
So here we are going to take of time on message.

58
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.960
So we will listen to the messages.

59
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:53.010
So you can see that in the popular days I have spent time here, that is, get tabs.

60
00:06:53.730 --> 00:07:01.460
So wherever the message is coming through background or JS, it will listen to all the requests which

61
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.940
after type get tabs.

62
00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:07.050
So that is how you send and listen to messages in chrome extensions.

63
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.260
So now,

64
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.350
after listening to that query, we can send responses as well.

65
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:30.170
So as you can see, we have a center that is from where this request is sent.

66
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:38.150
So if you are sending our response back and we're getting that response back in this pop up script.

67
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:42.110
So now let's see that in just.

68
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:49.550
So let's clear these past errors and update.

69
00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:52.700
Updated.

70
00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:56.780
And as you can see now, we have access to all our apps.

71
00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:03.330
We are getting two tabs and that is pretty good, right?

72
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:10.370
And keep in mind, this is something that you'll be doing very often with Chrome extensions, that is

73
00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:17.330
sending messages between files, because a lot of times you will see that the background file does not

74
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:18.560
have a lot of permissions.

75
00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:22.400
So you really have to use service workers and pop up files.
