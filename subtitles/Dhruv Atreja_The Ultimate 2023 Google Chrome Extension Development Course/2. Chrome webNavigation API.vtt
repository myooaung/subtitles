WEBVTT
1
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:08.490
So we have to catch whether people go to certain websites, which is basically the actual functionality

2
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.050
of this extension.

3
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.260
So that's the main functionality of our extension, which we will look upon right now.

4
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.190
So we're going to put a couple of things in it.

5
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:31.720
So I'll put some space at the top because we will put some in there shortly.

6
00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:40.210
So the first thing that we need to do is we need to catch when the user goes to a certain web page.

7
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.280
So let's say chrome dot navigation.

8
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.970
We want to catch it before they navigate.

9
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.810
Right?

10
00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.290
Or when they're about to go somewhere that's going to catch them.

11
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.920
So we are listed.

12
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.970
So it will get triggered whenever we navigate.

13
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.820
We are about to navigate to a specific web page.

14
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.950
So.

15
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.660
They're going to greater function in here, which is the callback function.

16
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.340
So we'll put one parameter in here with the details.

17
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.240
So we're going to put all the things that we do in our function.

18
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.700
So we're going to call the Chrome dot tabs dot update.

19
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.020
Which will.

20
00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.160
Change something little to the tabs that you want to change.

21
00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.130
So we'll get the tab that we're currently in by getting details.

22
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.260
Dot tab ID.

23
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:28.090
And then we need to specify where we want to update the tabs to.

24
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.360
So the flower needs to be an object.

25
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.320
So we want to update the URL of the tab.

26
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.280
And we want to send it to Chrome.

27
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.540
Dot time, dot.

28
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:08.040
So we want to send them to any web page that we want instead of the Web page that they want to go to.

29
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.820
So I've added an alternate page to send them to.

30
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:34.050
So where this page is located, it will be different on everybody's chrome.

31
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.740
So we'll go on the registry with the folder and create all page start.
