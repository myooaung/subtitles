This topic may seem alien at first, but I promise if you keep following what I do in your machine,

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,600
you will have no issues whatsoever.

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:15,450
Keep in mind that there is very limited documentation and due to rules for the latest version of Chrome

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,230
extensions.

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,430
So a lot of resources you may try to look up might be outdated.

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,900
Also, one more tip, try to tweak each code just a little bit.

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,930
The more you play with extensions, the faster you learn.

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,280
Best of luck.
