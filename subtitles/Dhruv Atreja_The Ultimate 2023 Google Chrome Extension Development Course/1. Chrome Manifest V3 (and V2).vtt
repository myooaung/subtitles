Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:02.650
Welcome back.

3
00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.870
I promise we have almost reached the interesting coding part, but before that, I want to give you

4
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:13.600
a brief overview of what the latest version of Chrome extension is and how it differs from the previous

5
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.140
version.

6
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.780
You might see a few things that you don't understand, but don't worry, we will cover that stuff again

7
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:20.380
later.

8
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.130
Just try to get a feel for things and I promise things will become clearer.

9
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.810
So recently Google released Chrome Manifest version three, a major update that introduced a number

10
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.970
of significant changes and improvements.

11
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.700
These changes were designed to improve the security performance, reliability of Chrome extensions,

12
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.030
as well as to make the development process easier for developers.

13
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.400
Or at least that is the official story.

14
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:53.380
It has actually made development more difficult because of the poor documentation provided for Chrome

15
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.550
manifest Version three.

16
00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.160
The most important change is the use of service workers instead of background scripts.

17
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.400
But don't worry, I will tell you what these are in the coming videos.

18
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:10.960
Also, one of the key changes in Chrome Manifest version three is the introduction of declarative request,

19
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.060
a new API that allows extensions to modify network request using declarative routes.

20
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.530
So we will cover that in detail as well.

21
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:30.310
Also an important change in this version is that in the introduction of isolated words which allow extensions

22
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:38.050
to run in their own dedicated processes, this helps the this helps to prevent extensions from interfering

23
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.560
with each other and improves the overall stability of the browser.

24
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:43.160
Okay.

25
00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.140
Now for the boring stuff.

26
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.960
I promise we will start hands on coding very soon.
