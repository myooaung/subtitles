1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,020
This is an alternate page that we want to redirect to.

2
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,100
So.

3
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,400
Yeah.

4
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:26,780
Like, I'm sure you know, basic HTML and there is nothing that you need to learn here.

5
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,890
I've just done it the same time and I've added this code again.

6
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,410
I've added all of this code below so you can just access it.

7
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,610
So I like the class attribute.

8
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:54,340
We want to add some space between the limits.

9
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:57,670
So.

10
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:02,860
That's why I wanted the space.

11
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:03,490
Plus.

12
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,080
If you're confused.

13
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:12,710
And then I've added some way to control them.

14
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,410
Control the extension, for example, as those button.

15
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:27,730
So yeah, like if you want to take a break or you actually need to access YouTube for the project so

16
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,760
you can just use the extension whenever you want.

17
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,470
So these are some controls in here that will add.

18
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:46,060
So we have a paragraph telling us how long we should snooze it for.

19
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:53,540
And we have put our input where we will put the number of minutes that we want to snooze it for.

20
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,390
And then we have an image down here, you know, just for good looks.

21
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:30,710
And then we have a script to make all of this interactive.

22
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:38,390
So let's clear our script.

23
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,940
So let's actually go back to background.

24
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,440
So I'll put one more thing in here.

25
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,480
We want to specify which one else it should catch.

26
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,020
Right.

27
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,030
So we'll create an array.

28
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,970
And it will have all the URLs that we want to catch.

29
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:29,120
So this was one area of object.

30
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,460
So what we want to match and how we want to match it.

31
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,330
You can match it against their domain.

32
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,240
You can match it against the exact URL.

33
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,750
So right now, we only care about the domain.

34
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:57,550
So we will use host contents, which means that whatever we write here is anywhere in the URL, then

35
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:00,610
it will get triggered and we will catch that with it.

36
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,480
You can think of other methods as well.

37
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,410
So let's look.

38
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,270
Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, Reddit.

39
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,650
So make sure it's in an area.

40
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:35,510
And we are going to add it on the end of the year for navigate listed.

41
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,640
So this parameter is going to be a URL filter.

42
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:48,810
So do this event or add this listener for certain URLs or events.

43
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:57,600
So here we will add the others that you wanted to filter, which we're going to rename this as filter.

44
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,750
And we are going to pass this array.

45
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:05,790
So we want to filter these words.

46
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:15,180
So whenever we are able to navigate to these URLs, extension will get triggered and our listener will

47
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:15,960
get triggered.

48
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,570
So let's test this right now.

49
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:32,230
If we try to go to any of these sites, it should block us every time.

50
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:36,820
So let's go to other extensions and I'll reload.

51
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,970
So let's try to go to one of those sites.

52
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,430
So, sweetie.

53
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:46,940
Yeah.

54
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,920
It's -- great.

55
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,310
It's going to the page we want.

56
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,480
For what?

57
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,330
Okay, so it's working just fine.

58
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:11,680
So as you can see, we can go to any website if we just start part of the blog.

59
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,490
What else?

60
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,410
Okay, let's see.

61
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,050
Look.

62
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:26,680
So.

63
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:34,730
Okay.

64
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:43,620
So that is because we close a tab after before it's updated, but it has nothing to do with the functionality

65
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,960
of the website, so you can just ignore it for now.

66
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,990
It's not breaking our extension or breaking our code.

67
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,680
So what's the next thing?

68
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:01,210
We're going to get back to that all star jazz.

69
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,700
And we want to handle the snooze button.

70
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:23,330
So very to get reference to the input so that we can see how long we need to snooze for.

71
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,660
So let's say minutes input equals to document dot get element by ID.

72
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,710
And it's the exact same thing here.

73
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:48,820
It's always a good idea to label the variable and the idea the same so that you always know what you're

74
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,750
talking about.

75
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:09,020
So the main thing that we want to do is just listen to the button and do a bunch of things from there.

76
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:15,260
So we had to put a North event listener.

77
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,320
And then we need to tell it what happens when the spotlight is clicked?

78
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,630
So we write the number of minutes that you want to use it for.

79
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,090
Minutes.

80
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,290
Important value.

81
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:47,460
But this is going to return a string and we want a number.

82
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,810
So we're going to limit it to a number in this method.

83
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:02,040
So this will convert whatever the string is to the mid.

84
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:08,780
And if it is not a number, then it will come to an end, which means not in them would.

85
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,560
Suave also specified a time for this input.

86
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,050
That is type is equal to the amount that you cannot put into any.

87
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,900
Cannot put anything into this, which is not a number.

88
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,830
So that's why we don't have to worry about any right now.

89
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,440
But 5 minutes is less than zero.

90
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:47,600
For example, if you put a negative number, then inside 2 minutes equal to zero.

91
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:06,350
So we are going to check if we are past the end of the snooze time.

92
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,790
But if the snooze hasn't finished yet, then we'll just let it go.

93
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:24,800
So we create a now user data object, which has all the data information you could ever need, including

94
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,370
time.

95
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,170
I will create another date.

96
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,530
And we will discuss what we want this year to be.

97
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,550
So we're going to do get time.

98
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,580
Which will be in the milliseconds.

99
00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:01,550
And then we're going to add 60,000 times the number of minutes.

100
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,200
Yeah.

101
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:12,350
So we're adding a number of milliseconds, which.

102
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:20,460
Takes us to the date to which we want to snooze.

103
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:31,540
Through Chrome dot Storage Dot sync.

104
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,870
They're going to set a value.

105
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:47,200
So we specify again our object and our callback function.

106
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:51,230
In fact, we don't even need a callback function right now.

107
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,410
We just want to set the object.

108
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:09,070
So they're going to call this and snooze.

109
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:17,400
Because it's the loose ends and we set it to new date.

110
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,290
And you do it here, It's a variable.

111
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:28,050
So we're going to put it in the date value.

112
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:36,350
So you would think that if you did this, it would work, right?

113
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,610
But it doesn't.

114
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,610
Because it has some issue with different date objects.

115
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:59,730
So this is a shortcoming at the storage API.

116
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:06,030
So instead of using just NuGet, we're going to convert it into a JSON function.

117
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:12,130
Which converted into this object, which is much easier to handle for Chrome.

118
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,460
So whatever.

119
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,340
Yeah.

120
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:31,650
So if it's loose for 10 minutes, then I'm in the database for 20 minutes.

121
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,560
Then it will override the previous snooze value.

122
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,740
So great.

123
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,140
Now, what do we need to do?

124
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:57,260
We need to modify our web navigation events to see if they are currently snoozed or not.

125
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,140
So they're going to have to add extra logic in this.

126
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:18,890
So the first thing that we need to do is we need to check if we're in study mode or at all.

127
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,210
So we only want to do this stuff when we are in study mode.

128
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:27,490
So.

129
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,570
So these are great.

130
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:37,550
And we're going to get the mode where we put our study mode values.

131
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:45,650
So the default value will be false because if we haven't stored anything, then we will get false.

132
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,310
So after we get this, what do we want to do with it?

133
00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:02,880
What you want to do is that we want to do details parameter in here.

134
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:10,350
If details dot mode.

135
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:16,950
And it is a boolean, which is either true or false.

136
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:25,240
So f side mode is on, then we want to see if we have to block them or not.

137
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:29,410
If it isn't on, then we don't want to do anything at all.

138
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:36,290
So we need to get us straight.

139
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:41,750
So again, we need to access chrome footage for that.

140
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,980
We are getting a hard and snooze.

141
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,260
And by default.

142
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,670
What would you put the default value?

143
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,760
They could put it.

144
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,530
That would be better.

145
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,300
So their default value is nil.

146
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,890
If you cannot get any date.

147
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:27,390
So if you put details in here, we'll have to we'll have a lot of variables with with the details.

148
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,780
So we need to change the variable names.

149
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,000
Let's name it more details.

150
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,400
And we'll call it a snooze.

151
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,090
Details.

152
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:59,160
So.

153
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:19,390
So the first thing that we need to check is if those three days is equal to null.

154
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,230
This means we have never snoozed.

155
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,280
In which case we have no problem.

156
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:29,290
Or we want to check.

157
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,250
If.

158
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:48,020
If the if the snooze date is less than the current date.

159
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:08,530
So the conditional first text, if we have a smooth straight line at all or if there is a smooth detail.

160
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,180
So we have to convert it back into a date and.

161
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:21,900
Right.

162
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,340
If you remember, we put it into JSON format.

163
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:35,090
So I'll convert it into a date first and then I will check if it is less than the current date or not.

164
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:39,790
If it is less than means, we still want to block it.

165
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:56,900
Pardon me If the date is less than that means that there is still some time remaining for this move.

166
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:59,760
So we want to just let it go and we don't want to block it.

167
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,970
So chrome dot tab sort of date.

168
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:08,790
Again, we update the tab just like we did before.

169
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:16,800
And you have to wait for it to finish since it is and is your greatest function.

170
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,700
The URL filters at the bottom.

171
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,310
Okay.

172
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:44,350
So let's go ahead and test it.

173
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,380
We'll deal with that extension.

174
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,790
Let's start with starting this off.

175
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,430
So let's go to YouTube.

176
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,820
I say the word is off, so we should not catch anything.

177
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:08,860
It's working.

178
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,930
So let's toggle it on.

179
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,230
We can't.

180
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:21,640
So that means that our extension is working fine.

181
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,500
Let's try to sit here for 1 minutes.

182
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,420
I'll click the mouse button.

183
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,100
And that will save it to storage.

184
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,010
So let's go back to YouTube.

185
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:38,650
Study mode is still on.

186
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,310
Oh, no.

187
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,020
Let's check if there are any errors.

188
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,690
Cannot read properties of null.

189
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,050
Let me see if I typed something incorrectly.

190
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,270
Well, I don't think I call it snooze button.

191
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:26,490
That's why I called it Snooze.

192
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,680
I'll change it to snooze button.

193
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,990
And.

194
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,220
Yeah.

195
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,570
So that should.

196
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,250
Let's go back.

197
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,580
So let's reload the extension.

198
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:58,680
So let's block it for one minute.

199
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:03,000
Let's check the console to see if there were any errors.

200
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,610
This time, no errors.

201
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,680
So let's try it now.

202
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:09,060
Go back to YouTube.

203
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,140
And it's going to let us through.

204
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:17,020
So that date has been saved.
