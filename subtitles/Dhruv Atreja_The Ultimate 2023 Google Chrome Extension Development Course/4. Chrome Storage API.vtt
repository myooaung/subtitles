00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.890
Also one more thing.

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.410
It's pretty interesting.

3
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.250
So as we saw and start this background jazz.

4
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.750
So for example, let color.

5
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.040
Let her be considered.

6
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.060
So this file is being run inside the service worker.

7
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.060
So we can add this list here.

8
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.310
So that chrome dot runtime dot on install.

9
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.000
Third add listener.

10
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.040
So this is how we defined the callback.

11
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.760
Chrome dart storage.

12
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.360
So this is the storage API in the browser.

13
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:10.380
So chrome dot storage dot sync, which you can access from the service worker.

14
00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.620
So now we can see our colors as well.

15
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:32.560
So we can save whatever data we want into the browser using storage.

16
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.240
So now we can save it through the browser as well.

17
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.340
Lets access it.

18
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:47.470
Chrome.

19
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.540
Dart Storage.

20
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.440
Dart Sync.

21
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.510
Dart Gate.

22
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.950
It.

23
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.730
So let's give a callback.

24
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:16.810
So now we'll receive the whole object using color destructor and get the colored property.

25
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.590
So console.log color.

26
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.630
Okay, let's try.

27
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.430
So I'll do fresh air.

28
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.790
Let's clear it and let's go back.

29
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.720
And let's go here and pick color.

30
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.390
Let's click on this.

31
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.510
And nothing is happening, but we're getting another.

32
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.010
And of undefined.

33
00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.160
Again, we have to go to the manifest and we have to declare this permission of storage so that we can

34
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.510
use the storage API.

35
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.600
Now, it should work.

36
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.670
That's three fish.

37
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.100
No.

38
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.270
Let's go ahead.

39
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.480
The color picker.

40
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.460
Okay, So let's go to the console of the pop up.

41
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.330
And as you can see now, we can access the storage as well.

42
00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.450
So let's add another extension.

43
00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.210
So this is a famous extension which does the same thing.

44
00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.620
So you can see options here.

45
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.210
So it opens a Web page for options.

46
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:10.280
Let's see.

47
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.960
An extension is very complex.

48
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:22.870
So you want another user interface for user to do whatever you want in a new web page.

49
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.970
So you can create a new web page by adding options.

50
00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.880
The property of options.

51
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.830
So our options page and let's add options.

52
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.920
HTML.

53
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.410
So let's go to options dot HTML.

54
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.180
So it's great.

55
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.870
It's fun.

56
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:16.840
And here you can have your details detailed your way.

57
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.760
So similarly, we can add a JavaScript file for this here.

58
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.700
Let's not do it right now.

59
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.650
But you can if you want to, so you can add this folder settings.

60
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.730
So let's refresh.

61
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.150
And let's come here.

62
00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:46.250
Color picker.

63
00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.370
So let's right click on this.

64
00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.050
And now we can see options.

65
00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.490
So let's click on it.

66
00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.730
Here you can have your detailed user interface.

67
00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.100
So you can either custom settings for their extension here.

68
00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.710
So finally, the exchange is ready.

69
00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.380
Let's test it.

70
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:19.080
Finally.

71
00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:20.930
I have apps.

72
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.740
I've opened this website.

73
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.280
Let's pick a color and let's pick any color we want.

74
00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:31.560
Let's say this color.

75
00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.170
And this is the color we are getting.

76
00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:41.400
And I have stored this color clipboard, so it's working fine.

77
00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.580
And if you want to publish it, you can do it as well.

78
00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.880
You just have to create a Google account.

79
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:58.490
And just upload the zip file there.

80
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:05.530
And that way anybody can use that extension.

81
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.110
It's pretty simple stuff.

82
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:16.760
I hope you got some knowledge from this video and I'll see you in the next.
