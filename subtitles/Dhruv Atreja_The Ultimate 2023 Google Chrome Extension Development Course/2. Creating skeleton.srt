1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,740
So this is a starting template.

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:10,660
I have three images which should look a little bigger.

3
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,310
But we also use for the extension icon.

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,520
So I'll make a file manifest or Jason.

5
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,650
As I've covered in the previous videos as well.

6
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:36,830
This is the file that contains all the metadata about our extension.

7
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,260
So let's give the name color picker.

8
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,750
Okay, So our version is, let's say 1.0.

9
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,560
You can put anything.

10
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,490
It doesn't matter.

11
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:24,390
But the manifest version is important and we are working upon the latest version.

12
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,160
That is version three.

13
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,590
Now we have our background.

14
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,680
I've already covered.

15
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,610
What background does it contains?

16
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,970
Our service worker.

17
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,880
So let's make ourselves a soccer file.

18
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,540
So let's go to the browser and manage our extensions.

19
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:40,560
We have selected developer mode, which you need to upload your extension directly.

20
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,830
I will teach you how to publish a sentence later on.

21
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,200
So you turn on the developer mode.

22
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:57,970
And you click on Lord and Bag and then you open the folder you want.

23
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,010
So.

24
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,050
As you can see, we have had extension here.

25
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,290
It is the unique idea of extension and service worker.

26
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,040
I've already covered what it does.

27
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,640
If you have any doubts, you can look up it.

28
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,470
Look it up in the previous videos.

29
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:35,670
So let's give a custom icon.

30
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:44,040
You go to the manifest and you add a property of icons.

31
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:56,420
And you can give icons for different sizes.

32
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,820
I have added those icons in below in the description.

33
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:17,830
So we have and we did saw different sizes.

34
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:42,700
So now you can see that when we refresh it, we see the icon.

35
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,530
So let's refresh it.

36
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:07,020
Now we can see a little bit good, but it is not clickable right now because you have to do some more

37
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,510
work before it becomes clickable.

38
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,240
Let's go to manifest.

39
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,170
We have to add a property of actions.

40
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,420
Default pop up.

41
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,040
We have had undeclared power before.

42
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,960
That's why it wasn't clickable, because there was the issue upon clicking.

43
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:44,030
Now that we have added a pop up, it should become soluble now.

44
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,450
We create this HTML file for the popup.

45
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,990
So we have added a pop file.

46
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,410
Now alerts are a JavaScript file.

47
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,860
So let's see what our Pop-Pop does.

48
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,640
So let's refresh it.

49
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,240
So let's see.

50
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,260
It's labeled, right?

51
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,790
So let's see what the issue is.

52
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:17,050
Okay, so this cog icon denotes that this is our service worker.

53
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,210
So it's efficient.

54
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:27,520
And now you can see, like goodness, viewable and clickable.

55
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,110
Right now, don't worry about colors.

56
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,530
That's a different extension.

57
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,690
I have Color picker is our extension.

58
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:41,990
So when you click on it, you can see the color picker, the Ashford tag that I inserted.

59
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:46,450
So.

60
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:58,280
You could see that this these pop ups, which almost every extension has, these are these pop up table

61
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,520
which you can notify in actions.

62
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,420
So welcome to my color picker.

63
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:17,000
So we have our button class.

64
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,760
Change color between.

65
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:25,950
Pickle.

66
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,080
So let's make a div.

67
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:43,190
And let's give a class to this div and selected colored.

68
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,600
So we are going to show the selected color inside this div.

69
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:56,450
Let's make a span and give it a glass.

70
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,200
And we will show the color in this pan.

71
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,350
So let's name it Color grid.

72
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:16,460
And we then need this pan to show the hex value of the color.

73
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,010
By default, it will be empty.

74
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,570
So let's refresh it and let's see.

75
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,250
Okay.

76
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,750
As you can see now, we have our button here.

77
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,010
Or let's style it a little.

78
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:50,070
So, yeah, we have declared a stylesheet pop up dot CSS.

79
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,750
So we select the body first.

80
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:06,770
So since this is a pop up file, we are talking about the body of the pop up and not body of the webpage

81
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:11,820
contents, which will deal with the body of the webpage and pop up will deal with the body of the pop

82
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,190
up.

83
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:20,400
So we have our background color.

84
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,690
So let's make a diff here.

85
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:35,150
And then insert our code into it.

86
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,820
So.

87
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,610
We have created a different class rapper.

88
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,480
So we have our rapid.

89
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:07,120
So the first thing that we have to do is we have to sit with.

90
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,320
Text the line.

91
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,460
The text to center.

92
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,410
So let's check it.

93
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:29,830
So as you can see, we have changed the background color and all the things have come to the center.

94
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,760
So let's click the button.

95
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,060
And now we have our change color button.

96
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:48,390
And now we have width of 200 pixels and outline none.

97
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,740
Border none.

98
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,650
Let's put some border radius.

99
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,480
For round corners.

100
00:11:58,490 --> 00:11:59,420
So let's do it.

101
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:06,650
Two peaks just a little bit, and we want the padding to be, let's say, five pixels.

102
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,850
And let's give her some Veronica the.

103
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,160
So let's put this color.

104
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,740
And of course, should we point at.

105
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,720
So now you can see.

106
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,300
So after clicking it, let's say we have a color picker.
