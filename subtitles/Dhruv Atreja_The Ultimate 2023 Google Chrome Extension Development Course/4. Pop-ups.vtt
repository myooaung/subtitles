00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.860
So you can see that I amended the content script indexed file.

2
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.350
So here just write console.log.

3
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.680
In order to update it, you can just click on this refresh button.

4
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:26.300
Now, whenever I refresh the page, I can deface a web page and I can see Hello World here.

5
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.310
So.

6
00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.720
So this means how the content script is working.

7
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.360
So let's add a user interface.

8
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:56.240
We'll go to first and we will add one action here for the pop up.

9
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.070
So let's start with our HTML code.

10
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.390
We will write Hello World and let's see what happens.

11
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.170
You can see we're not getting anything.

12
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.530
So we have to refresh the page, the extension.

13
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.750
And now you can see we are getting Hello World.

14
00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.330
So now we are getting Hello World in our puppet.

15
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.150
Just read this and you can see that Hello world is the.

16
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.870
So what do we have to do?

17
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.210
We have to add the DJs file for this pop up.

18
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.320
So how can we either file for this pop up?

19
00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.100
Let's see.

20
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.960
So here we will mention pop up DJs.

21
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.340
So I'll go to HTML and I will add a link for this script.

22
00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.410
So you can see that to start recognizing, recognizing this popular jazz.

23
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.190
That is because we have to mention this JavaScript file in the section of content scripts.

24
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.720
So now it will recognize the PowerPoint file because we have mentioned it in the manifest.

25
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:26.220
So you update on the extension and now you can see that we have popular filed.

26
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.020
Now.

27
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.250
It's very interesting.

28
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.650
So let's just create a simple user interface instead of this one.

29
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.390
And I'm going to use Edge five here, or let it be at six.

30
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.730
And here I will be using.

31
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.900
Manage chrome tabs.

32
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.420
See if this and updated

33
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:07.710
and now you can see getting this manage chrome tabs now that that size is very small.

34
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.350
So we have to the size of this pop up as well.

35
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.920
So we are going to create CSS file

36
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.670
and this SS file will also have to be mentioned in the manifest.

37
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.860
So for that, we're going to create this.

38
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.820
And here this will be style starts.

39
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:34.470
Yes.

40
00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.900
So just save this and we have to add this and link it in the HTML header.

41
00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.320
So to save this.

42
00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.190
So it's hard for the body.

43
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.840
Actually, this should be.

44
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.850
Yeah.

45
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.030
This would be a minimum, right?

46
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.150
Actually, not Max worth.

47
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.050
Yeah.

48
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.150
So now you can see the changes.

49
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.350
We are getting a much bigger pop up.
