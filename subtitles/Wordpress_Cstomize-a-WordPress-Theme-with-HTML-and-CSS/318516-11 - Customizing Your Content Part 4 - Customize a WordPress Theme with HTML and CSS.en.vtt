00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.010
The following block is pretty simple.

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.450
We just need two columns,

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.015
one is with the text, another with the button.

00:00:06.015 --> 00:00:10.875
Here, I'm going to add new, and two columns.

00:00:10.875 --> 00:00:13.005
Let me check if they're two.

00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:14.985
Yes, they are.

00:00:14.985 --> 00:00:17.415
I want it to be full width,

00:00:17.415 --> 00:00:22.695
and here I'm going to put a heading, H3.

00:00:22.695 --> 00:00:31.815
It's going to say, "Want To Know More About Our Company."

00:00:31.815 --> 00:00:41.700
Here I need a button and in the text I'm going to put Learn More.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.315
I want the background color to be more to turquoise

00:00:47.315 --> 00:00:53.775
and brighter, so update.

00:00:53.775 --> 00:00:55.410
They don't like this combination,

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.740
they think the contrast is too old to read,

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.620
but I'm going to leave it for now.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.085
Here I want to put the link to our About page.

00:01:04.085 --> 00:01:10.495
I have created a dummy page about us just to have a place holder,

00:01:10.495 --> 00:01:12.105
see there's nothing in it.

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:14.895
But I need this URL here,

00:01:14.895 --> 00:01:20.860
copy, go back to the front page, edit.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:28.680
Where is the button? Here, going to put the URL link, so update.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.690
I want this block to have a light gray background color,

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.325
and I can do that here.

00:01:34.325 --> 00:01:36.710
I have to put an advanced CSS class,

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.600
I'm going to put more block,

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.415
update, head to my style sheet.

00:01:44.415 --> 00:01:46.170
In the Style Sheet,

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.590
I'm going to add the class more block,

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:58.140
and say background color,

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:05.190
light gray, save and update,

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.245
and check in the browser view page.

00:02:10.245 --> 00:02:12.500
What happened? It's light gray,

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.205
but I can't read anything and the button is way up there.

00:02:16.205 --> 00:02:21.470
So go back to this style sheet and

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:28.260
say more block also has to have a color of gray,

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:38.485
update that and check, yes.

00:02:38.485 --> 00:02:43.189
But I also wanted to have a padding top,

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:46.590
top and bottom, but top.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:54.525
Heading 2.2, run.

00:02:54.525 --> 00:02:56.410
Let's see how that looks like.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:05.025
Yes, moving too fast, update.

00:03:05.025 --> 00:03:07.275
Yeah, that looks a bit better,

00:03:07.275 --> 00:03:11.505
but maybe a bit less of padding,

00:03:11.505 --> 00:03:15.190
and I want this button to be more on the right.

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.515
I need this class here.

00:03:19.515 --> 00:03:21.960
I think it's going to be,

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.310
yes, WP block button.

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.235
I'm going to just say edit as HTML,

00:03:32.235 --> 00:03:36.975
and copy this WP block button, copy,

00:03:36.975 --> 00:03:43.730
go back to Style Sheet and then say padding top is going to be 2.1,

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.660
and padding bottom is going to be 1rem.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.090
Then I need this

00:03:53.090 --> 00:04:02.810
more WP block button class.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:13.470
It has to have a margin left, let's say 4rem.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.370
Let's see how this looks like now.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.810
Refresh, that looks a bit more acceptable.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.930
But you know, there's a lot of detail work to do,

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.130
would have a states and all these nicer things like I want to

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:36.090
have more of an emphasis in this block, etc.

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.105
Next block is just a copy of this one.

00:04:38.105 --> 00:04:40.505
It has a text on the left and an image on the right.

00:04:40.505 --> 00:04:42.950
We're going to do exactly just that.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.735
Here's our first block.

00:04:44.735 --> 00:04:46.845
I'm going to select it here,

00:04:46.845 --> 00:04:48.440
and in this menu,

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.665
I'm going to select Duplicate. That's it.

00:04:51.665 --> 00:04:55.670
I have to change the media to show on the right,

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:01.514
and I also have to change this image here,

00:05:01.514 --> 00:05:08.725
select, pretty easy, and then I want to push it all the way below this more block.

00:05:08.725 --> 00:05:13.400
I forgot here, I wanted to stack above each other on mobile,

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.600
so people can read view page.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.375
As I've guessed, we have this nice new block,

00:05:23.375 --> 00:05:30.080
but this block here is this one.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.170
This div has a margin.

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:36.140
Also, this div has a margin,

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.570
this one has a bottom and this one has a top.

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.700
Now the above one is the more block,

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.920
we have it already in our Style Sheet.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:47.885
I'm just going to say here more block,

00:05:47.885 --> 00:05:54.465
I need the margin bottom to be zero,

00:05:54.465 --> 00:05:58.450
and just in case I'm going to put important.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.145
I don't want anything messing with that.

00:06:04.145 --> 00:06:06.095
Now I have to go back,

00:06:06.095 --> 00:06:07.610
first I'm going to save this,

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.680
yes, and have to go back.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.185
You'll see if I refresh, it's still there.

00:06:15.185 --> 00:06:18.305
But I can show you here in the inspect element.

00:06:18.305 --> 00:06:23.750
This div does not have a margin bottom anymore,

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.820
but this one has a margin top. What do we do?

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:33.515
We just add a class to this last row that we just made,

00:06:33.515 --> 00:06:43.770
so I select it here and say is going to be, update.

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.010
In the Style Sheet,

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:50.715
put the anemone to work,

00:06:50.715 --> 00:06:56.250
and say margin top is going

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:02.385
to be zero and it's going to be important.

00:07:02.385 --> 00:07:07.080
Let's check. Yes, FileZilla we didn't

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:14.670
forget, view page, yes.

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:18.945
This is how it's supposed to look like, great.

00:07:18.945 --> 00:07:23.570
We just have to tweak a bit between creating blocks,

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:30.235
and creating extra CSS classes for them and working on them in your Style Sheet,

00:07:30.235 --> 00:07:32.640
and don't forget the important rule.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:39.600
Now the last block is going to be the Contact and the Google Maps.
