00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.530
Hi, my name is Victoria Anna,

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.600
and I'm a visual communication designer.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.700
I design logos, corporate identities,

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.980
website, and I illustration.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.585
In this Skillshare class,

00:00:09.585 --> 00:00:13.590
I'd like to show you how to customize the default 2019 theme

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.045
and transform it from this to this.

00:00:18.045 --> 00:00:22.460
This process is valid for transforming and customizing other WordPress themes.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.615
I hope you're going to find inspiration and start work on some customizations.

00:00:27.615 --> 00:00:30.240
We are going to take a look at the template files and

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.180
how they work together to build a WordPress theme,

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.990
and we're going to make some changes to them.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.130
We are going to change the header,

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.490
the footer, customize the logo,

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.280
the menu, create content,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.555
embed Google Maps, install some plugins.

00:00:46.555 --> 00:00:52.834
I assume that you already have installed WordPress theme and WordPress

00:00:52.834 --> 00:00:59.585
and taken a look at the settings and that you have some experience with CSS and HTML.

00:00:59.585 --> 00:01:01.910
If you have any questions, reach out to me.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.550
You're going to find the resource files and exercises attached to some of the lessons.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.500
Now let's start.
