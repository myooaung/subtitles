00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.550
Here's a bonus tip for those who, like me,

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.130
need to implement icon flags or

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.290
flag icons next to these two links or anywhere else in the code.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.640
I have search the internet and found here on GitHub,

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.760
a great repository by lipis,

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.570
who is a web developer at Wire app and Google,

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.175
and he has created this package which is called flag-icon-css.

00:00:26.175 --> 00:00:28.920
You can install this package with

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.680
your task management tools if you have a big project and if you work with JavaScript,

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.140
but we're going to implement this really by foot because our project is not

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.695
that huge and we can implement it just with one line of HTML code.

00:00:46.695 --> 00:00:49.380
I have downloaded this file,

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.080
the zip file. It's here.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.090
I have unzipped it,

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.545
and inside there is the CSS,

00:00:57.545 --> 00:01:01.875
which I'm going to need and the flags.

00:01:01.875 --> 00:01:05.630
Because I'm going to need only the rectangle ones,

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.310
I'm not going to upload the whole folder.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.460
I'm going to create a copy here and call it flags,

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:22.600
open and then upload a rectangle,

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.015
flag icons, SVGs up there.

00:01:27.015 --> 00:01:32.010
In the meantime, I'm going to take

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.405
a look at the CSS, and there it is.

00:01:37.405 --> 00:01:38.450
These are the icons,

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.180
the SVGs, the square ones,

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.620
and the rectangle ones.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:50.615
This line apparently only considers the square icons,

00:01:50.615 --> 00:01:54.665
so I'm going to copy only this.

00:01:54.665 --> 00:02:01.490
Copy and paste it in my child theme CSS file.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.020
Of course I'm going to comment this if I can find it

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:13.215
later and paste it here and save.

00:02:13.215 --> 00:02:17.055
Then, I need the US flag,

00:02:17.055 --> 00:02:19.085
I'm going to find it here,

00:02:19.085 --> 00:02:20.540
and I don't need the square one,

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.500
I need the rectangle one.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.755
Copy this.

00:02:25.755 --> 00:02:31.835
Well, SVG link and paste it into my CSS.

00:02:31.835 --> 00:02:34.950
Then I need a German flag,

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.675
and I'm going to find it here,

00:02:38.675 --> 00:02:41.130
the rectangle one,

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:49.080
copy and paste.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.500
This is the CSS style file,

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.165
which I have to confirm that I've changed.

00:02:55.165 --> 00:02:57.400
Yes. Now we have the flags here.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.555
The CSS is in our style,

00:02:59.555 --> 00:03:07.045
and now we need that HTML line of code, which is here.

00:03:07.045 --> 00:03:11.240
The lower one, the one below is for the square flags.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.055
I need the rectangle flags.

00:03:13.055 --> 00:03:15.485
I'm heading to do widgets,

00:03:15.485 --> 00:03:21.995
and to my second widget where the links to the languages are,

00:03:21.995 --> 00:03:24.140
to the language versions.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:34.705
I'm going to paste the HTML here and change domination here to DE for Germany.

00:03:34.705 --> 00:03:40.819
Paste again and change to US for USA,

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.960
because the readers of this page are also going

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:51.350
to be in the United States of America, save, done.

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.930
Let's see. Refresh. They're supposed to be here.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.050
You see how the link is extending,

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:01.745
but they're not showing.

00:04:01.745 --> 00:04:07.385
What happened? I'm going to show you what I forgot to do.

00:04:07.385 --> 00:04:11.090
I can show you here. You see the URL?

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.415
It's the same here.

00:04:13.415 --> 00:04:15.155
The path to the file.

00:04:15.155 --> 00:04:20.720
Of course, here, I have to get out of

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.210
the folder here and go to the flag folder here the style is in the root,

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.220
I just need to go to the flag folder.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:40.190
Deleting these two, save,

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.475
put on the server and refresh,

00:04:44.475 --> 00:04:46.960
and voila, here they are.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.095
I could bother to remove this link underlining,

00:04:51.095 --> 00:04:57.615
but that would be a bit too over the scope of this short tip.

00:04:57.615 --> 00:05:03.500
I hope you've seen how you can tweak with

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:10.325
the child theme and change the look either through editing the PHP files,

00:05:10.325 --> 00:05:16.220
the parent theme files that you copy into your child theme or through the widget area,

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.390
and of course in your CSS style files.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.035
This is our website now,

00:05:23.035 --> 00:05:28.800
and the next we have to deal with the header and the content.
