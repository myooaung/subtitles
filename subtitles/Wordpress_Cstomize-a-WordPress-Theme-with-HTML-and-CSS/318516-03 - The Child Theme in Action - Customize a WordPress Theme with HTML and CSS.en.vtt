00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.415
To start customizing our theme.

00:00:02.415 --> 00:00:05.655
We need to create a copy of it first.

00:00:05.655 --> 00:00:08.325
Because going from here,

00:00:08.325 --> 00:00:13.890
the default 2019 theme to this one that I already tried on for

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.730
this business side is not recommendable

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.140
to change all the original files of your WordPress theme installation.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.915
Because you might break something, make a mistake,

00:00:24.915 --> 00:00:31.080
or the theme is going to be updated and all your changes are going to be lost.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.125
You have to start all over again.

00:00:34.125 --> 00:00:35.870
There is a possibility, of course,

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.120
to go to the customizer and upload the logo, change the colors,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.640
create menus, changed the widgets,

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.535
and here is an additional CSS field,

00:00:46.535 --> 00:00:49.730
which you can fill in with your CSS.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.360
Let's say something really simple.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.785
Background color is going to be green, great.

00:00:58.785 --> 00:01:02.404
Now you save it and you have a green website,

00:01:02.404 --> 00:01:08.050
but 2019 gets updated and all these changes get lost.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:14.270
What to do? There is another possibility where as an administrator in the dashboard,

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.365
you go to the Appearance Theme editor.

00:01:17.365 --> 00:01:20.270
I've shown you this before in the other video,

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.760
so you can change all these theme files and edit them.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.365
But of course this might break your theme, you're original theme.

00:01:29.365 --> 00:01:33.170
The recommendation is always to create a child theme,

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.120
and this is really great.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.410
It's called child theme because the parent theme is still there,

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.110
and all the files, all the functions,

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.800
all the JavaScript, etc is still there.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.390
The child theme can use them,

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.410
but if you want to make changes you just copy one of the files,

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.105
make changes in them and leave it in the child theme.

00:01:55.105 --> 00:01:59.975
Because it's going to overwrite the files that are here in the parent theme.

00:01:59.975 --> 00:02:04.085
It's way beyond our scope to create a child theme,

00:02:04.085 --> 00:02:08.720
and I found online that there is a great site which is

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.295
called ChildThemeWP.com and the great team that works there,

00:02:13.295 --> 00:02:16.520
and some of them work for WordPress.org are creating

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.840
the child themes for the known WordPress themes.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.565
Here is the download link.

00:02:21.565 --> 00:02:24.050
You're going to find it in the exercise files

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.840
so you can download the child theme for yourself.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.180
I have already downloaded it,

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.565
I just have to push it up to my server.

00:02:31.565 --> 00:02:37.805
It's unzipped, and so I just pulled a file up here onto my server and here it is.

00:02:37.805 --> 00:02:42.620
The child theme consists of functions PHP and style CSS and the screenshot, of course,

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.925
for the theme, which I believe is blank, and some JavaScript.

00:02:48.925 --> 00:02:54.990
All of this, the great team from the ChildThemeWP.com has created.

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.140
We don't have to worry about creating all these files.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.130
How does this function with the child theme?

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.925
We have a parent theme here and the child here,

00:03:04.925 --> 00:03:08.665
and how do the files communicate with each other?

00:03:08.665 --> 00:03:10.440
Well, that's not a problem,

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.640
I'll just open here the WordPress on my computer

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.280
just to have an overview of the files and to explain.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.550
You see the child theme has very few files on the functions and style CSS.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.410
For example, if I want to change the header,

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:36.095
I'm just going to copy the header PHP to my child theme and do the changes in that file.

00:03:36.095 --> 00:03:40.280
All the rest is going to come again, stay the same.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.060
All the template files are going to be from the parent theme.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.540
Everything you want to change in the child theme,

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.580
you just copy that file and make your changes in the child theme.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.180
Of course, you have to keep also the structure of

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.815
the folders in order to keep the linking between the different template parts.

00:04:02.815 --> 00:04:07.295
On the front side, installing a child theme is going to look like this.

00:04:07.295 --> 00:04:13.770
I'll go here in the dashboard and appearance themes and remember,

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.250
I've told you the screenshot of the child theme is blank.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.780
We'll going to have to change this in a while.

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:27.245
I'm just going to activate this theme and if I go back to our side,

00:04:27.245 --> 00:04:28.415
it's still the same.

00:04:28.415 --> 00:04:30.230
You see it works,

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.840
it's basically a copy of this site.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.100
But if I want to change a file or just copy to the child theme and

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.570
change it there instead of breaking the parent original theme.
