00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
To create our last row of content on the front page,

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.210
we need a Contact Form and Google Maps.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.340
We're taking a small excursion here,

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.370
we're adding a plugin it's called, Contact Form 7.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.595
A very popular plugin because it's integrated with so many other services.

00:00:20.595 --> 00:00:22.650
You can have a recapture.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.785
You can use it with PayPal and Stripe.

00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:28.905
Very, very versatile plugin.

00:00:28.905 --> 00:00:31.230
So I'm going to activate it.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.480
Here going to the Settings,

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.040
I have Contact form 1,

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.595
I can leave this name here because I'm going to have only one contact form for now.

00:00:40.595 --> 00:00:50.255
I'm copying the short code here and building it into my front page in the left column.

00:00:50.255 --> 00:00:56.510
So I'm adding here a new block, two columns,

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.000
and I'm just going to type the short code here inside

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.710
of the left column and then check because I want it to be full-page,

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.655
of course, full width, sorry, and Update.

00:01:10.655 --> 00:01:13.360
If I take a look here,

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.210
here is our form, great.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.800
It's just a bit, you know,

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.950
the fields are too big and these labels usually you have to leave them above.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:31.385
It's very helpful for the accessibility for people who use keyboard to navigate the site,

00:01:31.385 --> 00:01:33.800
just to leave this label above.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.225
But for this website,

00:01:35.225 --> 00:01:39.785
I think it's going to be okay if I just put it inside as a placeholder text.

00:01:39.785 --> 00:01:45.030
To do that, I'm going to the dashboard again here in Contact,

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.155
Contact Forms, and Edit.

00:01:49.155 --> 00:01:56.630
I want this text to be here in this area as a place holder,

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.445
I can delete this one,

00:01:58.445 --> 00:02:02.810
then use Text as the field form.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.770
It's going to be called, your name.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.355
Your name. Default value,

00:02:08.355 --> 00:02:10.890
the texts that I've copied from above.

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.360
Use this text as the place holder of the field.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.915
I'm going to add an ID attribute because later,

00:02:17.915 --> 00:02:21.200
if I build another contact form on this website,

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.915
I'd like to have the possibility to call only this specific field.

00:02:25.915 --> 00:02:29.580
It's going to be, your name, "Insert Tag".

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.830
Here it is, I can delete this one.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.540
For the e-mail, it's pretty much the same.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.925
Copy, I can delete this and put Email.

00:02:41.925 --> 00:02:47.640
Required field, it's going to be your e-mail.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.425
Default value, the one that I copied from above.

00:02:51.425 --> 00:02:54.035
Use this text as Placeholder.

00:02:54.035 --> 00:03:00.930
ID, your e-mail, "Insert Tag".

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.490
I can delete this one.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.310
The form says that it has some kind of a conflict.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.440
I don't know, everything's fine.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.800
Like so, Save form,

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.900
we are back. Subject, like so.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.315
Yes, I have to do is here as well.

00:03:26.315 --> 00:03:31.100
Text, and it's not going to be a required field.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.665
It's just going to be subject.

00:03:33.665 --> 00:03:37.679
Default value, subject. Use this text.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:44.400
Subject, "Insert Tag" and delete here.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.450
Then the last one is, your message.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.820
I'm just going to delete here.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.190
Text area, exactly.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.330
I'm going to leave it here.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.580
Default value, your message. Use this.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.410
I'm not going to use a text ID attribute.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.625
So this is our new form Save,

00:04:11.625 --> 00:04:15.430
and take a look at the page.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:24.125
Let me see. It looks different now and I just have to style it here.

00:04:24.125 --> 00:04:30.035
To style this field, I'm just going to open my web tools here and check.

00:04:30.035 --> 00:04:31.250
This is my form,

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.745
form class, wcpf7-form, really nice.

00:04:35.745 --> 00:04:39.555
Each of the elements is here in a paragraph,

00:04:39.555 --> 00:04:42.280
the label and the span class,

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.630
and within the span class is the input element which I want to style.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.925
So I'm going here,

00:04:48.925 --> 00:04:53.700
I'm just going to push this up so it's easier to read.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.300
Input type text and et cetera.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.220
I want the background to be gray,

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.175
so I'm just going to write aaa.

00:05:01.175 --> 00:05:05.880
I don't want any border here, none.

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:12.885
That's it. I'm going to copy this first [inaudible] text.

00:05:12.885 --> 00:05:15.720
Be sure to select everything.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.430
Go back to style sheet, enter this,

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:26.100
and then copy this class from the form.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.075
Edit HTML, and the class is here.

00:05:30.075 --> 00:05:37.220
I'm copying this, putting it into my style sheet as a class,

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.580
and of course it's a typo like so.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.740
I'm going to save it here and then go back because I want

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:53.110
also to change this color here.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.040
It's going to be also gray.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.600
I'll just pull it a bit up like this,

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.005
maybe a bit more up.

00:06:04.005 --> 00:06:15.970
Yes. Then I wanted it to be Source Sans Pro and sans-serif,

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:20.835
and the line height five.

00:06:20.835 --> 00:06:24.400
I have to copy all of this.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.795
Well, not everything but,

00:06:27.795 --> 00:06:29.910
yes, I'm trying here.

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:37.750
Copy and then edit here and add the class.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.215
Okay, save it.

00:06:43.215 --> 00:06:44.850
Confirm.

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.410
Go back to the browser.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.810
Also, I want to change the font size.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.485
It's going to be 8.8rem.

00:06:55.485 --> 00:07:00.039
I'm going to copy this here.

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:08.980
Copy and paste it here,

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:17.350
wpcf7-form as the class.

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:28.265
Of course, I have to put it in front of each of these elements.

00:07:28.265 --> 00:07:32.120
Don't let anyone tell you differently.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:36.550
Which of course, it's easier to do that in SAS,

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:40.420
but we are doing things manually here.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.745
Yes, I don't have to write this here again,

00:07:55.745 --> 00:07:59.730
I'm just going to add font-size,

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:06.980
rem and everything that does not appear,

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:11.070
probably going to be an important rule.

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:14.790
Let's see what we've done till now.

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:21.115
Refresh. It basically looks like I wanted it to look like.

00:08:21.115 --> 00:08:23.405
Okay, maybe not the button,

00:08:23.405 --> 00:08:25.580
but you get the point.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:27.920
You just have to open your Web Tools,

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:32.060
choose the Elements, see their classes,

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:35.200
and then edit them in your style sheet.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:40.340
Let's go to the Google Maps, our second column.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:43.430
To embed Google Map here into our website,

00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:45.110
we just go to Google Maps,

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:49.325
enter the address of the business that we want to show,

00:08:49.325 --> 00:08:55.905
and then maybe clicking this marker and then Share.

00:08:55.905 --> 00:08:58.260
Let me just check if this is going to work,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.840
sometimes it doesn't and I don't know why.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.190
We can't embed map,

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:03.660
it didn't work now.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:08.535
I'm going to refresh this like so,

00:09:08.535 --> 00:09:12.390
and then click on "Share",

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:16.635
embed a map, and now it worked.

00:09:16.635 --> 00:09:19.175
So here I can even choose,

00:09:19.175 --> 00:09:20.390
I'm going to copy this,

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:24.905
"Copy HTML" and then choose even the size.

00:09:24.905 --> 00:09:29.420
I'm going to put the size that I have seen that I need.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:36.250
It's 650 width and 595 height,

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:41.375
and then "Copy HTML" again with the dimensions.

00:09:41.375 --> 00:09:44.750
Go to Our Page, Edit page,

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:49.215
and edit the column.

00:09:49.215 --> 00:09:54.630
So here I click on this Add block button and have a column

00:09:54.630 --> 00:10:00.155
selected and I immediately want to add an additional CSS class,

00:10:00.155 --> 00:10:02.750
I'm going to call it Google map,

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:07.250
just to have the possibility to style this map.

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:09.440
I'm going to update here.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:16.935
Then in here, I'm going to choose the custom HTML block.

00:10:16.935 --> 00:10:27.595
So like this, enter the code from the Google Maps page and then Update.

00:10:27.595 --> 00:10:33.170
View Page, and this is our map.

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:37.085
We can style it again with our extra CSS class,

00:10:37.085 --> 00:10:41.945
but basically now we have added Google Maps with the address of the business.

00:10:41.945 --> 00:10:44.930
That was it with the content customization,

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:48.780
we're moving on to the header.
