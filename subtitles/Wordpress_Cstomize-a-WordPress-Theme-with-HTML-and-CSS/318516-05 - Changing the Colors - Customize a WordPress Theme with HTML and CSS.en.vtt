00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.655
If I'm going to change the colors,

00:00:02.655 --> 00:00:05.130
I'm going to need my file,

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.350
my sketch of the website,

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.135
and I have a little app which is called ColorSlurp.

00:00:12.135 --> 00:00:17.185
It's a free app which makes funny sounds when you choose a color.

00:00:17.185 --> 00:00:19.500
Well, I've turned that off because I have found it little

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.025
bit irritating when I worked with it.

00:00:23.025 --> 00:00:27.300
I have already saved this background color here,

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.840
which is a warm middle gray.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.230
I'm just going to copy this code,

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:47.640
open my inspector, and find the body tag.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.960
Here it is. It says,

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.965
background color body is white.

00:00:55.965 --> 00:00:58.900
I'm going to change that.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.185
Here it is. Looks a bit funny and weird, but not bad.

00:01:07.185 --> 00:01:17.175
Now I'm going to copy here everything because it includes also the color of the font.

00:01:17.175 --> 00:01:28.125
So Copy, open my CSS style file in the atom app and just paste it here.

00:01:28.125 --> 00:01:35.955
Of course, I have to delete this here and maybe also,

00:01:35.955 --> 00:01:38.700
this has m color.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.255
I could put white,

00:01:41.255 --> 00:01:46.005
but I don't think it's going to be correct,

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:48.690
I think I need to choose a very,

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.460
very light in gray.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:58.755
I'm going back here and using ColorSlurp,

00:01:58.755 --> 00:02:05.969
I'm going to choose this gray here.

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.490
This is the lightest spot,

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.160
and I'm going to copy this into my font color.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.420
This comes here.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.470
Save and then change the font family too.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.000
On this website in this project,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.550
I like to have as little as possible different fonts.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.010
Save, and then of course,

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.200
saving font fill as well on the server.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:56.310
Go back, close this and let's see what happened. It looks nice.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.075
Of course the text is illegible here,

00:02:59.075 --> 00:03:03.290
but these are blocks and this is the nice part that I just have

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.430
to basically change the body color, the font color.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.110
Maybe in some other occasions like links,

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.290
I have to change a few colors,

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.835
but otherwise all the rest I can just edit here in the block.

00:03:20.835 --> 00:03:23.260
Let us see that.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.800
Color settings.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.550
I'm going to put the text color white and the

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:39.020
background light gray, update and check.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.870
Yes, that looks a bit more legible,

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.900
but not really nicer.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.110
To make our theme a bit nicer and to customize it,

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.615
we're of course going to need a lot of tweaking,

00:03:50.615 --> 00:03:54.680
and if I went to all of these links individually,

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.410
it is going to take awhile to change their colors and hover states.

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.290
I found on GitHub,

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:10.670
that the developer Ann Pohl has put the 2019 custom color override out there to use.

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:18.840
I'm just going to copy all of this and put it in our style sheet.

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.500
Let me just check if you edit.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.510
I have already comment in here, the typography.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:34.270
I'm just going to put another comment to know where to look for things.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:44.530
Colors, override, and then paste all of it here.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:51.405
Then I have to look for the a, for the links.

00:04:51.405 --> 00:04:55.300
This is what we are working on at the moment.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.130
Just save it for a second.

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.755
This is the links color.

00:05:00.755 --> 00:05:06.940
I have prepared the one I want here in my text file,

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:14.960
copy this one, go back to code and enter it here.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.210
Most probably if I go back here,

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.944
of course I have to save the file also on the server.

00:05:25.944 --> 00:05:30.650
Let's see in the browser what happened.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.635
You see nothing happens.

00:05:34.635 --> 00:05:40.564
Well, this is the trick with working with child themes that you have to use

00:05:40.564 --> 00:05:47.390
the important rule quite often to override many of the CSS settings.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.255
It doesn't feel good,

00:05:49.255 --> 00:05:53.630
it feels bit hacky and I don't really like it, but that's it.

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.580
That's the work with the child themes.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.925
This is now the look of the links.

00:05:58.925 --> 00:06:02.350
Of course, when I hover over,

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:05.100
not much is happening.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.239
I have to change also the hover cover,

00:06:08.239 --> 00:06:10.640
which I have prepared here,

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.865
and it is this one.

00:06:13.865 --> 00:06:19.440
I think it's a corn yellow or something like that.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.745
Let's see, the hover states.

00:06:23.745 --> 00:06:26.085
I'm going to put it here.

00:06:26.085 --> 00:06:33.820
Not forget important, save,

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:39.315
and check in the browser what happened.

00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:45.860
Here we go. Now, I wanted to have also the animation of the border underneath.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.740
Because here you can see there is

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.285
a text decoration underline which actually cannot be animated.

00:06:53.285 --> 00:06:57.925
I'm going to add the animation now in the hover state.

00:06:57.925 --> 00:07:02.075
To change this hover transition,

00:07:02.075 --> 00:07:05.885
I am going to remove the underlined here and then

00:07:05.885 --> 00:07:10.220
add the border which I'm going to transition, not animate transition.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.150
I'm always using to homeward,

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:15.785
and I found it better because transitioning

00:07:15.785 --> 00:07:20.845
underlying a text decoration is always resulting in some jitters.

00:07:20.845 --> 00:07:23.680
I'm heading back to the CSS file,

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.894
and here in the hover state,

00:07:25.894 --> 00:07:32.150
I'm just going to copy this color because I want the border to have the same color,

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:35.015
of course, as the text.

00:07:35.015 --> 00:07:40.025
I'm going to just add border color here.

00:07:40.025 --> 00:07:47.205
Save, and then go up to transition this.

00:07:47.205 --> 00:07:49.815
First I have to say,

00:07:49.815 --> 00:07:55.385
text decoration is none.

00:07:55.385 --> 00:08:04.110
After declared the Border button transition from two pixel

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:12.700
solid transparent to the color

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:15.385
that I've declared in the hover state.

00:08:15.385 --> 00:08:25.545
I'm going to put the transition or linear and the simplest, then 0.3 seconds.

00:08:25.545 --> 00:08:30.660
I found 0.3 seconds to fill the most natural of speeds.

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:36.270
Some going to save this here and do the same in

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:43.620
FileZilla and check what happened in the browser.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:49.100
Oh, apparently all the links now have that same transition.

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:53.510
Well, the admin bar is not really my concern.

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:55.250
Let's see here.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:59.435
We haven't removed the underlying decoration.

00:08:59.435 --> 00:09:05.850
Firstly, I forgot to write important.

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:11.840
Was that the case?

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:18.310
Go back. Now I can transition it.

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:24.845
Let's see here, all the other links as well.

00:09:24.845 --> 00:09:29.645
Great. I also want to change the color of this element.

00:09:29.645 --> 00:09:31.580
It's some left border.

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:35.015
Let's see which one it is,

00:09:35.015 --> 00:09:42.110
its entry content and blockquote.

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:47.780
I want to put this the same color as the link color,

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:51.035
and I'm heading to the CSS file.

00:09:51.035 --> 00:09:56.675
Let's see here is the link color, copying it,

00:09:56.675 --> 00:10:05.380
pasting it here with the blockquote, saving, confirming.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.975
Checking in the browser.

00:10:08.975 --> 00:10:11.920
What happened?

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:18.050
It has changed the same color as the link before the hover state.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:21.835
But if I look at this in the big picture,

00:10:21.835 --> 00:10:26.230
I find these lines way too fine considering the typography.

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:29.315
I want to make them a bit chunkier.

00:10:29.315 --> 00:10:33.930
I'm going to change that back here,

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:40.990
adding the border width,

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:47.175
and I'm going to start with the nine pixels just to exaggerate a bit,

00:10:47.175 --> 00:10:54.580
and confirm and refresh.

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:59.240
Looks a bit more in harmony with the topography,

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:03.350
but maybe a little bit too thick.

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:07.290
Just to tone it down I'm putting

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:16.220
eight pixels and fresh,

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:20.435
that looks a bit more in sync.

00:11:20.435 --> 00:11:23.285
We have edited the colors of the theme,

00:11:23.285 --> 00:11:27.140
and now we're going to move to the footer area

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:31.950
because I don't want to have these widgets in my footer.
