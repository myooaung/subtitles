00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
I've started FileZilla FTP client,

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.170
which is my preferred.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.100
Let's have an overview over the WordPress installation files.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.565
Usually, we download from the WordPress site,

00:00:11.565 --> 00:00:17.640
the zip folder with WordPress with the newest version and ZIP it on to our computer,

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.540
and send all the files up to our server to install

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.680
it with installation of the database and all the other settings.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.350
Well, here in the WP Content,

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.090
we have our themes also plug-ins. Lets take a look.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.430
This is our 2019 theme,

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.030
and WordPress these days comes installed with 2017 and 2016 theme.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.650
Let's have a pick into our 2019 theme and to see what files are there.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:54.385
Usually, WordPress theme can function only with an index PHP file and style CSS.

00:00:54.385 --> 00:00:57.790
But functions PHP is also very nice.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:03.130
You might also want to have some nice interactions and some nice fonts.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:10.060
All these files are basically modular components that build up one thing.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.490
It's really important to understand the hierarchy of the WordPress template files.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.960
We have all these template files that I've shown you in FileZilla, and then of course,

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.290
the style sheets and JavaScript images and other template files

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.115
like functions PHP that build up the entire theme.

00:01:27.115 --> 00:01:31.460
All these template files are like little modules that you can

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.410
combine to create the theme that you want to have.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.120
They are giving the structure for the information on your website.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.715
For example, in our theme,

00:01:43.715 --> 00:01:50.090
the sidebar PHP with widgets is actually a part of the footer PHP.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.960
You can combine all these little modules together to one big theme,

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.390
and there is a special hierarchy,

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.560
for example, the most specialized one of the templates is,

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.185
for example, you have a page PHP for all those pages that we've created in our theme.

00:02:09.185 --> 00:02:13.640
But let's say we are going to need a contact page and it's

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.080
going to look a bit different than all the other pages.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.760
So I'm going to create then a page, contact PHP.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.210
This is going to be the template only for the contact page.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.565
In case, for example,

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:36.310
that I have created a contact page but not assigned contact page template to it,

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.640
the WordPress is going to fall back onto the page PHP templates.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.610
So the more specialized one template is,

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.100
like category or category shoes.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.955
Category shoes is more specialized than category.

00:02:49.955 --> 00:02:55.880
So WordPress is always going to show the more specialized template,

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.290
and if it doesn't find it,

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.965
it's going to fall back onto the less specialized one.

00:03:00.965 --> 00:03:05.435
Then ultimately, if it doesn't have any other templates in the theme,

00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:08.420
its going to show the index PHP file.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.400
So when you're changing a theme,

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.690
when you're customizing it,

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.765
you usually only work with style CSS,

00:03:14.765 --> 00:03:18.340
but sometimes there are parts that you want to change,

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.870
and for this, you're going to have to have an FTP client to open up these files,

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:31.380
edit them, and create the new structure that you want to have into your template files.
