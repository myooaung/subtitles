00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.590
Let's now discuss the line chart. A line chart is a graphical

2
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.580
representation of a variable over time. So, I am going to create a new

3
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.590
line chart showing the actual sale price across the years.

4
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:20.130
I will rename the chart to line chart and I will choose the Line Chart

5
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.660
visualization type. In the x‑axis I am going to choose the Years Sold, while in

6
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:32.520
the y‑axis I am going to put the average actual sale price. And in the Color I

7
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.640
am going to choose the Zoning Classification.

8
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.160
Using the Color field will enable us to separate different lines using a

9
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.360
specific category. And let me improve the readability of the year sold in

10
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:55.120
the x‑axis That's good. And let's order the years in an ascending fashion.

11
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.580
Looks nice. As we can see, the houses in the low‑density area average

12
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:05.650
actual sell price remained almost stable from 2006 until 2010, while the

13
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:12.000
houses in the commercial area had an increase in 2007 before it goes down later.
