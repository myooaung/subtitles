00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.190
Let's now add some makeup to our visuals and make them more meaningful.

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.900
AWS QuickSight provides some level of customization

3
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.290
to make our visuals look better.

4
00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.610
Let's start with the bar chart, and let's say that I

5
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.570
would like to change its color.

6
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.780
I will rightâ€‘click on the chart and choose Chart Color.

7
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.390
Then, I will change the color to green.

8
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.950
Looks better, right?

9
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.850
And now let's go to the scatter plot, and let's say that I would like

10
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.770
to make the title larger for better readability.

11
00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.730
I will click on the gear on the right of the visual,

12
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.850
and then I will change the title font size to large.

13
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.750
And as you can see, that title now is larger.

14
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.510
We can apply the same principle on the rest of the visuals. And

15
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.200
now let's see what we can do with the pie chart.

16
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.990
Let's say that we would like to show the percentage

17
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.240
of each category in the pie chart.

18
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.020
I will click on the gear on the right of the pie chart,

19
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.590
and then I will click on Data Labels.

20
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.840
Then I will click on Show Metric. And as you can see,

21
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.710
we can see each category and its corresponding percentage.

22
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.800
And now let's go to the table, and let's say that we would

23
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.580
like to add some conditional formatting.

24
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.600
I would like to mark years with number of sales less than

25
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.390
500 with red so that the viewer will easily recognize that

26
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.810
there is something wrong.

27
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.840
I will click on the three dots in the right of the table.

28
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.240
Then, I will choose Conditional formatting. In the Column section on the left,

29
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.900
I will choose Number of Sales column. And as you can see,

30
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.250
I can apply the formatting either on the background color,

31
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.540
text color, or through an icon in the cell.

32
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.470
I will choose the background color. And here, I can define a condition

33
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.830
based on a certain aggregation type, such as count,

34
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.590
average, median, and so on.

35
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.590
I will leave it as count, and I will make the condition type as less

36
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:06.160
than, and the value I will put 500. And for background color, I will

37
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:15.240
choose red, Then I will apply. And as you can see,

38
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.930
the cell with value 341 now is red since it is less than 500. I

39
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.000
hope now you have some idea on some capabilities AWS QuickSight provides for you to customize your visuals.
