1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:04,390
Let's now discuss the pie and donut charts.

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:08,080
I will rename my visual to Pie and Donut Charts.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,020
Let's just start with a pie chart.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,050
A pie chart is a circular statistical graphic,

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,110
which is divided into slices to illustrate numerical

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,360
proportion. So, I will create a pie chart to show the

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,810
percentage of sale price by the fireplace quality.

8
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:26,510
I will choose the Pie Chart visualization. In the Group/Color I will

9
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:30,870
choose the Fireplace Quality and in the Value I will choose the

10
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,100
Actual SalePrice. And, more specifically,

11
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,540
I would like to look into the average sale price.

12
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,390
As we can see,

13
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:42,320
houses with excellent fireplace quality take around

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,300
28% of the average sale price.

15
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,820
But let's say that I am interested in seeing those

16
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:53,040
values for a specific year sold, so I will add a filter for that.

17
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,590
I will click on Filter on the left and I will create a new

18
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,690
one. And I will choose the Year Sold.

19
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:04,800
I will click on the Year Sold filter, and let me choose 2010 once again.

20
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,050
And I click Apply. And as we can see that houses with excellent fireplace

21
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:12,770
quality took 30% of the average sale price.

22
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,110
And now we can proceed with discussing donut charts.

23
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,430
A donut chart is a variation of a pie chart except that it has a hole

24
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,420
in the center, which makes it look like a donut.

25
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:27,790
I can follow the same exact steps I did to create the diagrams.

26
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,570
However, I want to show you a quick shortcut.

27
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,650
If I click on the three dots in the right of the visual and I

28
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:36,420
click on Duplicate visual, and I would choose to duplicate the

29
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,270
visual in this sheet. Simply,

30
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:45,000
I can change the visualization type to a donut chart. And here is our donut chart.
