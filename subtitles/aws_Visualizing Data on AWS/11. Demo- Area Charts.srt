1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,990
Let's now discuss the area charts.

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,020
Area charts have a pattern similar to a line chart.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:13,130
However, the space between each line and the X‑axis is filled with a certain

4
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:17,760
color. Area charts are ideal for indicating a change among different

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,870
datasets. So we will create an area chart to compare the housing prices over

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,800
time for different zoning classifications.

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,900
I will rename the chart to Area Charts, and I will change

8
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,000
the visualization type to area line chart.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,010
The area line chart is similar to the line chart,

10
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,020
but it's filled to help visualizing the differences between the lines.

11
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:45,590
So I will start by choosing the year sold in the X‑axis. And I will sort

12
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:50,940
it in an ascending fashion and improve the formatting.

13
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:58,300
Then, I will put the average actual sale price in the value field, and I will

14
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,400
differentiate the colors using zoning classification. And now,

15
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,250
as you can note, it's very easy to visualize the actual difference

16
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:14,000
between the average sale prices in a specific year between different houses in different zoning classifications.
