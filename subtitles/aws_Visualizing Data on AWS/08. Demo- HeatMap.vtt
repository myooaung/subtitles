00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.870
And now let's discuss the heat maps. A heat map is a data visualization

2
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.800
technique that shows magnitude of a phenomenon as a color in two

3
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.380
dimensions. Dark colors are usually used to indicate high values, while

4
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.850
light colors are used for lower values.

5
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.430
I will rename the sheet to HeatMap.

6
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.360
I will create a heat map to show how the actual sale price is affected

7
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.220
by the overall house condition and overall material quality. I will

8
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.430
click in heat map visualization type. In the rows, I will choose the

9
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.340
overall house condition. And in the columns, I will choose the overall

10
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.500
material condition. And for the values, I will choose the actual sale

11
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.240
price median.

12
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.330
It is the actual sale price, and I change the aggregate type to

13
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.350
median. Good. In the legend on the right,

14
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.550
we can see that the range of sale price is a gradient that

15
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.280
becomes darker as the sale price increases.

16
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.320
And as we can see on the left, as the overall material

17
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:09.000
quality and overall house condition increases, the boxes become darker, which indicates that the median sale price increases.
