00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.450
And in this module, we are going to make our hands dirty

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:13.110
by using AWS QuickSight in practice.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.400
So in this module, we will be using AWS QuickSight.

5
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.120
We will start by loading our dataset, and then we will create

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.000
