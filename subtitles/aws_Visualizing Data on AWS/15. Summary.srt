00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:06,530
Let's now recap what we have learned in this course. In the first module,

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:11,240
we started by learning about different aspects in AWS QuickSight.

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,020
We learned about its different usage scenarios and features, and

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,590
then we introduced its architecture and general components that

5
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:23,110
constitute it. And in the second module, we took a look at AWS

6
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:28,180
QuickSight in action, and we learned about different types of visualizations,

7
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:32,090
such as bar charts that count the number of instances in a certain

8
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:36,620
category, scatter plot which help us to identify the correlation

9
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:41,220
between two variables, pivot table to explore the data from

10
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,390
different dimensions, and many others.

11
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,740
And finally,

12
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:51,050
don't forget to rate the course from the options on the right and share

13
00:00:51,050 --> 00:01:00,000
your questions and insights in the course discussion. Thank you for your time, and I hope that I see you in future Pluralsight courses.
