00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,820
Let's quickly recap what we have learned in this module.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:11,160
We started by positioning AWS QuickSight in AWS Big Data Specialty exam,

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,750
and we identified that it lies in the fifth domain,

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:19,650
which is the data visualization domain, and it's worth 12% of the exam score.

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,730
Then we discussed the importance of data visualization.

6
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:26,800
We stated the reasons why we would like to do data visualization,

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,480
such as seeing data on aggregate levels.

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,640
Then we introduced AWS QuickSight and its benefits.

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,740
Then, we dived deeper and discussed the core components of AWS QuickSight,

10
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,240
which are different data sources we can load data from,

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,460
such as databases and APIs, datasets that we load our data to,

12
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,270
which can be backed by SPICE engine, and analysis,

13
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,570
which is a collection of visuals, different visuals which can be bar charts,

14
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,510
pie charts, and so on.

15
00:00:58,510 --> 00:00:59,610
In the next module,

16
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:03,300
we will see AWS QuickSight in action, and we will make our

17
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:09,000
hands dirty with a demo as we will discuss. Are you already?
