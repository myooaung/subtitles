Let's now discuss the bar chart. A bar chart is a chart that shows

2
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.690
categorical data with rectangular bars with heights or lengths

3
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.840
proportional to the values that they represent.

4
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.810
It can be either vertical or horizontal.

5
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.620
I will create a bar chart to show the median sale

6
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.440
price for each zoning classification.

7
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.380
Let me rename this sheet to Bar Chart. Then in the visuals

8
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.870
types, I will click on vertical bar chart to change the

9
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.530
chart type to a bar chart. And, as you can see,

10
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:36.080
the field wells section has been enabled. In the X‑axis, I am

11
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.850
going to show the zoning classification,

12
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.210
and I do so by dragging and dropping the zoning classification

13
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.760
field in the X‑axis section, while in the Y‑axis or value, I am

14
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.970
going to put the median actual sale.

15
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:58.830
I will drag and drop the actual sale price in the value field. And I need

16
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:06.280
to change the aggregate type to median. Notice at the top of the

17
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.630
visualization, we have automatically generated title called Median of

18
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.840
Actual Sale Price by Zoning Classification,

19
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.400
which makes it easy for the user to understand the context of the visualization.

20
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.290
The very first interesting conclusion we can see that is the

21
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:32.000
village residential tends to be the most expensive, while the industrial and agriculture tends to be the least expensive.
