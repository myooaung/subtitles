1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,208
In this clip we're going to take a look at the term the Amazon Machine instance.

2
00:00:06,208 --> 00:00:11,208
I know the title says instances, but there are Linux and Windows instances.

3
00:00:11,208 --> 00:00:14,808
So when I'm looking at the choices to build my virtual machines,

4
00:00:14,808 --> 00:00:17,208
I have a couple of things to consider.

5
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:23,208
Instances nowadays typically run on 64-bit virtual Intel processors.

6
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:24,708
And as such,

7
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:31,208
we get into a few other distinctions when we are building our instances.

8
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:35,208
The hardware virtual machine, as it's defined,

9
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:39,208
with paravirtualization support, now there's a mouthful,

10
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:42,155
and paravirtualization used to be the way,

11
00:00:42,155 --> 00:00:47,679
I'd say 5-6 years ago it was pretty well the predominant way of

12
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:52,384
running virtualization when we're looking at running Xen as the

13
00:00:52,384 --> 00:00:55,208
hypervisor in the open source world.

14
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:56,275
Typically nowadays,

15
00:00:56,275 --> 00:01:01,075
the paravirtualization provides pretty amazing support to attach to

16
00:01:01,075 --> 00:01:05,708
the network and storage through drivers that are really baked into

17
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:08,208
this copy of the hardware virtual machine.

18
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:12,419
Because of updated drivers, faster processors at the physical layer,

19
00:01:12,419 --> 00:01:17,155
I would start with an HMV and it will come down to

20
00:01:17,155 --> 00:01:19,366
choice as to what is readily available.

21
00:01:19,366 --> 00:01:22,208
The typical market nowadays, the hardware is getting better,

22
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:24,608
this is typically the defacto choice.

23
00:01:24,608 --> 00:01:27,008
Now when we're talking about paravirtualization,

24
00:01:27,008 --> 00:01:29,458
we really were talking about Linux.

25
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:33,208
Windows hasn't opened up their operating system for anybody.

26
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:39,561
For Windows systems, since we have the HVM with the paravirtualization support,

27
00:01:39,561 --> 00:01:43,746
Windows can take advantage of the support for faster

28
00:01:43,746 --> 00:01:47,208
networking and storage than they could in the past.

29
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:49,753
So when it comes to choosing our instances,

30
00:01:49,753 --> 00:01:52,935
we have a few choices, the first is general purpose,

31
00:01:52,935 --> 00:01:57,008
and as you may expect, general purpose means just that.

32
00:01:57,008 --> 00:02:00,741
There's a balance for compute, memory, network resources,

33
00:02:00,741 --> 00:02:04,208
and they have a couple of flavors that based on what

34
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:07,208
customers ask for as a starting point, they provide it.

35
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:12,208
The next instance choice we can look at is the optimized instance for memory.

36
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:15,737
So if you have needs for a high performance database,

37
00:02:15,737 --> 00:02:18,208
maybe you're dealing with heavy duty analysis,

38
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:20,855
maybe you're building some enterprise application that needs a

39
00:02:20,855 --> 00:02:23,208
ton of RAM or maybe it's compute optimized.

40
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,103
Now the compute optimized instances are,

41
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,945
as you may expect, high performance, and so again,

42
00:02:27,945 --> 00:02:30,958
you might be doing scientific analysis, engineering,

43
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:36,208
gaming, encoding video, or it might be storage optimized.

44
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:39,958
Maybe you have something like a very large NoSQL database,

45
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:43,208
maybe you've got transactions going on, data warehousing,

46
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:48,208
big data, Hadoop, then you can start with storage optimized.

47
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:52,583
You need something that is defined as accelerated computing where

48
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:55,208
you're using the graphics processing units,

49
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,208
so the GPU instances.

50
00:02:57,208 --> 00:03:02,208
Maybe it's something that's designed for that specific GPU power.

51
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:06,208
Now that we have a bit of background on the instance choices,

52
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:09,875
let's take a look at the storage options for our instances.

53
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,208
So we start off with ephemeral storage.

54
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:15,753
This storage is on physical drives that are on the bare metal server,

55
00:03:15,753 --> 00:03:19,471
so in this example we have a couple of instances that have

56
00:03:19,471 --> 00:03:22,419
some volumes that are defined as ephemeral,

57
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:27,065
and they live and die as your virtual machine lives or dies.

58
00:03:27,065 --> 00:03:30,208
So you can reboot the box, the drive is still there,

59
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,840
you turn off the system, your drive goes away.

60
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,629
So we can't rely on this instant storage for anything that's valuable,

61
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:40,875
but it might be perfect for a web server or app server.

62
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:46,208
If you think about it, you have a perfect image for your web server,

63
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,708
you launch it, there's no data on that web server.

64
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,208
Why wouldn't I use ephemeral storage?

65
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:54,333
It's fast, it's probably the fastest thing you're going to have,

66
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,208
it's on an SSD drive.

67
00:03:56,208 --> 00:04:01,208
So lots of ways to look at ephemeral storage, expect it's not permanent.

68
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:04,737
To recap, the disks are physically attached to the host,

69
00:04:04,737 --> 00:04:09,050
they're attached only during launch, which means that you shut them down,

70
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:09,787
they're gone.

71
00:04:09,787 --> 00:04:13,103
The data is scrubbed when the instance is terminated,

72
00:04:13,103 --> 00:04:14,541
we've heard that before,

73
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:18,208
and if I wanted to I could encrypt using third-party tools.

74
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:22,208
So one of the caveats about this type of storage is that these volumes

75
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,914
can't be detached and attached to a different instance,

76
00:04:24,914 --> 00:04:26,326
just can't do that.

77
00:04:26,326 --> 00:04:31,362
There is lots of customers out there that use third-party tools to make copies

78
00:04:31,362 --> 00:04:41,000
of this information and store it on Elastic Block Storage. So there is a number of possibilities if you want to take a bit of risk.
