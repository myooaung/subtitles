00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Well hello there, Mark Wilkins checking in.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,714
How are you today?

3
00:00:04,714 --> 00:00:09,000
We're going to look at Securing Access to Edge Locations.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,048
Well what's an edge location you may say?

5
00:00:12,048 --> 00:00:12,429
Well,

6
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:17,000
it's a piece of technology or a service that is on the

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,308
edge of Amazon's internal services, like DNS,

8
00:00:21,308 --> 00:00:25,000
load balancing, web application, firewall protection,

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,333
those sorts of things.

10
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:28,000
So I'm glad you're here.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You may have some questions though on security, why the focus on security?

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,200
Well, everything in cloud is focused on security.

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,000
People talk about it's cheaper, it's available,

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I can get going really quickly, and then security rears its head,

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,200
so we have to focus on security and ensure that what we're

16
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,000
hosting/implementing in the Amazon cloud is secure.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,571
Now the portion of security that we can control,

18
00:00:53,571 --> 00:00:55,571
because after all it is a partnership,

19
00:00:55,571 --> 00:01:00,684
and this is also a course that will get you ready for

20
00:01:00,684 --> 00:01:04,895
some of the Amazon certifications, such as sysops,

21
00:01:04,895 --> 00:01:07,000
administration, and security itself.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And as I like to say, security is 25/7 in the cloud.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's always something we have to monitor and manage.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,667
In searching for sayings to start off each of these modules,

25
00:01:17,667 --> 00:01:20,000
looking for something to do with security,

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,130
well William Cowper was in the 1700s,

27
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:26,087
and I don't think he saw any of the clouds that we saw,

28
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:28,667
but the saying still kind of makes sense.

29
00:01:28,667 --> 00:01:33,000
We are never more in danger than when we think ourselves most secure.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,263
Isn't that the case?

31
00:01:34,263 --> 00:01:37,421
We have a network, nobody's broken in, nobody's done something,

32
00:01:37,421 --> 00:01:40,333
so we feel that we're secure until somebody breaks in,

33
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:43,000
and then, oh my goodness, we've got to fix something.

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,500
And then, of course, the last part of the saying,

35
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,000
nor in reality more secure than when we seem to be most in danger.

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,846
And that kind of applies to that definition of security.

37
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,000
Are you secure?

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Last time I checked.

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Never-ending story, isn't it?

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,619
This course is going to help you with edge location security,

41
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:04,000
the components that are on the edge of the AWS services,

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,235
and a working knowledge of AWS, hey it's always a bonus,

43
00:02:07,235 --> 00:02:09,000
it's not essential for this class.

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,053
So what are our topics?

45
00:02:10,053 --> 00:02:11,737
Well we're starting off with elastic load balancing,

46
00:02:11,737 --> 00:02:14,053
and then we'll look at the traffic through the balancer,

47
00:02:14,053 --> 00:02:15,368
how we could encrypt it.

48
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:18,947
Then we'll take a look at the policies for the elastic load balancers.

49
00:02:18,947 --> 00:02:23,053
There is 2 elastic load balancers, the standard TCP/IP up to level 4,

50
00:02:23,053 --> 00:02:25,786
and then we have the application load balancer.

51
00:02:25,786 --> 00:02:29,000
Then we'll look at DNS services and Route 53.

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,333
DNS,

53
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:34,000
kind of essential for everything that we do on the cloud across the internet,

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
pretty well everywhere.

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Then we'll look at the AWS Web Application Firewall and the AWS Shield Service.

56
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And then we'll end up with some best practices for securing access.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So there's our topics. Let's get going.
