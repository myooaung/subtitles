00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.668
In this demo we're going to take a look at defining IAM policy per user.

2
00:00:07.668 --> 00:00:11.168
And what we're looking at is a brand new account.

3
00:00:11.168 --> 00:00:16.001
So this is the new account for the developers for Wired Brain Coffee and

4
00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:19.668
they've logged on and are logged on as the root account.

5
00:00:19.668 --> 00:00:21.668
They don't want to stay there, that's just the root account,

6
00:00:21.668 --> 00:00:24.918
so they want to add some users so they're going to start off by

7
00:00:24.918 --> 00:00:28.668
adding their first user that will be an administrator.

8
00:00:28.668 --> 00:00:32.721
So clicking Add user we have to put in a username.

9
00:00:32.721 --> 00:00:35.668
So let's add in a user called admin.

10
00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:38.268
Now note we can add multiple users and it's going to take us

11
00:00:38.268 --> 00:00:40.036
along a timeline of adding in details, permissions,

12
00:00:40.036 --> 00:00:42.247
review, and then we'll be done.

13
00:00:42.247 --> 00:00:46.668
So what sort of access do I want to give this user?

14
00:00:46.668 --> 00:00:48.895
Well they're going to be an administrator,

15
00:00:48.895 --> 00:00:53.668
so I would expect that I would want to give them access to the console.

16
00:00:53.668 --> 00:00:59.668
And I also might want to do some work from the command line interface.

17
00:00:59.668 --> 00:01:01.850
I want both types of access.

18
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.941
Now when I do access for command line SDK then I have an access

19
00:01:06.941 --> 00:01:10.585
key ID and secret access key versus the console,

20
00:01:10.585 --> 00:01:12.668
which says just a password.

21
00:01:12.668 --> 00:01:14.454
Now what kind of password?

22
00:01:14.454 --> 00:01:15.525
Well, custom password.

23
00:01:15.525 --> 00:01:17.668
So let's now look at permissions.

24
00:01:17.668 --> 00:01:22.001
So what do I want to do, add a user to a group,

25
00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:24.001
copy permissions from the existing user,

26
00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:25.525
attach existing policies directly?

27
00:01:25.525 --> 00:01:27.668
So I've got some options.

28
00:01:27.668 --> 00:01:30.668
Well I don't have any groups created.

29
00:01:30.668 --> 00:01:33.468
I don't have any other users, as mentioned,

30
00:01:33.468 --> 00:01:37.668
so let's scroll down and say well we'll just continue for now.

31
00:01:37.668 --> 00:01:40.118
Now notice before I create the user,

32
00:01:40.118 --> 00:01:43.968
there is one policy attached and that is the policy that

33
00:01:43.968 --> 00:01:46.668
allows this IAM user to change their password.

34
00:01:46.668 --> 00:01:50.335
That's certainly what I want them to be able to do,

35
00:01:50.335 --> 00:01:53.577
but note that's all this user will be able to do.

36
00:01:53.577 --> 00:01:57.123
So let's create the user and then we'll have to go about adding

37
00:01:57.123 --> 00:02:00.668
in additional policy for this administrator.

38
00:02:00.668 --> 00:02:06.168
Now there's a couple of important concepts on this page,

39
00:02:06.168 --> 00:02:13.842
number one, there's a link for anybody that's using IAM to use to log on,

40
00:02:13.842 --> 00:02:16.451
and that's this link right here.

41
00:02:16.451 --> 00:02:21.668
We also have the ability of looking at the secret access key.

42
00:02:21.668 --> 00:02:27.577
So if I click Show, it will show me the secret access key.

43
00:02:27.577 --> 00:02:31.668
And I can also email the log on instructions,

44
00:02:31.668 --> 00:02:36.668
a couple of handy options, we also have the download of the csv.

45
00:02:36.668 --> 00:02:38.335
Well what's in the csv?

46
00:02:38.335 --> 00:02:39.668
Let's take a look.

47
00:02:39.668 --> 00:02:41.668
So let's save the credentials file.

48
00:02:41.668 --> 00:02:46.844
So we see three components, the access key,

49
00:02:46.844 --> 00:02:52.668
the secret access key, and the console login link.

50
00:02:52.668 --> 00:02:55.293
So this is information that if I want it,

51
00:02:55.293 --> 00:02:59.085
I have to download it at the time I create the user because

52
00:02:59.085 --> 00:03:01.811
it's not going to be available again.

53
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:05.668
So it's a good idea to save that information.

54
00:03:05.668 --> 00:03:07.335
Alright we've got our user,

55
00:03:07.335 --> 00:03:11.668
let's click the user and we can see what has been set up.

56
00:03:11.668 --> 00:03:14.868
Change password, managed policy; the groups,

57
00:03:14.868 --> 00:03:18.601
none; security credentials, what I can do,

58
00:03:18.601 --> 00:03:19.668
the link.

59
00:03:19.668 --> 00:03:23.858
Now note what is not here is the secret access key.

60
00:03:23.858 --> 00:03:27.668
So remember in the spreadsheet is the secret access key.

61
00:03:27.668 --> 00:03:30.609
If I didn't download it, I'm not getting it again.

62
00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:32.668
The next tab is the access advisor.

63
00:03:32.668 --> 00:03:35.418
The access advisor can be handy because it gives me detail

64
00:03:35.418 --> 00:03:38.335
about the permissions that were granted to this user and when

65
00:03:38.335 --> 00:03:40.001
the services were last accessed.

66
00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:44.668
I don't have anything going on, I haven't logged on as this user yet.

67
00:03:44.668 --> 00:03:47.168
But we're going to, we'll test out this user,

68
00:03:47.168 --> 00:03:49.668
but we have to give the user enough permissions.

69
00:03:49.668 --> 00:03:54.335
So back to permissions, I could add permissions here and grant permissions,

70
00:03:54.335 --> 00:03:56.668
or I could create a group.

71
00:03:56.668 --> 00:04:02.668
So let's go ahead and create a group and the group name,

72
00:04:02.668 --> 00:04:04.668
we'll call it wiredadmin.

73
00:04:04.668 --> 00:04:08.668
So we've created a group, let's go to the properties of this group.

74
00:04:08.668 --> 00:04:13.283
There's no users, let's add some users to the group.

75
00:04:13.283 --> 00:04:14.668
Good to go.

76
00:04:14.668 --> 00:04:20.112
The permissions for this group, now we can take a look at adding policy,

77
00:04:20.112 --> 00:04:21.668
let's attach a policy.

78
00:04:21.668 --> 00:04:25.842
So what do I want this user to be able to do?

79
00:04:25.842 --> 00:04:26.885
EC2 full access?

80
00:04:26.885 --> 00:04:30.049
Note there is a number of prebuilt managed policies,

81
00:04:30.049 --> 00:04:34.620
so we have a number of policies, if I select policy Type,

82
00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:41.168
I can then drill down and say well let's look at job function,

83
00:04:41.168 --> 00:04:43.968
Administrator Access, NetworkAdministrator access,

84
00:04:43.968 --> 00:04:44.668
SystemAdministrator.

85
00:04:44.668 --> 00:04:46.918
So they're trying to make this easy for us.

86
00:04:46.918 --> 00:04:49.168
Since this is an administrator of the account I

87
00:04:49.168 --> 00:04:50.668
certainly want administrator access.

88
00:04:50.668 --> 00:04:53.668
I want to do network administration.

89
00:04:53.668 --> 00:04:56.668
That looks like enough to start.

90
00:04:56.668 --> 00:04:58.535
Let's click Attach Policy.

91
00:04:58.535 --> 00:05:00.868
So I have two policies.

92
00:05:00.868 --> 00:05:03.668
I can add up to 10.

93
00:05:03.668 --> 00:05:09.668
So I have a user in a group and that user has a number of policies.

94
00:05:09.668 --> 00:05:14.801
They have a policy to change the password and they have

95
00:05:14.801 --> 00:05:16.668
administrative and network access.

96
00:05:16.668 --> 00:05:18.032
So let's go back to users,

97
00:05:18.032 --> 00:05:20.759
now we can see the policies have been added to that user

98
00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:23.168
because he's a member of the group.

99
00:05:23.168 --> 00:05:24.168
Which group?

100
00:05:24.168 --> 00:05:25.668
The wiredadmin group.

101
00:05:25.668 --> 00:05:27.768
So we're making a good start.

102
00:05:27.768 --> 00:05:29.868
How could I make this better?

103
00:05:29.868 --> 00:05:32.668
I could activate MFA on the root account.

104
00:05:32.668 --> 00:05:36.268
I could also activate this on all accounts if I wanted to.

105
00:05:36.268 --> 00:05:38.668
I should also apply an IAM password policy.

106
00:05:38.668 --> 00:05:40.335
We'll leave that for another demo,

107
00:05:40.335 --> 00:05:43.668
but that's certainly something in the real world that we should do.

108
00:05:43.668 --> 00:05:47.972
So let's copy this link and we will paste it in,

109
00:05:47.972 --> 00:05:51.885
user name - admin, password - I can't tell you,

110
00:05:51.885 --> 00:05:53.418
top secret and all.

111
00:05:53.418 --> 00:05:57.168
Logging in for the first time, what's my old password,

112
00:05:57.168 --> 00:05:58.668
entering the new password.

113
00:05:58.668 --> 00:06:00.057
I'm in, I'm an administrator,

114
00:06:00.057 --> 00:06:03.112
probably the next thing I should do is add another backup

115
00:06:03.112 --> 00:06:05.668
administrator to that group and then move ahead.

116
00:06:05.668 --> 00:06:16.000
So that's a look at defining IAM policy per user, but note that we didn't stop there, we added the user to a group.
