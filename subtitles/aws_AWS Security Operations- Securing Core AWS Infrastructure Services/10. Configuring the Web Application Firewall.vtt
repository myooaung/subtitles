00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.608
In this demo, we're going to look at using the WAF,

2
00:00:04.608 --> 00:00:06.703
the firewall for the applications,

3
00:00:06.703 --> 00:00:10.850
to create against a bucket that Globomantics has created for

4
00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.379
Wired Brain Coffee for users to upload their pictures of their

5
00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:17.522
custom coffees that they've created.

6
00:00:17.522 --> 00:00:21.379
We want to protect against a specific IP address.

7
00:00:21.379 --> 00:00:23.379
Let's go over to S3 and just review.

8
00:00:23.379 --> 00:00:27.569
In our list of buckets, we have a Wired Brain bucket,

9
00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:30.617
and it's in the Asia Pacific region, i.

10
00:00:30.617 --> 00:00:30.998
e.

11
00:00:30.998 --> 00:00:31.379
Sydney.

12
00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:34.561
Once more users, say in Europe or the United States,

13
00:00:34.561 --> 00:00:36.152
start to access this bucket,

14
00:00:36.152 --> 00:00:41.490
how do I get this bucket to be quickly available for these other users?

15
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.157
And this bucket is for uploading,

16
00:00:44.157 --> 00:00:48.879
but other customers can view what other customers have presented and uploaded.

17
00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.379
So, we want to enable to CloudFront.

18
00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.555
Now CloudFront is their content-delivery network,

19
00:00:54.555 --> 00:01:00.379
and this is a global-delivery network that is on the edge,

20
00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.509
so let's go over to the CDN.

21
00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:05.249
So down under Networking, we can look at CloudFront,

22
00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:10.261
and what we want to do is create a distribution for this particular bucket.

23
00:01:10.261 --> 00:01:14.808
So clicking Get Started, the name of the bucket is wiredbrain,

24
00:01:14.808 --> 00:01:20.379
and we're going to leave the rest of the settings as the defaults.

25
00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:23.320
So we're going to scroll down and create this distribution.

26
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.800
Now this will take a few minutes, maybe 15 minutes.

27
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.116
You can see it's enabled for wiredbrain.

28
00:01:30.116 --> 00:01:34.379
So the idea is that we've got a distribution,

29
00:01:34.379 --> 00:01:37.320
in a sense a caching-distribution network in front of this

30
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.379
bucket that's going to speed up access,

31
00:01:39.379 --> 00:01:42.046
working in conjunction with Route 53 to say,

32
00:01:42.046 --> 00:01:43.046
oh you're there?

33
00:01:43.046 --> 00:01:45.379
Oh, I will distribute this to you.

34
00:01:45.379 --> 00:01:53.179
Notice that the region is global, so if I click the drop-down,

35
00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:58.379
it's beyond, it's above, it's in the edge.

36
00:01:58.379 --> 00:02:01.179
It's not a specific region service,

37
00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:05.379
so we don't select a region because it's global.

38
00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:07.732
Alright, so, now let's go and do WAF.

39
00:02:07.732 --> 00:02:10.379
We go down under Security, we can see WAF.

40
00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.419
What we'd like to do is go to the WAF, and we want to configure a web ACL,

41
00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:20.106
a web ACL that's going to protect our CloudFront distribution and our bucket.

42
00:02:20.106 --> 00:02:22.379
We'll give it a name.

43
00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:28.379
Now as we give it a name, note that it's also giving a metric name, WiredBrain.

44
00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.853
So this is the metric that will be created that will

45
00:02:31.853 --> 00:02:34.379
actually be doing the work against this region,

46
00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.712
against our CloudFront distribution.

47
00:02:36.712 --> 00:02:41.379
Clicking Next, we can now create the condition.

48
00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.026
So we're choosing IP addresses.

49
00:02:44.026 --> 00:02:50.379
The name for this condition, let's call it IP, again CloudFront distribution.

50
00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.561
Now we want to specify an IP version 4 address.

51
00:02:53.561 --> 00:02:57.379
The address has to be in CIDR format, let's add the address,

52
00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:59.850
and click IP address or range.

53
00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.085
Let's create it.

54
00:03:01.085 --> 00:03:04.379
So my match condition is now created successfully.

55
00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:07.979
Now let's continue on, and now we have to define a rule.

56
00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:09.479
So we're setting a rule,

57
00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:14.879
when a condition originates for an IP address in our IP condition,

58
00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:16.379
we'll create this.

59
00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:17.979
Now, the rule's successful.

60
00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:22.379
The default action, if it doesn't match, well, it will allow.

61
00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:26.229
So let's Review and create, looks okay, let's Confirm and create,

62
00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:29.379
so our rule is created, I'm good to go.

63
00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:42.000
So my bucket is protected, even though it's behind the CloudFront distribution, this gives additional protection for a specific suspicious static IP address.
