00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
In this demo we're going to look at VPC setup and this could

2
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.752
be a really long demo looking at all aspects of setting up

3
00:00:10.752 --> 00:00:12.602
public/private gateway services, security groups,

4
00:00:12.602 --> 00:00:12.952
NACLs,

5
00:00:12.952 --> 00:00:17.852
but in one sense I don't really want you to follow a demo and

6
00:00:17.852 --> 00:00:19.854
set something up without thinking about it.

7
00:00:19.854 --> 00:00:22.712
So we're going to do a little different setup in this demo,

8
00:00:22.712 --> 00:00:25.797
I'm going to show you where you can start and give

9
00:00:25.797 --> 00:00:27.376
you some options for automation.

10
00:00:27.376 --> 00:00:31.078
Starting with automation, we're going to look at cloud formation.

11
00:00:31.078 --> 00:00:36.961
Now I've already logged in to Amazon, so I'm there,

12
00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:40.652
so looking at the documentation for services,

13
00:00:40.652 --> 00:00:45.902
there are some sample templates that can show us how to use cloud formation.

14
00:00:45.902 --> 00:00:48.997
So Globomantics has decided to look at one of these templates and see

15
00:00:48.997 --> 00:00:52.493
whether or not it can be a baseline which they can add onto.

16
00:00:52.493 --> 00:00:53.447
So scrolling down,

17
00:00:53.447 --> 00:00:57.902
we can see there's a lot of templates for a lot of different setups,

18
00:00:57.902 --> 00:01:01.084
the one we're interested in is the virtual private cloud.

19
00:01:01.084 --> 00:01:06.784
So to take a look at this automation, let's take a look at the simple one,

20
00:01:06.784 --> 00:01:10.549
a simple EC2 instance in an Amazon VPC.

21
00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:12.902
So let's launch this stack.

22
00:01:12.902 --> 00:01:16.902
Now take a look at the top of the account where it's put me into Oregon.

23
00:01:16.902 --> 00:01:20.902
I don't have any resources there so I'm going to go back to US East.

24
00:01:20.902 --> 00:01:25.235
So you have to keep in mind that I've started some automation and

25
00:01:25.235 --> 00:01:27.902
the automation was created in a particular region.

26
00:01:27.902 --> 00:01:29.902
I have to make sure it matches my region or it's not going to work.

27
00:01:29.902 --> 00:01:32.811
So we're using this particular file from Amazon,

28
00:01:32.811 --> 00:01:33.902
we'll click Next,

29
00:01:33.902 --> 00:01:39.165
and we have not much to set in place other than how do I authenticate,

30
00:01:39.165 --> 00:01:40.744
so I'll pick wired brain.

31
00:01:40.744 --> 00:01:45.165
SSHLocation I could define, I'll leave it open for now, and click Next.

32
00:01:45.165 --> 00:01:51.902
Key values, do some test automation, and all we have to do now is click Create.

33
00:01:51.902 --> 00:01:56.235
It should launch this and we can see the create is in progress.

34
00:01:56.235 --> 00:01:59.534
Selecting the stack we can see what's happening and it

35
00:01:59.534 --> 00:02:02.376
shows us the complete automation, it's made the VPC,

36
00:02:02.376 --> 00:02:05.759
it's added in the internet gateway, and it's continuing on,

37
00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.902
adding in its subnets and adding in the rest of the pieces.

38
00:02:10.902 --> 00:02:12.652
Well look at that, that's completed.

39
00:02:12.652 --> 00:02:17.902
So I can look at my resources and it tells me exactly what it set up for me.

40
00:02:17.902 --> 00:02:20.235
So let's head over to EC2.

41
00:02:20.235 --> 00:02:24.902
I've got an additional running instance and that would be this one.

42
00:02:24.902 --> 00:02:27.188
Alright so it set it up for me.

43
00:02:27.188 --> 00:02:28.902
Now I'm also paying for resources.

44
00:02:28.902 --> 00:02:33.902
If I go down to Elastic IP, it's using an elastic IP and it's good to go.

45
00:02:33.902 --> 00:02:38.007
So automation, don't forget automation to set up a VPC and an instance,

46
00:02:38.007 --> 00:02:41.720
and there's nothing to stop you from using cloud formation

47
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.902
for complete automation of just your VPC.

48
00:02:44.902 --> 00:02:48.608
Now another component for setup is to consider using

49
00:02:48.608 --> 00:02:51.902
the VPC Wizard to set up the VPC.

50
00:02:51.902 --> 00:02:53.586
Because from the wizard,

51
00:02:53.586 --> 00:02:57.797
let's say I wanted to select a VPC with public/private

52
00:02:57.797 --> 00:02:59.902
subnets and hardware VPN access,

53
00:02:59.902 --> 00:03:02.728
I could select that option and it would give me all of the

54
00:03:02.728 --> 00:03:04.250
possibilities that I had to fill out,

55
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.045
meaning I'm not going to leave anything behind,

56
00:03:07.045 --> 00:03:12.188
and it's a simple matter of adding in all of my wiring,

57
00:03:12.188 --> 00:03:16.766
all of my addresses, and creating it and having it very quickly created.

58
00:03:16.766 --> 00:03:22.056
I find it a really nice clean way to look at setting up your VPN and

59
00:03:22.056 --> 00:03:33.000
looking at all the possibilities of what you might need. So there's a look at VPC setup, automation and the wizard.
