1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,516
In this demo we'll take a look at security tools,

2
00:00:04,516 --> 00:00:06,976
the tools that deal with the passwords,

3
00:00:06,976 --> 00:00:10,031
and for that we're going to start with IAM.

4
00:00:10,031 --> 00:00:15,031
So from the console under Security, Identity, & Compliance, let's pick IAM.

5
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:19,317
Now if you watched the last demo we ended up here and we can see

6
00:00:19,317 --> 00:00:21,781
we've got the one administrative user and one group.

7
00:00:21,781 --> 00:00:24,031
We can see the logon link, we're all go.

8
00:00:24,031 --> 00:00:24,531
So IAM,

9
00:00:24,531 --> 00:00:29,481
what we can do from the console is we can take a look at the credential report.

10
00:00:29,481 --> 00:00:31,581
Now the credential report is created,

11
00:00:31,581 --> 00:00:35,857
it's stored for up to 4 hours and I can download the report and

12
00:00:35,857 --> 00:00:38,205
take a look at it by clicking this button,

13
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:41,486
having had a lot of log ons for this particular account,

14
00:00:41,486 --> 00:00:44,395
it's going to save it as a csv,

15
00:00:44,395 --> 00:00:48,031
let's see if there's anything in there that's of value.

16
00:00:48,031 --> 00:00:50,281
And we can see that there is some information.

17
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:54,031
We can see that we did a log on, the last demo we logged on,

18
00:00:54,031 --> 00:00:55,877
did the user create a password?

19
00:00:55,877 --> 00:00:58,031
We can see all sorts of information.

20
00:00:58,031 --> 00:01:02,406
So pretty handy report if you had a lot of users to look at the

21
00:01:02,406 --> 00:01:05,031
status as to what's going on with the credentials.

22
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:06,281
Were you able to access?

23
00:01:06,281 --> 00:01:07,781
Were you not able to access?

24
00:01:07,781 --> 00:01:09,031
Did they change their password?

25
00:01:09,031 --> 00:01:10,174
What was the date?

26
00:01:10,174 --> 00:01:11,317
What was the time?

27
00:01:11,317 --> 00:01:13,031
What else can we do here?

28
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,596
Well we have the credential report.

29
00:01:14,596 --> 00:01:17,205
If I select a user, I've only got one user,

30
00:01:17,205 --> 00:01:22,325
but in a way it makes it nice and simple to look at this interface,

31
00:01:22,325 --> 00:01:26,031
and under Admin we can go to Access Advisor.

32
00:01:26,031 --> 00:01:30,486
Access Advisor will give me some advise as to what can this user do,

33
00:01:30,486 --> 00:01:33,031
and now that the user has logged on,

34
00:01:33,031 --> 00:01:36,087
you may remember in the last demo there was nothing here,

35
00:01:36,087 --> 00:01:38,663
now because my credentials have been applied through the

36
00:01:38,663 --> 00:01:42,452
group I guess I can do a few things because I have

37
00:01:42,452 --> 00:01:44,031
administrative rights and networking rights.

38
00:01:44,031 --> 00:01:45,593
Now what did I access?

39
00:01:45,593 --> 00:01:49,031
It doesn't look like I've done anything, that would be true.

40
00:01:49,031 --> 00:01:52,189
So from the IAM console we can get a credential report and

41
00:01:52,189 --> 00:01:54,031
we can deal with the access advisor.

42
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:57,460
We can also look at CloudTrail, so let's go over to CloudTrail.

43
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,954
CloudTrail is going to leave a trail of access and it says

44
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:04,031
well you've just setup this account, it hasn't started yet.

45
00:02:04,031 --> 00:02:07,531
I probably should turn this on, so let's click Get Started.

46
00:02:07,531 --> 00:02:12,667
I can have one trail for free and so what shall our trail name?

47
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:13,758
The wiredTrail.

48
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:14,849
All regions?

49
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:15,395
Sure.

50
00:02:15,395 --> 00:02:17,031
Create a bucket?

51
00:02:17,031 --> 00:02:17,505
Sure.

52
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:18,926
What about wiredtracker?

53
00:02:18,926 --> 00:02:26,031
So there won't be a lot going on because I've just turned on this trail,

54
00:02:26,031 --> 00:02:28,399
something that we certainly should do for our account.

55
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:31,031
So let's go over and look at the other account.

56
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:33,412
This account has been running for a number of years,

57
00:02:33,412 --> 00:02:36,931
so we can see that there's a whole bunch of information on API activity.

58
00:02:36,931 --> 00:02:39,631
You can see there's lots of stuff going on.

59
00:02:39,631 --> 00:02:42,031
Again, if you have followed all the demos,

60
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:45,531
you can see that I switched roles, I exited roles,

61
00:02:45,531 --> 00:02:50,317
I did certain things with this account and so everything is being tracked.

62
00:02:50,317 --> 00:02:52,888
So CloudTrail can be very handy.

63
00:02:52,888 --> 00:02:55,031
So let's go into CloudWatch.

64
00:02:55,031 --> 00:02:57,656
Well with CloudWatch we can set up some rules.

65
00:02:57,656 --> 00:03:00,573
So clicking rules we can create a rule and say,

66
00:03:00,573 --> 00:03:04,281
well I would like to find out when somebody logs in.

67
00:03:04,281 --> 00:03:08,031
It is any user or is it a particular user?

68
00:03:08,031 --> 00:03:11,698
Is there somebody I want to identify by the resource name?

69
00:03:11,698 --> 00:03:17,281
For now I can leave it as any user and then I can select the target.

70
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:21,031
So selecting add target, well there's a few targets.

71
00:03:21,031 --> 00:03:25,768
I could send it to a lambda function, that's automation,

72
00:03:25,768 --> 00:03:30,820
so I write that automation saying if this happens carryout a task.

73
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:35,031
I can also get notified and then from the dropdown list I can pick a topic.

74
00:03:35,031 --> 00:03:41,031
Maybe I'm tracking my sales team, so I could say sales configure my details,

75
00:03:41,031 --> 00:03:44,531
give it a name, we'll call it consolecheck,

76
00:03:44,531 --> 00:03:46,531
and create the rule.

77
00:03:46,531 --> 00:03:47,031
Success.

78
00:03:47,031 --> 00:03:50,031
We now have a console check.

79
00:03:50,031 --> 00:03:55,898
Many different possibilities of tracking what's happening with

80
00:03:55,898 --> 00:04:01,031
authentication and security of my IAM users.

81
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:05,031
But wait a minute, what's the console check going to do in its current state?

82
00:04:05,031 --> 00:04:11,031
Let's go into consolecheck, let's check the SNS topic and see what's been set up.

83
00:04:11,031 --> 00:04:11,978
That's my notification.

84
00:04:11,978 --> 00:04:16,084
I have to create a subscription in order to actually get that information,

85
00:04:16,084 --> 00:04:18,898
so I could then say although what do I want,

86
00:04:18,898 --> 00:04:21,031
oh yes you could send me an email.

87
00:04:21,031 --> 00:04:24,440
I could set up the other aspect of where that information is going to be

88
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,108
sent and you can see that there's a variety of options,

89
00:04:29,108 --> 00:04:30,646
even text.

90
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:34,493
So let's set it up.

91
00:04:34,493 --> 00:04:36,031
I'm subscribed.

92
00:04:36,031 --> 00:04:44,000
Alright we're all set up now. So that's a look at security tools for AWS.
