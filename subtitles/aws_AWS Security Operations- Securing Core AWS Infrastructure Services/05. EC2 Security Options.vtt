00:00:02.104 --> 00:00:07.104
Let's look at some of the security options for our EC2 instances in this demo.

2
00:00:07.104 --> 00:00:11.771
So let's start off by going into the EC2 console and once there we'll

3
00:00:11.771 --> 00:00:15.059
look at one of our instances for Wired Brain Coffee,

4
00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.649
this is the test environment.

5
00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:19.831
We can see one of the web servers is running,

6
00:00:19.831 --> 00:00:24.818
so let's look at the properties of this web server and we can see that there is

7
00:00:24.818 --> 00:00:27.437
an IP version 4 public IP address assigned automatically,

8
00:00:27.437 --> 00:00:29.437
there isn't an IP version 6,

9
00:00:29.437 --> 00:00:33.104
there is private DNS and there is a private IP address.

10
00:00:33.104 --> 00:00:38.104
So we have a couple of options for networking that are assigned.

11
00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:39.695
Now since we're also focusing on security,

12
00:00:39.695 --> 00:00:43.104
we can see that there's a VPC and we can see that there's a subnet,

13
00:00:43.104 --> 00:00:44.979
but what type are they?

14
00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:49.854
So backup to Services and we'll head down to VPC and we've got

15
00:00:49.854 --> 00:00:53.504
one VPC and it ends up being the default VPC.

16
00:00:53.504 --> 00:00:56.654
Now if you've been following along with this class,

17
00:00:56.654 --> 00:00:59.104
that's not the right one for production,

18
00:00:59.104 --> 00:01:01.604
it might be the right one just to start out with,

19
00:01:01.604 --> 00:01:04.454
but really we have to create a VPC for this customer based

20
00:01:04.454 --> 00:01:06.904
on the security needs for this customer.

21
00:01:06.904 --> 00:01:11.104
So if I look at the default VPC, what do I have?

22
00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:13.539
I have a route table, let's go take a look at the route table,

23
00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:16.704
and we can see that we're heading out to the internet gateway.

24
00:01:16.704 --> 00:01:20.971
So this subnet has public access automatically because

25
00:01:20.971 --> 00:01:23.437
that was selected during installation.

26
00:01:23.437 --> 00:01:25.104
Now security groups, network ACLs,

27
00:01:25.104 --> 00:01:29.420
we know we have a number of security groups in our library and

28
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.209
we can define the security group based on the security that we

29
00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:35.104
want for attaching to this instance.

30
00:01:35.104 --> 00:01:39.339
We also know that we can take advantage by using network ACLs

31
00:01:39.339 --> 00:01:41.104
to provide additional stateless security.

32
00:01:41.104 --> 00:01:46.437
Let's go in and take a look at the EC2 instance from the creation

33
00:01:46.437 --> 00:01:49.104
standpoint and we'll start launching an instance.

34
00:01:49.104 --> 00:01:52.788
And let's pick the first one, the Amazon Linux AMI,

35
00:01:52.788 --> 00:01:56.104
and we can get some information about the instance.

36
00:01:56.104 --> 00:01:59.633
You may remember we talked about CPUs, the different types,

37
00:01:59.633 --> 00:02:03.533
Intel components, where are they when we're looking at ordering a system?

38
00:02:03.533 --> 00:02:06.104
Well I have to go and select show/hide columns,

39
00:02:06.104 --> 00:02:10.554
and this is where I can get tell me what the physical processor is,

40
00:02:10.554 --> 00:02:13.704
tell me the clock speed, tell me the architecture,

41
00:02:13.704 --> 00:02:15.468
show me the Intel features.

42
00:02:15.468 --> 00:02:17.286
Now I've got some information.

43
00:02:17.286 --> 00:02:19.104
I've got more reading material.

44
00:02:19.104 --> 00:02:22.234
So if I pick the general purpose, t2 micro,

45
00:02:22.234 --> 00:02:27.104
I know it's part of the Xeon family, I can see my clock speed,

46
00:02:27.104 --> 00:02:30.247
I can see the memory, I can see the instance EBS.

47
00:02:30.247 --> 00:02:32.818
So I get a little more information including the

48
00:02:32.818 --> 00:02:35.247
different features of the Intel chip set.

49
00:02:35.247 --> 00:02:38.104
So that's where you get that information from.

50
00:02:38.104 --> 00:02:40.457
So let's go in and configure the instance details and

51
00:02:40.457 --> 00:02:42.104
see what we can do for security.

52
00:02:42.104 --> 00:02:45.788
Well the default VPC is selected, there isn't another option,

53
00:02:45.788 --> 00:02:49.961
so I really need to create a new VPC and then I

54
00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:51.675
would set my networking up properly.

55
00:02:51.675 --> 00:02:53.675
The signing of the public IP address,

56
00:02:53.675 --> 00:02:56.683
do I want to use the subnet settings of enabling?

57
00:02:56.683 --> 00:03:00.472
Right now it's set to disable, I get to decide that because,

58
00:03:00.472 --> 00:03:03.009
of course, there's public IP address.

59
00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:09.199
We know with IAM roles I could add in an IAM role to

60
00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:13.163
secure access from this instance to, in this case,

61
00:03:13.163 --> 00:03:14.810
S3 access, for example.

62
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.104
So I have some options that are here.

63
00:03:18.104 --> 00:03:21.437
Do I want to enable termination protection to

64
00:03:21.437 --> 00:03:23.104
protect against accidental deletion?

65
00:03:23.104 --> 00:03:24.904
I should do that as well.

66
00:03:24.904 --> 00:03:29.104
I definitely want to monitor what's going on so I know when there's issues.

67
00:03:29.104 --> 00:03:31.104
I certainly want to be monitoring this instance.

68
00:03:31.104 --> 00:03:34.904
Let's scroll down and see what else we have as far as security decisions.

69
00:03:34.904 --> 00:03:38.104
Another option is adding in the user data,

70
00:03:38.104 --> 00:03:40.504
a script that will run once,

71
00:03:40.504 --> 00:03:44.771
and in this script you can do your configuration of this instance,

72
00:03:44.771 --> 00:03:48.104
it will be done exactly the same every single time.

73
00:03:48.104 --> 00:03:52.104
Now when we take a look at storage, we have options of adding different volumes.

74
00:03:52.104 --> 00:03:58.104
I also have some security of reliability because I'm using SSD drives.

75
00:03:58.104 --> 00:04:03.104
Now one other security options is the tenancy, so let's go back.

76
00:04:03.104 --> 00:04:09.104
Notice that we can see tenancy, do I want to run a shared hardware instance?

77
00:04:09.104 --> 00:04:11.013
Do I want a dedicated instance?

78
00:04:11.013 --> 00:04:12.286
Or a dedicated host?

79
00:04:12.286 --> 00:04:15.468
I've got a couple of security options as to whether

80
00:04:15.468 --> 00:04:17.468
I want to be multitenant or not.

81
00:04:17.468 --> 00:04:20.468
And we're going to be taking a look at this concept

82
00:04:20.468 --> 00:04:24.286
in some detail in this class, so we will cover this a bit later.

83
00:04:24.286 --> 00:04:28.104
The last thing we'll take a look at, we'll look at reviewing and launching,

84
00:04:28.104 --> 00:04:31.954
it gives us our information, there's no warnings that are here,

85
00:04:31.954 --> 00:04:36.247
so let's click Launch and it will come up and say Mark,

86
00:04:36.247 --> 00:04:38.914
one other thing, what's the key pair.

87
00:04:38.914 --> 00:04:44.017
I had better choose an existing key pair that I have a copy of.

88
00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:47.365
If I don't have a copy of these different key pairs

89
00:04:47.365 --> 00:04:51.843
that have been used in the past, I better create a new key pair,

90
00:04:51.843 --> 00:04:54.974
I better give it a name, say wired 2017,

91
00:04:54.974 --> 00:04:58.104
we'll download that key pair and we'll save it,

92
00:04:58.104 --> 00:05:01.704
and now when I launch this instance this is the key pair

93
00:05:01.704 --> 00:05:04.104
that's going to be linked with this instance.

94
00:05:04.104 --> 00:05:14.000
So there's a look at security options available and some of the decisions that you have to make when launching an instance at AWS.
