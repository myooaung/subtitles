00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.320
Hi,

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:00.810
everybody.

00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.430
And welcome to this lesson on connecting to our A C two instances and never getting our

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.020
hyper litter fabric network.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.050
When we looked at the Explorer,

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.560
we launched our fabric networks.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.780
Let's go ahead and connect to our easy to instance and start working with our hyper your

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:17.520
fabric network.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.790
Now I'm working on a Windows PC.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.590
So in order to at this age into the A C two instance,

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.780
which is Lennox based,

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.720
I need to use something called Party.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.940
And in order to do that,

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.480
the first thing I need to do is get information regarding my easy to instance.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.150
And I can do that through the easy to instance Dashboard,

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.870
If I click on the sea to instance name and Afro click on Connect,

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.980
it'll give me some information about my easy to instance.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.410
Once I do that,

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.100
I'm gonna go ahead and launched the windows Pretty.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.700
I'm gonna go ahead and click This are saved.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.800
This session for future use is just so I don't have to put in all of the information all

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.620
over again.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.120
Now I want to do is in the data part of the user.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.680
Name is easy to death.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.050
Usually that you guys can see everything before the at sign is the user name.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.250
If I click on the authentication in the s S h,

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.250
I'm gonna want to browse for the keep that I downloaded in one of the previous lessons.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.130
If you guys remember,

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.490
one of the wrecks was creating a keep and via remember,

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.370
I told you to save it in a safe place.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.870
So this is where we specify that specific keep their and almost I Peters,

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.970
you guys can see that it is the name of the or the domain name off.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.590
The easy to instance that I highlighted for you on there.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.750
I want to have all the information I can connect an ssh into my easy to instance,

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.050
Let me just increase the font size.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.680
So you guys are able to see what I'm doing in the different commands that I'm running in

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.750
this command prompt.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.830
And there we go.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.240
You guys conceive from the command product.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.950
I'm currently logged into my easy to instance in AWS as easy to user.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.440
And then that is the I P address of the easy to instance.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.570
So let's run the command to explore a instance to see what's going on.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.050
And as you can see,

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.910
there are two or directories here,

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.710
one that contains the example chain code for the hyper leather fabric.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.850
And then we have the hyper ledger Basic network.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.400
Now that the main director that we're going to work more than the one we are interested in

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.400
.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.210
So let's go ahead and take a look at that a little bit further.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.830
We're gonna run the L s command on the hyper ledger Basic network folder that's gonna show

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:33.520
us what this or what is within this specific folder And what artifacts are in there now,

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.700
as you guys going to be one of the folders you have is doctor composed,

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.300
which contains the A m O file for all of the containers that were set up for hyper ledger

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.580
fabric network that was launched to the cult claw information template.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.580
And if you run the command again to view the files which are within the doctor composed

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.930
director,

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.710
you can see that there are a number off,

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:54.080
um oh,

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.610
files and templates that are available now these Air Yemen files that are used by AWS in

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.870
order to provisioned the Blockchain network with the three pierce and order note and the

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.150
rest of the containers.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.930
So we're gonna go ahead and CD into this directory and so we can work with these GMO files

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.910
that we have to perform a little bit off a fix here,

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.100
which is,

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.750
um,

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.010
something that has been overlooked by AWS at this point time because again,

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.580
this is a brand new service which is offered by AWS and burn template,

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:33.030
which is created by AWS someone the Yemen Finals has a space that we need to go out and

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.480
delete.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.620
Now,

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.080
the C amel file is what AWS used by default in order to bring up the containers in a fabric

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.650
network.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.760
So it's the doctor composed as C L.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.770
I am a foul on.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.910
We can view all the containers that there's,

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:48.090
um,

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.700
a file created by using the docker compose compose P s command.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.900
Here we see that this Yemen file created seven running processes.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.940
The state of all these processes are up indicating that they're all running.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.070
The first these processes is a CLI or the command line interface that we're gonna use to

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.200
connect to our client.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:07.960
Well,

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:13.340
then I have the fabric explore running on Port 80 80 and this the container running hypos

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.740
Explorer that we just connected to In our previous lesson,

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:22.070
we can see that the fabric Explorer DB runs the post.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.120
Corey SQL.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.920
We have the container running the order note on the order nor belongs to the channel domain

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:28.620
as a whole,

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.260
which is example that calm dooming because if you remember,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.370
I left it as default.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.290
But if you are in a production environment,

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.460
you want to have this as your own domain name.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.130
Now we have the three peer nodes belonging to each of the organizations that were set up.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.930
The 12 and three on all of these sub domains are an example dot com.

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.170
Now,

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.510
this is what we had configured when we set up the Blockchain template figure.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:52.480
Remember the stack.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.970
So let's go ahead and fix that specific type O and the specific bug that is,

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.000
within Monday cli containers,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.070
which makes it a little on user and unusable.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.140
It will cause problems a little bit later on,

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.480
so if you don't fix it and you run into problems,

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.380
you'll know why.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:14.450
So we'll use the nano text editor editor to open up the docker compose C L I m o file.

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:22.250
I'm gonna go ahead and scroll on down to the line that says the core Pierre MSP config path

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.250
.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:23.000
No,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.210
this is an environment variable that's been configured.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.100
Not wrongly,

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.680
but there's just a space in between that we need to get rid off.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.060
I want to go ahead and delete this space and we click on control.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.040
Retyped control.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.550
X guys conceal.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:38.830
Ask if you want to save this.

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:39.010
Yeah,

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.570
move file.

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.050
We're gonna go and click on yes,

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.090
and keep the name the same by clicking on Enter.

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.690
No,

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.320
what we want What?

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.640
We wanted to bring up the container for our command line interfaces using the docker image

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:51.120
for it.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.480
And that's why I guess he has specified the image tag is equal to latest.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.880
That's our environment.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:57.410
Variable.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:02.140
The doctor composed command will retrieve the latest images for each of the containers that

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.370
we're bringing up using.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.870
The doctor composed other containers for the piers and orders work.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.920
This finances is the only one that we knew.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.790
We need to use the latest latest version off,

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:17.560
so we need to create the c l or recreate the CIA container should say so.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.800
We specify the doctor composed dash if specified the name of the yamma file Which again,

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.390
if you remember,

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:24.340
is the docker compose?

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:29.090
See Ally and make sure that you guys when you saved it and you kept the name the same if

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:34.040
you named it differently make sure you specify that here and the up up commander case that

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:38.450
you want to recreate the container the D indicates that we want to run this command in the

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:39.120
background.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.130
Now we don't want to recreate any of the other containers,

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:46.770
so it is going to leave this one here and click on Enter and we're going to see this

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.210
message indicating that are CLI recreation has been complete.

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:51.140
Now,

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.710
once that's done,

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:56.260
we're ready to log into our cli container on.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:01.050
We're going to use the docker compose exact command which connects us to the container

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:08.950
running our command line interface and executes the bash cell in the cli container from

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:11.610
within the from within this container,

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:15.470
which is basically a client application for our fabric network.

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.560
Lets see are some environment variables.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.690
Now we're explicitly interested in those environment environment variables which have the

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:24.250
term Pierre within them.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:24.860
Now,

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:31.220
the export Command which will list all of the environment variables from within those very

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:37.070
variables were interested in those that have the pure word and want to filter out those

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:39.840
environment variables which contained the term TLS.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.950
If you guys look at the variables,

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:46.680
the biscuit tell you that the default peer to which the command line interface client

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:52.760
application will connect is or Gwen Pierre I want to run the pier command from this cli

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:58.170
utility appear that it will reference is the organ one and we can change this to be a

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:01.440
different period by updating the values and the environment.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.250
Variables.

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:04.930
Let's go ahead and weaken.

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:11.100
Type out exit and exit back to our main shell command prompt for are easy to instance and

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.690
outer far doctor container.

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:18.560
So this is basically just you guys familiar with a Dr Container that was set up on how we

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:22.280
need to just modify one of those yamma files to get rid of the space.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:27.610
And if you want to go ahead and change the or one peer toe or two or or three or whatever

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:29.550
name you define when we set up the stack,

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:35.730
we are also able to able to do that by changing some of these environment variables.
