00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.830
everybody.

00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:06.210
And welcome to this lesson on creating our first chain code in our high pills or fabric

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:06.700
network.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:14.380
Now I'm going to be using the Golan programming language and familiarize or help you learn

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.920
The Golan language is a bit outside of the scope of this course.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.290
So I'm assuming you guys are familiar with gold Lang or some of the concepts.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.680
If you're not Ah,

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:22.240
that's okay.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.540
Also,

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.830
we can just copy and paste the code in there,

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.920
but I'll take you through the all of the lines in their help.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.250
Explain what you're about,

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.570
what this chain code does and what it's used for.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.600
And it's also available online on the get have repository for you guys use the multiple

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.940
chain cause that are available,

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.780
and the main programming languages that are used are either going or node Js Oh depends on

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.690
which program language you're familiar with you can use to write your chain code.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:48.350
So again,

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.920
like I mentioned,

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.430
the one that I'll be using specifically for this demonstration and for this course is this

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.490
going coat.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.840
So we're going to write a chain Cote to set up a,

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.680
uh,

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.750
vehicle registry specifically for cars where we can change the ownership of cars from one

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.780
person to another,

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.160
and we can keep a record of who the original owner was and so on.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.580
So the first thing we're going to do is set of functions within the chain called Devil

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.780
allows to create new vehicles and then quarry those details of the specific vehicle.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:27.050
So what we want to be able to do is set up a vehicle within the bloc,

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.480
shame to let their want to have inventory off a new vehicle.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.650
I want to make sure I get that logged in along with the order is I want to be able to query

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:37.780
that vehicle,

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.160
and I also want to be able to change the ownership of that vehicle on all of that.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.630
I want to keep track off within my Blockchain network,

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.250
and essentially,

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.580
this is what this chain court allows us to do.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:56.360
The first thing that we need to do within the Golding is set up some import statement for

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.730
the libraries that we need,

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.160
so we're going to first import the including Jason Library on.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.400
That's going to allow us to store our car details in the Jason format and ledger.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.260
The format library is used for formatting our output statements.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.980
Now it contains specifically the print function,

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.560
and we're also going like I mentioned,

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.250
use some off the chain called specific libraries from Get Hub Directly.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.800
Now the S H I am or a shim package supplies AP eyes,

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.440
which we use to access certain variables within our chain coat.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:36.740
And it also access is the current state off our Red Street are far Vehicle Registry Ledger

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.110
and additionally,

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.530
it's also going toe.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.770
Allow us access the allows X to the transactions that is to be executed along with all of

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.130
the arguments needed to execute the transaction.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.860
Additionally,

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:58.360
were also important appear package that's going to structure the responses once we import

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.720
everything.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.660
Now we're ready to set up the structure which represents our vehicle registry.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.450
Now go allows us to attach functions to any data,

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.040
types and functions to struck's.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.720
So that's what we're going to do here now.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.660
Go doesn't explicitly have any specific classes,

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.050
but it allows functions to be attached to types known as receivers for the function.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.180
So the i n.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.330
I.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.670
T.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.120
And invoke functions from the chain code interface will be attached to the car registries

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.900
trucked and again that's going to act as a receiver.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.450
Additionally,

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.890
we're going to set up another struck,

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.510
which will have the fields and hold.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.630
The basic information about the car on the car.

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.250
Struck will contain the make the color and so on of the specific vehicle.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.850
We're also going to serialize this in the Jason format on the value in this field,

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.540
be written out with a key make with a lower case M.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.400
The car struck contains other string fields with information as well,

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.240
such as the model,

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.270
the color like I mentioned and most importantly,

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.390
the owner of the car,

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.640
which is what we're going to be using.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.130
Let's say the car changes ownership and yes and see ah,

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.110
we can scroll on down the rest of this chain code to help you familiarize yourselves with

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.900
what's going on.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.990
But the basic just if it is,

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:26.810
what we're doing is creating a simple car registry program in which we can and put in cars

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.810
.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.630
Let's say we were put in a command.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.100
We specify the specific information for the car,

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.360
such as the make the model,

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.430
the color and the owner.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.740
It'll save that into the Blockchain.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.950
We can also query those records within that Blockchain to see if that car exists and who

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:41.760
the owner is.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:42.610
And then,

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:43.210
lastly,

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.780
we can change the ownership off that vehicle from person A to person B.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:48.500
So essentially,

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.720
that's what this chain code is doing.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.840
I'm not going to get into any more of the details in terms of the Gold Lang,

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.850
because that will get a bit outside of the scope of this course.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:58.550
Um,

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.550
but just for your reference,

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.590
this is essentially what this chain court is doing.

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:08.100
And you can also write any change that you want and go lying or no,

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.790
Jess,

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:09.880
depending on you know,

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:15.530
whichever ones you or your organization are using or are comfortable with that that's

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.380
basically the crux of the Shane code.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.390
We're gonna go ahead and completes his chin cord.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:26.430
We're going to save this as a car registry dot go and save it on our A C.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.650
Two instance
