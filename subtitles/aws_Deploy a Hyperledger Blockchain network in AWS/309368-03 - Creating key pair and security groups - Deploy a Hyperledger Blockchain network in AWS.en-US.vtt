00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.550
hi,

00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:00.900
everybody,

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.230
and welcome to the second step in creating and launching our hyper larger network.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.280
So we're already done creating our BBC and this lesson we're gonna go ahead and create our

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.490
security group and our keeper.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:22.680
I'm gonna go ahead and navigate to the easy to a section or the sea to dashboard and on the

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.470
left hand side will see an option for key pairs are just for your reference.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.420
The key pairs are required when we're gonna be ssh ing into our A C two instance and

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.570
configure our Blockchain network because that is you got since I already have one created

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.880
that I was testing out with.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.350
I'm gonna go ahead and click on Create in you pair.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.420
I'm gonna give it a unique name just so I can keep it differentiated that I'm using this

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.600
for the Blockchain network on a gold.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.650
Go ahead and click on creating or what's going to do is going to download the key pair for

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:58.130
me onto my PC and just make sure that it is kept in a safe place because we will be

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:03.850
utilizing this key pair when we're connecting into are easy to instance and configuring Are

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.830
Blockchain network in after that?

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.540
Then I'm gonna go ahead and go into the security groups because we will,

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:17.750
because we'll need to create a security group to allow certain protocols toe be available

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.290
in our CC Twin stirs going to give this security group a unique name just so I can keep it

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.940
identified as being used for the Blockchain network.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:25.750
For the description.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:26.610
Weaken again.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.820
It's just for your reference in terms of identifying what the security group is going to be

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:31.550
used for.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.770
For the VPC again,

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.780
we're going to selected VPC.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.280
We just created in the previous lesson to make sure that the security group is being

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.220
applied to that.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.970
Go and click on create No.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.020
One thing that we need to do is obviously we need to allow certain protocols in certain

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.980
traffic to be able to come in to this easy to instance,

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.830
into this VPC because it is a publicly facing VPC,

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.420
I'm gonna go ahead and select the security group I just created on the bottom.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.930
I guess he's several tabs that we're able to customize our security group.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.300
So what I want to do is I want to allow inbound traffic.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.470
So I'm gonna click on the inbound and right now the table is empty.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.820
So I'm going to go ahead and click on edit and allows certain protocols or certain types of

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:21.530
traffic to be able to be allowed into the VPC networking essentially to our A c two

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.150
instance.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.100
Now,

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.040
we're mainly going to be working through ssh!

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.590
Trying to make sure the first thing I want to do is allow as this h traffic Teoh into this

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.460
vpc from the public domain.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.400
So in the type,

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:43.340
I'm gonna go ahead and find S S H and the SNC.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.630
The protocol is by default a TCP,

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:52.920
and the default port it uses is Port 22 in terms of source now I can identify either my i p

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.870
a custom I p or any i p address.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.460
And if you guys notice wants us like my i p,

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.260
it will automatically determine what is my I P address that is currently assigned to my

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.950
machine.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.040
And anywhere is obviously which is not something you guys want to do it allow anybody to

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.440
connect into easy to instance.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.860
But if I do my i p,

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.880
it will identify the current I,

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.080
Peters has assigned to my machine that you're logged into AWS with.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.840
I will only allow access age into the VPC from your specific I P address,

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.400
which is,

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.830
for security purposes,

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:25.760
highly recommended.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.220
Because if anybody can access age into your A C twin since they can basically use it to do

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.220
anything that they want,

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:39.690
I'm gonna go ahead and click on Add this S S H rule And I also want to add a customer TCP

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.040
for port 80 80 because when we go out through,

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.230
the rest of lessons will be connecting through Port 80 80 on to our A c two instance to

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.270
monitor our hyper legend network.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.580
Want to make sure that I'll I allow both of this traffic into the easy to instance from my

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:57.390
current machine,

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:58.300
which I'm working with,

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.050
which I'm logging to AWS with?

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.260
If we don't do that by default,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.660
it does block all traffic so you won't be able to connect into your easy to instance,

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.890
especially a publicly facing one which is assigned to a specific VPC.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.960
So we have to make sure that we create the security group in allow both of those types of

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.050
traffic because if you don't allow the TCP,

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.350
then we won't be able to monitor our Blockchain network.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:22.220
Once I do that,

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.180
I'm gonna go and quickly click on Save.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.180
And as you guys can see on the bottom,

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.430
it has added both those roles or allow both off this type of traffic into this VPC from the

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.350
public domain.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:33.860
For the second step,

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.660
the told me things that want to do is we wanna go and create that keep their there all

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.840
hours to assess it into the instance and then obviously allow the traffic off Both ssh and

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.570
the TCP port 80 80.
