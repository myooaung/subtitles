00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.330
Hi,

00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:00.790
everybody.

00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.930
And welcome to this lesson on looking at the different components off a Blockchain.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:05.660
Now,

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:06.460
as discussed,

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:11.180
Blockchain is essentially allowing transactions were recorded in a shared or distributed

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.840
ledger rather than having a centralized leisure,

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.520
which is how things used to work.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.090
So now let's look at what are the different components off off Blockchain and how it

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.100
enables the use of a distributed ledger.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.200
So we're gonna look at three different things in this lesson.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.510
Look at transactions,

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.280
smart contracts and consensus.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.190
A log rhythms.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.980
These are the basic building blocks that power the Blockchain network.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.980
Transactions in the world of Blockchain could be thought off as a message,

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.210
which is sent from a center to a recipient,

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.390
which transfers something over value to the other.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.200
It can be in a form of currency,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.940
which a lot of your familiar with cryptocurrencies,

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:48.890
such as Bitcoin,

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.280
or any tangible or intangible asset,

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.230
for example,

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.700
in terms of a tangible asset,

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.040
it can be a vehicle.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.450
It can be a house.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.140
It could be anything that's tangible or intangible.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.040
Assets such as intellectual property and transactions can be logically thought of as being

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.320
made up of three components you have the recipient,

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.600
you have the signature of the centre and the other value of the assets to send.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.190
Any transaction that has been executed has to be recorded in a permanent manner.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.640
And the distributed ledger.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.590
Since the letter exists with all nodes,

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.610
these transactions made to be verified and reflected amongst all nodes when we use

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.090
Blockchain technology.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.800
These transactions are the contractual clauses that make up the agreements.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.910
They're executed with something called smart contracts.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:47.980
Smart contracts are essentially the cold that runs in orderto execute transactions.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:54.950
All Blockchain framework used smart contract mechanism to allow common contractual clauses

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.140
to be specified,

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.380
verified or enforced,

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.150
even in the absence of trust between parties and in the absence off 1/3 party.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:11.580
No Wikipedia specifically defined smart contracts as a computer protocol intended to

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.040
digital,

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.770
facilitate,

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.410
verify or enforce the negotiation off performance of a contract.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.260
They allow the performance of credible transaction without third parties,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.470
and they're trackable and irreversible.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.890
The implementation of a smart contract is essentially a software program.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:38.010
This is the program that's executed on a Blockchain network to add entries into the shared

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.940
distributed ledger.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.190
This program is written in a domain specific language.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.110
Such a solidity when you're using ethereum or in a high level language such as JavaScript.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.870
Smart contracts encompass all of the details that have been agreed to by the participating

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:54.510
parties.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.340
No,

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.520
no,

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.330
no in a Blockchain network and update their own copy off the distributed ledger in a

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.500
unilateral way.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.240
Now this means that there has to be some mechanism which should be used to determine what

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.560
entries get added to the share ledger.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.180
And one.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.790
The way this is done is through something called consensus.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:20.820
A longer them's no Blockchain technology explicitly avoids the use of trusted third parties

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.820
.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:26.150
All participants in the contracts and agreements essentially don't trust one another,

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:33.170
which means verification of transactions need Tito adhere to a carefully designed a longer

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.380
objective of a consensus.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.700
A longer them is to ensure that there's agreement amongst all peers as to what transactions

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.350
are valid and what should be added to the distributed ledger,

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.350
not transactions in a distributed ledger have to be verified before they become part of the

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.340
permanent record,

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:56.650
which means you need to verify the identification of the center or the initiator of the

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:57.500
transaction.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:04.710
You also need to make sure that that the transaction has not been modified after initiation

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:10.180
and confirmed that the center actually owns the asset that are being transferred over,

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.170
whether their tangible assets or intangible assets.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.460
All of these steps are required to validate transaction and add the transaction to the

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:20.650
Blockchain network.

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:26.010
Now all of these steps to validate a transaction and add the transaction to the Blockchain

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.240
network are part of the consensus.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.050
A log rhythm.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:35.360
All of the nodes in the Blockchain have to agree upon what transaction should be added and

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.550
the exact ordering off the transaction as well.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.390
Now there are many different consensus logarithms that exist out there,

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.750
and they're different based on the framework that you work with.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:46.290
So,

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:47.070
for example,

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:53.020
a theory amuses the proof of work a log rhythm while hyper leisure Sawtooth uses the proof

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.090
of elapsed time which will look at a little later on and so on.

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:02.550
My once the nodes in a Blockchain network reach consensus as to the transaction that form

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.200
part of the permanent ledger.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.070
And as to the order of these transactions,

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:13.050
that air then added to the distributed ledger and become part the permit ledger that cannot

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.950
be changed.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:14.560
So how?

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:20.100
Blockchain frameworks ensure that one that the transaction once added are permanent and

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.050
incorruptible.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.810
So let's quickly look at implementation details off a block.

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:26.620
Shame No,

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:33.540
let's first look at the block in Blockchain stands for Blockchain is basically a growing

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.540
list of records called blocks which are linked to each other.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:38.590
Cryptographic Lee.

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.670
All of these transactions that are recorded on the Blockchain network are in the form of

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:44.400
blocks.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.690
Ah block is a set of verified transactions in some order where the order has been

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.050
determined by the consensus a longer than that is used.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:59.230
All transactions recorded in the distributed ledger in the form of blocks and each block

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:02.910
are linked to the next block containing the next set of transactions.

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.680
Of the link between this blocks again is a cryptographic link.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.430
Many cannot be tampered with very easily.

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.750
A chain of the link blocks make up the distributed ledger,

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.950
which is where the term Blockchain comes from.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:22.190
Now the cryptographic link is set up using cash in technology which ensures

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:27.960
incorruptibility of the transactions within the certain block and the Blockchain network as

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:28.530
a whole.

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:32.390
So essentially each block in the Blockchain has a hash,

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.170
which is the hash of all of the transactions.

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:36.450
Within that block,

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:41.590
changing the order or contents of any of the blocks will change the hash.

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:46.340
Each block in the Blockchain contains the hash of the previous block.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.100
In that change,

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:51.330
not this cryptographic link is set up using hashing technology,

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:57.220
which ensures incorruptibility of the transactions within the certain block and the

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.450
blocking of the whole.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:01.200
So each block in the Blockchain as a hash,

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.750
which is a hash off all of the transactions within the bloc.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:05.270
Ah,

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:10.190
change in the order or contents of any of these blocks will change the hash.

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:10.660
Now.

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:16.030
Each block in the Blockchain contains the hash of the previous block in that chain.

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:16.220
Now,

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:20.670
if you notice that the hash of the first block is present within the second block,

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:23.540
and it's used to generate the second blocks hash,

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:28.140
the hash of the second block is then also within the third,

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:31.440
and that's used to generate the third blocks Hash.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:37.750
The first block in any Blockchain is called the Genesis block because it doesn't contain

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.650
any previous hashes,

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:44.880
and this hash is a cryptographic link that ensures that the transactions added to the

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.530
Blockchain are immutable and irreversible.

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:53.150
Transaction data in that block can't be altered after the fact.

00:07:53.150 --> 00:08:00.500
Any change in the hash value off a particular block requires altering all subsequent blocks

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:05.850
on all distributed ledgers across all nodes in the network.

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:12.500
This can become extremely complicated and is nearly impossible to do on closing.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:19.070
A Blockchain network uses transaction hashes and cryptographic linking off blocks within

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:24.960
the network in order to ensure that any transaction recorded in this manner are verified,

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:28.290
their permanent and they can't be changed after the fact.

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:35.530
This is what essentially makes Blockchain networks so secure and almost unhappy able at

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:36.640
this point in time.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:41.460
Thank you for watching this lesson on giving go a quick overview about the different

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.060
components off a Blockchain.

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:48.130
Now let's go ahead and get into hyper ledger and see what it has to offer
