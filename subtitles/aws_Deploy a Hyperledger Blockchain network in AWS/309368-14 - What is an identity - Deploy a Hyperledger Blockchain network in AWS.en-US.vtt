00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.360
Hi,

00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:00.800
everybody.

00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.190
And welcome to this lesson on defining what we mean by identity,

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.750
as referred to in the Blockchain network.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.230
So different actors in the blocks in network that we looked at or we are going to look at,

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.020
depending on which lessons you have gone through,

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.230
include peers,

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.750
orders,

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.830
client application administrators and each of these actors.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.200
Active elements Insider,

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.020
Outsider network able to consume services have a digital identity in the form of a digital

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:27.730
certificate.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.420
Thes identities really matter because they determine the exact permissions over resource is

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.170
an access to information that actors have in a Blockchain network and by design,

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.780
Blockchain networks are meant to be secure and anonymous,

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.650
or these identities play ah,

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.230
important role in that aspect.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.150
Now let's take a look at a simple scenario to help explain the use of identity.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.260
So imagine you visit a supermarket to buy some groceries.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.530
Remember the check out you.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:57.140
Most luckily,

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.850
remember the sign that says a Visa MasterCard Diners Club Amex card are accepted here.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.280
If you try to pay with a different card,

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.950
it doesn't matter whether the card is authentic or not.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.560
It will not be accepted.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.790
It only accepts Visa,

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.770
MasterCard and Diners Club,

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.020
and you try to use an American Express card.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.680
It will not work even though it's a valid card,

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.720
because having a valid credit card is not enough.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.070
It must also be accepted by the store and public key infrastructures and membership service

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:37.650
providers work together in the same way a PK provides a list of identities and an MSP says

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.650
,

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.830
and an MSP says,

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.250
Which of these are members off a given organization that participates in the network?

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.150
Peaky,

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.480
I certificate authorities and I must peas provide a similar combination off functionalities

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.480
.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.970
Ah,

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.510
Peake EI is essentially card provider.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.710
It dispenses many different types off verifiable identities Had an MSP,

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:58.460
on the other hand,

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.970
is like a list of car providers accepted by the store determining which identities are

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.650
trusted for in store payment.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.540
Let's dig a little bit deeper into these details.

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:16.450
So what R P care eyes or public key infrastructures there miss the collection off Internet

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.180
technologies that provide secure communications in a network.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.400
It's peaky eyes that put the S in https.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.580
Although Blockchain network is more than a communications network,

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.650
it relies on this peaky as standard ensure secure communication between various

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.510
participants in the network and ensure that the message posted on the block chains are

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:47.150
properly authenticated is therefore important to understand basics of PK I and why MSP zehr

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.000
important.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.150
Other four key elements toe a public key infrastructure.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.950
We have digital certificates.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.700
We have public and private keys.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.710
We have certificate authorities and we have certificate revocation lists.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.850
Let's go ahead and take a look at each one of these four in little bit more detail.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:13.050
So digital certificate is basically a document which holds a set of attributes relating to

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.620
the holder of the certificate.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.160
The most common type is the X 509 standard.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.860
So,

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:19.750
for example,

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.440
and now a certificate is very similar to a government issued identification card.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.850
It provides information about the person which can be used to prove facts about the most

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.010
important thing about all these attributes that air captured is that they can be recorded

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:41.880
using a mathematical technique called cryptography so that tampering will invalidate the

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:42.700
certificate.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.550
This cryptographic allows a person to present their certificate to others to prove their

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.440
identities so long as the other party trusts the certificate issue are known as a

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.850
certificate authority.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:00.110
As long as the difficult authority keeps certain cryptographic information securely,

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.210
anyone reading the certificate can be sure that the information about this person has not

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:06.470
been tampered with.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.600
How does authentication work to ensure that the person is would claim to be the

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.760
authentication and message integrity are both important concepts.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:23.610
Authentication requires that parties who exchange messages are a short of the identity for

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.400
message to have integrity.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.900
It means that it should not have been modified during its transmission.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.060
Traditional authentication mechanisms rely on digital signatures that,

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.440
as the name suggests a law party to Disney,

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.580
sign the messages.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.160
They also provide guarantees on the integrity of the sign message,

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.200
not technics.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.730
Not technically speaking.

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:50.610
Digital signature magnetism require East Party toe hold to cryptographic Lee connected Keys

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:51.090
Ah,

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.750
public key that is made widely available and acts as authentication anchor and a private

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.640
key that is used to produce digital signatures on messages.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:06.710
Recipients of digitally signed messages can verify the origin and integrity off a received

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:13.060
message by checking the attached signature is valid under the public key off the expected

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:18.740
center of a unique relationship between a private key and the respective publicly is the

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.400
cryptographic magic that makes secure communication possible.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:28.650
The unique mathematical relationship between the keys can be used to produce a signature on

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.680
a message that only the corresponding public he can match,

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.250
and only on the same message.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:41.240
This is how you can ensure that the message has not been tampered with and prove the

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.810
person's identity.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.840
In order for all of this toe work,

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.810
we have to have a trusted and verified certificate authority.

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.500
Now see a Zara Common part of security protocols.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:06:00.310
And I'm sure you guys have heard of some of the more popular ones such a semantic or did

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:01.720
you search or go Daddy?

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.550
And so on?

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:08.620
A certificate can be widely disseminated as they don't include either the actors nor the

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.390
CIA's private keys.

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:14.990
As such to can be used as anchor of trust for authenticating messages.

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.860
The sea is also have a certificate,

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.620
which to make widely available.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.100
This is known as a public certificate.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:27.590
This allows the consumers of identities issued by given see A to verify them by checking.

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:33.230
The certificate could only have been generated by that public key in a Blockchain setting.

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:37.400
Every actor who wishes to interact with the network needs and identity.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.340
And in the setting,

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:45.010
you might say that Warner Morsi is can used to define the member off in organizations From

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:46.550
a digital perspective,

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.820
Dossiers basically have two different versions.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.260
We have roots C A's and we have intermediate CS.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:07:01.440
Because Route see ace organizations that the semantic have to securely distribute hundreds

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:07.330
of millions off certificate to Internet users make sense to spread this process out across

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.910
what are called intermediate certificate authorities.

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:17.110
These have their certificates issued by the route or another intermediate authority along

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.450
establishment off a chain of trust.

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:25.790
This ability to track back to the roots see a not only allows a function of C A to scale

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:27.650
while providing security.

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:33.030
It also allows organizations that consume certificates to use intermediate C A's with

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:36.840
confidence if it intermediate see is compromised.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:37.800
On the other hand,

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:42.750
there will be much smaller exposure as compared to for route See A is compromised.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:48.380
No revocation lists are very important and also very easy to understand.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:53.760
Their basically just a list of references to certificates the see a nose to be revoked for

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.150
one reason or another.

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:55.980
For example,

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:57.300
if we're going to a store.

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:01.360
The revocation list will know the list of stolen credit cards off.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.750
Any one of those is used,

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:08.820
the personal automatically identified when 1/3 party wants to verify and other party's

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:09.490
identity.

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:15.240
It forced checks the C A's revocation list to make sure that the certificate has not been

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.040
revoked.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:21.320
Aware Fire A verifier does not have to check their educational list,

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:25.570
but if they don't they run the risk of accepting compromised identity.

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:30.950
Now certificate being revoked is very different from a certificate that's expiring.

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:34.600
Revote revoked certificates have not expired.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.650
They are,

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:36.820
by the very measure off,

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:42.650
fully valid certificate that their habit they have been revoked for one reason or another.

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:48.520
And that conversation gets pretty in depth and out of the scope of this lesson.

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:53.850
Just know that there's a difference between a revoke certificate and an expired certificate

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:53.850
.

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:59.110
Now you've seen how PK I can provide verifiable identities to a chain of trust.

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:04.440
The next step is to see how these identities can be used to represent the trusted members

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.850
off a Blockchain network,

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:08.990
and that's where a membership service provider,

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:09.910
or MSP,

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:10.990
comes into play.

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:17.350
It identify the parties who are members of a given organization in a Blockchain network
