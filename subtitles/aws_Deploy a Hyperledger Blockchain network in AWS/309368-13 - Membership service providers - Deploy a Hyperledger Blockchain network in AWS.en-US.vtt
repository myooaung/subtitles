00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.460
Hi,

00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:00.970
everybody.

00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:04.810
And welcome to this lesson on looking at membership serious providers.

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.330
So no one attitudes to go through what identities are.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.020
We look at PK eyes,

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:16.020
so now we have to see how the identities could be used to represent the nose or members of

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.000
a Blockchain network.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.280
And this is where a membership service provider or MSP,

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.220
comes into play.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.940
It identifies which route certificate authorities and which intermediate certificate

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.250
authorities are trusted to define members of a trusted domain.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.900
The power often MSP,

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.560
goes beyond just listing who another participant is.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.530
And MSP can actually identify specific rules.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.590
And actor might play either within the scope of an organization that I must be represents

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.610
and sets the basis for defining access privileges in the context of a Blockchain network.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.170
So let's look at a little bit more detail of what MSP czar,

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.350
especially an organization,

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.150
is a managed group of members.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.700
This could be something as big as an international corporation or something as small as ah

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.020
Mahn Pasha.

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:10.430
What's most important about organization is that they manage their members under a single

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.170
MSP.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.280
The exclusive relationship between organization and its MSP makes it sensible to name the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.040
MSP after the organization,

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.850
a convention you'll find adopted most of the time.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.950
For example,

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.770
on organization that might be called Organization,

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.130
one would likely have Emma Speed is called or dash MSP one,

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.740
as you guys can see on there.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.370
In some cases,

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.240
an organisation may require multiple membership groups,

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.760
for example,

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.900
where channels are used to perform very different business functions between them.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.440
In these cases,

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.480
if you have multiple M sp's,

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.170
you would need them.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.480
Name them accordingly,

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.870
depending on which business function they're responsible for on or position is often

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.890
divided up into multiple organization units,

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.250
each of which has a set of responsibilities.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.920
For example,

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.580
in opposition might have a manufacturing division that might have a distribution division

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.610
that might have a logistics division and so on.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:10.350
So,

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.020
in a C A issue certificates the organizational units field in the certificate specifies the

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.890
line of business.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.340
With the identity belongs,

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.460
I will look,

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.080
we're going to see a little bit later on how these units can be helpful to control.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.150
Parts of an organization were considered to be members of a Blockchain network,

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.270
for example,

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.760
only identities from,

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.070
let's Say,

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.790
the manufacturing unit might be able to access channel,

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.450
whereas a distribution unit might not be able to access the channel.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.590
Finally,

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.840
though,

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.840
this is a slight misuse off the organization units.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.020
They can sometimes be used by different organizations in a consortium to distinguish each

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.680
other in such type of cases,

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.160
the different organizations use the same route.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.470
See A and intermediate C is for the sheen of trust.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.730
But assigned the unit field identify members of each organization is not how they're meant

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:01.410
to be used.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.860
But organizations sometimes also used them like that.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.040
So you so you might come across that even in your organization or an organization that

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.880
you're working for.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.650
So there's two different appearances of Hamas peas in a Blockchain network.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.940
Yeah,

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.990
the Configuration channel was referred to US Channel I Miss P's and then look and locally

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:22.760
on a nodes premise,

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.230
which is a local MSP.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.100
The local on this piece of defined for clients and for notes,

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.970
knowed local MSP is to find the permissions for that note.

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:32.770
For example,

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.870
who the Pier Edmunds are the local MSP ease off the off?

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.230
The users allow the users site authenticate itself in its transaction as a member of a

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.850
channel or as owner off a specific role in the system.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.330
Now every note and user must have a local.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.950
I must be defined as it defines who has admin privileges and so on.

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.700
In contrast,

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.290
Channel Emma's Peas defined administrative and participatory rights at the channel level.

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.790
Every organization participating in a channel must have and must be defined for it.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.060
Piers and orders on a channel will all share the same view off a channel,

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.800
MSP,

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.490
and will therefore be ableto correctly authenticate the channel participants.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:22.290
This means that if an organization wishes to join a channel,

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:28.200
an MSP incorporating the chain of trust for the organization's members would need to be

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.390
included in the channel configuration.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:31.830
Otherwise,

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.460
the identities will reject it.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.080
But the key difference between local and channel Emma's piece is not how they function.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.420
Both turn identities into roles,

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.260
but their actual scope.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.400
One is local,

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.210
whereas one is organization wide.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.270
A split between channel and look I'm a speed reflects the need of organizations administer

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.570
their local resource is such as pure or journals,

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.900
and the channel resource is such as ledgers is more contracts.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.210
It's helpful to think of these MSP XYZ being at different levels with Emma's peas are

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.470
higher level relating to network administration concerns.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.470
While the lower level handles identity for administration of private resources.

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:16.130
Emma's Pisa mandatory at every level of administration and they must be defined for the

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.930
network channel Pierre Order and users.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.820
It's very important for a channel to maintain the AMA's peas of its members.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:24.550
Separately,

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.700
a channel provides private communication between a particular set of organizations,

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:35.840
which in turn have admin control child policies interrupted In the context of that channels

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.840
,

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.600
I must be defined who has the ability to participate in certain action on the channel.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.580
So there's no necessary relationship between the permission toe administrate a channel and

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.250
the ability to administrate the network configuration channel.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.810
So you've seen the most important element of us.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:53.260
Often.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:58.600
MSP are the specifications of the route for intermediate CS that are used to establish and

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.900
actors or knows membership in the organization.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:08.060
There are more elements that are used in conjunction with these two to assist with the

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.780
functions,

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.430
other nine elements to an MSP.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:17.050
It's easiest to think of these elements in a directory structure where MSP s name is a root

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:18.460
folder name of the supple,

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.120
the representing the different elements of the configuration.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.270
For example,

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.990
of the root C.

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.460
A's.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.600
This has a list off self signed certificates of Root.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.530
C is trusted by the organization represented by this MSP.

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.950
And as you might have guessed,

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.550
this is the most important folder.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.240
But because it identifies the C.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.700
A's,

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.200
you also have the organizational units listed in there.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.320
You have Administrator,

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.270
which contains the list of identities that define the actors,

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.890
will have the role of admin on the network.

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:47.620
Yes,

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:48.290
importantly,

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:51.540
have revoked certificates of you if you guys remember from the identities,

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:54.390
lessen the revoke certificates are very important toe.

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:59.880
Identify rogue notes on the network or rogue agents on the network you have.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.720
The Nord identity was contains the identity of the North,

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.550
which again is a cryptographic material that,

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.450
in combination peaky,

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:12.060
I allows a note authenticate itself and its messages.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:15.450
You have the key stores which store the private keys.

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:16.630
Alec TLS,

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:17.410
Rosie A.

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:21.580
Contains a list off self signed certificate off route.

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:26.120
See is trusted by the organization for TLS communication on an example,

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.280
the tales communication would be one appear needs to connect toe on order so it can receive

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.440
leisure updates.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.880
And the same goes for the TL TLS Intermediate See ace.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:40.910
So if we got a good grasp of how a membership so hopefully got a good grasp of how

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:45.550
membership service Breuder's work and in conjunction with the identities lesson that

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:50.830
proceeded this you should have a good grasp of how they both worked together on how both of

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:54.960
them are is sen show for a Blockchain network to operate properly.
