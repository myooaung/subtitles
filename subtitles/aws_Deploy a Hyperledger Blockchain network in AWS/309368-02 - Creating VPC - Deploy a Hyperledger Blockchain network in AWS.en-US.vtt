00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.230
Hi,

00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:00.640
everybody.

00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.650
And welcome to this tutorial on a virtual private clouds or be PCs.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.820
So in this exercise we're going to do is will create a non default we PC with a single

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:11.480
summit.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.510
And just as a reminder,

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.500
sub nets enable us to group instances based on our security and operational needs.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.760
So there's two different types of sub minute.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.980
There's a public sub net which is accessible by the Internet or a private sub net,

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.280
which is accessible only within that BPC.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.860
So after doing that will create a security group for our instance that allows traffic only

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.250
through specific ports.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:42.060
We're lost on Amazon s will launch an easy two instance into our sub net and associate an

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:48.010
elastic I p address with that instance which will allow our instance access the Internet.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.740
So first and foremost,

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.870
we're going to go ahead and create our VPC.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:59.910
Let's navigate to Rvp C section and from our VPC dashboard,

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.490
we're going to launch the VPC wizard and here we have several options.

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:07.050
In order to launch BBC's,

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.870
we can launch it with a single sub net begin out of BBC's with public and private sub nets

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:18.680
looking EVP sees with public and private suddenness and hardware VPN access or with private

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.700
Submit Onley and Hardware VP and Access and the hardware.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.590
VPN basically allows us to connect our on prime network onto the VPC hosted by AWS,

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.950
so we'll stick with the single sub net.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.360
Let's give this vpc your name and up here.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.530
It mentions on I p before C i.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.790
D.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.450
R or a sitter block.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.810
Now this is a bit outside The scope of the Cloud Practitioners exam will need to know about

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.930
this in the solutions architect course and exam.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.450
So this is basically gives us a number of I P addresses that were able to use in binary

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.540
format and a troll.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.510
There's 65,531 I P addresses available,

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.510
so if you want to limit the number of I P addresses that are allocated to the subject,

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.790
we can do that through the city Availability zone gives us a choice of where we want to

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.370
create this instance in Based on the region,

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.650
which I'm currently in London,

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.250
we'll just leave it as no preference.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.170
We can also additionally give this sub net a name if we will have multiple subjects is

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.900
always good to differentiate between private and public ones.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.930
So the service endpoint it's in the service endpoint section.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:34.080
We can select a sub net in which to create a VPC endpoint to Amazon s three in the same

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.520
region.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.240
Here,

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.200
we can either allow dynamodb or s three.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:46.650
We can limit the amount of access that these that these services will have to this VPC or

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.780
customized access and the custom.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.400
One will just have to use either this Jason editor or we can use a policy creation tool.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.010
So what is enabled?

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.060
Deanna's host names one set the yes,

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:05.930
it ensures that instances that are launched into our VPC receive a DNS host name and the

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.620
hardware tendency option enables us to select whether instances launched into the VPC are

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.150
run on a shared or dedicated hardware.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.450
Just keep in mind that if you select dedicated tendency,

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.420
it incurs additional costs.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.550
We'll go ahead and click on create BPC.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.570
So if we're going to our BBC's,

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.490
we see there are two VP sees the one that we just created and the default one that's

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:32.210
created when we launched our first easy to instance so now that we have Rvp created,

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.330
let's go ahead and create a security group.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.220
And if you remember,

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.800
Security Group basically acts as a firewall virtual firewall to control the traffic Fourth

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.390
associate ID instances.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.540
So for a security group,

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.780
we need to add inbound rules to control incoming traffic to the instance and out barn rules

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.860
to control the outgoing traffic from the instance.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.840
Now BBC does come with the default security group.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.090
Any instance not associated with another security group during launch is automatically

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.000
associated with the default security group of the VPC.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.990
So let's go ahead and navigate to our security groups section and security.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.800
Well,

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.750
we're gonna create a security group,

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.750
and here we're going to slide the idea of the VPC that we just created and create the

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:18.550
security group.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.000
So here you can see the security group that we just created.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.050
Once we selected on the bottom,

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.070
you can see a description,

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.470
and here's where we can specify the inbound rules and the out bond rules.

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.910
So the inbound rules that's go and click on edit.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.390
We're gonna add a rule.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.170
And here are all of the rules that we can add.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:44.290
So let's go ahead and allow http traffic and the source is basically the zero Dodger

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.750
communes from anywhere.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.700
And let's also add in an https.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:57.150
And if you guys can see it automatically detects the default ports for both http and https

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.300
now that we have rvp see created,

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.410
we have a security group associated with it.

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.180
Let's associate or let's add instances to this VPC.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.910
So if we go back to our dashboard before we collected before we selected Launcher VPC

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:13.340
visited.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.230
So let's go ahead and select launch Easy.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:16.310
Two instances.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.410
Well,

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.700
just select the default instance that we've created in the previous lesson.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.690
So here is where we can select the vpc that we want this to be associated with.

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:33.390
If you guys remember the last one that we created was associated with the default PPC

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:34.590
because we only had one.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.440
Now that we have the other vpc created,

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.940
we can associate this instant with this vpc and here also if we had multiple suddenness

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.990
that would show here But since we only have one only one to showing up.

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:50.530
And here is where we can associate security groups with this instance.

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:55.020
So here we need to create a new scared a group or select an existing security group.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.360
We want to select an existing one because recall we just created this one Previously.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.320
We'll associate this instance with this security group,

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:10.100
and here it's defines what the security group allows allows both East TTP and https traffic

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.610
inbound and outbound.

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.330
Once we have that instance,

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:18.640
Launch would go back to our VPC dashboard and attaching elastic I p to that instance,

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.750
and an elastic I.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:26.280
Peters is basically a static i p before address designed for dynamic cloud computing.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:31.190
So in at so an elastic I P addresses associated with our AWS account,

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:31.930
and with that,

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.860
we can mask the failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping the address to one

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.660
other instance in our account.

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:43.150
And just keep in mind that the elastic I P address is a public I.

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:44.430
P v four address,

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.200
which is reachable from the Internet.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.490
So if we were to associate an elastic,

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:55.230
I appears with instance that we just created it will allow http and https traffic from the

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:58.570
Internet to reach this instance brisket.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:03.140
Now the instances accessible from the Internet with yet elastic I p address being

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:04.190
associated with it.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:09.310
So those are the steps that we we need to do in order to create a custom vpc.

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:12.980
But it's a few things to keep in mind and security.

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:16.090
We have both a network access control list or nah,

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:22.480
KAL and security groups now a network access control list are applicable at the summit

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:22.840
level.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:28.620
So any instance in the sub MIT with unassociated nickel will follow the rules off the

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:29.070
national.

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:31.720
The security groups,

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.470
as we saw,

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:35.550
have to be associated with a specific instance.

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:36.610
By default.

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:39.600
Our default we PC will have a default Mackel,

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.300
which will allow all traffic both inbound and outbound.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.150
So we want to restrict access at the seven it level.

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:50.500
It's always good practice to create a custom network access control list.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.000
Also,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.200
keep in mind that network X control list are stateless.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.730
Unlike security groups,

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:58.200
which are state full.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.380
So in a security group,

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:05.810
let's say if you had an inbound rule for Port 80 it's automatically allowed out meaning out

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:09.690
bond rule for that particular port need not be explicitly added.

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:12.750
But for the network access control list,

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:18.170
you need to specifically provide an explicit inbound and outbound rule.

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:19.000
Lastly,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:19.760
and security groups,

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.680
we cannot deny a traffic from a particular instance.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:23.610
By default,

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:24.850
everything is denied.

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:27.600
We can set rules on Lee to allow,

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:34.610
whereas any network access control s weaken set rules both to allow and to deny in the

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:37.740
peering connections is where we can do vpc peering.

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:41.070
If you want to connect to a WSB PC's together,

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:42.650
we can accomplish that.

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:46.530
True peering the Net gateways allowed to submit.

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:46.950
Let's say,

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:51.680
if you have a private and public sudden it they will access the Internet through a net

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.290
gateway or network address.

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:54.110
Translation.

00:08:54.110 --> 00:09:00.410
Gateway and the Endpoints and Endpoint Services allow applications to connect instances in

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:01.270
the VPC.
