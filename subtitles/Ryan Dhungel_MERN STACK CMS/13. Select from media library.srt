1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:08,370
All right, so let's so all the media files here, just like what we have here in our finished project,

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,390
something like that.

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,570
And we will show the icon for Delta as well.

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:13,770
All right.

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16,380
So here we've got all these images.

6
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:21,690
So let's use map to map through all this media.

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,390
So let me put it into the div.

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,830
So here are media

9
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:35,720
images.

10
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,690
If we have them, then we use method.

11
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,930
So here on your map, through the images, we get the images, right?

12
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:49,980
So you get the images.

13
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,430
So here we want to show the images.

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,120
Now for that, I'm going to use the image component from InDesign.

15
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,010
So make sure you import that.

16
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:01,020
Then.

17
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,910
We can use that to him if we need to give it source.

18
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:13,220
So so it's going to be immense.

19
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,540
So each image will have the URL.

20
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,810
That's how it is saved in the database.

21
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,820
So now that's how we do it.

22
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:22,100
Okay.

23
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:26,250
So as you can see, now we have the images.

24
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:38,570
And you can see with image component from and event there by default they saw this preview and you click

25
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,680
you see the full, full view of the image as well.

26
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:48,080
Again, now that is something you maybe you you don't always want.

27
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,010
All right.

28
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:54,380
So when you accessing this library from this component, then maybe you want to preview.

29
00:01:54,710 --> 00:02:01,220
But here when we are creating a post, when we are creating a post, maybe we just want to click on

30
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,190
the image and that will be selected here.

31
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:04,790
Okay.

32
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:11,570
So instead of serving the P, so to control that, we can use another property here called.

33
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,210
That one is called.

34
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:33,130
Preview and by default it is true.

35
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:36,520
But you can make it false instead of hardcoded false.

36
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:45,130
We can use a sorted variables, let's call it so preview and let's have the default value are false,

37
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:49,750
but in some situations you may want to turn it to true.

38
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,180
At least let's clear the state.

39
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:05,100
CET so media equals to use state.

40
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:07,610
What's.

41
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,050
Okay.

42
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,310
So by default, it's false.

43
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,420
Now, if I come here.

44
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,770
Use date is not defined.

45
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,000
Okay.

46
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,580
So we have to import.

47
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:30,960
Okay.

48
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,690
Now, you can see we don't have the preview auction here.

49
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:34,320
Okay.

50
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:42,900
So by default, we don't enable that preview, but later, we may enable in some other components what

51
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,800
here we don't want.

52
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:48,000
Our next thing we want to do is we resize them because too big.

53
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,830
So preview schools to the size we can.

54
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:57,750
Let's try to start here.

55
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:58,680
Start.

56
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:13,440
So start adding don't keep betting on top betting until five betting right ten so that the images they

57
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:23,370
don't they're not attached to each other so betting right we give ten a game the height height that

58
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:31,740
we use 100 pixels that's not too big with we thought and it said 200 pixel.

59
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,660
Object fit.

60
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:45,580
Problem because when we said the width and height to be equal square some M is my.

61
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,040
So you know their streets.

62
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:52,360
So we use object fit cover that will nicely fit the image.

63
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:54,970
So yeah.

64
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,840
So that's how it looks.

65
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:56,560
Beautiful.

66
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,200
I guess the next thing we ought to do is let's center these images.

67
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:12,260
So let's put some styling here, this deep style.

68
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,250
We just want to center.

69
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,710
So let's use fixed aligned center.

70
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,170
And that centers this right in the middle.

71
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:23,920
Beautiful.

72
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:26,020
Okay.

73
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,860
So we get a bit of a gap here.

74
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,280
Here, too.

75
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,770
Everything looks good now.

76
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:36,140
And next thing we want to do is we want to show this cross icon to delete.

77
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:44,000
And when they click the image, we want to make this image selected and then selected image will be

78
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,190
displayed here as a preview.

79
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,920
A preview images for the feature.

80
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:49,790
Right.

81
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,170
So just.

82
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,340
I take you to this context now?

83
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:58,360
As you can see, they can have the selected images.

84
00:05:58,930 --> 00:05:59,230
All right.

85
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:06,510
And then how we this model is to show in inside so selected when they click on the image, if they click

86
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:12,100
on any of these images, when they click, we want to update this property.

87
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,070
So that clicked images we want to put here.

88
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:16,300
All right.

89
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:23,400
So that way, if there is a senator in Missouri, immediately saw that as a preview for this post,

90
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:27,280
you know, to to be served as a featured image.

91
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,110
Okay.

92
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,310
So let's come back here.

93
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:39,440
So the misleading the use and plea function so unclear.

94
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:44,210
What you want to do is update the media.

95
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,490
Set media.

96
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:54,170
Leave the rest of the properties and selected.

97
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,920
You want to select?

98
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,410
Put this me.

99
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,910
Put this image as selected so that it emits.

100
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:04,850
I wanted to that.

101
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:05,120
So

102
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:11,750
I guess this way when it is clicked, the images will be.

103
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:19,490
In his will be selected and the selected images were showing as a preview immediately as a featured

104
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:19,850
image.

105
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,320
Let me quickly show you how you did that.

106
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,110
Let's go to Edwin.

107
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:29,110
Spaces admin new posts new.

108
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:29,830
So in.

109
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:35,410
We have the selected.

110
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,020
So we get the preview model.

111
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,600
Let me just frame.

112
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,680
I guess we are showing that's not the one.

113
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,880
So if we have the selected media, then we are showing that you.

114
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:06,890
Just above this publish button you can to just follow the person we're showing here.

115
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,580
So let's try.

116
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:15,880
And if we click and you can see immediately we have that this dark, beautiful.

117
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,890
And you said, that looks good.

118
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,510
Let's go back to media library.

119
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:29,680
And by the way, if you want to shoot this kind of for.

120
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:31,990
Like this.

121
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,310
The the Hannigan.

122
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:34,300
They clicked.

123
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,110
Then you can use some CSC on the image.

124
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:46,010
So the stud cursor pointer.

125
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,530
You can do the now see this hand.

126
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,550
So it gives the user the idea that it is something clickable.

127
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:58,550
Okay.

128
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:08,270
Now, the next thing you want to do is you want to shoot the cross open so that they can click to delete

129
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,140
the image as well.
