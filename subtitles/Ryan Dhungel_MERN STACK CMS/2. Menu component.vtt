1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:00.750
All right.

2
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.550
So we have implemented this light and dark theme, which is beautiful.

3
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.550
Now we want to put this in the navigation, right?

4
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.990
So this is a finished product.

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.530
You can see here we have put it in the navigation and then we have a bunch of links.

6
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:15.090
All right.

7
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.060
So we want to have some kind of a navigation like this.

8
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.250
So this is our next focus now.

9
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.010
So we want to work on the navigation map.

10
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:24.210
All right.

11
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.320
So first we have to decide how you want to write a never.

12
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.710
You can write your own thesis, make your own custom navigation bar.

13
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:34.500
That is something.

14
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:43.800
Again, you can easily use some bootstrap courses and just use bootstrap lessons to quickly create a

15
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.570
navigation as well.

16
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:52.830
However, since we're using and designing and design has this absolutely beautiful MIDI component that

17
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:53.520
we can use.

18
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.520
I say I'm here just for many.

19
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.030
And this is the one you can see here.

20
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.220
This is one example.

21
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:09.560
It has the dropdowns on a small screen.

22
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.520
This is how it looks.

23
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.760
There's more and more navigation links here and you can get the code here as well if you want to implement

24
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.200
the sidebar navigation, which we will use later when we are building the dashboard.

25
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.070
We have that example here as well.

26
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.910
You have the dark theme as well.

27
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.500
Now for our purpose, we want to use this.

28
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.200
The main one, the one on the top you find here.

29
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.160
This one.

30
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.610
Right.

31
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:47.040
So now obviously you can copy all this code or you can just write yourself one by one.

32
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.610
However.

33
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.240
It's as you can see here, it's quite straightforward.

34
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.190
So it's better to understand and then just copy the score.

35
00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:58.770
All right.

36
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:06.650
So just to that, we avoid doing a lot of typos because when you type a lot of the same things over

37
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.390
and over again, it just takes time.

38
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.600
And then you might end up with some typos and things doesn't work.

39
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.980
So since it is provided to you in the document decent, definitely.

40
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.800
I recommend you to copy this one.

41
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.190
Even though I hate copy paste, especially when I'm making online videos.

42
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.590
However, in a situation like this, it just makes perfect sense to just copy the code.

43
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.820
All right.

44
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.000
Now, before we copy the code, let's try to understand what's happening here.

45
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:42.200
So we have import the mini component, and then some items from this are the package we install and

46
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.140
design icons.

47
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.460
All right.

48
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:52.640
So we have some icons and the mini component has an import and then this menu component has this submenu

49
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.060
as well.

50
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.920
So that is something you can destruct.

51
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.390
So from the menu.

52
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.080
All right.

53
00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.920
And then we have this state.

54
00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:06.920
So in the state, you can keep track of the current link that we can show, which is the current link,

55
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.690
and make it actively apply some staying for that purpose.

56
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.320
You can have a state as well.

57
00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.640
All right.

58
00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.990
And then on click, it's time any of these menus have been clicked.

59
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.500
You can see.

60
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.280
Inside the menu, you have all these menu items.

61
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.770
So think of this as a link, you know, in a regular steamer that you have the.

62
00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.050
The anger text for the clicks.

63
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.640
We think of them like that.

64
00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:43.700
So many item, menu item instead so many how to you have the menu item but this time if it is used in

65
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.430
the dropdown, so you have the menu item group, I guess that's another component.

66
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.950
And then instead here you have too many items.

67
00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.200
So you can see here is link is represented as the menu item and.

68
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.300
They are, all of them put inside many components.

69
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:03.520
Menu item.

70
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.240
Menu item.

71
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:10.690
However, if you want to have the dropdown, then you use submenu, insert some many.

72
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:16.120
You use menu item group and then you group each of these menu items.

73
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.430
All right, so that's all happening here.

74
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.460
So let's copy this code.

75
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.720
Copy.

76
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.000
Come here.

77
00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:32.020
And for this one, we can create another component and it's called Top NAV 30th.

78
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.690
And just based that here.

79
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.100
Now there's some.

80
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.520
Things you have to fix, and that is this one.

81
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.690
So we're not rendering into this app.

82
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.630
Instead, we just expose default.

83
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.510
So they called it EP.

84
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.730
We want to call dog in that.

85
00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.480
It's top nav.

86
00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.490
Now let's change this as well.

87
00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.690
The component near.

88
00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.520
You'd notice that this is using plus component now.

89
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.880
Plus plus component you can still use.

90
00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:12.650
That's fine.

91
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.190
However, it is not the recommended way.

92
00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:23.930
If you, especially with the new newer version of React, it is recommended to use functional components

93
00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:30.390
and use these multiple hooks to add certain features to component.

94
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.100
All right, so class component is not really recommended.

95
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.000
So as much as possible, you should try to use functional component.

96
00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.490
It's really easy to convert.

97
00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.780
Okay.

98
00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.590
So you can see in class components you use a state like this.

99
00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.760
However, in our case, we can use the use state hook.

100
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.830
That's one difference.

101
00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:59.510
Another difference is you can see here, we don't need to have this render function to return anything

102
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.750
in function components to just to use return.

103
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.350
Right.

104
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.300
So let's start cleaning up.

105
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:13.830
The first thing you want to do is remove the class name and replace with const constant nav equals to

106
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.560
add a function and then all this code.

107
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.880
Let's cut that.

108
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.920
All right, so that's our sound component.

109
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.960
We don't have the.

110
00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.450
We don't need the state financial instrument that.

111
00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:41.730
And this function, let's put it in a variable const handle click equals to and then you can see this

112
00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:42.240
render.

113
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.940
And then restructuring of the Valley from the start.

114
00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.470
You want to remove that.

115
00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:54.580
So to move that and then come all the way down here, we have to remove the closing curly process.

116
00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:57.030
Both of these.

117
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:08.130
Sorry, not worth a just one of that because this one that because other one is the part of this one

118
00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:08.820
function.

119
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:10.370
Okay.

120
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:14.030
So hopefully you did have an issue here.

121
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:15.980
You can see we have the function.

122
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.110
We have this handle, click function.

123
00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.190
And we have a return.

124
00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:25.170
Our menu here.

125
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.760
Okay.

126
00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:33.580
Now, since we're not using class component, we're not going to use this cure.

127
00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:37.090
We don't need this cue to refer to this function.

128
00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.180
It is here and it is easily accessible here.

129
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:43.560
All right.

130
00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:47.080
So Henry Lee, we have.

131
00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:52.300
This again, we have to remove from the.

132
00:07:54.340 --> 00:08:02.450
And for the state, actually we should import our youths stay at home.

133
00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:07.750
So it's import youths, they react.

134
00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:12.160
We import that hope so that we can use state in our functional component.

135
00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:14.060
Isolated period.

136
00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.930
Then it's const government

137
00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:27.330
set current equals to use state and you can use a different one.

138
00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:28.450
Let's use mill.

139
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:29.950
It's not requirement.

140
00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:31.560
You can have it.

141
00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:36.090
All right, so this way we can easily use state in our function and component.

142
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:37.580
And.

143
00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:41.230
You can see in class component.

144
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:48.040
This is how state was updated but here now we can you just use set current and give the event key.

145
00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:56.530
Now this event comes from the menu here whenever it is clicked I guess a little remote that.

146
00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:01.230
Let me it this right said state.

147
00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.780
We want to update the state with the currently clicked item.

148
00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:05.090
Right.

149
00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:07.060
So that that's going to be even Turkey.

150
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:10.650
And then you can dream of that.

151
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:12.540
Perfect.

152
00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:16.600
All right, so one click.

153
00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:18.010
That's what we do.

154
00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.190
We can have a look at the clicked item in the console as well.

155
00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:23.380
So let's look at that.

156
00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:28.750
Now, before we do that, we actually have to import this component somewhere.

157
00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:30.160
At the moment we can see.

158
00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:30.670
All right.

159
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.770
And this top navigation is something you would need on all the pieces.

160
00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:36.100
All right.

161
00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.720
So we need everywhere.

162
00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.740
So that means can you guess?

163
00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:43.630
We need to import this one.

164
00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:53.050
We need to improve this component in advocates is just like whenever we had to apply global services,

165
00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:59.710
we infer that here when we want to provide the value, we import the provider here in a similar way.

166
00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:07.640
Anything that requests to be available for the entire application we import and using the actors is.

167
00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:09.160
So in our case the never used.

168
00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:15.190
And definitely we want to import and use here so that it is available for the whole activities.

169
00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:15.610
Right.

170
00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:16.480
So import

171
00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.410
of -- from.

172
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:26.040
And we go one step up.

173
00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:28.100
Go inside components.

174
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:29.400
Go in there.

175
00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:31.190
All right.

176
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:32.510
So you can put that here.

177
00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:36.930
Simple as that.

178
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:43.590
So that's how all the code that you have in the dog name is technically available here since you have

179
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:45.030
imported and put here.

180
00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:47.810
All right.

181
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:48.930
How good is that?

182
00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:49.500
Never is.

183
00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:50.820
Absolutely beautiful.

184
00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:51.630
90 year.

185
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:54.830
We have Navy isn't.

186
00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:55.490
Navy isn't.

187
00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:56.720
This is a difficult one.

188
00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:01.250
This is the dropdown menu items.

189
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.630
Beautiful.

190
00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:05.810
City.

191
00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:06.560
State.

192
00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:07.000
Okay.

193
00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.320
Obviously that we still have that.

194
00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.310
We have to change that.

195
00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:11.960
It's good to talk now.

196
00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:17.960
And since this from Sid started to set current.

197
00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:23.000
Beautiful.

198
00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:24.860
And let's have a look at the consulate.

199
00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:25.640
Should we get.

200
00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:31.100
It's okay here if I click on this one.

201
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:36.950
Now you can see the key mail if I click on this one.

202
00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.370
So that takes us to a separate component.

203
00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:46.490
When I click on this one, you see it's a setting one, either one setting three.

204
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:47.800
And these are the keys.

205
00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:50.240
These are the names that have been used, you said.

206
00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:51.820
All right.

207
00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:57.890
So this is how you can easily use and isn't many component.
