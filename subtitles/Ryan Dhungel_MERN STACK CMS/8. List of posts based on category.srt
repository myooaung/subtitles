1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,800
All right, so we got a short list of posts that belongs to this category.

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,050
So let's continue working on that one.

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,700
So we show the heading, the category name.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:18,300
After that, we can map through the posts directly into the column.

5
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,410
Poster map to map to the post.

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,010
So is Bush.

7
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:35,510
We want to display card.

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:44,790
Card component from and and then since we're using each item we keep the unique key that would be pushed

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,200
front and scope and here in the card.

10
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:57,650
We can use a deep dive to dive.

11
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:01,930
Let's use Flex so that we can show the limits.

12
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,170
Let me see the finished product.

13
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:12,500
So we want to show the images on the left and then the title and meta information like this one, horizontal

14
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,540
using flex.

15
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,250
This is Flexbox.

16
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:17,150
All right.

17
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,150
So here div style.

18
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,540
Display fakes.

19
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,960
And then in this debriefing had two elements one would be immense.

20
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,110
Another one would be the post voice.

21
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:35,520
I guess so.

22
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,090
For images I can use avatar component.

23
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,980
Same circle.

24
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,270
You can use squid.

25
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:45,960
I have used.

26
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,920
I like to use circle in this one so you can give the size.

27
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:57,690
I'm going to use 60 style margin right with Martin so that it doesn't.

28
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:02,220
Get to close with the post title to content.

29
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,840
So margin write

30
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:12,950
margin dried would be 15.

31
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:17,120
We can use 15 in the source of the index.

32
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:18,770
That would be.

33
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,940
Post featured in this post.

34
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,060
Don't.

35
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:27,690
Featured image.

36
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,650
If we have that, then we want to access the Yahoo!

37
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,050
Otherwise we use some default images.

38
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:43,380
So, for example, the default image we can access from our local directory public images default.

39
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:48,910
Thank you, sir.

40
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:57,850
Otherwise, by default, we use slurs in this class, and people don't do things.

41
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,650
Tipping in that script.

42
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,450
So we have posts, man.

43
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,310
Something's not right.

44
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,450
I just caught that bit, man.

45
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,810
Play through the post.

46
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,690
I think we need one more parenthesis here.

47
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:37,590
Yes.

48
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,080
So let me push them back again.

49
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:41,280
Beautiful.

50
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,120
So we are showing the avatar.

51
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,700
If not so, the different images come back here.

52
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,410
You can see we have the images.

53
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,870
These don't have the feature dismissal.

54
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,460
We saw the default image.

55
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,930
Otherwise, they're beautiful.

56
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,910
Now let's display the content here.

57
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,490
The title and the meta information.

58
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:12,370
So this avatar let's use all ties to it would be helpful for search engines post statements we use that.

59
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:21,220
And after that in Ms. is still inside this live flex with the flex here we use another div.

60
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,330
And here we should title page two.

61
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,500
We can use has to.

62
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:39,690
And here we saw postcard tourism.

63
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,150
And then I guess we got the title.

64
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:52,450
Now let's display the the meta information that created did something like this saying to you something

65
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:52,690
like.

66
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:59,470
Now you might notice that it looks foreign, looks a little different if you want to make it like that

67
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:03,340
that is using the typography from and.

68
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,510
I guess if you can use that, you can use import typography.

69
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,550
And then you can.

70
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:27,610
Use, for example, title capture detail from the structure, from typography.

71
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:34,510
And you can use that type of typography gives you other things as well.

72
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,370
For heads to history, there are other things you can destructor, you can tell the documentation.

73
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,580
So let's try to use that.

74
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,780
Title of that.

75
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,100
That looks big.

76
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:56,840
Okay.

77
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:05,180
So to make it like his two and has three actually we can use the level the level three that to look

78
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,110
like his three.

79
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:07,490
Beautiful.

80
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:08,750
Okay.

81
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:09,800
And not just that.

82
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,200
I think we want to make it clearly realized, but we have to make it clear.

83
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,180
So that means.

84
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:24,910
Let me put it into a link and get tag based here to link heads through.

85
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:30,620
SLAs, post SLAs or slow.

86
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:36,850
Okay.

87
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:37,420
Let's have a look.

88
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:43,900
Beautiful.

89
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:45,610
That works.

90
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:54,850
So we can click on the categories, visit all the posts, click on them to view absolutely beautiful

91
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,840
isolates and display the better information as well here.

92
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:05,220
So that one we can put under the link.

93
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,400
And let me use paragraph dag.

94
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:10,480
And then here.

95
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:14,890
First, I'm going to serve the dead daisies.

96
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:15,520
Don't.

97
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:16,780
So daisies.

98
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:25,840
And then we use the give the dead posts dirt created and dead to give that and we won't ferment that

99
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,380
comment that in this.

100
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,970
Let's try a different this time.

101
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:41,780
Let's format by the month day and the year and then the our minute and PM on that extended date for

102
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:50,260
once a month, day, comma, year and then our minutes and then am PM.

103
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,360
So we want to use this format that gives us this beautiful time.

104
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,020
Next one lit.

105
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,690
So it's less lit.

106
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:13,030
So the post created by the name you just name whoever created it gets a post dot posted by dot name.

107
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:17,670
Let's make sure we have this to.

108
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,030
Post.

109
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,620
So post posted by.

110
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,330
Looks like we don't have that.

111
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,180
Probably because we haven't populated toilets.

112
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:50,790
Google.

113
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,580
This one is the single.

114
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,400
And this one is the post.

115
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:07,320
My career is less critical to our server controls category populate feature images and let's also.

116
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:10,750
Use

117
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,440
posted by.

118
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,470
All right, so let's give it a base.

119
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:19,980
Reload.

120
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:22,680
Beautiful.

121
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,230
All right, so we have the time.

122
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,340
We have the author name.

123
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,590
That's right.

124
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,220
Let's go back here and let's see here.

125
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,850
And it's right by the user name.

126
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:37,140
Beautiful.

127
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:38,460
All right.

128
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,950
Now, finally, let's also show the

129
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:49,260
categories and latest post from the hooks.

130
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,280
Now, that is something we have already done in our single post views.

131
00:09:54,300 --> 00:10:00,930
Let's quickly go to this post slug and we can actually copy that code.

132
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,990
And so the divider.

133
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,600
Including the column.

134
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:18,320
I think it's it's better to just copy the column as you can make here.

135
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:23,990
So we have this column on the small screen.

136
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:27,460
We take full width, but on the large screen we take only the 18.

137
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:33,740
That means after this column, we can put this so 818 that remaining six.

138
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:35,720
Okay.

139
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:41,630
And for a small screen, this again, it can take full width 24.

140
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,930
Okay, so we have one offset.

141
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,470
So let's leave it trying to.

142
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,970
Now let's make sure we have the hooks imported too.

143
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:52,850
Let's go here.

144
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:53,930
Let's go and talk.

145
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:55,160
Just like we did earlier.

146
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,450
Let's import.

147
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,090
Oh, actually, we already did.

148
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:06,380
That means we just have to execute them just like this.

149
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,010
All right, let's give it a try.

150
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,050
Okay.

151
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,970
Some some reason it is down here.

152
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,190
Let's fix that.

153
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,100
I think we don't need the opposite one.

154
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,420
That's not really important.

155
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,380
Then we can just leave it to 24.

156
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:37,670
Beautiful.

157
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:41,960
Now we can see we are showing the categories and latest post here.

158
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:43,490
Awesome.
