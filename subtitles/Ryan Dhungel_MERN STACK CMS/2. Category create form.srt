1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,830
All right, let's continue working on this piece.

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:07,040
So we need to have a form like that.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:07,500
All right.

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:08,700
So.

5
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,110
Let's change this to.

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:25,500
And a of you just don't take add new category and new category.

7
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:27,000
All right.

8
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,530
So we want to have fun now.

9
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:33,420
Form is something we have already used in our in inside of components.

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,100
If you want, you can have a quick look at it.

11
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:35,580
All right.

12
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:43,590
So anytime in future, you are building a project and you want to you know, you can always come back

13
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:44,550
to the finished project.

14
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:49,620
For example, this project you can have a look, you know, you can take out the code or you can always

15
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,550
reuse the code.

16
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:58,050
That's the beauty of when you build many projects, you can combine, you know, you can look at the

17
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,470
code in its copy the components copy the.

18
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,200
Functionalities and then you can quickly build up to for example, we have already the form here so

19
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:14,360
if you want and you know obviously have a look at it and maybe even copy some of these input fields

20
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,340
to make things easier.

21
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:16,360
All right.

22
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:16,750
So.

23
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,590
You can see from.

24
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,180
And the foam item.

25
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,160
So we use that one for the evil two.

26
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:28,890
Let's copy that.

27
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:40,060
Just to make things easier, go back to categories and firstly it's import import from strong and and

28
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,030
then we want to so that so from

29
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:53,780
an inside from that base, that form item name let's give it a name name.

30
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,000
So that's going to be the category name.

31
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,160
It's sort of like the roots, this one input prefix.

32
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,500
Input free fee.

33
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:09,480
So for this one we can use the icon called edit outlines.

34
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:15,960
So import from at and right.

35
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:17,660
So.

36
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:19,450
It did.

37
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,980
Outline so we can use this component.

38
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,890
So this item.

39
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:35,660
So we prefix with that icon and then we see this input field, full name, category name so we can call

40
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,130
it plus placeholder.

41
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,430
Give it a name that's relevant.

42
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,460
Input is not defined.

43
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:52,570
So let's make sure we import input as well from and.

44
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,240
Beautiful.

45
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,750
We've got that little foam.

46
00:02:59,350 --> 00:02:59,800
Awesome.

47
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,320
Now, we don't want to make it full width.

48
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,460
Just like you can see here.

49
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:11,650
We used to have space for the foam and the rest for showing all the creative categories as to let's.

50
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,400
Use the rule.

51
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:23,120
So with and designer we can use columns and roots a row and column.

52
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:28,340
So we use the 24 column grid in a row.

53
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:33,560
So what we can do here is within the admin layout.

54
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,240
Let me quickly have a look at the finished project.

55
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:42,920
So all this sits in the first half and then the rest on the second half.

56
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,670
So that means everything that we have so far.

57
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:51,910
Let's cut and let's use through the squid route in.

58
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:56,120
So we want to split the colons into half hour.

59
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:56,560
So.

60
00:03:59,560 --> 00:03:59,930
Call.

61
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:12,140
This column seemed to have the content so spend we give 12 so in end then we use the 24 column grid.

62
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:17,630
So we used 12 for the first column and then another 12 for this second half.

63
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:24,590
And so once you have this really spaced that the code that we got before heading in the form.

64
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:30,200
And then after this call and just leave a comment as well.

65
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:32,850
You can.

66
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,630
I meant using command and slash.

67
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:42,060
If you press, you get this one and here you can write comment in this deus ex.

68
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:46,860
Let's call it first column.

69
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:53,490
So this first call, this column, another 1/2 column.

70
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:58,320
Second column.

71
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,340
Also, we use column in here for the moment.

72
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,440
Let me just write something.

73
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,040
So categories list.

74
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,930
Let me just read that for the moment.

75
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:13,290
Okay.

76
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,310
So we're going to the categories list later.

77
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:15,580
Here.

78
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,870
Here we can now continue.

79
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,450
So we have the input file.

80
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,670
We can have a button as well.

81
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,320
So let's import the bottom.

82
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:34,080
Front end and then within the sprung after the item in button.

83
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:45,010
And Barton also, if you want to, you can make the windows split open.

84
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:52,420
The sun component here where we have already used all these buttons and forms and we can quickly have

85
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,460
a look at it and see how it's done.

86
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:54,790
Right.

87
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,470
So you can see that's how it was done.

88
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:57,610
So.

89
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,420
But.

90
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:04,250
We give the name here, let's call it submit.

91
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,520
And here button type.

92
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,970
There are a couple of types you can use.

93
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,930
One is primary.

94
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,220
Few other ones.

95
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:19,690
If you are.

96
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:21,990
Take out of the documentation.

97
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,440
Let's go and take it home.

98
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:25,600
But.

99
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,170
Thanks to this good component.

100
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,520
And Bodden is right here.

101
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,360
So that's important.

102
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,750
Let's come all the way down.

103
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,900
And then here you can see the type.

104
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:46,680
We can use all these types, we can use primary host dest linked text all this.

105
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:53,400
So we might try a few of this later, but basically primary is the one we will be using mostly.

106
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:58,020
So let's use that primary just like we did here.

107
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,100
Glass, then we're not actually using the glass.

108
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,510
And so we didn't invent.

109
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,710
And that looks like it's pretty measured.

110
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,410
That's a really.

111
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,750
His statement.

112
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,250
I guess we need this one.

113
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,730
His statement, I submit.

114
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:17,940
Yeah, right.

115
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,240
Beautiful.

116
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:22,870
No.

117
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,010
Just like the the form we had before in the sign.

118
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:27,880
And you can see here.

119
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:29,750
Unfinished.

120
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,130
You can execute a function.

121
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,240
All right, so let's do that.

122
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:40,580
From from this unfinished order.

123
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,250
We call it let's call it handle.

124
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,830
Let's call it unfinished.

125
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,840
Let's keep it simple.

126
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,360
But obviously you can call it anything.

127
00:07:53,960 --> 00:08:00,410
So on finis almost unfinished equal to async.

128
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:05,600
We'll make a request to back end for the moment.

129
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:09,880
That means if we just use console.log the values right.

130
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:10,500
Console

131
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:14,900
values.

132
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:24,970
Valleys or the valleys would be will receiving as an argument to these funds.

133
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,390
So that's how the fund component in end is.

134
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:35,340
And also so you can use the on fitness and that will give us all the values from the input.

135
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,510
For example, we have at the moment, just this one.

136
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,000
Its name.

137
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,290
Name is email.

138
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,170
So here we have called.

139
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,060
Give it a name.

140
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,710
Just name.

141
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:52,400
All right.

142
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,020
So don't get confused with that.

143
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:58,040
No, you can give it another name, but let's just leave it like this.

144
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,120
Okay.

145
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:06,580
So we'll be receiving the venue name so we can take that out here on our front.

146
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,670
So let's see if we see this console.log.

147
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,710
So let's open.

148
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,340
Console.

149
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:21,660
And let's say Rihanna hit Summit.

150
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:28,590
And you can see we obviously get the name which has the value yet.

151
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,310
Beautiful.

152
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,260
Now, that's a great start.

153
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:40,650
Now all we need to do is send this name to our backing so that we can save the a category in the database.

154
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:40,920
All right.

155
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:48,060
So once you save, we will be getting the response and those responses we can put here to show the list

156
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:48,850
of categories.

157
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,130
So we'll come back to it later.

158
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,690
But at the moment, as you can see, let me close this one.

159
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:56,520
It's looking good.

160
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:03,630
We have the face and with the form, we are able to create a categories.

161
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:10,290
Now, obviously, we have to go to the back end and create a root and controller functions.

162
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:13,150
We need to create the category schema.

163
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:20,460
We're going to do all of that pretty much from scratch in the back end because even though we were generating

164
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:26,760
the authentication server that only has the authentication foetus, anything else we want to add?

165
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,880
Obviously we have to write ourself.

166
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:38,760
Now this way you will fully understand how the the backend development works, how you build the API

167
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:44,520
is, how you handle the roots and how you send out the restaurants using the control functions.

168
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:50,370
We already saw how they work, but now we're going to actually write our SO I guess it's going to be

169
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:50,790
awesome.

170
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:59,280
So let's go ahead and work on the back end for the categories to create routes, controller functions

171
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:03,960
and even schema for categories so that we can start saving in the database.
