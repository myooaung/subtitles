1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,110
All right.

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:07,830
So next feature we're going to work on is the list of uses for add ons.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,240
So this is the finished product.

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:16,020
All right, so I'm here logged in as admin and when I go to users, all users here, I can see all the

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,490
users that I currently

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,370
have registered into this application.

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,590
So you can see here, here I am.

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,530
Here this is the.

9
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:31,100
Ed Neely.

10
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,100
So obviously I don't want to give my sources that is grayed out.

11
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:39,440
I can edit my profile or for any other user I can edit or delete their profile.

12
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:40,430
All right.

13
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:43,300
So we want to have a similar functionality into this app.

14
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:47,420
So let me just sign in as an.

15
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:53,000
So here at the moment, we don't even have the base.

16
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:54,890
So let's create a base.

17
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:00,500
Basically, what we want to do in that base is list out all the users.

18
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:01,310
All right.

19
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,330
So we show how many posts they have as well.

20
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:13,910
So we'll have to go back to our controller and make a small change so that we will be able to post the

21
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:14,300
post.

22
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,700
It is time the post is created.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,390
So we're going to find the user and post that post, Heidi, to the user's post.

24
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:29,000
Something to add that feature so that we can show the number of post that belongs to the user.

25
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:31,800
Okay.

26
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,150
And then we'll have the.

27
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,740
So it fits as well.

28
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,060
Okay, so let's go first.

29
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,710
Let's quit that base.

30
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,890
So here, let's go into bases.

31
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:53,170
It is admin uses index.

32
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,320
So here we need some imports.

33
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:08,030
So let's import use this state used effect.

34
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:14,700
Use context to react.

35
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,910
Next one, we want to import the admin layer.

36
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:30,160
So import admin now from.

37
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,350
So we go.

38
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,700
One step up, two step.

39
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:42,050
Wants to do two, three step components and lay out next one.

40
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:48,740
We want to import some of these components from and really call them.

41
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:52,630
List.

42
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,540
And then Avatar.

43
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:00,600
So pretty soon we will be showing the avatar.

44
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:06,960
We will basically using just the you this name, the first character of the display.

45
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,450
You could display images as well.

46
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:18,750
So we use Avatar for the next film and next one excuse.

47
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,820
And we import toast as well just to sort of toast notification.

48
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,580
In bold.

49
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:45,960
He used it out a hook or two in need use rather from next strata so that we can read with the user.

50
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:57,720
We need the context of context as room and we also need link from next.

51
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:02,610
I guess in it's important that first impulse link from.

52
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:10,810
LIM And let's put the context in full

53
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,550
context from.

54
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,670
Context off.

55
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,750
I said, that's all the inputs we need.

56
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:30,510
Now let's create our component so we can pull that all uses, const all uses.

57
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,650
It's word function.

58
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,410
Exclude default function.

59
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,950
All uses this way.

60
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:51,510
I didn't have to write x for default underneath, so it's just a personal preference.

61
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:57,250
So here what we want to do is we want to first access the context, right?

62
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,570
So context, sorry, context.

63
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:09,720
Second set of set off from use.

64
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,500
Context of context.

65
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:18,040
Once we have the context, we can access.

66
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,180
We will need to access hoops later to redirect the user.

67
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:26,020
So we use that used article and then.

68
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:32,820
We are going to have a state, the local state, that wants a local state.

69
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,610
Where are we going to put all the youth?

70
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:42,150
So we're going to use you de facto to make a request to back in, get all the users and put them in

71
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,810
the state.

72
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:50,040
And then we're going to render the list of uses from the state and so uses state.

73
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,600
So once you have that, why didn't we use use effect?

74
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:58,680
Make a request to back into that we can get all the users.

75
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:08,970
Now, before I do that, let me just return something and let's return a layout and layout.

76
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:22,620
Had been loud in Ted Leo tweaking to use the rule instead rule to use an entire column.

77
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:33,540
Let's give it a heading has for all users gave me right before styling here style.

78
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,960
Mars in Barton.

79
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:53,270
Means to fix it just so that we don't have a lot of gap under the from the title and the list of uses

80
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,480
and we will see if we need to add this.

81
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:03,410
We can add Slater in here basically moving to a list of here this list of uses at the moment we don't

82
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:04,370
have any uses.

83
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,010
We can try the length.

84
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,860
Okay, so this is our component.

85
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:14,930
So obviously we're going to use use effect to get on the uses, but let's have a look how it looks so

86
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:15,260
far.

87
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,470
So this admin user.

88
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,380
Users write to that.

89
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,050
That is user syndicate.

90
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,250
So it should work.

91
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:28,750
All right.

92
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,410
So we got the input error model not found.

93
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,220
And we lay out that to be kept today.

94
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:45,610
Okay.

95
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,120
So looks like we have the path that is not quite so far from here.

96
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,920
Once they do step three step.

97
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:59,020
You go up and the components lay out.

98
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,060
And then left.

99
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,540
All right, perfect.

100
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:10,770
So we got a bit based on users at the moment.

101
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,140
We don't have any users to its do.
