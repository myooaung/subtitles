1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,910
All right, so let's go and create a media model so that we can save the images in the database.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,220
Some models let's create new file media entities.

3
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,760
It's all lowercase media.

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:24,180
This to make things easier, let's copy one of the schema, this post schema pasted down here.

5
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,940
So we have all these inputs now this one we call it media.

6
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:38,850
Media skim copy come down here, media schema and this name will be media.

7
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,980
Okay, so leave the timestamp and everything else.

8
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,360
Let's just get rid of that.

9
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:46,800
We're going to write.

10
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:49,210
Um.

11
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,530
I just don't see what happened here.

12
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:52,850
Yeah, it's.

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,520
It's a slow slog and all that.

14
00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:00,020
It's okay to scheme a little, right?

15
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:05,540
So what are you going to save when we save the is so going to save the earth.

16
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:12,230
That's the most important one this year will be receiving from cloud in every uploaded air and that

17
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,460
when we save in the database.

18
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,010
So the URL will be the type of string

19
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:26,300
public it will be the type of string so close never gives us the URL in public and so that public ideal.

20
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:32,240
So we going to save here because later when we want to remove this image from media library, we can

21
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,100
remove it.

22
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,820
So when we remove, we remove from the database and also from the cloud in area.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,270
All right.

24
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,940
So this photo guide will be used for that.

25
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:50,060
And we also want to save the posted by posted by whoever uploaded the same is the reason for that is

26
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:51,590
later.

27
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:55,130
The authors will also have access to the media library.

28
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,140
However, they cannot.

29
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:04,720
Delete other people's the image that is uploaded by other users.

30
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:04,990
Right.

31
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:10,840
So that this will be useful at that time because if they were trying to delete someone else's image,

32
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:18,430
we will know based on the posted variety I suppose by the type object I didn't refer to the user more.

33
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,520
Okay, so that's pretty much it.

34
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,710
And the time since.

35
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:27,820
So that's something you need to see that you are obligated and the posted by user.

36
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,060
Okay.

37
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:35,590
So that's how media schema, once you have the media schema, we can go to a control function and start

38
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:39,100
saving the the images in the database.

39
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:44,800
So it's good to post control, it's cool on top and it's important model.

40
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,120
Media from models media.

41
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,270
Okay, let's come on down.

42
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:06,310
And here now we can upload to Cloud Canary.

43
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:10,160
We get the URL and probably already we can save that in the database.

44
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,380
And then we finally send the response.

45
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,690
The uploaded image responds to the front end here.

46
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:32,720
All right, so constant vigilance equals to avoid coding every dot uploader, dot upload and to upload

47
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,220
we need to give the images path.

48
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:40,930
So that's going to be requests to find the file to path.

49
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:52,560
I can says you can see the files give us previous to you so we got that request files give us this one.

50
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:55,930
So we also have to go and access the path.

51
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:00,880
So that means requested files don't file that path.

52
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:06,310
So this is what this is what we need to give to do.

53
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,570
Okay.

54
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:14,400
So that will give us the result which will contain the URL and public IP.

55
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,350
Now let's save in the database first.

56
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:25,020
Konst Media equals to new media.

57
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,130
No need to create a new media based on the URL.

58
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,080
That's going to be the result.

59
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,930
Dot security.

60
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,700
Earth, public I.D..

61
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,440
That's going to be results.

62
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,640
Dark, complicated, and then pushed to.

63
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:47,940
Right.

64
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,840
That's going to be the request door to user today.

65
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,310
Right now for this to work.

66
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:58,680
You need to make sure you have applied the request hand in middleware in your out.

67
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,890
Any question.

68
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:05,910
All right.

69
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:12,510
So that's all the data we need to create a new media saving the data we see in this to use save.

70
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,070
All right.

71
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:20,700
So once it is saved, you can send the response, no response to this and you can send media.

72
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:28,830
So this is the object you got here that is already saved in the database so that this will contain.

73
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,870
You are probably already posted, right.

74
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:37,410
As well as the the unique idea that you get when you save anything in the MongoDB.

75
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,120
Okay, beautiful.

76
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,260
Let's have a look at it.

77
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:43,350
Let's see how this response is received in the client.

78
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:50,790
So basically this when the image has been uploaded, we want to put that image.

79
00:05:52,640 --> 00:06:00,830
In the context, in the context and from the context we can access to the posts that we are creating.

80
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:07,430
So if we want to send the photo featured image, we just upload and that will be automatically selected

81
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:10,130
so we can just create a post with that.

82
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:16,580
And then later, when you have the media library from here, if you want to choose any of the media,

83
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,480
you can just click in.

84
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:24,710
That will be selected and that will be again sent to the back end when we're creating a new post.

85
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,760
So we'll come back to that.

86
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,550
But so far we have almost we are pretty much done here.

87
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,450
So let's have a look.

88
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,760
Let's see how we received the response.

89
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,910
Once we receive the response, we're going to save in the context of that message.

90
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,200
We need to create the media context very soon.

91
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:45,470
So let me try and it's just separate.

92
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:48,530
This one, it's uploading.

93
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:51,680
Okay.

94
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,830
So you can see we've got a success message very successfully uploaded.

95
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,110
We got the response.

96
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,440
Let me just go to.

97
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,910
Upload file.

98
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,560
The response, Mrs..

99
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,170
We didn't to the response.

100
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,340
Network.

101
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,530
So the upload image.

102
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,510
Thank you, sir.

103
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:34,140
We.

104
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,020
I didn't see the response.

105
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:43,210
Okay.

106
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:48,450
So not just the success in Ms., but we actually have to use this response.

107
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:53,470
So when we get the successful response, we get the URL of the emails, right?

108
00:07:53,800 --> 00:08:03,910
So that information we want to put in the context so that we can later use that to create a new post.

109
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:08,170
So that means not just the message that, but we also want to have a look at that.

110
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,760
Let me just console.log for now.

111
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:15,610
We don't have the context yet, so let's just come to log in for that file.

112
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,250
The tour begins in front of five.

113
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,000
I said, let's try one.

114
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,050
As it's uprooting.

115
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:38,390
Okay.

116
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:47,660
So you can see once it is uploaded we got the response info dot file in for the find it responses here.

117
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,500
Okay.

118
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,190
So we're supposed to receive the response here, but it's empty.

119
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,210
And so I realized that here in our control.

120
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,660
I forgot to use a weight.

121
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:10,390
And that's the reason I think we're not getting the best one.

122
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:16,900
So let's make sure we have a weight here so that we get the response.

123
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,360
So let's try one more time.

124
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,410
I guess the end for that file this time we have the responses.

125
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:41,720
As you can see, this response has the information of all the media that is saved in the database.

126
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:49,370
So it has created a built in data public ID posted by users ID in the URL.

127
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,330
Beautiful.

128
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,240
This information we're going to save in the context.

129
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,240
By the way, if you want to try, you can try.

130
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,410
The image has been uploaded beautifully.

131
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,320
So this information.

132
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,420
Now all this files we will be able to show in the library later.

133
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:14,730
But as the upload is done, if you use a one to.

134
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,200
Use that images in the post.

135
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,150
He should be able to.

136
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:23,520
So we will put it in the context and.

137
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,380
Later when recruiting a post we can clear from the context.

138
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:34,950
So in the context we will have the media's and we will also have a property called selected.

139
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:42,750
I guess as soon as any image has been uploaded the the latest images response we will always save in

140
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,850
the context as a selected one.

141
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:45,450
Right.

142
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:50,310
So when the post is created we will always have that as a featured images.

143
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,500
Okay, so you'll see how that works.

144
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,520
But so far so good.

145
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,010
We have been able to upload the images.

146
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:56,520
Awesome.

147
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,950
Now this delete feature here, we are not going to actually implement this one.

148
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:08,720
Instead, we will show all the media library here and let me show you how I did in the finished product.

149
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:11,090
So here we will allow them to do it.

150
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:11,540
All right.

151
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,200
So we are going to.

152
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:16,400
Use this one.

153
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,210
So you saw one whenever you uploaded.

154
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:20,840
You see that?

155
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:27,310
So you can remove that by using CCS if you don't want to.

156
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:27,770
So that.

157
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,020
So that one to write.

158
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,200
Clean, inspect.

159
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,170
And Burton.

160
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:56,090
And upload a list items of this class, then we can target veterans.

161
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:56,720
Copy that.

162
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,680
And if you use that.

163
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,400
Let me just quickly try here.

164
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,490
Displayed.

165
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:09,030
No.

166
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,770
If you do that, you can see the.

167
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,680
You don't see that.

168
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,450
So let's use this.

169
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:16,880
See us.

170
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:22,260
Put it in our thesis frame.

171
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,340
All right.

172
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,530
Now, you come here.

173
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,760
You don't see that.

174
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:33,540
It's beautiful.
