00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.400
In the previous video, we implemented and designed navigation a component.

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.370
We just copy paste of code from the documentation.

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.250
Now let's make them clickable.

4
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.960
So we have two pages at the moment.

5
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.500
We can add few more bases and then just put some real navigation links, right, so that we can navigate

6
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:22.980
around.

7
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.300
And for that, we can use a link component from and design.

8
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.010
So in regular sized email we use and attack the attack.

9
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.300
But with react in next is we use a link component.

10
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.770
So if you are using plain React, you be using a link component from React crowd and that's a popular

11
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.480
library for implementing routing.

12
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.630
But with next year, we didn't have to install any third party packages from NPM.

13
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.200
It comes with Nexus itself.

14
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.740
All right.

15
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:56.730
So let's go ahead.

16
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.440
Let's give it a try.

17
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.610
By the way, if you have a loop, if you go to admin, you'll also notice that we didn't have any styling

18
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:05.820
here.

19
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:13.170
That's because the styling has been applied in that targeted menu.

20
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.680
So tall, thin component.

21
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:22.260
You can see here we have the basics and that's where we use that thesis.

22
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.820
All right, so on.

23
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:31.290
Unless you share this component in all the pieces, you will not get to see us this applied everywhere.

24
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:39.240
Now, to fix that, what we can do is we can import this double team component and use in the navigation

25
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.670
because we know the navigation will be used in the entire application.

26
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.130
All the pieces we see here, the navigation, right.

27
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:56.430
So we can import that this starting component and put it here in the nerd bar that we use, it can double

28
00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.880
the theme.

29
00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:05.970
And at the same time, since we will have the axis that is part of this component that is in the headsets

30
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.580
and that will be applied for the entire application.

31
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.570
And as a result, no matter which page you will, you will have to see, is this applied?

32
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:22.230
All right, so let's go import this double team component in top NAV again, because instead of searching

33
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.550
here like we did in the home base, we can remove that and put it here.

34
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.490
So here in the top.

35
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.540
Now, let me just import that first import double theme song.

36
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:44.130
So we are in the same directory, so don't less stole theme then we can put that let's use the last

37
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:52.650
menu item which is which must be this one here navigation for this one.

38
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.350
So let's take that off and instead put double theme.

39
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.280
All right.

40
00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.000
Now we have this double theme here.

41
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.480
Beautiful.

42
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.890
Awesome.

43
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.290
Now let's push it to the right end and remove from home.

44
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.670
To put it to the right end.

45
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.650
First, let's remove this key.

46
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.980
We don't really need to use key in this one.

47
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.900
And we're going to use some styling margin.

48
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.020
Margin left.

49
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.650
We use auto that boost this to the end.

50
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.540
That's that's right.

51
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.210
Beautiful again.

52
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.620
Now let's go to composer to move this from school to home.

53
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.980
Let's index its double.

54
00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.560
Beautiful.

55
00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.030
Now we have home base.

56
00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.010
We have the dollar theme.

57
00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.210
And if you were to add me.

58
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.590
We have the same navigation, we have the city supply and everything is there.

59
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:22.360
Now let's change this text and just use the link imported from and then so that we can navigate around.

60
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:29.170
And since we are working with React, we there will be no base reload.

61
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.310
So when you navigate between pages, you will not see the page reload.

62
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.670
It will be happening in sending.

63
00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:39.500
I guess so.

64
00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.210
I mean, it's good to talk now.

65
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.950
So it'll be component based routing.

66
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.290
So whichever component we use, so in admin we see the admin component or the component will switch

67
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.100
and basically reload if you need to react.

68
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.930
Traditionally, PSP both on the server side language.

69
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.780
If your side is built using both technologies, then the PS will reload whenever you navigate between

70
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:10.260
bases.

71
00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.270
But with React, that's the beauty.

72
00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.030
So here in the top.

73
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.980
Now let me use this as a brand name.

74
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:21.780
So let's find that out.

75
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.770
The first one, let's call it seamless.

76
00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:28.990
Next one, we call it.

77
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.210
For the moment, let's just call it added.

78
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:41.820
We make changes later, we translate it, we make it decimal and then based on the user role, we will

79
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.380
take them to a different decimal, right?

80
00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.190
So for the moment, just leave it like this.

81
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:54.090
That's admin and we have this dropdown dropdown.

82
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.360
I think it's a good idea to use the dropdown for admin.

83
00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.810
Right.

84
00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.570
Let's have a look at how we did for our finished project.

85
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.370
Monster Dotcom.

86
00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:14.820
I guess you can see we have the job done for the admin and then we have the regular links, so let's

87
00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:15.600
keep it like that.

88
00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.180
So this way I can use it for sign up and sign it.

89
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.800
Sign up.

90
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.430
So let me just copy that one.

91
00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:38.510
Put it down here listing the key to sign up and this one's key to signing.

92
00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:40.650
All right.

93
00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.520
So we will change to little bit later the icons.

94
00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:44.400
Let's wait for that.

95
00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:49.370
So we've got sign up signing and list the dropdown.

96
00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.090
Let's give it a name title.

97
00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.010
Let's send this to Dashboard for now.

98
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:01.180
I guess so.

99
00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.070
We got sign up signed in Despres.

100
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.370
That's a lot of you want to push.

101
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:05.800
Push it to the right end.

102
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.660
So what you can do, you can upload the seamless assist, as we did here.

103
00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:19.190
All right, so let's put it.

104
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:19.920
Put it here.

105
00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:29.370
Okay.

106
00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:36.510
So once we applied that here, I think we didn't need to put it here.

107
00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:38.490
This one comes out for that one.

108
00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.110
So let's try that.

109
00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:40.830
Yes.

110
00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:41.420
So that.

111
00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:41.850
Yes.

112
00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:43.380
All right.

113
00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.370
So we got that.

114
00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:53.730
Now let's make them clickable and let's use the link component from end to the currently disabled.

115
00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:54.970
So we do want to disabuse.

116
00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:05.360
All right, let's import link component from next link.

117
00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:09.350
Now, if you're coming from the reactor out of Dodge, most likely you will.

118
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.920
You would import like this and react proud of doing it.

119
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.770
But with next year there is no destruction.

120
00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:21.500
You just import, default, import like this all to make sure you don't do it.

121
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.700
So with that link here, we can use that.

122
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:30.200
So for seeing this one, they click on this one, we want to take them to the home base, right?

123
00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:38.870
So here we use link and as a requirement in next this you need to have the anchor date for any links

124
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.140
and then you just based in this.

125
00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.390
Okay, so we got the link.

126
00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:50.870
A So if we put here, it's if it's going to be just home base for.

127
00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:56.570
Now if you're new to next year, this might feel a little weird because we have the link and then we

128
00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:57.910
have the anchor data as well.

129
00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:58.160
All right.

130
00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:01.010
But that's a requirement to keep that in mind.

131
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:02.840
All right.

132
00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:07.160
So that's for the home base for sign up.

133
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:10.820
Let's create the link.

134
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:17.760
So Link.

135
00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:30.220
Anchored tags and then just finished the name sign up to hatred.

136
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:33.390
Sign up.

137
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:39.720
We need to quickly clear some bases for this one test and then let me just copy this one.

138
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:41.700
Let me just based here.

139
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:54.790
We can just copy, link and place this one call.

140
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:55.360
Sign in.

141
00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:04.290
All right, so we get the signing sign up and we get the disclosure.

142
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:05.460
All right.

143
00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:08.010
So we've got the sign inside of Nashville.

144
00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:11.040
Now you can click to get to the home base.

145
00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:14.220
This desperate.

146
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:16.790
And let me take you to.

147
00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:25.310
Some and even just call it Edwin.

148
00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:29.030
And it's quickly have a look at how we have done here.

149
00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:33.170
Management, we give this give this a title and then the link.

150
00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:34.940
So what do you do it like that?

151
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:37.520
Management.

152
00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:38.900
And then.

153
00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:47.110
Let's just use admin for now because we have only one type of user.

154
00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:53.050
We focusing at the moment that admin link and could take.

155
00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:57.360
He's admin.

156
00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.410
His hatred.

157
00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:01.260
Hatred is going to be baseless.

158
00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:05.840
All right.

159
00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:15.090
Now as to the sign of signing, we got the admin here so you can click it, go to the admin basic,

160
00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.620
click with home base.

161
00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.510
There is no base really or anything.

162
00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.000
It's beautiful, by the way.

163
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.450
Management are supposed to be here and I want to fix that.

164
00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:26.450
Some management.

165
00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:30.700
So the main element is that it?

166
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:31.590
Oh, yes.

167
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:32.370
That's the time.

168
00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:33.810
That's what we should be using.

169
00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:37.020
Management.

170
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:37.500
All right.

171
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:38.640
So we can remove that.

172
00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:40.350
Beautiful.

173
00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.140
And let me do this.

174
00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:43.710
Fantastic.

175
00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.600
Let's keep it simple.

176
00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:49.620
So the item group, we have the title and then just one link for now.

177
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.470
All right, so we've got the admin, we've got the home.

178
00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:57.590
Let's quickly create these two places as well.

179
00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:59.840
So we've pretty much done with our default.

180
00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:02.870
Navigation with bases.

181
00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:03.200
Right.

182
00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:05.910
So we have home base.

183
00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:07.140
So let me just copy that.

184
00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:13.350
Just to make things easier inside business school new further sign up dirt is.

185
00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:25.090
Another one signing dances and then you paste that code from home since the Nim sign in.

186
00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:31.630
Sign in to send the name.

187
00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:32.900
Do sign in.

188
00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:38.780
Remove the bottom and just replace this to sign.

189
00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:41.270
We don't need the button as well.

190
00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:44.980
Okay.

191
00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:47.800
So we've got the sign in base.

192
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:49.560
It's good to sign up.

193
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:55.200
It's based that and it make sense to sign.

194
00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:00.380
Copy paste first.

195
00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:03.060
All right, so we've got all this space.

196
00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:04.150
Let's give it a try.

197
00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:04.990
Got home.

198
00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:07.630
Santa signing.

199
00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.840
And every beautiful.
