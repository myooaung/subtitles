00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.310
So we started working in the post.

2
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.310
EDIT So we created this post and we know we uploaded defeated images for this one.

3
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.720
So this featured image the existing she's an image of the post.

4
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:21.330
Let's try to show that here when we land and this is so for that we can put that somewhere just above

5
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.350
this post button.

6
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.290
So we've got the populist button there.

7
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.630
Let's try to put that here.

8
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.110
Actually, we have this quarter.

9
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.380
We just have to modify this one.

10
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:45.340
So if we have the selected media, if I tried to upload a new feature image, choose from the library

11
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.250
or upload a new one, then that will be selected.

12
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:48.640
Right.

13
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.790
So media has this context with the selected.

14
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.670
So whenever you upload, that will be select.

15
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.520
So if I do that, then obviously I would see here.

16
00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:59.980
So this code works.

17
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.790
If you upload or choose from the libraries, that's fine.

18
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.580
Let me turn this to Don Alfredo.

19
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.720
So if you have that, that's okay.

20
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.650
Otherwise.

21
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.130
Again, we have to use that next iteration.

22
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.170
So otherwise, maybe this post already has the featured image, right?

23
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.620
So we, we have the local state of feature image, so we can use that.

24
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.220
So if feature images here, feature images.

25
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.870
Yeah, we can stick with the air.

26
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.050
So if we have that, then again, we want to use that.

27
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.410
Otherwise it wouldn't be the industry.

28
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.280
So if we have that again, we do something.

29
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.270
Otherwise we just leave it empty string.

30
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.870
I guess if we have the featured image so maybe we can send DV and put here.

31
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.300
Let me save that.

32
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.310
So here you are asking to be featured in is yard.

33
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.670
Okay.

34
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.780
Let's give it a try.

35
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.720
This should work.

36
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.980
Let's give a quick read.

37
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.220
Let's visit that page one more time.

38
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.400
Okay.

39
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.430
So we didn't see that.

40
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.520
Let's try.

41
00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.160
It's fair to have a look at the state featured in this.

42
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.310
Okay.

43
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.240
So looks like we don't have the state.

44
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.670
So let's come.

45
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:54.280
Back to our Lord post function said featured in his daughter dot feature image.

46
00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.460
Let's have a look at this console.

47
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.820
Okay.

48
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.630
Actually, we may not have on this one.

49
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.140
Oh, know we do.

50
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.280
We have the you are featured in this funeral is there.

51
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.280
Featured images there.

52
00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.260
Oh so I did on the school suit be came of course like this featured in this.

53
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:37.290
Okay.

54
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.210
So we see that.

55
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.570
Beautiful.

56
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.360
Maybe just some of that decent string of.

57
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.820
So this post had its own elements, so we saw that.

58
00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:01.170
Now, if you want to update with the new one, obviously you can click and that works.

59
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.460
Okay.

60
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.500
So that also works.

61
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.760
So we come to title updated.

62
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.860
I'm buried.

63
00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.110
So we got it.

64
00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.170
We can see the preview.

65
00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:32.660
We can show this image as well here in the preview show and to so we can pick more categories or remove

66
00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:33.860
to that also works.

67
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.920
So everything's warden here, right?

68
00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:44.600
So all we need to do is send this updated information to the back end so that we can save this object

69
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.560
in the database.

70
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.840
All right, so find the post decent I.D. and update all these values.

71
00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.110
So we pretty is good here.

72
00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:01.010
Now, let's work on this number, this function that gets executed when we submit handle published.

73
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.350
So we're sending the featured image as well.

74
00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:11.770
Total content categories featured image if any error we saw the error, otherwise we sort of sexist

75
00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:12.320
misses.

76
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.510
We don't have the local stories because this is not the create post.

77
00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:18.610
So let's move.

78
00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.770
That said media and media selected.

79
00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.070
Let's use no instead of empty string.

80
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.400
And maybe this is something you want to change here as well.

81
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.880
So it's good.

82
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:29.950
The Post quickly.

83
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.940
That should be.

84
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.380
Not because the selected images will be the object.

85
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:44.620
Instead of having the string that let's make it empty object, which is no.

86
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.210
And then finally, just take the media context.

87
00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.070
Context media.

88
00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:57.180
Okay.

89
00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.530
So we're using not good.

90
00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:00.120
Okay.

91
00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.260
So back to slug.

92
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.020
So if it is successful, we said the media selected will not be there.

93
00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.000
And then finally we can post the user to post here.

94
00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:18.930
So it's optional, but you can reduce the user when they they update the post to you, you can redirect

95
00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.640
them to all post based.

96
00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.500
No.

97
00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.790
We're done here.

98
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:29.530
Let's go to the back end and create the endpoint so that we can serve this object.

99
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.920
At the moment, if you try, obviously we get the error because that endpoint doesn't exist.

100
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.250
This end point, it posts less.

101
00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.020
We'll say this event doesn't exist.

102
00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:52.330
Actually for Objet we can make a portrait, which I did to ensure a post we can use to put that technically

103
00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:57.220
correct when we are updating something and make a photo request.

104
00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:05.900
And if you try to make a request, you get the error because poor for business, obviously.

105
00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:12.280
So let's go to the back end with the the end point and the put end point so that we can object.
