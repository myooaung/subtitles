1
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.640
All right, so let's work on the sidebar here.

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.260
So we're going to create an admin menu.

3
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.810
So this one.

4
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.250
We're going to actually use you to call it admin now.

5
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.820
All right.

6
00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.380
So let's cut that from you.

7
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.550
We don't need that here.

8
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:23.240
Cut from here and create a new for inside components.

9
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.380
And it's called NAV.

10
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.620
Instead.

11
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:33.030
Now let's create a new file called and minute later we're going to have alternative and subscribe in

12
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.660
there as well.

13
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.110
So I been there.

14
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.290
So we want to import layout from and

15
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:55.820
const slider was filled out with destructor and then we created components of const admin nav.

16
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.530
So you want to return for the moment?

17
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:08.490
Let me just return the sidebar for now and then export the default admin nav.

18
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.510
All right.

19
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.410
Now let's import this one to admin.

20
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.440
It's also put on top

21
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.420
import and now from.

22
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.480
So that is just one step of inside nav admin.

23
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.850
Then and mean no.

24
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.290
All right.

25
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.630
So Sizer, now we replace the sides with admin.

26
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.290
Basically it's the same thing we have decided here.

27
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:44.970
So you see it's the same thing.

28
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.640
But if you are just going from it's called admin side.

29
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:53.180
All right.

30
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.170
So you can see it works.

31
00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:02.800
Now for the sidebar, we can use this another menu items so it's come here menu.

32
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.390
They have the menu here in the component to exclude you.

33
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.190
So we are going to use this.

34
00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.540
This is the top navigation.

35
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.190
Now we want to use something like this on the sidebar or something like this.

36
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.480
So let's use this one.

37
00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.890
This is pretty nice.

38
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.850
And you can see you can collapse as well.

39
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.610
So we're going to later dynamically detect the the browser with the user.

40
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.550
And if it is too small, we can collapse as well.

41
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:34.810
It's pretty cool.

42
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.220
All right, so let's grab this code from here.

43
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.700
So we could manually write all this code.

44
00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.220
Basically, it's the same thing.

45
00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.190
Previously we used it in the top navigation.

46
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.760
The only difference is this menu.

47
00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.950
It has the orientation.

48
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.560
Let me say that one mold in life.

49
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:09.620
More in.

50
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.150
Now if we have a look at the previous one we used in the talk, now this one.

51
00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.550
Maltese horizontal.

52
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.710
Most of that trade is horizontal.

53
00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.030
But this one is more in line.

54
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.310
Because it's just on the side.

55
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.980
Otherwise, basically, it's the same thing.

56
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.330
It's the same many component.

57
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.930
All right.

58
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.300
So let's go ahead and copy this call.

59
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.760
So you see this component here, exemplar.

60
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.260
You open this one so the core and you can copy from here.

61
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.690
All right, so it's copy then.

62
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.590
And let's go to Edwin.

63
00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:58.970
Never too under there.

64
00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.160
And now we can post here.

65
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:09.050
Now, let me just actually remove all this, slip this one and and move on that space to you.

66
00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.320
That way it's much easier to remove this one.

67
00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:21.740
And now we want to choose the component name it's using plus component so we can change that as well.

68
00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.900
Just leave it like this for now.

69
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.810
So we have the admin nav component.

70
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.570
All the inputs are held, the icons are imported.

71
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.790
Minion button is there.

72
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.400
We have the state collapse.

73
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.740
So this collapsed is needed for this control to collapse and open.

74
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.640
All right, so it has the Boolean value false.

75
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.880
When it's true and false, it will collapse and open.

76
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.410
All right.

77
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.990
So you can see total collapse on click.

78
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:58.270
We executed this function and this function will basically change the state to collapse.

79
00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:06.280
If it is collapse, it will, you know, not collapse, otherwise collapse into told the value to and

80
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.720
false.

81
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.630
All right.

82
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.820
So that is something that we can even write in line.

83
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.560
We don't even need this function here.

84
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.200
So we're going to make that change.

85
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.400
We're going to change this to a functional component and we're going to do that.

86
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:24.010
And basically, we have the button here for the collapse icon and then we have the standard menu.

87
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.150
And this is something you already know you used in the top navigation.

88
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.500
All right.

89
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.440
So we saved that.

90
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.020
And let's have a look how to use.

91
00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.220
In the office.

92
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:48.290
React to since the existing the react component we have to import react from.

93
00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:53.750
Import.

94
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.900
You can import react.

95
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:04.010
Oh, just to use that component, we can do structure component as well from React.

96
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:06.260
You could do that.

97
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.990
You can just remove the React from here.

98
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:10.910
And that's that's holding it.

99
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:16.210
Okay.

100
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.180
So looks like it might actually need to react.

101
00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:20.770
Okay.

102
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.090
So it's under that.

103
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:24.320
That's an.

104
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.740
And it's input here.

105
00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:34.280
All right.

106
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.860
Now, you can see we have this beautiful side by many of this beautiful styling.

107
00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.560
We can fix that, but otherwise it's pretty cool.

108
00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.080
You can see it is collapsible.

109
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.100
You can open was beautiful.

110
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.560
Now there's a bit of issue.

111
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.490
We can fix that.

112
00:06:55.470 --> 00:07:00.750
So here, first thing I want to do is make this a functional component, since we're using functional

113
00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:11.250
components everywhere so that since this that is tuned to concept and NAV equals two and then we don't

114
00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:13.710
need all this at all.

115
00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:14.490
Yeah.

116
00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.060
That now in

117
00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:27.180
functional components we don't right still like that we want to bring in the hook to create a state

118
00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:27.930
so that's.

119
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:36.980
Riot is already imported by default globally with next year.

120
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:42.320
But sometimes in some version of Nexus, you might still have to import artists.

121
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:44.870
Keep that in mind, but in our case, we didn't need that.

122
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:47.270
We just want to use it.

123
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.770
Use the state.

124
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:50.060
Don't hook.

125
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:50.480
All right.

126
00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:57.620
So once you have that, we can just replace this one with the institute.

127
00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:58.340
So.

128
00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:01.530
Collapsed.

129
00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:07.940
Since it collapsed, you state and give the different value of force.

130
00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:12.600
So you can see in class components you do like that but in.

131
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.550
Procter Gamble.

132
00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:19.330
This is how we do it and then will collapse.

133
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:23.890
We just have to double this value in the step, which is something very easy.

134
00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:24.900
We can do it in line.

135
00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.880
So let's just not to worry about this one scenario.

136
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:28.900
Instead.

137
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:31.580
On Glee.

138
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:31.910
All right.

139
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:32.510
On Glee.

140
00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:36.310
Now we use our phones in.

141
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:46.620
Set collapsed and whatever value we have in the state, we just told Dolan that went all right.

142
00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:47.880
So nice and easy.

143
00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:50.880
That's the beauty of head of Fox in Poughkeepsie.

144
00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:59.580
It's so good how we have to poll K since they're using the crit element we have to see the input react

145
00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.230
to is student.

146
00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:05.270
React and the new state.

147
00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.730
Now we have one issue and that is the render.

148
00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:12.740
So glass components you need to render it and then you put return here.

149
00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:16.490
However, with functional component, we just need done that.

150
00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:21.920
So let's remove the render and come all the way down and remove that carnivorous.

151
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:30.630
You know when you save PGA will outperform and your core arc beautiful.

152
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:37.140
So we go to the state, we get the region, we have the in-line one click function that tells the stated

153
00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:37.560
valley.

154
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:40.440
All right, so that looks good.

155
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.090
Let's have a new state collapse.

156
00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:45.600
So we still have that good.

157
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:47.610
Still let some of that.

158
00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.950
We just need to collapse.

159
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:51.930
That is the state variables.

160
00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:56.460
If it is collapsed, we show this item mini on food.

161
00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.910
Otherwise we should menu for icon.

162
00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:01.650
All right.

163
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.510
In Collapse line 32.

164
00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:10.980
So they have this one as sitting room that.

165
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:15.730
That's.

166
00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:17.220
Okay.

167
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:17.910
Beautiful.

168
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:24.290
Now we've converted this component to a functional component and silicon good.
