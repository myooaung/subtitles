1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:00,610
All right.

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,270
So we worked on the edit post here in the front end.

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,830
We just need to create the endpoint so that we can save this object in the database.

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,150
So let's go to the back end and create this endpoint.

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:13,230
Thank you.

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:19,800
So let me go to so let's start from the right post.

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,690
Let's create a food truck without a dog food.

8
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,160
So the end point is it it?

9
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:33,810
At least this post started it be getting the post.

10
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,540
Only the question is admin.

11
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,450
Edit post.

12
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:47,390
So let's create this controller from and post I.D..

13
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:57,630
Edit post I saw him export concert edit posts.

14
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:02,970
It comes to a song request response.

15
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:21,330
Okay.

16
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:27,690
So yeah, what we want to do is first and get the data from the params this destructor so it's easy

17
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:37,470
to use post ID equals to request params so we can find the post based on the idea and then prompt it.

18
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:48,210
Now let's also destructor are the values so that it's easier to use later context we can destroy title

19
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,820
content, featured images and then categories.

20
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:01,270
From the request for.

21
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:03,880
All right.

22
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:10,600
So we're sending this sending all this value which should be received in the request form.

23
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,120
So we do structure all of them as well.

24
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:25,780
Then first we have to work on the categories because, you know, we are extending the category.

25
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,490
The categories, which basically is the array of names.

26
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,980
However, when you want to save in the database, we need to know these categories and not just the

27
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,570
name, but the idea, right?

28
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,470
So just like we did when we were creating the post.

29
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,510
New post create post.

30
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,500
So previously also we did the same thing.

31
00:02:52,500 --> 00:03:00,300
We pushed the categories 80 so we followed we found the categories based on the name and then we.

32
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,390
Using this for a look.

33
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:12,070
We post these categories, add to this variable and we saved this array instead of the name.

34
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,510
So we can grab this.

35
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,760
Let's grab that.

36
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,390
And just put here.

37
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,810
So that will give us the categories.

38
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,010
Add in the salary.

39
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:38,830
So once you go the categories, we want to save the the possible object.

40
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:46,030
Now if you notice previously when we were creating that time also we used the set time because because

41
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:51,310
of this, the look that we have, it might take a few milliseconds.

42
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:57,310
So just to make sure we have all the categories before we save in the database, we use the set time

43
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,430
I and we delayed the saving by 1/2.

44
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:00,940
All right.

45
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,750
So we can do something like that again on the edit.

46
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:11,770
So, so yeah, we can use set timeout.

47
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,050
So a set timer takes a function.

48
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,790
We use our function you.

49
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,510
And we give the.

50
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:30,810
Time, the delay time and let's say 1000 milliseconds, which is 1/2, I guess, for here.

51
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,500
What we want to do is we want to find the post by 80.

52
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:42,120
So constant post it wants to wait post.

53
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:48,700
Post mortem fine by I.D. and update.

54
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:49,390
All right.

55
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,340
So here into this function.

56
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:56,830
Well, first, we have to give the post I.D. so that we can find the post based on I.D..

57
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:04,030
So post I.D. is post I.D., which we have already destructed from the params.

58
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,770
So that's positive.

59
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:12,520
So that's for argument's sake, an argument is the values that you want to update.

60
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:16,930
So in our case, that's the title content featured in this album.

61
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:20,320
So title content.

62
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:28,960
By the way, let's also make sure to slowly fade the title, because if you have changed the title,

63
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:34,390
if you have changed the title, then you may want to update the slogan as well.

64
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:34,960
All right.

65
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:42,490
So slogan will be title, whatever that is.

66
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,140
If that has been changed.

67
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,710
And then here's the slug effect function.

68
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,010
We give the title.

69
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:50,600
Thank you.

70
00:05:50,750 --> 00:06:01,700
So we saved the update entitled Slug Content Categories, which will not be the requisite body categories.

71
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:10,820
Instead, that will be the array of category IDs sets categories that it is and then featured in is.

72
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,560
We'll be there thanks to family and update.

73
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,150
So we've got a table here somewhere.

74
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,100
When I'm when I save.

75
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,410
And if it doesn't format the predefined doesn't format, then I immediately know there's something wrong.

76
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:37,950
So I noticed that we using a way to unity, using async support.

77
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,930
And that's the reason.

78
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,820
I guess that's the reason.

79
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:46,310
Okay, so we've got the titles, log content categories, feature images, that's all we need.

80
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:52,130
So find the post variety, save this update.

81
00:06:52,520 --> 00:07:02,240
The next argument we can use is new to so that we can give the this updated response here.

82
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:03,950
Now it's a new true.

83
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,760
And then finally we can send the response.

84
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:13,270
However, when we send the response, we want to populate everything we need.

85
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:21,700
So one is first we want the posted by, we want the categories and we want the featured images.

86
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:22,490
Right?

87
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,480
So.

88
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,680
Let's use that.

89
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,080
So you don't.

90
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,430
Populate post in both.

91
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,690
We just need the idea.

92
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:49,240
And then again populate categories, name and slug.

93
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,590
Actually, we don't have to populate it.

94
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,210
It's always there by default.

95
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:59,540
And then populate feature limits.

96
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,730
We want to select the URL.

97
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:05,630
All right.

98
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:13,400
So that's all now we can say in response to Jason Post so this has been updated post.

99
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:15,760
All right.

100
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,270
So that's our that's our post update.

101
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,170
Okay.

102
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,090
That's the post.

103
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,560
Let's give it a try.

104
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:31,460
So previously we had issue four for not fun, but hopefully this time it works.

105
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,090
Let me hit publish.

106
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,960
It's let me just write some updates.

107
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:54,390
I guess if we have no let's add one more then we've got a feature that means let's hit publish.

108
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,740
You can see it has been successfully uploaded.

109
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,910
That's beautiful.

110
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,370
You can see the updated title is.

111
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:05,820
Then if you go to update again, you can see everything is there.

112
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,170
How good is that?

113
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:13,680
Beautiful.

114
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,800
Just to make sure.

115
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,890
Let me just give it a reload.

116
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:25,810
And he continues, Everything's working beautifully.

117
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,830
So we have been able to update the post as well.

118
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:33,910
Now.

119
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:36,420
Let's try one more time.

120
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:36,970
I've done it.

121
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,830
Let's try another post.

122
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:41,050
Actually, let's go to all posts.

123
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,940
Let's try this one.

124
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,480
You said this also had the existing image.

125
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:52,390
It's the last post from Ryan and it's in the title.

126
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,370
Let's use this.

127
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,080
We have no more.

128
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,160
Featured image limiting the featured images to

129
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,700
something else.

130
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,170
Let's try this one.

131
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:18,540
Accident and this one.

132
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,980
This one, even this one.

133
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:30,710
Okay.

134
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,500
He told this.

135
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,470
Beautiful.

136
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,200
You can see the has been published.

137
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,300
It's called Visit the Post Office.

138
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:42,150
We have veteran updated post.

139
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:45,610
Beautiful.
