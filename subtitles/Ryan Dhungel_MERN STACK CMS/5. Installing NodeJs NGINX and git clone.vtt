00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.820
What's the next step is to install NPM Norton and Beam produce Lawson at this command.

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:18.780
I took this from the official documentation so you can also search and deploy node to OSU and they have

3
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.660
official document as an official tutorial as well.

4
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.250
There's one that's.

5
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.420
It's tradition that's 2019.

6
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.970
So here also you'll find the same information, I'm pretty sure.

7
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.880
Again, this one looks a little different.

8
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.820
Now, let me go back.

9
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.930
Let me try this very first one.

10
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.620
I.

11
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.980
So, yeah, that is the same comment I have used here.

12
00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.910
All right.

13
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.160
So let me just go through this one.

14
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.930
So you concur.

15
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.710
We're going to run this command.

16
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.090
So here in the dissolution.

17
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.060
So this is this is access into the digital asset server.

18
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.130
We're going to run this to institutional.

19
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.820
I could.

20
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:41.180
Now this one, it's a bit hard to exit so we can try this command control x, the control x, so we

21
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.520
exit.

22
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.470
No, it's okay.

23
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.010
So that was two command exit.

24
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.870
That was the first.

25
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.140
Come on, let me just run this one more time just to make sure.

26
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.660
It ain't okay.

27
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.060
And this one I think we did already.

28
00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.610
But let's do it one more time.

29
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.300
I get to control X.

30
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.010
All right, that's done.

31
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.930
Next, we have to run this.

32
00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.000
Password.

33
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.420
Well it's happening.

34
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.680
Let me copy this from an assault sudo apt install notice.

35
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.870
It's done.

36
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.750
No, it says sudo apt to get install nodes.

37
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:42.160
Yes.

38
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.390
I guess let me just paste that.

39
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:51.000
I.

40
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.620
So with that, I think instilling note is done.

41
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.090
So once we have know that we have NPM as well.

42
00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.090
So no problem then.

43
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.660
Once it is done, we're going to try to see the version worse version, whatever we have.

44
00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.280
We won't have the latest version.

45
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:12.630
And then we can start cloning the repository from GitHub so that we have the code base here.

46
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.330
And then we're going to make some changes in the in the next server and that that is it.

47
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.030
We should be able to start our project.

48
00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.550
It just looks like that's done.

49
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:30.360
Let me take the version node that's fit so into we are using version ten.

50
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:40.230
I guess we we we installed version ten probably we should just send this to version 15.

51
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.450
I think that is the current one at the moment.

52
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.930
Let me just boost here and change this to version 15.

53
00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:01.230
And then copy that and let's run this one more time so that we get the latest version.

54
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.440
I just change this from 10 to 15 x.

55
00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.560
I guess we have to run this one more time.

56
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:24.910
Control X.

57
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.160
And the last one, finally, this.

58
00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.410
But this time let's try and know.

59
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.910
Okay.

60
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.680
So we got the latest version 50.

61
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:03.430
That's perfect.

62
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.530
Okay, so that's done with.

63
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.610
And so note next, we can start cloning the repository.

64
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.720
All right, so let's clone both back end in front end and let's go here.

65
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:20.890
Let's start with server EDI client, that is.

66
00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.590
Repositories.

67
00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.480
So this is the recent one.

68
00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:41.990
And eating your server, let's bring in the server first so you can click here, grab this code and

69
00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.600
come back to our terminal.

70
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:58.760
And here let's and let's do a story that's going to have to start with git clone using pseudo pseudo

71
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.920
git clone based that URL and give the name.

72
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.480
So if you leave it as it is, it will create this folder.

73
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.480
Let's just call it so as to make it easier.

74
00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.250
So you have to give the GitHub username password.

75
00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.310
This is the GitHub password.

76
00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.650
Okay?

77
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.380
This is not the disclosed password.

78
00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.620
And we have got the code base here.

79
00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:41.910
You can see we have the server perfect CD server and S and you can see we have all our vegan code is

80
00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:42.180
here.

81
00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:42.660
Perfect.

82
00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.960
All we have to do is run npm install here.

83
00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.640
So let me go back again.

84
00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:59.070
And in the root directory along with the server, let's also import the client client project as well.

85
00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:06.740
So let's click you go to code, click here and here, get it.

86
00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:14.400
Do sudo git clone paste that url and then give the folder name client.

87
00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.390
I guess it would got both client and server folder.

88
00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:26.320
Perfect.

89
00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.290
Let's see what else is here.

90
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:35.020
So we have to get inside these projects and run and beam in stone.

91
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:38.400
Now, before we do that, let's also configure engineer.

92
00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.070
So we have to make some changes so that our server.

93
00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:50.770
EPA can run on 8000 and the front end will run on Local 3000.

94
00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:55.000
I guess we will have the same domain until we have the domain.

95
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.950
We will be able to access the the app using the IP address.

96
00:07:58.960 --> 00:07:59.500
I guess so.

97
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:08.740
The the front end will be served in the forward SLAs, but anything with SLAs API will be used for the

98
00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:09.220
API.

99
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:11.080
All right.

100
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:22.660
So we have to go to this file, added this default in the next file and add this to location block so

101
00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:25.390
you can copy this code and copy that.

102
00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:33.340
And I'm pretty sure you used the 8000, 3000 in your local project as well.

103
00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:38.140
So copy that and navigate to this folder.

104
00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:45.590
Here, see the space, s+, etc..

105
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.910
Engine x.

106
00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:56.210
Celeste sides there's a valuable.

107
00:08:58.540 --> 00:08:59.140
Okay.

108
00:08:59.170 --> 00:08:59.770
So sorry.

109
00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.060
We don't have the engineers.

110
00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:03.910
We haven't installed engineers yet.

111
00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:08.530
Did we miss the Indian Express installation?

112
00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.310
Thank you, sir.

113
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:12.710
Looks like I missed that step here in the studio.

114
00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:12.940
Louis.

115
00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:13.620
Soledad.

116
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:15.760
Okay.

117
00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:16.660
No, actually, it's.

118
00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:17.890
I missed that.

119
00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:22.780
Okay, so let's install engine X first.

120
00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.100
Yes y and hit enter.

121
00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:45.130
Now we should be able to go to this for this to see the space less except wrestlers in the next class.

122
00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:47.920
So it's available.

123
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:50.460
All right.

124
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:54.180
So you can have a look at this default file we have.

125
00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:57.540
We're going to edit this fight to pseudo vim.

126
00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:00.800
The and default.

127
00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:03.870
Thank you.

128
00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.960
So again, to edit this file, you can press a.

129
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:15.600
And then you can use the up and down, right and left arrow keys to navigate.

130
00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:20.970
So you can see we have this server several blocks here.

131
00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:24.930
Replace the location code block with the following code.

132
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:28.410
EPA will run and put a thousand.

133
00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:31.570
Your React app will run on 43,000.

134
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:38.940
So grab this code and then come here all the way down to the location.

135
00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:45.150
BLOCK So you can see here we have to replace the location.

136
00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:51.240
Now, instead of deleting this file, let me just comment this out so that if we need to in future,

137
00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.560
we always have it here.

138
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:56.430
So use this as a symbol that will.

139
00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.320
The comment is called out.

140
00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:04.550
Okay.

141
00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:10.520
So with that, we can come down here and then paste that.

142
00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:13.580
So could block this location.

143
00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:14.940
BLOCK.

144
00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:16.330
Okay, come here.

145
00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:16.820
Best.

146
00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:18.160
Yeah.

147
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.620
Sorry.

148
00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:23.090
It looks like I didn't copy.

149
00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:25.580
Let me just come back here one more time and copy that.

150
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:29.390
Copy that.

151
00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:31.610
Come here and paste you.

152
00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:34.790
Perfect.

153
00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:38.290
So I have the two location block here.

154
00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:46.180
Next, we can save that file and then take to make sure we have no errors.

155
00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:51.910
Okay, so skip colon WQ hit enter.

156
00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:53.080
All right.

157
00:11:53.380 --> 00:12:01.870
Now let's make sure no errors sudo and the next dusty digit is successful.

158
00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:04.050
Now this is really important.

159
00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.050
Make sure to restart in the next okay.

160
00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.260
Otherwise you will not see any changes.

161
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:15.340
Sudo systems need to restart and the next.

162
00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:16.850
Thank you.

163
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:18.490
That's done.

164
00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:20.260
And the next configuration is done.

165
00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:24.130
Now we can start running our project.

166
00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:27.940
So we need to get into it towards H2.

167
00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:30.160
Let me go to the group directory.

168
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.640
So we need to go into each server.

169
00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:35.890
We need to go into the client, create the EMV.

170
00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:41.110
Fine, because we had the we didn't commit these to GitHub.

171
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:41.380
Right.

172
00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:50.260
So we need to create these files and add whatever environment variables we need for both back end and

173
00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:50.680
front end.

174
00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:55.210
And then we can run NPM install and that's it.

175
00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:57.220
We, we can start running our project.

176
00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:03.190
Obviously we have to install the MongoDB as well, but that is it.

177
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:04.120
