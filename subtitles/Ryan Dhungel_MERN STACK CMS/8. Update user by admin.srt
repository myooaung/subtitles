1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:00,920
All right.

2
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,090
So we make the request to the end point.

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:10,020
So that means we have to no go ahead and create this new endpoint to update the user.

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,900
So let's go to server.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:25,840
Or else let's quit the endpoint product or put make a poetry quiz to update the user.

6
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:34,450
And this should be the use should be logged into require assigning either admin.

7
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,310
We are not going to use on this one.

8
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:39,860
Um.

9
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,690
I think I think we need to create to control the foxes.

10
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:54,480
They should be quite similar, but one will have the tick if the user, whoever is being updated, that

11
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,920
user is logged in user.

12
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:56,280
Right.

13
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:04,170
So we need that tick and we need another one that is that would take if the user is added, if it is

14
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,310
admin, he would be able to update other users profile as well.

15
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,530
But if it is not admin then they can object themselves only.

16
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,840
So at the moment we are working for the admin, so let's continue using admin.

17
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:26,610
But later for other users we may duplicate the road user would come back to it.

18
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,190
So let's call it update user by admin.

19
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,090
Listen to this function.

20
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:43,890
Actually I think it's better to use different drugs or reduce it.

21
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:44,740
By Edmondson.

22
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,270
It's called.

23
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:54,620
Let's go to react and let's send this to the user by admin.

24
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:00,530
All right.

25
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,720
So we'll conditionally change this one.

26
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,220
So later when we use this.

27
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:09,950
We will try to reuse this component for both also and admin and other users.

28
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:15,440
So we'll just try to change the the endpoint by passing some kind of port.

29
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,180
All right.

30
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,070
So let's continue here.

31
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:23,060
Object user by admin to integrate this function.

32
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,130
So let's put that here.

33
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,760
Bring from the controllers of.

34
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:45,910
Export context update user async request response Troy.

35
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,500
Now before you try to object to use it.

36
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,690
So we have to apply some takes.

37
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:05,810
So we need to make sure that when they're trying to object, we have got the name, we have got the

38
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:12,950
email, but the password is there and if it is there, then we want to make sure it is up to six characters

39
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:13,340
long.

40
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,960
So things like that we have to take.

41
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:25,370
So first of all, let's it's this one we're going to use for the admins object to use of admin.

42
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,490
So first let's destructor the values from request barley.

43
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:35,840
So we are getting the ID then just don't say kill.

44
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,440
We are sending that IED.

45
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:54,800
Um, I think we have to send they did because we have to find the user from the database personality

46
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,200
and Shintaro doesn't have.

47
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:04,550
That type of approach to road programs we have to send the ideas to.

48
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,780
Let's quickly go back here.

49
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,790
Let's add one more field here.

50
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:08,980
Set.

51
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:13,870
I d so let's start from here.

52
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,000
I'd say that indeed it was to you the state.

53
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,860
Can a tree declare?

54
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:34,960
Okay, sir.

55
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,580
So we have the right to query I.D..

56
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,520
So let me remove this one.

57
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,990
And just to use directly here.

58
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:55,020
I guess, you know, you use it in the state and then when we get the response sent, added, da da

59
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:55,950
da da, underscore it.

60
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:56,790
Beautiful.

61
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:05,760
Now we can send this I.D. when we make this request I.D. and the rest of the world is male, we will

62
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,660
access that here.

63
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,380
So I.D..

64
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,170
Name.

65
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:11,850
Email.

66
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:14,860
Password.

67
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:17,710
Website.

68
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:24,490
Role and emails we can distribute from request boarding.

69
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,650
I guess so, yeah.

70
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,410
First, let's try to find the user from the database based on this I.D. so user ID can so each user

71
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,480
find by using that I.D..

72
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:40,830
We can call it.

73
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:45,070
Let's call it to use a form from DB.

74
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:46,540
Thank you.

75
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,020
So here we're going to take a couple of things.

76
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:54,340
For example, let's take two valid email.

77
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:05,230
Now, this is something I think vanity means there are different ways of making sure the email is a

78
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:05,980
valid email.

79
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:10,750
But we can we cannot be 100% that it is a valid email.

80
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,640
That is what library we can give you.

81
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:19,840
Try and PM email validate.

82
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:25,700
We can try using this one.

83
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,900
So you can see that's a valid image.

84
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,660
That's true.

85
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,230
True.

86
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:36,580
But if it is not in the full format, then it will be false.

87
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,940
So it's a it's a basic to edit it so we can use that.

88
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:41,950
Let's copy that.

89
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:45,020
And it's so.

90
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:57,100
I guess once that is installed, we can input that in our control.

91
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,700
Import a email.

92
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,360
Validator from.

93
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,320
Even validates.

94
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:20,880
Now, you know we can use this.

95
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:30,120
So check for the van and even we'll take.

96
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:39,190
If not email validated or validate email.

97
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:44,510
So you can see this email validity gives us this function called validate and did that function?

98
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:48,470
We give our email and it will.

99
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,800
If it is true, it's region two.

100
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,350
Otherwise it's only false.

101
00:07:54,410 --> 00:08:03,980
If it is not true, then we want to send some kind of error message to return Response Edition.

102
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:11,810
We send error and that will be invalid email.

103
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:22,720
Next one we take for take email is taken because when they're trying to update the profile, they may

104
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,710
want to update the email that belongs to someone else.

105
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:35,830
So in that case, we have to stop that from happening and see if Emily is taken next one to ask for

106
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:37,240
length.

107
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:44,410
So if they're trying to object the password, we to make sure it is long enough and then we can go ahead

108
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,270
and start saving.

109
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,010
So if there's password, we have to has the password as well.

110
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:59,410
I guess to give the email is taken down existing ones to use a friend via email, try to find the user

111
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:00,130
by that email.

112
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:12,730
And if we find if exist exist and exist dot underscore already don't do.

113
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:19,990
String equals equals sequence user from db dot and industry.

114
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,870
So if the if we find the user.

115
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,190
Mm hmm.

116
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:25,120
By email.

117
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:26,830
We don't object.

118
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,660
However, there is one exception.

119
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:33,730
If this user is this user, then obviously we have to update.

120
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,540
Sort of what's happening here?

121
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:41,550
Not.

122
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:50,370
So I think if the image is taken now, this image would be taken.

123
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,160
For this currently logged news, obviously.

124
00:09:53,910 --> 00:10:00,900
So if exist and exist, it is not allowed to currently logged inside.

125
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,720
Then only then we send this error.

126
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,140
Mrs..

127
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,030
Don't respond to this animalistic thinking.

128
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,950
And then for password.

129
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:15,090
If password and password length is smaller than six.

130
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,030
The reason we have this one is first we make sure that we have the password.

131
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,770
Sometimes we use a may not be sending the password.

132
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,710
Maybe they just updating of all the information.

133
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,870
That time we didn't have to worry about password.

134
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:29,220
Right?

135
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,670
So that time we don't have to object anything.

136
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:37,740
But if we have received the password only then we want to make sure it is long enough.

137
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:49,410
I can then return response, duration and password is required and should be six characters long so

138
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,960
we can send that error message.

139
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:52,920
I guess.

140
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:58,410
So if all this validation pass, then we can go ahead and save the user.

141
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:03,060
All right, so before we save the user, we want to has the password.

142
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:14,820
So if there is password, so const has it has the password equals to again, we take if we had the password

143
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:20,040
if we have, then it has password.

144
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,060
So we have that function.

145
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,820
So we use that and give the plain password.

146
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,080
Password.

147
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,920
It's otherwise undefined.

148
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,310
So.

149
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:35,840
We don't have to make any changes for the users password.

150
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,440
And so if you have the password, then we has that.

151
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:43,960
And then.

152
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:48,950
We're going to object to user.

153
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:55,060
Oh let's put that result in the variable of did it enhance to avoid user

154
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:05,380
fine by I d and do it so we we find out

155
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,850
find valid that is the idea.

156
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,540
And then why do you do an object is here.

157
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,570
So what do you an update is?

158
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,830
Name that would be.

159
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:28,570
First we have to take.

160
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:36,030
So whenever we want to object, we have to make sure that that value is there.

161
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:39,480
For example, user might not want to update certain fields.

162
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,480
Maybe they want to update only one or two fields.

163
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,660
So in that case, we always have to be careful here.

164
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,170
So if name before we find bad idea an update we take.

165
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,540
So if name is this in the request morning.

166
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,620
If we have requested word in name, use that.

167
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:59,310
Otherwise the user's existing name.

168
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,000
Which is.

169
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,980
I use it from DVDs to whatever is his name.

170
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:07,750
We just continue using that, he said.

171
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,350
Email.

172
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:10,830
Email.

173
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:18,640
Also we use request border email if it is there.

174
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,390
If not.

175
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,060
User from database email.

176
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:27,750
Existing next one is password.

177
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:32,190
If it is password, we use the has Verizon has the password.

178
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,870
Otherwise the existing password.

179
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,030
Um.

180
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,530
The wolf said.

181
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,420
We do the same thing.

182
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,280
The rules.

183
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:48,690
We do the same thing.

184
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:50,550
Emails.

185
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:51,690
Also.

186
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:52,620
We do the same thing.

187
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,060
Okay.

188
00:13:58,690 --> 00:13:59,800
So that's how we update.

189
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,500
Now, when we update, we want to send this updated information as a response.

190
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:09,430
So we use new tool and then finally we can send this response.

191
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:16,780
Now, before we do that, let me just use dot populate and I want to populate the images.

192
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:24,550
Also, when we send this response, the response should contain the images and then response to this

193
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,510
and updated.

194
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,470
So we send.

195
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:35,050
All right, so this is how the admins should be able to update the user's profile.

196
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,070
Now we can go and give it a try.

197
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,450
And let's see.

198
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:48,070
Let's see how we get the object to use a response.

199
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:49,030
Let's come here.

200
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,700
Let's change this user.

201
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,290
We go to all users.

202
00:14:54,290 --> 00:15:00,020
Firstly, we try to update myself, Ryan the admin.

203
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,550
We've signed.

204
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,560
Now a little bit.

205
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:18,770
We're not getting any response.

206
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,670
But let me have a look into the net.

207
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,030
What?

208
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,070
I guess it looks like it is successful.

209
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:27,800
You can see

210
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,030
200.

211
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:32,450
Okay.

212
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:33,650
We got the response.

213
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,000
Beautiful.

214
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:36,890
We got the image idea as well.

215
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,850
Console the images.

216
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:52,980
This should have been populated, but otherwise everything looks good.

217
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,320
So we have the updated response.

218
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,220
I think we have issued the images.

219
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:08,710
You can see we're getting the I.D. we supposedly in depopulated images.

220
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:12,760
And I think that's because we did one mistake here.

221
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:23,000
In our model, user model, we have the images, but we have specified these two fields from the Guardian

222
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:23,450
URL.

223
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:29,630
Instead, what we need to do is we need to refer this to the media model because all the images will

224
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,900
eventually be coming from the media, right?

225
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,490
So they will be saved in the database.

226
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,850
So let me go to media.

227
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,210
Post.

228
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,040
So this is how that should be.

229
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:54,420
So just like we used featured themes for the post, it's going to be similar.

230
00:16:54,430 --> 00:17:00,370
So let's go to Model C user elements, try to update that one to image.

231
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,040
Give me just Scott based here.

232
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:05,720
Sorry.

233
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,500
Let me just got this part based here.

234
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:15,410
So this will be the type of object wherein it will refer to media model.

235
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:19,440
All right, so let's make this change and give it a try.

236
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,560
This time, it should work.

237
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:27,310
Let me pick one existing image and try that.

238
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:41,280
All right.

239
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,070
So we've got the response this time.

240
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:49,620
You can see the images has all this information, including the euro Beaufort.
