1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,460
So let's go all the way down.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:06,690
By the way, you told him that it's made dark, too good for hose.

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,720
I guess this is the example we want to use.

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,570
So let me click here, she recalled.

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,000
We had had a look at the consulate's copy.

6
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:24,480
Actually, instead of copying the everything, let me just copy the form again.

7
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,800
Because we already have the.

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:41,950
Component virtual it's the new swiftly it's Kobe the only good back kid in space that I guess you want

9
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:42,580
to save.

10
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,970
We need to make sure we have these imports.

11
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:49,240
So we need to import the form and.

12
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:53,240
Input and a button as well.

13
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:57,460
So let me go back to and let's see all the inputs.

14
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:02,050
So they this is where they have their input to make and to this copy.

15
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:05,800
This input to copy then.

16
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,210
I guess Alumina actually caught this as well.

17
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,740
Put all here.

18
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:19,650
Awesome.

19
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:22,380
Let's have a look.

20
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:23,970
Unfinished.

21
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,620
We need to have that function as well.

22
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,260
Let's write that const on finish equals two.

23
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:32,520
Oh, so.

24
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,340
And font.

25
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,310
This font gives us the value.

26
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:42,840
All right, so that's how we get the user input sorted with the type here in the form email password

27
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,080
that we will be receiving as values.

28
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,060
So that's what I was talking about it earlier.

29
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:54,720
We don't need to have our own state with and for we get the vendors like that.

30
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,000
So there's no need to have our own state.

31
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:08,120
I guess if we look into this, we can even try console long values.

32
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,320
We can have a look at these values.

33
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:15,620
Okay.

34
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:19,240
So you can see that we have this beautiful form out of the box.

35
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,410
Username.

36
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,100
Password.

37
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,690
Remember me?

38
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,520
Peter may know to use that to me a little bit.

39
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,140
We just want the sign up.

40
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,450
Oh, a link to log.

41
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,230
Right to.

42
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,010
We have the button and then a log and link.

43
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,970
So let me remove that.

44
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,710
Remember me a bit.

45
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,750
It's not a bad forward pass version of this.

46
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,730
We will have this feature, but not here on this basis.

47
00:02:54,730 --> 00:03:00,070
We will have it in the log base, log in.

48
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:06,130
Oh, which I won't actually have a land break here.

49
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,550
Everything goes down.

50
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,160
Beautiful.

51
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,460
So we got the name password.

52
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:18,180
Okay, so let's try to understand this form first so we can see from it as the name, class name.

53
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,010
Initial values.

54
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,020
So you can give initial values.

55
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,380
So by default it is empty, right?

56
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,910
But you going to give some initial values.

57
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:33,810
For example, we have the user name listed as to just name, I guess the name.

58
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,170
And you can see there are rules as well.

59
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,200
It's not mandatory, but if you have it, then you can show the error message.

60
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:47,950
If they try to submit form without entering the values, which is pretty cool.

61
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:52,360
So please enter, you know, let's see.

62
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,230
I guess if it is.

63
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:59,850
M.D. We saw this Mrs. and this field input field.

64
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,020
That's what you see here.

65
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,130
That's the input field.

66
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,260
And this field has the ICAM.

67
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:04,800
Right?

68
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,690
And the placeholder is in there so that.

69
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,040
Coming from here, sir.

70
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,830
The prefix with this item is outlined.

71
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,610
And the placeholder is the username.

72
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:16,780
All right.

73
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,080
Now send me the password.

74
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,040
We have the password.

75
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,600
The item.

76
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:32,000
And when you use the type password, it will automatically hide the inputs to you if you want to see

77
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:32,380
again.

78
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:37,660
So that in if you don't have any values, it'll get that error.

79
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,160
Mrs..

80
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:45,010
Same with the username if you make it empty so it will show you this warning.

81
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:45,790
It's pretty cool.

82
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:53,950
Now, we used to see the item here that we could allow the user to see the password that was.

83
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:58,930
I saw that in some of the examples and we just go all the way to the top.

84
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,090
So this one you can see the using this one.

85
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,160
So let's take it out how they did.

86
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,290
So the password.

87
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:16,530
The used input dart pass for you so that you can access this proper password.

88
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,790
So let's try using that.

89
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,030
So we've got the input dots.

90
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:24,990
Let's try using this.

91
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,260
I guess if you do that, you get that.

92
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,180
Beautiful.

93
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,110
So that's cool.

94
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,540
So you got the name password.

95
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,340
Let's add one more fill for email.

96
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,020
One more fill for email and let me think the documentation.

97
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:49,470
They might have the email specific input, which will look for the valid email format to be taken out.

98
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,520
They might have.

99
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,310
Name to who triggered this example?

100
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:05,210
Four.

101
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,660
So you've got the e-mail label, e-mail rules type email.

102
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:12,670
I guess if they didn't have.

103
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:16,960
Anything specific.

104
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,920
However, we can apply this to rituals.

105
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,510
Let's grab that rule.

106
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,320
I guess.

107
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,490
Let's go back.

108
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,680
So we got the name from Ida.

109
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,190
So we have to copy that.

110
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:37,620
So let me just paste this rule that it copied just so I can use it later.

111
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,510
From item to limit.

112
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,340
Copy this.

113
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,740
And just put it on.

114
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,920
I think I want to write a bit of commentary.

115
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,030
It's easy to read.

116
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:58,520
So this one's for the name, but this one's for Emile, which I'm going to paste here, and this one's

117
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,010
for posterity.

118
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,310
Just to make it a bit more easy to read.

119
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:09,000
Also, the email name will be email rules.

120
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:14,260
So the rules and I want to apply this rule for email.

121
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:23,530
That email server room we put here.

122
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:26,890
It's removed that and replaced with the one we copied.

123
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,560
Email soon.

124
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:35,490
User outlined placeholder email.

125
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:41,850
So this item for the email we can use, we can use this envelop.

126
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:42,750
Outline.

127
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,910
I think we have that.

128
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,650
I can tell it's important here.

129
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,260
Envelop

130
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:59,490
envelope outlined for me.

131
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,160
Copy that.

132
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:08,420
And for the E.M., it's a place that with this.

133
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,180
Looks like that one doesn't exist.

134
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,200
So it's always good to just search in.

135
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,250
Red envelop.

136
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:24,700
Okay.

137
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,780
So it's not even late.

138
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:29,170
It's called, I think, Messi's not Messi's.

139
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,990
This should be this should have.

140
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,130
Let's quickly have a look.

141
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,850
This should have some kind of four male.

142
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,730
Mail box type if I can.

143
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:49,290
This should have let me see what I used.

144
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,470
I guess that is the one.

145
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,400
Let me search you, Mel.

146
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,160
Okay, so that's the Mel outline.

147
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,600
So it's men and.

148
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,330
Thank you.

149
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:09,390
Thanks to the two men outlined.

150
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:09,870
Copy.

151
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,310
It's called the on top.

152
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,320
Replaced this one.

153
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,600
Beautiful.

154
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,220
All right.

155
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:29,560
So we got the phone name, email, password limit in place for this one for using name.

156
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,330
Send to name

157
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:34,510
the name.

158
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,210
All right, beautiful.

159
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,090
Let's see.

160
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,660
Let's have a look at the console.

161
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:46,710
Since this is and is an forms you can see on finished.

162
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:54,070
This function executes, it gets the values, and we can just access that without having our own state,

163
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,060
which is pretty cool.

164
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,130
Let's give it a try.

165
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,210
Let's try the name Brian.

166
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:00,820
Brian.

167
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:04,480
And okay, so we have the email format as well.

168
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:11,110
So if it is not email format, it will show that error message also.

169
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:13,300
All right.

170
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:17,080
So let's try and log in so you can see I'm console.log in the valley.

171
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,120
See, everything is coming up here.

172
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:26,080
If I come to Atari and click the button, you see, we have that form.

173
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,220
Guns along the valleys.

174
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,730
You can see we have access to the other info.

175
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,660
You have the name, email and password.

176
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,710
Beautiful.

177
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,510
This is good.

178
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:45,430
Now we can have the similar form, pretty much the similar form in the sand in bays as well.

179
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,220
So this will be for registration and another one will be for logging.

180
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:58,400
I guess that means I think we have to change this to register and this one, we make it look nice and

181
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,310
let's make it clickable as this when they click, we take them to sign in base.

182
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:03,980
All right.

183
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,030
So let's come here.

184
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:12,380
By the way, then once we have the sign in base as well, and then we'll come back and work on this

185
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,460
function.

186
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:19,310
So basically we can use X's to make a request to back in to send this data to the backend.

187
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:23,720
But before we even do that, we have to set up our own back in the API.

188
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:30,080
Otherwise, you know, we don't have any API server to send this data right now.

189
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:37,280
Building API from scratch is a lot of work, but there's a quick and easy solution, which I will be

190
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,470
showing you, which is very exciting.

191
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:40,950
All right.

192
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:51,030
So let's since this takes button takes to register and if they have already registered, they might

193
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,050
want to go log in.

194
00:11:52,070 --> 00:12:05,070
So it is to log in now and make it a clickable link to swiftly remove that since we are using and next

195
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:12,630
this was got we use the link component from next and paste this and get that.

196
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,980
So history will be here.

197
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:17,950
Simon.

198
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,850
Logan.

199
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,080
We take them to signing.

200
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:24,470
Now, let's not forget to import the link component as well.

201
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,080
Empowered Link from next.

202
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:35,610
I guess I did one mistake here that is I destructor.

203
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:42,550
If you're coming from the react rather if you have been using react with react by default, you might

204
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,570
destructor.

205
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:49,570
If you do that it will not work with this and you get some weird errors which can give you quite a lot

206
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,080
of headache.

207
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:55,150
I always make sure to just import like this because this a default export.

208
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,060
All right, so everything looks good.

209
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:03,650
We'll come back to this space once we have our service set up.

210
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,500
But at the moment, we're pretty much done with our sign up.

211
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:14,330
If you want to go to sign in, we have that same sign.

212
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,520
Let's work on the sign in as well.
