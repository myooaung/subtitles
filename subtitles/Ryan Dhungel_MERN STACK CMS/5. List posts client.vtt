00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.840
So we created the post API that returns on the post.

2
00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.530
So let's show them here.

3
00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:07.890
So let's all this post.

4
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:15.330
So to make a request to our server we need to use excuse and we're going to send a request to server

5
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.710
in our use effect function.

6
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:26.750
So in the component months we can make a request to let's import use effect who use state hook also

7
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.570
from.

8
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:30.350
React.

9
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:40.280
And then so when we get the post we want to put in the state, right, so we can have the posts in the

10
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.290
state posts said post.

11
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.800
It'll be the default array, the empty array by default and use effect.

12
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.420
It takes a function as an argument.

13
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.480
Second argument and theory.

14
00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.030
So here we want to make a request so we can write on the court here.

15
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.480
Or we can just refer to a function name.

16
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.460
So let's call it face posts.

17
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.860
I didn't just write that function.

18
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:24.210
You know, the beauty of this one is you can use it as you go it, because if you write here, you can

19
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.560
to use this input here.

20
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.240
He can do that.

21
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.350
So it's a huge effect.

22
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.790
So this is most cost for his post sequence to async try.

23
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.160
If there's an air concern.

24
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.690
So we use it's useless import that.

25
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.260
So we use the excuse to make a request that will give us the data.

26
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:05.580
We at the structure point excuse to get to make a get request to class posts.

27
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.670
And that gives us the data.

28
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.770
You can control of the data, but I'm pretty sure we get that.

29
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:20.820
So let's directly save it in the data, it out in the state and just have a look at them.

30
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:21.810
The two or three guns.

31
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:34.410
Foundation string fine data, assorted donor posts.

32
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.150
And it's, you know, and forth to make it more readable.

33
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.670
It's heavily beautiful.

34
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.720
Now, you can see here we have got all the posts of the duration of the post here.

35
00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:54.220
Awesome.

36
00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.700
All right, now what are we going to do?

37
00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.990
Is we not going to actually show the entire content here?

38
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.180
Because that's not necessary.

39
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.850
All you need to do is show the title and that that's pretty much it.

40
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.830
Maybe we use a slogan, otherwise we don't need a lot of this data.

41
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.010
So let's take out the finished version.

42
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.120
One step.

43
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:30.740
Architect to London.

44
00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:32.540
In London.

45
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.240
I'll post so you can see I'm just showing the post title.

46
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.070
I'm not seeing anything else.

47
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:52.480
So that means we could probably go to our back in the control function and remove all the populate that

48
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.230
we have used.

49
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.590
Right.

50
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.080
Because that's not being used here.

51
00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:03.410
However, they might be used a bit later, or maybe we use this endpoint to solve the post in our post

52
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.780
office.

53
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.590
So let's leave it like that for now.

54
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:11.430
But as you can see, we are actually not using a lot of the data that we get.

55
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:18.300
We just showing the post time and we have these two buttons that will allow the admin to edit and delete.

56
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.340
All right.

57
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.960
So let's continue here.

58
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.450
Let me just comment that out.

59
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.450
So here, let me actually to move that.

60
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:35.130
I'm going to use the list component from and designed to show this beautiful list of all the other posts.

61
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:42.360
Now for that, let's import list component from and.

62
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.900
And then let me also write to Francis.

63
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.000
We very soon begin to implement these pieces to edit and delete.

64
00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:02.070
So let me just put them here as a placeholder just so that we don't forget post and the edit equals

65
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.270
to async.

66
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:14.670
And then is copy this one and based yeah and Justin's the name from Kendall to handle delete.

67
00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.100
So we will be using these functions bit later.

68
00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:25.700
Let's leave them like this for now and come here and try to show the post in a list.

69
00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.330
Also, got the button.

70
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.460
We have the one heading.

71
00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:32.280
Stay here.

72
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.660
What we want to do is we want to use the list component.

73
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:45.570
List, some list, it takes the layout.

74
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.870
So which layout you want, you can use a horizontal vertical.

75
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.280
So we use horizontal.

76
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.000
We will try tending to vertical and see how this looks.

77
00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.330
Right.

78
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.550
It's a data source that's the most important.

79
00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.220
Once the data source is a.

80
00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.520
That's what we have in the state, the area of posts.

81
00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:09.270
And once you have the data source, you want to render it easier to render item.

82
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.100
That is the function of years.

83
00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.640
And there's the property in here, render item.

84
00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.240
We basically use the function.

85
00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.090
So you can see we're using our function.

86
00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.590
So it's the whatever data source you have, so is of that data.

87
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.120
Each one of them will be available here.

88
00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.530
So you can call them item, you can call them post, you can call them whatever you like to.

89
00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:32.760
Let's just call it item.

90
00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:33.870
Okay.

91
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:41.520
So this array is item from the array, you get access here and now you can add our render how you like.

92
00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:47.620
So we can use list item, even just to use symbol divisors of symbols.

93
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:48.620
DEGGANS.

94
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.920
Write your own.

95
00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.840
You know, you can extend the way you like.

96
00:06:55.290 --> 00:07:00.660
But let's stick with this list, item for list item.

97
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:01.770
Let me close that.

98
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:08.690
So each item.

99
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.910
So we have to show the name.

100
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:14.580
Right.

101
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.350
So we have to show the name, actually, the one we had here.

102
00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:18.770
All right.

103
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:20.630
List item don't matter.

104
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.190
Actually, we can use that.

105
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.350
So that's a self-closing component.

106
00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:28.230
So title, so we can give the title.

107
00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:32.160
So that would be item dot type icon.

108
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:34.280
So that will be the blank.

109
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:35.660
So the poster.

110
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:39.710
And then we can close this list time.

111
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:48.650
It's a render item.

112
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:51.320
We are showing the list item entitled this item.

113
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.170
We are showing the title and not just title.

114
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:56.690
We want to show these two items, edit and delete.

115
00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:59.960
As I said, let me come here.

116
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:06.050
Now you can see we already have the beautiful list in the list title.

117
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:07.070
We are showing the title.

118
00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:09.590
So these are the one we are currently working on.

119
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:10.670
This is the finished one.

120
00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.820
You can see the look, British, British time.

121
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.970
I have shown the total number of posters.

122
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.770
So this is something you can do here.

123
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.690
Post student

124
00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:30.100
you can call that post dot links.

125
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:35.180
All right.

126
00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:39.350
So we so that it's a beautiful space there.

127
00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:50.230
Style movies and don't listen to any sort of ten.

128
00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:55.110
Maybe 15.

129
00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:59.880
I guess that's that's okay.

130
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:01.580
So we have the list of posts.

131
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:05.520
Now let's show the I can edit and delete on the right end.

132
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.510
So for that, again, we used the list item.

133
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:24.390
So Adam can take accents and accents.

134
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.570
You can pass the array of items.

135
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:29.610
So it it is one item.

136
00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:33.320
I did it in another city in Boston, Missouri.

137
00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.530
So we can use an attack.

138
00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:45.400
For Ed and then another one.

139
00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:50.600
For, did it?

140
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:54.140
Now since we have two elements.

141
00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:57.960
We have to separate.

142
00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:01.590
So as you can see, this works exactly like a tree.

143
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:07.260
So in our unit you can have more items, but you have to separate with comma.

144
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.460
So that's how it works.

145
00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:10.150
I guess so.

146
00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:16.390
For Ed, when they click on the edit, we want to execute a function called handle edit and for delay

147
00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:17.790
we execute this one.

148
00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:19.690
So let's do that here.

149
00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:30.160
Only handle edit and actually we have to pass this item as the argument to that function.

150
00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:31.990
So we use arrow function here.

151
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:42.650
Handle edit and we have to pass the item so that we know which item we're trying to edit and for this

152
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:44.090
one the same thing.

153
00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:56.080
On the.

154
00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:00.850
All right.

155
00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:08.140
So you can see here render item, we are rendering the list item and here we have two elements.

156
00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:14.050
One is determine the is the item and this item has these accents.

157
00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:15.220
Edit delete.

158
00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:19.340
Let's have a look.

159
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:24.740
I guess they're here and we want them to be on the right end.

160
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:30.140
So what we can do here is probably apply some scissors.

161
00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:34.700
Okay, I just realized that these are the accents.

162
00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:41.020
They actually it doesn't require different list items, and they can be given in this skirt.

163
00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:43.370
All right, so I'm just.

164
00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:46.670
Carter, let me remove that so that can actually be him.

165
00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:54.680
So let's put them here so you can see list item and you just give accents to this item.

166
00:11:55.010 --> 00:12:02.350
That is the list item and that is the closing this element to basically want to have one item inside

167
00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.320
that is the title.

168
00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:08.330
And all these accents is a property you can use in this list.

169
00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:13.550
So I guess with Dentons now that that looks good.

170
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:16.250
Okay.

171
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:20.390
So we give the item, we can access them.

172
00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:29.540
So those items we get as an argument, we can call them item or we can call them post, we can just

173
00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:30.620
call anything, let's call.

174
00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:32.690
It was just so that makes sense.

175
00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:38.570
Post And let me just control for now Godzilla.

176
00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:45.790
All right.

177
00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:46.630
And then here.

178
00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:55.660
Okay.

179
00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.780
So we'll work on this one.

180
00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:05.680
So it will be pretty straightforward, but edit we're going to edit, we take them to a separate.

181
00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:08.860
So at the moment we just have the console.log.

182
00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:13.270
So let me see if I click edit.

183
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.760
You see?

184
00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:19.580
Edit post we have the post so we can do something.

185
00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:22.070
If we click delete, we have the post.

186
00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:25.730
We can do something so we can turn this idea back in to remove the post.

187
00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:31.130
But to edit we have to open up a new base.

188
00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:34.190
For example, let me show you the finished one so we have on this post.

189
00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:40.550
If they click edit, we have to take them to a separate page where they can edit the title, edit the

190
00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:49.340
content, edit the categories on that, and they will find it a bit and you'll lean back on the space

191
00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:51.020
with the updates.

192
00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:56.630
So we have to take them to a new place for edit, but delete will be pretty straightforward.

193
00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:58.310
So we will welcome these features.

194
00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:07.400
But before we do that, there is a need for us to lift our application state from local state to the

195
00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:08.180
global state.

196
00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:12.380
And I will explain to you why we had to do that in the next video.

197
00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:21.050
And then we're going to just upgrade our application from using local state to global state, not for

198
00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:23.480
everything, but for categories and post.

199
00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.860
It's going to be quite important.

200
00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:28.160
So I'll explain to you why we had to do that in the next few.
