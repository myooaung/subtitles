1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:07,200
All right, so let's log in as this hates the root and we need the IP address, which you must have

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,070
answered.

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,690
This is the one to copy that.

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:12,690
Based here.

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,170
So we're going to log in by using our services.

6
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:23,300
Or so it will ask you, Are you sure you want to continue continuing?

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,380
You just say yes.

8
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:25,460
Hit enter.

9
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:28,250
Okay.

10
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:29,720
Now you need to give the password.

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:30,860
I'm pretty sure you have.

12
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,280
You remember your password you used earlier in this global.

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:44,780
Again.

14
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:45,490
That's from.

15
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:50,820
Okay.

16
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,280
So you can see I'm logged in as a root.

17
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,560
So the first thing you want to do is you don't want to continue using the root.

18
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,360
This is not recommended for security reasons.

19
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:06,720
So you're going to create a new user, you're going to create a new admin user.

20
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:13,110
First, you going to just go to user and then give him a role of admin and then you will every time

21
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:18,880
you log in, next time you will log in as that user instead of root user again.

22
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,390
So follow these steps line by line and be very careful with this.

23
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,390
And if you miss one step, things can go wrong, right?

24
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:35,460
So this is the first step we did that logging basis is now add new user because you don't want to continue

25
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,420
using root user.

26
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,710
So add user and you can give this user any name.

27
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,180
Here.

28
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,250
I have given the name FSA admin.

29
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,530
Probably here.

30
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,500
I want to give the name.

31
00:01:59,270 --> 00:01:59,630
Let's.

32
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,060
Let's use the same name, so it's much easier.

33
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:06,080
All right, so we added this new user, FSM, right?

34
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:11,510
So given password, you can continue using the same password that you created earlier if you want to

35
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,300
do so that it's easy to remember.

36
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,340
So retype that one more time.

37
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:27,400
Okay.

38
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:31,300
Now, these questions you don't have to answer so you can just hit.

39
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,540
Enter, enter, enter.

40
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,080
Enter.

41
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,090
Enter and hit type Y and hit enter.

42
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,500
Perfect.

43
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:45,570
Now this new user has been added by the name of Eva's admin.

44
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,500
Now just adding the new user doesn't make any difference to this user.

45
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,560
We need to give him the admin ability.

46
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:52,870
Right?

47
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,680
So make this new user admin, make him admin.

48
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,760
And this is the command to make admin to user mode.

49
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,700
There's a D.

50
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,490
Studio if as Ed.

51
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:13,670
So this user has become the admin user.

52
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,120
So not yet added admin to the sudo users list.

53
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,850
So sudo basically means superuser.

54
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,090
So added to the sudo users list.

55
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:32,150
So sudo as u f is admin.

56
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:34,370
Okay.

57
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:39,280
Now, this admin, this user is the admin user now.

58
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,120
I guess that means we can nix them from next time.

59
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,590
We can log in as this user and not a root user.

60
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:55,040
Instead, we should disable the log in ability for this user for security reasons.

61
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:55,790
All right.

62
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:00,590
So here you can see try exit and log in as FZ to see if it works.

63
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,570
So first you want to make sure it works.

64
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:09,290
Then if it works, then you want to remove this root user and log in as the.

65
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:18,260
FSA admin this new user for from now on from every time you try logging again.

66
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:18,610
All right.

67
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,620
So let's try first.

68
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,370
Let's try to control C one more time

69
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:30,280
controlled C, I think I have to try it.

70
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:31,390
Okay.

71
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:32,830
One more time.

72
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,520
I did.

73
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:34,990
I guess I'm out.

74
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,760
He can see I'm out.

75
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,020
Clear.

76
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:38,860
Everything all right?

77
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,630
So let's try again one more time.

78
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:49,750
Now, this time, instead of a route, we want to log in as if as admin the new user with admin draw

79
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:50,710
that we created.

80
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,000
I could give the password.

81
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:02,600
Okay.

82
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,230
So that's crude.

83
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:06,200
You can see you can log in as this user that squared.

84
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:09,170
Now the next thing you want to do is remove the root user.

85
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,140
So root user cannot log in.

86
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,320
That's recommended to remove root user.

87
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:27,860
So we have to go to this file and make some changes so you can do sudo vim espace and then s+ etc..

88
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,930
SS hates ss hates d config.

89
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:39,320
So we have to go to this file and we need to give the password.

90
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:45,020
Okay.

91
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:53,920
Now this file you can see to edit this file, you can press a, press a, then you see this, insert

92
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:00,170
word and then you can use up and down, right and left arrow keys to navigate around.

93
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:07,430
So go all the way down until you find the line that says Permit root, logon and turn that from yes

94
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:07,940
to not.

95
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,520
So let's go all the way down and you can see permit route logging it is currently.

96
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,740
Yes let's change that to no.

97
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,910
No, no.

98
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:27,340
Once you make any changes into this file to save and exit, you can use the escape.

99
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:33,610
You can person that escape tab in a keyboard and then colon.

100
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,120
W.

101
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,720
Q This is really important to you.

102
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,910
You want to remember that again?

103
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,290
I have written that here as well.

104
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:43,580
Thank you.

105
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:51,100
Now, to make sure the all your changes were successfully applied, you can try this, I guess.

106
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,800
Let's try a pseudo service.

107
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,560
SS heads restart.

108
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,900
I guess it has been restarted.

109
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:02,910
That means the.

110
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,620
What the changes you've made that is applied.

111
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,000
No.

112
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:12,960
So now if you tried to log in as a root user, you shouldn't be shouldn't be able to log in.

113
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,120
So you might want to give that a try.

114
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:18,600
Let's try that exit again.

115
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,860
Now, let me try again.

116
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:28,050
Just use I've been known Iraqis to go to the previous commands and let me try log in as root user.

117
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,610
Let's see if I can still logging.

118
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:38,840
Okay.

119
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,460
You can seek permission denied.

120
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,860
So that meant with root user, I cannot log in anymore, which is great.

121
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:50,870
Now let's try and log in as the the admin user episode.

122
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:00,630
And we can log in.

123
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,500
That is perfect.

124
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:08,050
Now, next thing you want to do is push your local projects.

125
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,780
You have two projects.

126
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,490
One is the server.

127
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,200
One is the client of both projects.

128
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,170
You want to push to GitHub.

129
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,350
That way we push from our local to our local computer.

130
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,150
We push this code to GitHub.

131
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:28,040
And from GitHub we will pull that code to digital also.

132
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:28,830
Okay.

133
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,270
And this is what you will be doing every time later when you make some changes, when you make some

134
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,440
updates to your code.

135
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,150
You will do the same thing.

136
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:43,020
You will post, make the comment, the changes to GitHub, post the changes to GitHub, and then you

137
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:46,860
will pull that changes from this license over here.

138
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:47,700
Okay.

139
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:54,060
So that means we need to create git repository for client and server.
