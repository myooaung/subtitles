1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:00,810
All right.

2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,420
So we have been able to resize the image in the grand total.

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,200
We have got the best 64 format of the image.

4
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:10,080
So let me just control over the name of that.

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,330
It's remove the written keyword.

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,490
So we going to send this base64 format and the image to the backend.

7
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:19,060
And.

8
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:25,730
Then that way it will be returned to the air and will be returned.

9
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,420
So we have to make sure it is dirty.

10
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:29,860
Yara.

11
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:30,860
I guess so.

12
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:33,330
Hopefully it will not.

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:40,600
And then so this year, all of the uploaded images will be saved along with the post.

14
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:49,240
Okay, so let's go to the back end and create this endpoint so that we can upload the images to ordinary.

15
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:54,400
So I'm not sure if we have already signed up to Cardano.

16
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,660
Let's go to EMV.

17
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:57,820
And we haven't.

18
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:58,540
So we.

19
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,220
Do have the key for SendGrid for uploading.

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:04,700
Sorry.

21
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,570
Sending email.

22
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:09,290
But we didn't have the one for cloud in every.

23
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:12,150
Okay.

24
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,880
So let me just read that here.

25
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,700
So we need to go and sign up to cloud an area.

26
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,760
And when we sign up to cloud native, we get the cloud name

27
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,450
cloud generally let's call it name.

28
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,450
Next one will be key.

29
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:36,890
And then the secrets.

30
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,790
That's a key.

31
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,620
It's good to sign up, get these values.

32
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,360
We can sign up for free.

33
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,540
Get these values so that we can start uploading to coordinate.

34
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:03,380
I do have the account, but I'm going to create a new account just for this cause.

35
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,480
Um, Claudia and Erin.

36
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,160
So I'm going to use that image that I used previously for.

37
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,510
Simply.

38
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,620
This might be a bit of a long process.

39
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,920
So if you have already signed up to Cloud Generic, you can skip to the next letter.

40
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,980
What I will be doing is I will be just putting my name key and secret by the end of this video.

41
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:41,800
So if you have already signed them to clarity, you can grab these values and put them here and continue

42
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,700
with the next lecture.

43
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,360
All right.

44
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,360
So let's go ahead all together.

45
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:48,520
Right.

46
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,330
So the email I'm using is mine.

47
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:55,640
See?

48
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:56,200
Seeing this.

49
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:00,990
I saw.

50
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,160
Oh.

51
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:28,980
Most content.

52
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:29,340
All right.

53
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,630
Hmm.

54
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:48,620
Oh.

55
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:49,850
Oh, thank God.

56
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,000
All right, I take the e-mail.

57
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,350
Also got the email.

58
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,580
Let's click on this one.

59
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:02,450
Sign in to validate the email address.

60
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:10,980
Okay.

61
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:14,660
So the cloud name is also here, but we can grab on that from.

62
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:17,690
The desperate township went too long in.

63
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,120
You should be landing on the dashboard.

64
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:25,750
So.

65
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:28,830
Okay.

66
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,580
So here.

67
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,620
You need to go to the decimal.

68
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:40,350
I go to the desperate and call me the cloud name put here to that cloud name.

69
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,140
Make sure don't have any special anything here.

70
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:44,430
Right.

71
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,320
Cloud name API key.

72
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,550
Copy that key.

73
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:54,940
Put it here and the API secret and need to copy that and put it here.

74
00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:02,410
Now these values, of course, you don't want to show it to the public because they can use you according

75
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:02,800
to this.

76
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,470
But I'm showing you because I trust in you guys.

77
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:13,750
And I will be hopefully if I don't forget, I will be deleting the the key.

78
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:14,620
All right.

79
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,160
So try not to use this value.

80
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:19,300
Okay.

81
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:19,820
So good.

82
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,010
The name key and secret.

83
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,170
So that is all we need to start using.

84
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,180
Ordinary, which is awesome.

85
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:31,210
Now, one more thing we need that is we need to install new in our server.

86
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:36,640
So let's stop that and NBN to continue.

87
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,490
Make sure you don't have any typos.

88
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:39,670
You.

89
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,090
So what is happening?

90
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,990
Let's go and create a road.

91
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:50,390
All right.

92
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:55,670
And, yeah, so we need to make sure that we restart the server.

93
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,940
But as you can see, we have to start it anyway.

94
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:04,700
Start the server and let's go to route.

95
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:17,480
So we need to create a new road for posts, write blogs, blog, post, post, whatever we like to call

96
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:17,560
it.

97
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:23,770
If I use the name post, we will be using post name quite a lot, so please don't get confused.

98
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,040
Right

99
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,940
posts don't test

100
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:37,350
cylinders, just copy some of these file from category and put in the post just to make things a bit

101
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:37,780
easier.

102
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,990
So we got to import express x.

103
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:43,450
Sara we may need these middle words and leave them here.

104
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:47,840
Controller let me remove all that.

105
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,790
Controllers will be forced control.

106
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:56,410
Limit this common that out for now and we're just going to have one drought for now and that is going

107
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:06,250
to be upload is required sign in so it should be only for the logged in user and the user have to be

108
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,450
admin at the moment.

109
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:14,920
Later, we will allow the author as well, but at the moment just admin and let's call it upload.

110
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:18,970
Here is I guess we need to create this control function.

111
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:23,470
We can put that here and control us first.

112
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:28,690
Now we need to go ahead and create this file.

113
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:34,960
All right, so let's go controllers with new file post start to use.

114
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,700
Export combs.

115
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,370
Popular music comes from async.

116
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,690
Request response.

117
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:49,520
Try.

118
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,970
Cats are going to love the air.

119
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:09,070
Now, before we actually upload the image to Cloud Native, we need to configure clouds in areas so

120
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,810
that we can start using it, right?

121
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:16,630
So we going to configure using the values that we have in the and we find the name key and secret.

122
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,880
So first, let's import that baggage.

123
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,300
We.

124
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,090
Insert.

125
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:35,780
Found a new front go delivery and we're going to config load in every supply ordinary config.

126
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,710
So config this function we passed this value.

127
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:45,630
So cloud name.

128
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,140
All right.

129
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,130
A battle the process took in.

130
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:55,570
We don't count in every name.

131
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:57,610
All right.

132
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:02,110
So let me just copy this one more time based here and one more time.

133
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,570
So next one will be cloud and area.

134
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,550
Also API key.

135
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,860
Make sure you use the same name here.

136
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,360
So that's a code name.

137
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,300
That's API key and it's is here.

138
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,100
We called it key.

139
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,550
Next one is FBI secret.

140
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,970
And that is echoed in every secret.

141
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:36,820
That is all we need to start using plugged in every awesome.
