1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:00,660
All right.

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:07,530
So you can see we have only six comments here in the admin dashboard, even though we have more than

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:07,980
six.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,040
That's because we are sending only six at a time.

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,650
We have implemented the pagination.

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,100
So if you want to load more, you have to click on the button, right?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,080
And that button will increment the value from 1 to 2.

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,560
And then whenever this value changes, you want to run the code that will fit the comments.

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:39,210
So we can use use effect, we can create a function to fix the comments based on this value, right?

10
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,440
So whenever the value changes by button click, we will execute on the code.

11
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:50,460
So let's, let's create another user to use effect

12
00:00:53,880 --> 00:01:00,390
and the dependency here is going to be B, so whenever the page changes, we want to run the code here.

13
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,810
However, at the very beginning, by default it is one.

14
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:14,280
So by default you don't want to run this function only when the value is bigger than one, then you

15
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:14,850
want to run.

16
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:23,340
Okay, so first we take if is a consequence equals one, which is two by default.

17
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:30,160
So when the piece gets gets loaded, you don't want to run this use effect.

18
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,590
So if base equals you can see this one return, don't do anything.

19
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,830
Otherwise we want to learn more.

20
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,370
If Page is not one that is between changes we want to.

21
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:50,330
Our normal post here, similar to how we did to the token.

22
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,590
If you have the token, then load more.

23
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:03,620
So that means we have to clear this function, load more that will load more comment to basically make

24
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:07,420
the same request but with a different value.

25
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,750
So what we can do.

26
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,350
You can read that he finds loads more.

27
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:24,930
Charlie, I just realized you may not even need another front, and maybe we can use the same face comments,

28
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:30,400
because you can see who it is taking the base value, wherever that is.

29
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,220
So we can use it.

30
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,010
We can use the Fed's comments.

31
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:40,780
The only thing we need to do here is instead of a sitcom and whatever you want to keep the previous

32
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,960
values if previous comments, if it was that.

33
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,130
Thank you.

34
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:49,960
So here, let's use away from it.

35
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:55,000
I guess a previous comment if it was there you can to leave it there and then.

36
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,320
You want to add the new array of comments which you will get here?

37
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,170
I said that would be just done.

38
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:05,970
All right.

39
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:11,050
So we should be able to do this when the base changes.

40
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:19,660
Anything other than one we face again, face additional data and then put in the commentary.

41
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:22,310
All right.

42
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,470
So let's use a button that will increment the base.

43
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:33,290
Thanks to this in comments more than one we run.

44
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,450
So let's try that.

45
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,280
Let's create that bond.

46
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,480
So we have this rule.

47
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,990
Let me create another rule at the very end.

48
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:49,300
Create a call to the school.

49
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:54,430
Spend 20 full time

50
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,350
on the center to text.

51
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,070
Text a line center.

52
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,020
Okay, so here we're going to set a button.

53
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,920
Toilet load?

54
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:17,710
No.

55
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:27,060
And when this button is on quick, we want to increment the base

56
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:30,150
set.

57
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,480
So whatever value it's under there, plus one.

58
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,140
Okay.

59
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:43,250
So this button we can give the size let's use last.

60
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:49,220
We want the last button type primary loading.

61
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,310
When it's loading, we want to disable this loading.

62
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,160
Okay.

63
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,920
Let's give it a try.

64
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,210
So this button is clipped.

65
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:02,510
We increment the best value when the base value increments.

66
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:11,450
We run this aggressive face comment function that will fix the comments, put in the commentary.

67
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:13,850
All right.

68
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:20,990
I guess something happened here, and it's good to kind.

69
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:27,980
I guess we have six posts and we have this launch button if I click here.

70
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,300
Nothing's happening.

71
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:37,270
All right, so let's have you send the best one.

72
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,720
So in tennis, we run.

73
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,690
This should be more than one.

74
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,190
Let me.

75
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:58,370
Let me just put you based in the survey and see the value we have.

76
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:03,080
So we have the base for five six suits.

77
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:03,930
X is enough for.

78
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:14,750
Okay.

79
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:21,500
So I just realized I forgot to exclude the function, which is a silly mistake.

80
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,190
You see here.

81
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,680
I forgot to have the parentheses.

82
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,270
So it was never executed.

83
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:30,950
All right, so maybe the students come here to reload.

84
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,330
So we have the normal one.

85
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,200
We have six post.

86
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:44,950
If I click here, this six is loaded, try again and over six and then there are normal post.

87
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,210
But we still showing this.

88
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,550
Now that's not how it should be working.

89
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,410
Now for this one, obviously we can use the one more request to back in to get the total comments that

90
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:01,390
we have, I guess if the total comments we have in the back end.

91
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:03,070
Is.

92
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,840
Less than what we have in the state.

93
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,180
Then we show the Lord Mountbatten.

94
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,350
Otherwise we don't saw.

95
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,100
All right.

96
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:15,380
So for that reason, we have already created that end point in the back end.

97
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:20,690
So let's go and execute that function.

98
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:31,020
So I can put that here to get the total counts of the government's crunched can total equals to.

99
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:39,890
All right.

100
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:45,060
So we can make a request to get the total comments slice.

101
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:53,070
I think we called comment comments, comment comment that will use the data which will have the numeric

102
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,320
value, how many comments we have in the backend.

103
00:07:55,650 --> 00:08:00,390
And we can execute this function in our very first to use effect.

104
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,250
So we can execute that here.

105
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:12,070
Since we know that we have to two lines we can just wrapped in a corridor.

106
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,500
If we make a request.

107
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:16,670
All right.

108
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,980
So now we should have the total as well.

109
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:20,570
We should have the total.

110
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:23,870
Now, let's use that to conditionally.

111
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,600
So this button.

112
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,660
Not just the button we can at home.

113
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:39,450
We can put it, put the entire row, I guess here we take if the base

114
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,680
multiplied by six.

115
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,840
So each time we are sending six, we are receiving the six comments.

116
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,080
Right?

117
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:53,470
So this number should matter how many are returning from a back end.

118
00:08:53,940 --> 00:09:01,170
So if you turn this 200, then you want to change this 200 new back in as it portrays value in our control

119
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:07,050
support base multiply by six if that is smaller than total.

120
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:09,450
Okay.

121
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:15,000
If that is true, then we saw this row which has this button.

122
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,190
Thank you.

123
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,600
So in that code, let's have a look.

124
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,750
Now you can see the bottom is not there.

125
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,270
Let me reload on my time.

126
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:26,310
Okay.

127
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:27,330
So Button is not here.

128
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:37,230
Let me just have a look at space and then.

129
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:39,910
Right.

130
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,110
So we have the page one total is zero.

131
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,310
So engineering the total.

132
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,810
Comet count for four.

133
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:52,700
Okay.

134
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,230
I think we made a typo here.

135
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:55,160
Count.

136
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,000
Oh, sorry.

137
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,250
That's got.

138
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,240
Okay.

139
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,870
No, no, no, no.

140
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:12,040
And then no more, because that's what we have.

141
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:12,480
Beautiful.

142
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,490
I guess that's one grade.

143
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:16,300
Let's.

144
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:23,060
Let's go back to comments.

145
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,160
So here, what I want to do is remove that.

146
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:28,760
Yeah.

147
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:31,630
Okay.

148
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:36,040
Now, the next thing we want to do is show the edit and delete.

149
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,610
I can see.

150
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,340
In fact, we just sort of delete icons, so admin will not be editing so we can destroy the data.

151
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,770
