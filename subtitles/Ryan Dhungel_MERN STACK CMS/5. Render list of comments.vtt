00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.330
So now that we have the array of comments, let's render them using a list component.

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.890
Let's go to slug.

3
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.160
Let's import list from and.

4
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.080
So let's come down and then remove that.

5
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.180
This is train fire.

6
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.230
And here it's used at least.

7
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:42.570
To list item layouts and layouts can be horizontal and data source.

8
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.220
So that's going to be.

9
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.870
Comments.

10
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.550
All right.

11
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:55.920
So we have comment in the states that that's not a source render the render item.

12
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.150
So we want to render.

13
00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.640
We want to render.

14
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.500
So we get each item.

15
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:11.040
It's comment here and we can render them just like using render DV.

16
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.740
You can do that or you can use list item.

17
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.310
This item.

18
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:22.450
And here.

19
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.530
First, let's give the IED.

20
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.600
Idea key.

21
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.730
I think it should be key.

22
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:43.460
Key item on the underscore I.D. So here we want to show the comment.

23
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.570
Right.

24
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.620
Actually comments we can use this item matter to render then.

25
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.250
So here let's use title isolated description.

26
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:04.430
Description that would be item is coming to an item dot.

27
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.060
Content.

28
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.040
So let's have a look.

29
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.480
You can see we have the two comments they already here.

30
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:16.110
Beautiful.

31
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.250
Let's add a bit of a gap here.

32
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.330
I can even use dear Steve.

33
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.170
Style margin, bottom 50 was in the bottom.

34
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.700
It's a bit of a gap now.

35
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.000
Let's render the comments like this one.

36
00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.980
This is the finished product so we can sue the user avatar.

37
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.620
We just pick the first character from the user name.

38
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.300
So we use the avatar there.

39
00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:56.080
So the user's name and then the comment and when it was create the date.

40
00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.530
So let's render it like this looks nice.

41
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:02.410
So here

42
00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.610
I am content.

43
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.590
That's a description of title.

44
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.110
Title, we can use the user's name.

45
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.620
So the title we can use.

46
00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.270
I don't.

47
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.270
Posted by dog name.

48
00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.330
We saw the username.

49
00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.510
Beautiful and we want to use the avatar as well.

50
00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:47.390
So it's used that we can use that in the meta avatar so we can use the avatar component.

51
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:58.920
And since we're not using the actual limits, if in that case we could use SBC, but we just want to

52
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:12.030
show the the letter, the first name of the user so we can access that using item posted by the name.

53
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:18.300
And I want to grab the first character only so I can use the name.

54
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:25.980
If the name is there, then get character and use the character add function and.

55
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.160
We're going to have to do the very question.

56
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.580
Thank you.

57
00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.360
So that's the avatar.

58
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.130
Give the name, we get the content and we want to solve the debt now.

59
00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.890
So let's have a new avatar.

60
00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.350
We don't have to import that.

61
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:54.120
All right.

62
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.750
That's good.

63
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.010
Get the avatar.

64
00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.170
You get the user name comment.

65
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.180
Let's make sure we have.

66
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.560
We should recruit date.

67
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.040
Make this.

68
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.190
For that.

69
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.590
We can use that basis.

70
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:09.630
It's come down.

71
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.860
So that to go along with the description to description.

72
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:30.240
Let me put it in the back Dix matrix and use it as a variable item content.

73
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.610
That's the created did.

74
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.550
So again, we use daisies, we give the date.

75
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:48.360
That is, I don't create that and we use this function from now.

76
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.460
That's what gives us that human readable date.

77
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.130
From now.

78
00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.790
That is item two, that from now.

79
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.900
Maybe we need to plug in four.

80
00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.580
And so the data is.

81
00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.760
It would need the related time period for next Sunday's.

82
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:21.080
Yes.

83
00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:22.470
We don't have time for that.

84
00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.030
It's hundred of them in bold.

85
00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.470
That one is.

86
00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:36.920
Related.

87
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:37.300
Time.

88
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:43.940
From.

89
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.860
There is this mass blogging class related to.

90
00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:59.610
You'll see this information in the official document decent annual visit to the docs of diseases to

91
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:00.380
which you have been to.

92
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.150
We have to use.

93
00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:11.320
Using data is to an extent related to.

94
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:15.550
All right.

95
00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.730
So with that, it works.

96
00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:21.850
And we have this beautiful format.

97
00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:27.610
We have the user name avatar content to comment and then the time.

98
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:36.660
Now we can create and render comments.

99
00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:41.880
Ain't it beautiful?

100
00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:51.980
Now, one more thing we can do here is make this button disabled when if they're trying to submit empty

101
00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:57.110
modify so we can go to comment form button loading.

102
00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:10.130
And disabled, we can seven the button if the content comment equals 70 plus empty.

103
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.360
I guess disabled.

104
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:18.050
But when I start typing it is not disabled.
