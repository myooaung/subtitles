1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:00.690
All right.

2
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.710
So we need to create the endpoint in our back, in SLAs, contacts.

3
00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:05.280
Let's go.

4
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.200
It's good to our server.

5
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.910
And I'm actually going to create a neuro because let's call it a website or two.

6
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.720
So here I'll put that contact and point.

7
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.990
And also later we will be customizing the pages.

8
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:32.400
For example, you saw the homepage, you homepage, the title subtitle can be changed from the decimal.

9
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.010
So for doing things like that.

10
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.690
And this the same concept you can apply for other businesses as well.

11
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.130
So this concept.

12
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.620
You can expand on this one, even control the content.

13
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.400
How are you going to render all of that?

14
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.950
So for things like this, I will be.

15
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.670
Of.

16
00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:02.810
Pulling all my roots for doing we've said related stuff here in this website is right here.

17
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.630
First let's import xmas guns.

18
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.700
X equals two.

19
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:15.500
Actually we can use the import import express from express.

20
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:25.540
And then we use points to round up equals to extra staff from.

21
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.430
And then we can create our own.

22
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.660
So, Aurora.

23
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.490
Do I get to make a good request to?

24
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:38.270
Content.

25
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.720
In fact, it is post request, post content.

26
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:48.950
So whenever we get requests to this end point, we use a function contact.

27
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.190
Okay.

28
00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.450
So let's import that from control

29
00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:57.540
context.

30
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.460
Context from.

31
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.500
So I'm going to create this folder.

32
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.120
Kunst puts her in.

33
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.200
Not quite simple.

34
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.590
So I made crude this file in a controller and we ran this function there.

35
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.800
Or let's make sure to import and export.

36
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:29.080
For drama.

37
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.760
And then let's make sure to import here in our entry point.

38
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.710
I think it it's important.

39
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.650
I set out from.

40
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.310
That's what they've said.

41
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.530
And then we applied these ads and middleware.

42
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.640
Yeah.

43
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.800
I'm and to use.

44
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.790
Every sentence is important.

45
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.240
Make sure to apply a malware impulse here.

46
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.540
I guess once that's done we can go to our control and the contact function.

47
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:17.020
The controllers knew fun with Scientologists and then we can right here extreme concepts.

48
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.710
Website thanks to async requests for response.

49
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:44.100
Here.

50
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.370
First, you need to make sure you have the.

51
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.020
Sing with kids in secret.

52
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.630
I guess I will show you how you can get that.

53
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.910
You can go to SendGrid Dotcom, sign up, get the API keys and put them here.

54
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.140
This is important.

55
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.080
And don't expose it to anyone because once it is exposed, for example, in GitHub, it will not work.

56
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:08.760
You have to generate a new one.

57
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.840
All right.

58
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.500
So we're going to use this and that is something we have already done.

59
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.080
In other places as well.

60
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.640
So you can have a look at the code example.

61
00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:28.420
For example, if you go to us, go all the way to the top, you can see we have use and we like that.

62
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:34.210
So if you want to copy that, you could also put it in some other file in this import entry.

63
00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.150
You could do that.

64
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.690
So let's continue here.

65
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:43.110
Okay.

66
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:54.690
So we import SendGrid and pass the keys using the said EPA key that will make the SendGrid mail function

67
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.670
ready for us to use.

68
00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.420
All right.

69
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.080
So here to send an email using SendGrid.

70
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.920
It's really easy.

71
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.700
First, we need to structure our data.

72
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.050
How we're going to send email.

73
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.760
Because when do we want to send the email?

74
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:17.940
We need to have the phone field from where the email is sending to, to which end it's going subject

75
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.310
of the email and then the body, which can be written as has Tim.

76
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.470
So once you have all that data, you can use send with direct send function to send an email.

77
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.070
All right.

78
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:35.490
So first, we will be receiving the data in the request body.

79
00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:36.060
Right.

80
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.630
So this is the slowest contact route.

81
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.200
And if you go to your front end contact form.

82
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.670
Content from what is this doing here?

83
00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.810
Components contact from.

84
00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.050
Is also.

85
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.600
Contact form is here.

86
00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.360
Contact find.

87
00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:16.690
I was going to use this component, but I think I put everything in the contact with.

88
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.460
Inside pages.

89
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:22.200
Contact.

90
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:22.550
Okay.

91
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.200
I think have put everything.

92
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.060
If you want, you can always move this to contact, from which we may do a bit later.

93
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.580
All right, let's continue like this.

94
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:32.810
So, contact.

95
00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:36.020
We have this form.

96
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:43.740
You can see we make a request and we send in the values as a second element that will contain the name,

97
00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:44.970
email and messages.

98
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.250
All right.

99
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.100
So we received that in our control.

100
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:53.880
We can do structure of those fields and name.

101
00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:55.590
Male.

102
00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.060
Mrs. May received from the rigorous body.

103
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:01.590
Once again.

104
00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:05.160
Then let me just send this to.

105
00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:07.320
We didn't need that.

106
00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:08.670
Yeah.

107
00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:20.880
Prepared emails and seconds email data equals to the subject here.

108
00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:21.930
I'm going to prepare.

109
00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:31.770
I'm going to send an email to like I said from a need from that will be this from it too is really important

110
00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:39.630
I guess so from a to both will be you verified email that you verified earlier in SendGrid thank you

111
00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:45.540
so verified the email we got the key and you chose the email which was verified.

112
00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:49.770
So it has to be the same email sending and receiving.

113
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:55.140
That might sound a bit weird, but that's what we have to do.

114
00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:57.660
Poster.

115
00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:02.100
Ian Winter The reason for that is precedent in don't email from.

116
00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:09.330
The reason for that is for example let's say you have a website and you have a contact contact with

117
00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:17.460
people come here enter the name email misses this summit so this information you will receive in your

118
00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:17.850
email.

119
00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:21.810
However, the front will not be the email address of this.

120
00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:26.180
Use it, I guess to be this email has nothing to do.

121
00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:31.890
This email will not actually be responsible for sending an email.

122
00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:32.430
Right.

123
00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:40.590
So the email that is responsible is this one and the sender will actually send an email.

124
00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:45.910
But SendGrid wants us to have verified email, so we use this thing.

125
00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:52.590
So that's from and then do also obviously it's the human that's where you want to receive the contact

126
00:08:52.590 --> 00:09:01.230
from whenever someone submits to that means to also will be sent to also persistent email.

127
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:04.510
So in we don't email from.

128
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:06.630
So what will be.

129
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:09.200
Same.

130
00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.000
Both will be same.

131
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:17.420
If you wanted it to be different, you could probably use different.

132
00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.800
But we just use.

133
00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:22.320
Okay.

134
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:23.400
So subject.

135
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:25.640
Subject.

136
00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:28.270
We can call it email.

137
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.120
Email received.

138
00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:36.910
From contact, from that subject and then body.

139
00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.320
We can write his team email.

140
00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:43.410
Let's use bektic so we can write multi-line here.

141
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.040
Let's use hitting three.

142
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:57.630
And he had every right contact from the masses.

143
00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:01.140
And he had let me use paragraph.

144
00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:06.400
Paragraph.

145
00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:09.370
Let's remember that she's owned land.

146
00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:15.010
And so the name.

147
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.860
The name's going to be the actual user's name.

148
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:24.480
All right, so that's what we get in the request body.

149
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:27.890
Now.

150
00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:29.870
Next one, the email.

151
00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:38.170
Again, we can use underscore underline for that just so that it highlights nicely and we show the user

152
00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:38.430
in.

153
00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:40.150
Next one.

154
00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:41.900
Mrs..

155
00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.420
We can sue the Mrs..

156
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:44.950
Right.

157
00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:45.890
So let's.

158
00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:00.230
Okay.

159
00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:01.980
So it's not formatting, really.

160
00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:03.220
We can live it like this.

161
00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:04.090
Doesn't really matter.

162
00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:05.170
All right.

163
00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:13.680
So that's how we prepare the email data that to be sent and then to send an email we can send it.

164
00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:18.100
So try if there is an error.

165
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:23.690
The control of the air so that you can see where it went wrong.

166
00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:28.860
In that case.

167
00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:32.370
First consideration you want to send.

168
00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:33.550
Okay, folks.

169
00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:34.360
Okay.

170
00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.550
Otherwise, we send.

171
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:36.840
Okay.

172
00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.430
Troopers from station.

173
00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.170
Okay.

174
00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:49.920
Actually, before we do that, let's send in some Coast Guard people to await.

175
00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:57.280
SendGrid mail dart sent email dart.

176
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:04.870
This is the data I send using SendGrid email function soon will send function.

177
00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:07.390
Give the email data that will send the email.

178
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.830
We can send the response to if there was an error, we'd get an error.

179
00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:14.590
We send the response of the okay, false.

180
00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:15.730
Okay.

181
00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:17.890
So this is all we need to send an email.

182
00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:20.920
Let's give it a try, actually.

183
00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:24.680
I think I have the wrong name and stupid contact.

184
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:29.990
The contact is.

185
00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.320
Cannot find out.

186
00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:36.450
Switch sides.

187
00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.220
Yes, I have a typo there.

188
00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:39.510
Let's fix that as well.

189
00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:42.270
It's good to index.

190
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:46.410
Wrote.

191
00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.450
Can't find more controllers contact.

192
00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:00.750
Oh, sorry.

193
00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:01.350
That's.

194
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:07.140
That's, uh, in our own stance from control, as we've said.

195
00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:10.790
The control file name is website.

196
00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.910
And so then we have that contact function.

197
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:26.390
Control slip signifying more lost control and contact from controls website.

198
00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:28.720
Expert.

199
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:29.920
Consultant.

200
00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:52.440
Controllers switch sides.

201
00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:00.750
Scooter wrote down.

202
00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:03.410
Oh.

203
00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:06.210
Should be only 111 level of.

204
00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:13.740
Explicit fraud is not a function.

205
00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:18.260
Okay.

206
00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:19.190
That should be kept.

207
00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:20.300
Sorry.

208
00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:21.770
Should be kept alive.

209
00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:23.880
Okay.

210
00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:26.080
Perfect.

211
00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.760
So we have the show running.

212
00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:32.830
Let's give it a try from our website.

213
00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:37.330
So let's say my name, Ryan.

214
00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:45.320
Right at the gym.

215
00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:54.400
And does this contact form works?

216
00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:56.590
I submit.

217
00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:01.210
Your message has been sent.

218
00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:04.180
The form has been emptied.

219
00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:06.100
That looks good.

220
00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.790
That is good.

221
00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:11.920
Okay.

222
00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:15.310
Two, let's check out the email.

223
00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:18.030
Okay.

224
00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:19.960
You can see I received an email.

225
00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:24.820
If you don't see your email here, you may want to check out here.

226
00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:26.690
More scrolling.

227
00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:32.350
Go to this film to make sure you don't have it ended in spam.

228
00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:32.710
Okay.

229
00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:37.560
So let's take a guess.

230
00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:38.850
You might see something like this.

231
00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:44.010
This happens because we don't have the actual domain emails.

232
00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:50.700
For example, if for one day you deploy, you were said to see MSN.com, then your email should be Ryan,

233
00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:52.740
Axiom, Dotcom, something like that.

234
00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:53.310
All right.

235
00:15:53.970 --> 00:16:00.420
So look, see if you can see we got the name, you get the email, we got the misses of the user who

236
00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:02.220
sent us the contact form.

237
00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:02.960
All right.

238
00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:04.560
So this is how it works beautifully.

239
00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:09.320
So contact form is also working perfectly.

240
00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:15.460
Also.
