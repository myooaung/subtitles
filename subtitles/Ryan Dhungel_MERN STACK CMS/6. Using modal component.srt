1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:01,110
Okay.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:05,610
So to upgrade the category, we need to.

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:08,780
Create a new state.

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,760
So let me just put that here.

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,590
It's opted to just so that we don't get confused.

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:27,130
So the concept of Dating Girl, we sit on the dating category.

7
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,150
It wants to use state.

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,910
So we're going to have the updating category.

9
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:41,220
So whenever that one is clicked, we use that handle and it function to put that item the click category

10
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,530
in the state just so that we know each category we're going to update.

11
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:47,090
Okay.

12
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,410
To make sure you don't make any typos, you.

13
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,470
And then we also going to have the visible state sections.

14
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:06,910
Visible set visible to use state and would give the deferred value of force.

15
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:11,300
This visible state will be used to display the model.

16
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:12,560
Okay.

17
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:17,860
So motta on list, the user is clicking on the edit.

18
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,800
We don't want to show the model so that will be hidden.

19
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,950
But when they clicked we saw that.

20
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:29,290
So that hidden and so and hidden that will be controlled by this valley.

21
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:29,950
So very different.

22
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:30,640
It will be hidden.

23
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,560
When they click, we will show them.

24
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:34,600
Okay.

25
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,470
So for this one, obviously we need the model as well.

26
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:42,340
So let's input the model component from and model.

27
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:44,320
Awesome.

28
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:51,610
Now first, let's make sure we are able to put the updating category in this state.

29
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,390
So let's come down to that function handle.

30
00:01:54,460 --> 00:02:00,100
Edit We get access to the item, the category here.

31
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:04,150
So said updating category.

32
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,300
You said that to item and then

33
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,930
set visible.

34
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,170
All right now.

35
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,940
Just to make sure everything's working.

36
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,810
I want to.

37
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:22,400
Just come down here and just.

38
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,020
Have a look at that.

39
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,780
I'm dating category decent string a fine.

40
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,030
I'm dating category no for.

41
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,340
So when we click, we should see the auditing category here.

42
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,050
When I click, you can see the flipped categories node.

43
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,510
When I clicked here, it's broken and so beautiful.

44
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:53,730
All right, so that looks good.

45
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,930
Let me remove that.

46
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,780
So we got the updated category.

47
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,360
We have the set visible.

48
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,120
When it is clicked, it becomes true.

49
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,830
So let's bring in the model from InDesign.

50
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:09,450
So.

51
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,940
You can put that model anywhere.

52
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,080
Let's put it doesn't have to be inside column.

53
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,320
It can just stay outside.

54
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:20,460
You can.

55
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,390
A model.

56
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:28,170
Let's quickly have a look at the official docs.

57
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:34,610
It's always a good idea to have a look just so that you can always stay updated, even if it changes

58
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:35,060
in future.

59
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,380
So you can see the basic model example is here.

60
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,110
Let's click and let's see how it is used.

61
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:45,050
You can see they have the visible state.

62
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,070
And look it and cancel.

63
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:52,640
This is something you can do in L.A. because this is the one line of code.

64
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:56,510
And basically, this is how you use the model.

65
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,820
So use the model, put some content in.

66
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:59,090
Okay.

67
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,220
So you're going to use the object form.

68
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:02,510
Yeah.

69
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,270
And then you give the title and the visible.

70
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:11,580
You knew the value of the state and on and on canceling in years.

71
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,420
I guess the title visible on okay.

72
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:16,990
On guns.

73
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:17,830
Let's use that.

74
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,450
Let's

75
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,530
update category.

76
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,250
Title next one wants.

77
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:37,840
Visible.

78
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,470
If I do it to the Senate, I can sue you.

79
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,070
Let me sue.

80
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:53,120
You can see if you send it to Drew, it stays it.

81
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:53,910
It's open.

82
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,240
Of course, they don't do anything at the moment, but it stays open.

83
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,170
You know, you don't want to send it to Drew.

84
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,900
Instead, you want to send it to Visible.

85
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,650
By default, the visual is false.

86
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,590
So you don't see the.

87
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,880
Let me let me come back to this one.

88
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,200
Okay.

89
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,660
What do you want to do is close the motor?

90
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:20,760
I guess so.

91
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:21,440
Whether it's on.

92
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:21,830
Okay.

93
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,930
In fact, let me just wait for that on.

94
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,270
Let me show you visible.

95
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,800
Let me give you a base refresh.

96
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,060
I guess you wouldn't see the model when you click.

97
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,720
You see the model ANC now at the moment.

98
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,000
Nothing works.

99
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,220
But actually, we don't want the canceling buttons.

100
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,360
We don't want to use them.

101
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,890
We just want this item.

102
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,610
Let me show you how we did in the finished product.

103
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,660
You can see here this is the form and this is the button of that phone.

104
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:58,300
So we don't have any a default or can cancel buttons.

105
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,420
We just have this one.

106
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,440
So let's hide them to hide them.

107
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,180
What you can do is for.

108
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:07,580
Do not.

109
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:13,750
When you do that, you can see the food is gone.

110
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:20,170
Now you want to be able to close it, click here or click anywhere on the PC for that you can use.

111
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,180
On cancel and on cancel.

112
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,370
You want to double the visibility, right?

113
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:33,850
So on council, we didn't have to use another fence and we can just write everything in line because

114
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:38,190
it's going to be very simple, said visible.

115
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,670
You set it to false.

116
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:42,560
All right.

117
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,940
So when Ed was clicked

118
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,440
on, canceled.

119
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,580
Let me just turn to.

120
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:55,720
On.

121
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:56,080
Okay.

122
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:56,930
On cancel.

123
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:57,500
Yeah.

124
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,130
Okay.

125
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:58,850
On cancer.

126
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,090
Let's use.

127
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:02,690
Okay.

128
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:03,100
As you.

129
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:12,930
SEAL.

130
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,550
Okay, see, I did.

131
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:18,390
So maybe that's from SEAL.

132
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,170
I think we do need to be honest.

133
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:21,660
Let's.

134
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:23,740
It's funny.

135
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,400
Thanks to networks.

136
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,230
Now you can see when you click.

137
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,720
By default, visibility is false.

138
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,260
So we don't see that when you click, visible becomes true.

139
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:41,620
So you see that the model and then when you click it, it's gone and you don't have to click.

140
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,080
You can click anywhere here when you click.

141
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,070
That also goes the model to Beautiful.

142
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:48,510
That's good.

143
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:53,510
So it's looking good so far.

144
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,790
The next thing you want to do is.

145
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:03,980
Have a form that is similar to the one that we have here for creating categories.

146
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,090
So we need a similar phone.

147
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:06,910
So that we can.

148
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,990
Popular this ability category here in the form field.

149
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:13,680
All right.

150
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:25,650
So that you can see this is the form, right so this similar from we can use now we could just copy

151
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,510
and put it down here.

152
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:28,890
I'll put in Taylor Moore.

153
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:29,580
I like this one.

154
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:36,220
And it's a mortar we can close like this as well.

155
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,120
So you can show some content as well.

156
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:49,840
So you can see now into that we want to show the form now instead of writing everything here to make

157
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:54,640
this file really begin how to manage, we can create a separate component.

158
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,780
Okay, so let's create a separate component where we're going to.

159
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,670
So the phone for updating the category.
