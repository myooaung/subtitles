1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,310
All right, so now we're going to work on the post edit.

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:14,760
I saw post edit we already worked on the delete so to edit basically we have to take the users to a

3
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,170
separate base where they can update the existing post.

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:25,470
So it's going to be similar to what we already had in our new post base here.

5
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,910
So we have the post input field of input field for the post titled Post Content.

6
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,930
Oh, the featured image categories.

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,600
All these fields, it's going to look exactly similar.

8
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:40,970
The only differences are based on the the post that we're going to edit.

9
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:46,940
We have to make a request to our server, can get that post and then populate the values here.

10
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:48,560
All right.

11
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,270
So pre-populated the categories.

12
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,100
So the existing images.

13
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,500
So the existing content and the title here.

14
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:59,100
Otherwise, the the farm and the base going to look exactly the same.

15
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,790
So let me quickly show you the finished one, how we did it.

16
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,960
So it's good to it's good to talk more.

17
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,380
Let's go to admin outposts.

18
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,060
I guess so.

19
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,810
Let's say we want to update this one, so let's clean.

20
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,110
Edit Ah, you notice this is the post titled So Graphical From Scratch.

21
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:27,360
It's all this text you will notice in the slope as soon as we land on the end.

22
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,870
It is you can see the post slug is there.

23
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:37,410
So when you click before you land in this land, in the space, you will be able to access this slug.

24
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:43,140
So you will use this slug to make requests to your backing to get this particular post.

25
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:43,680
All right.

26
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:52,140
If you can use use effect for that based on the slug, you will load this post from the back in and

27
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:52,440
then.

28
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:56,830
You will have the data of this post in the States.

29
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:02,020
So you can put that in the state, local, state, and then you will pre-populated the values here.

30
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:02,620
All right.

31
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,690
So the values are already there.

32
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,550
The content is there, the title is there.

33
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,690
Now, you will make some changes or whatever you want to do.

34
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:11,810
Thank you.

35
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,450
So when you do that, you will again hit object button and that will update the post.

36
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:17,890
So that's how it's going to work.

37
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,650
Okay, so we've got the concept now.

38
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,450
Let's go actually work on this.

39
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:32,150
So the first thing you want to do is you want to create a piece for edit, so that will be admin posts.

40
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,520
We can create a new file this time we will be accessing the slug.

41
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,460
So let's call it slug that is.

42
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:44,990
Okay.

43
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,160
So here we can write everything from scratch.

44
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:57,770
But to make things easier, let's grab this code from this new to create new displays, because everything

45
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:00,170
is going to be almost exactly same.

46
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:02,120
And then obviously we have to make some changes.

47
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:07,260
But as you can see, this is the layout.

48
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:12,230
So we have the input for title content categories, feature images, all these things.

49
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,030
We need an update as well.

50
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:18,860
So let's copy everything and go to the slogan based here.

51
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:23,570
Obviously we will make the changes here so we can start by the name.

52
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:28,730
So change the name to new post it sends to edit post.

53
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,520
Let's go on top.

54
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:40,400
First we start from the name, so change the name and actually if you go you might actually see the

55
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:48,530
the create the base that that will look like the Asian celebrities the title first create new post.

56
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:52,670
So let's go to the return section create new post.

57
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:58,280
Let's turn this to edit post and let's visit displays first.

58
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,390
So we've got our posts when you click on this.

59
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:08,090
Edit, Nothing happened, so we haven't probably done anything on fleek, so let's go ahead and fix

60
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:08,600
that first.

61
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:15,920
So that is in the admin post index, we got the edit and delete.

62
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,530
So we have the function edit handle edit.

63
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,440
But that doesn't do anything.

64
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:27,690
What are we going to do is we can just redirect the user, take the user to that place.

65
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,860
So we could use link component.

66
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,920
Oh, you can do a programmatically like this.

67
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,490
So let's first make sure we have properly done so.

68
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:44,960
Let's input the hook we use row from next row.

69
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:53,600
And then to start using that hook, we can just put it in a variable, let's called a row that equals

70
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,380
to use row row.

71
00:04:54,380 --> 00:05:01,010
So we execute that and then using roto we can push the user to that base.

72
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:07,070
So let's use that and to edit around and dark force,

73
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,740
we want to use it to slice.

74
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:16,390
Richard.

75
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,890
But Dick's slippers had means less post.

76
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:24,730
Post.

77
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,700
With s scarce.

78
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,660
We need the.

79
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,650
Post slow.

80
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,690
All right, so that's all we need.

81
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,720
We need to make sure we return.

82
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,710
Let's give it a try.

83
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,330
O'KEEFE It's imperative.

84
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:56,390
I miss the neutron.

85
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:05,000
I guess if I click, you get that takes us to that place.

86
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:05,720
Beautiful.

87
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:10,300
We got the post slot and we have everything there and it post like.

88
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:16,940
So the first thing you want to do is access this post, right?

89
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:22,940
So grab this year and make a request to the back end so that you can give that post.

90
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,810
And once you get the response, pull in the state and then from the state you will be able to show the

91
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:30,440
values you.

92
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,360
And we already have the endpoint because we have already.

93
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,250
Let me just open in a new tab.

94
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,900
We only have used the endpoint to get the single point.

95
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,290
For the single most viewed effectively.

96
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:57,360
Actually, you can see we are making requests to that the back end with this slug to get this post so

97
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,340
we can make a request to the same endpoint.

98
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,340
Give this give the post and then pre populate you in these fears much less growth.

99
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,470
So that's fence posts.

100
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:10,510
We have that one.

101
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,880
So that's a different base.

102
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,090
Let's close this file.

103
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:19,280
So this is the one we were working on and this is the one we copied on the quarter.

104
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,370
Let's close that as well.

105
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,980
So we are in this log.

106
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,460
This is our delete also edit post with.

107
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:29,070
So let me use use effects.

108
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,580
So we're loading categories as well.

109
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,340
So that's good.

110
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,070
Simply titled and saved content.

111
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,440
So we were learning from the local stories.

112
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:44,710
But we don't actually need this now because we already get the post from our backends.

113
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,260
So let's remove these two functions.

114
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,250
And then let's remove them from here as well.

115
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,400
And then just to use industry.

116
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:03,730
Because we are no longer getting the saving into the local sewers and getting from the local storage.

117
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,140
So we just remove that.

118
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:08,100
Okay.

119
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:11,920
So first, let's load use the fake.

120
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,670
Let's you do the.

121
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,920
We want to load the post.

122
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,080
All right, so let's create a function called load posts.

123
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:25,100
We execute that and looks for that here.

124
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:30,920
Post load post equals to async.

125
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,400
So here we want to lower the posting of posts.

126
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:46,790
So.

127
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,250
Contact Donna.

128
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,210
You can see.

129
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,110
Oh, wait.

130
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,560
Excuse.

131
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,460
Don't gift.

132
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:02,770
We get to use big tech's SLAs.

133
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:08,680
Boost SLAs slow now slug we are getting from around the region.

134
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,880
That query did slow.

135
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,240
I guess a disrupter gives us the slug as well.

136
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,800
So that's another beauty of this one.

137
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:16,090
So rather query.

138
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:16,660
Just slow.

139
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:21,280
We give this log, I'll make a request to back in to get that post.

140
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:26,980
And once we get that post, every first comes a log before we try to put in the step sequential log.

141
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,040
That's right.

142
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,920
Got post for its.

143
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,170
Okay.

144
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:44,850
Let's make sure we have got the post before we do anything that's open.

145
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,440
Set includes a defense arrangement that.

146
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:03,680
Rudy, let me just give you the reference.

147
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:16,420
We may have to have a dependency because we have to make a request only when we access the slope before

148
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,160
we access the slope.

149
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,260
If we make a request, obviously that will fail.

150
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:20,680
Right.

151
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:25,420
So in the dependency, let's make sure we use.

152
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:30,630
Of the dependency here.

153
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:35,350
Relevant relevant query.

154
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:39,360
Slow.

155
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,410
All right, let's try it.

156
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,390
Now we going to post unit.

157
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:51,810
So in our case, we needed the dependency because when the component mounts, immediately, the request

158
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:52,290
is made.

159
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,440
So at that time, maybe we haven't got the slug yet.

160
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,620
So that might take a few milliseconds.

161
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,940
So we have to wait for that.

162
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:00,930
Okay.

163
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:06,030
So you can see here we have got the post, we have got the categories, content, visual images, everything

164
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:06,390
is there.

165
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,080
Beautiful.

166
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:12,630
Now, let's pre-populated those values put in the these forms.

167
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,550
Now, let's quickly have a look at these fonts.

168
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,500
Now you can see.

169
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:24,250
The phone was that so screwed to the written block?

170
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,960
So we get the input for a title.

171
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,580
Now you can see the values.

172
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:33,610
They're already using the stead value title for this one stead value content.

173
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,150
And for previews we have the loaded categories.

174
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,220
Instead of law that goes categories.

175
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:47,460
We want to alert the post categories.

176
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,680
So we need to make a bit of a change here.

177
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,080
So let's start from the title and content.

178
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,810
So let's have a look at the steps.

179
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:58,590
So you can see we have the title content categories.

180
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:07,080
Now this time these categories will be posts categories, the existing categories of the post, if there

181
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,560
is any.

182
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:12,480
So we will use this state for the post existing areas.

183
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,830
And then loaded categories, we will.

184
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:26,490
So the loaded, you know, whatever categories we have available in our back end, we will load all

185
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:30,490
that so that the user can pick, you know, from the existing one.

186
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:35,650
They might, might want to add more, read more, more, so they will be able to select more from the

187
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:37,340
available categories list.

188
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,360
And okay, so that looks good.

189
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:45,340
Let's come back to the load post for instance, are here instead of just console.log, let's populate

190
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:45,970
the state.

191
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,000
All right, so you

192
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,070
can hear what I'm going to do is.

193
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:56,620
Said.

194
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:07,380
So that would be the data set down to the total set content that would be downloaded content that featured

195
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:07,920
images.

196
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,400
That would be data.

197
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:17,230
Featured image linked to the state.

198
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:23,230
We don't have these featured images in the state.

199
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,610
That means we want to add that current.

200
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,020
So let's put that right here.

201
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,000
Concert

202
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:42,340
Featured images that featured Indians includes two youths, the state and the empty object.

203
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:45,820
Because this is going to be the object said featured image.

204
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:46,810
We've got that as well.

205
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:53,470
Next one, we will actually need the post I.D..

206
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,190
I mean, we can update the post by slowly as we look.

207
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,870
We can find the post based on the slogan object.

208
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:05,890
Later, when we actually supplement this phone using the handle summit function, which is your handle

209
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:12,610
probably instead of using Slack, I like to use it because it's really easy to find valid an object

210
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:16,990
because that is the function we can use with mongoose in a find by the end.

211
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:17,470
Update.

212
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:28,870
So for that reason, let's also add one more state in that one more value in the state for the ID post

213
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:36,270
I.D. I just said I.D. and let's call it said post time and that would be data underscore.

214
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,700
So that means we need to have this state as well.

215
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,660
Let's add that that's added on top.

216
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:52,150
Post said post, I need post I.D. It was in use state.

217
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:54,770
Awesome.

218
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,580
So we've got that.

219
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,620
We added this one.

220
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,580
We had this one.

221
00:14:59,740 --> 00:14:59,950
All right.

222
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,660
So we populate all those fields.

223
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,960
So we also have to set the categories.

224
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:11,560
But that's a little bit tricky because we have to extract the name from the categories, because categories

225
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,840
is going to be the array of objects.

226
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:17,170
It has the ID name and slug, but we just need the name.

227
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,800
That's how the we'll be able to.

228
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:22,360
So in the end design this dropdown.

229
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,510
Okay, so actually let's see.

230
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:32,080
So we already have the title and content, so let's see if we table.

231
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:35,170
So we got the title, but we don't see the content.

232
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:37,300
All right.

233
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:44,800
So this is probably because when the component is loaded at that time, the content is not ready.

234
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:54,250
So loading state, if we use the learning state, then it would be true that when the post has been

235
00:15:54,250 --> 00:16:00,190
received using the use effect here, when it has been received using this excuse that time, it may

236
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,450
have been few milliseconds.

237
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:06,940
So when that happens, we put the response in the state.

238
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,560
How about this component?

239
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,560
Some of these components they have is their own state.

240
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,410
So sometimes they don't actually read render.

241
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:14,870
Okay.

242
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,860
So let's let's see how we can fix this one.
