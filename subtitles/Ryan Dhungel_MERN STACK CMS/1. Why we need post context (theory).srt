1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:09,240
So now we are going to create one more state, global state using context for post and categories so

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:16,410
we can put them both in the post context because category is basically used for post recruiting posts.

3
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:16,710
Right.

4
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,930
So you already understand the concept of context.

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,140
Let me quickly go to the one we already have.

6
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,640
That is called theme context.

7
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:36,630
So we had to have this theme context because this way we could access the current theme no matter where

8
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:37,010
we are.

9
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:43,620
We could be in any of those places, any of those components, wherever we are, we can easily access

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,970
the theme using the theme context.

11
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,190
So this one is not here.

12
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,900
So let me quickly go to.

13
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,430
So this is our theme, theme context.

14
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:02,460
And if you want to know the, the current theme and if you want to tense the theme, then you can just

15
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,110
access this context anywhere.

16
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:11,910
For example, we have access to that in our component called toggle theme that you can see to access

17
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:12,450
that theme.

18
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,260
For example, if I wanted to access here from this component, it was this easy.

19
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:24,930
So all I had to do was use the use context to give the context, and that would give me the the result.

20
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,430
And if I want, I could even update using set theme.

21
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:30,150
All right.

22
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:37,710
So that way, if you need some information, some data, not just in one component, but in the entire

23
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,220
application.

24
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,780
So you may need in some places, you may need in some component that time.

25
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,950
It is so easy to access them and object.

26
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:47,520
All right.

27
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,510
So we need to do that for push.

28
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,190
I guess so.

29
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,490
Again, so this is a finished project.

30
00:01:53,760 --> 00:02:00,110
So post also when we want to edit, we take them to a separate base.

31
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,200
So on that basis we need to access the post now later.

32
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,300
Not only admin, the author also will be able to upgrade his post.

33
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:09,720
Right.

34
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,380
So we need the same functionality, pretty much the same code.

35
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,000
However, we need to have a different base for SLAs.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,290
Author less post.

37
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:26,070
And that time also we need to show all the post we need to implement edit when they click edit we need

38
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,020
to take them to a different base.

39
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:32,460
So when we are doing like that, we need to access the current.

40
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:41,190
We need to access still array of post and categories in many different places, many different component,

41
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:46,830
because later we're going to move a lot of this code from the create base.

42
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,130
So you can see this place.

43
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,810
So all of this, we're going to move them to a component.

44
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:59,420
So that way we can just bring them into admin, post base and later author post base as well.

45
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,730
So we can pretty much put all this coordinate component in for our to reuse.

46
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:12,000
So for doing things like that, as you can imagine, we need to know the area of post array of categories

47
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,130
in many different phases in component.

48
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:19,800
So when there is a situation like that, when it needs certain data in more than one places, then it's

49
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:25,770
always a good idea to use the context so that you can easily access that and you can even update the

50
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:26,940
data in the context.

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:38,520
So for that reason, we're going to move our code from the local state to the new context we're going

52
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:38,970
to create.

53
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,950
That will be post context.

54
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:42,360
All right.

55
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:51,150
So once we have the post context, the first time we're going to use that is here in the admin post

56
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:52,470
index space.

57
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,300
So you can see here that is the limit.

58
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,180
So that base is right here.

59
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:01,050
Now you see you can see here we have the list of post.

60
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:07,800
So the first thing we're going to do is when we have the post context, we're going to put all of this

61
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,890
in the global post context.

62
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:15,030
So instead of putting them here, we put them in the global context.

63
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:24,000
That way we will be able to access all the post, not only here but any other places as well.

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,670
So we can easily access that from context.

65
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:34,080
So you will see how and when we have to access it in other places or components.

66
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,470
As we continue building the application, you will see the use case.

67
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,950
But for the moment, we're going to move them to the context.

68
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:44,610
All right.

69
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,080
So let's continue this.

70
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:56,580
In the next video, we can create a new context called post context, the same we did previously for

71
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,090
the theme.

72
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:58,050
All right.

73
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,610
And then we're going to just.

74
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:00,900
Continue building this.
