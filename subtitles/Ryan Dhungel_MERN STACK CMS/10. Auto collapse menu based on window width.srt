1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:00,780
All right.

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:07,770
So the next thing we want to focus on is making it collapse when we are in a smoke screen.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:08,280
All right.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,260
So this is something you can control.

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:16,440
So we have this slider and we have the collapsed value in the stood by default.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,040
It's false.

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:27,690
Now, let's try to using that in the sidebar collapse so we can use this collapse to be the true or

8
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:28,170
false.

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,200
Collapsed with teeth.

10
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:39,370
So you can see here at the moment it's collapsed this fall.

11
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,410
So we see it's open.

12
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,190
But if I turn this van into two.

13
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,260
Then you see it is collapsed.

14
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,020
I see you can see it's collapse.

15
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,610
I can't even open because it's the state said to to.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,450
So what I want to do is.

17
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,650
When the browser with is smaller, then I want to automatically collapse.

18
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,690
Then I see that's what I want.

19
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:18,780
For that we can use a and vim baggers that will give us the value of the current browser with all right.

20
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:26,640
So that we can source with this package that's called or react windows sites.

21
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,160
React to Q&amp;A said.

22
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,530
I think that's the one we want.

23
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:44,220
Go back react who window size.

24
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:55,910
Still it's come to this come on.

25
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:58,730
And you can see the basic use case has.

26
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,460
So we can import and we can just.

27
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:07,690
Get the width should be fairly.

28
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:12,160
So all we need to do is this get the window, a window size.

29
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:18,900
You know, the one we're going to use is a window with the size, window with.

30
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,400
We just need to get the width.

31
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,860
All right, so let's insert this one.

32
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:29,630
Let me stop the server here on this.

33
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,280
And while it's happening let's go and input.

34
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:45,140
So we input that admin never seemed to limit input on the input.

35
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:53,690
The one function we want to use is to use a window width use window with and from.

36
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,540
And we asked who window size.

37
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:02,800
All right.

38
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:08,560
And to use that, we can invoke that hope.

39
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,150
So that's the they can see, folks.

40
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,370
So we can put that here.

41
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:23,650
It's a first only with we can put that in a very wanted to with equal C use window with.

42
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:28,660
So we just need to execute that function and that will give us the current window with you can have

43
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,250
a look at it you can sort of now.

44
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:38,220
Window with, only with.

45
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,140
All right, so let's have a look.

46
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:55,900
Giving you a quick refresher.

47
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:56,610
Okay.

48
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:01,090
So we don't have then that's because we haven't started the server.

49
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,320
Window with, I guess you can to 1280.

50
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,870
That's a window with my face.

51
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:19,930
Make it small.

52
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:24,460
You'll notice that we get this dynamic value of the current with.

53
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,200
That's pretty cool.

54
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,070
You can see here.

55
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,860
So you can use the value or whatever value like.

56
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:37,820
And then you decide if this screen size is smaller than that, then I want to auto collapse.

57
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:38,750
You can do that.

58
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,030
All right.

59
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:47,690
So let's use that value that we have to decide when we want to collapse.

60
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:51,480
All right, so I'm just gonna turn that out, actually.

61
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,710
Let's move that window with.

62
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,170
Now, let me use another user.

63
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:57,740
15.

64
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:05,600
So I will run this code whenever these values change.

65
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,920
So window with.

66
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:12,200
So to use effect, we have this function and then the dependency array.

67
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:15,650
I'm going to use only width.

68
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:22,460
So only width actually to as you make the browser small, it continues to grow.

69
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:28,760
So what I want to do is I want to check if window with is smaller than let's say 800.

70
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,090
So that's not too small enough to me.

71
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:39,440
So if window with is smaller than 800, then I want to collapse the saver.

72
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,550
Otherwise leave it open.

73
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:53,490
Obviously you want to do is if only with is smaller than 800.

74
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,850
Then I would like to set collapse the troops.

75
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,760
I want to collapse the object to the valley in the States.

76
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,540
It collapsed.

77
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:04,140
True.

78
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:05,520
Otherwise.

79
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,520
And if.

80
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:12,000
If window with is greater than 800, then don't do anything.

81
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,540
Leave it out.

82
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:12,970
Right.

83
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:13,920
So it collapsed.

84
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,850
False, just like it is in the default state.

85
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,140
So if it is bigger than 800, keep it open.

86
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,210
Set, collapse, false.

87
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,490
Otherwise make it too beautiful.

88
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:33,480
No discord runs whenever the window with becomes more than 800.

89
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:38,280
So that means we will have the dynamic collapsed valley so we can use that.

90
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,850
It's used it here, which we already did.

91
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,560
So let's give it a try.

92
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:44,730
Okay.

93
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,830
So let me make it small.

94
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:47,430
A small.

95
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,060
Small.

96
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,010
As soon as I hit 800, it is collapsing.

97
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,120
And automatically.

98
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:56,810
Beautiful.

99
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,410
No, you should make it open bigger.

100
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,670
Obviously it opens.

101
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:03,020
If it goes on by 800, it collapse.

102
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,640
Beautiful.

103
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,640
Now, one more thing.

104
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,360
We have to fish is it collapsed.

105
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:13,830
However, sometimes some user may still want to open.

106
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:14,600
Open up.

107
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,280
Even if it's a small swim.

108
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,550
Maybe they won't get a clear view.

109
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,520
But at the moment, it doesn't work.

110
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:28,710
So let's add one more functionality so that we can manually give the ability for the user to change

111
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:29,520
this, right?

112
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,920
So for that, we have a function that we can use with the site that is called On Collapse.

113
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,710
All this is in the document, isn't it?

114
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,890
And finally, the document isn't very quickly.

115
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,940
So how you can take out things like that.

116
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,890
So when you are here, for example, say the.

117
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:58,420
Now sometimes you want to know, for example, it's good to button hard.

118
00:07:58,450 --> 00:07:59,440
It's a simple example.

119
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,840
So you have this one component.

120
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,510
Do you have a bunch of examples?

121
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:04,840
That's fine, but sometimes you need to go deeper.

122
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,220
What are the properties?

123
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,930
What are the options available?

124
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:08,200
Right?

125
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:15,520
So for Button, you can use the button button type primary.

126
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,980
Okay, so best is there.

127
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,140
So things like that, do you want to explore more?

128
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:28,260
So always go down all the way down and you can see here the API, the six and you can take out of whatever

129
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:29,530
options you could use.

130
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,060
The Freedom BLOCK Danger.

131
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:37,900
That's a title that would give it the red button so you can use loading if it is valid, true or false,

132
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,750
the you will get the little spinner spinning in the button.

133
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:45,160
We will explore this feature split lib so you can see all these things so you can use it.

134
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:53,170
Unplug function on the button so you can see these are the things you can use with button.

135
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:58,990
You can use the size of the venue, small, medium, large, you know, things like that.

136
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:04,930
So always check out these API six and if you want to get a deep understanding of the and components.

137
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:06,880
All right.

138
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,940
So we have the collapse function that we can use.

139
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,590
So let's use out of fancy here.

140
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:20,950
So on collapse when the collapse happens, if you want the user to be able to you know under the excel

141
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:31,720
down then since collapse and you can turn this to not collapse so whatever value is in the state to

142
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,620
collapse whether that's true or false, you just revert the value.

143
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,560
So if it is true and make it false, otherwise vice versa.

144
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:42,240
So you can use this one is let's try.

145
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:44,800
All right.

146
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,330
So we make it small.

147
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,710
It goes smart home.

148
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:54,700
You can still manually follow the user to change it thanks to this function.

149
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,240
Beautiful.
