1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:05,190
So now we're going to focus on creating a layout for admin.

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:05,790
Right.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,900
So the first thing we want to do is focus on building the admin despot.

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:17,100
Because since it seems we merely see a miss, we want to focus on the admin section where admin can

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,860
create categories, create posts, quit users.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,190
That's how we get the content for the entire application.

7
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:23,550
Right.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,870
So let's quickly have a look at the finished products, added Fozzie.

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,120
So the next thing we want to focus is create layout for the dashboard.

10
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:34,570
All right.

11
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:44,080
So you can see here we have this layout which has the sidebar on the left, and then we have the area

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,430
here to show the content.

13
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:46,360
Right.

14
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,810
So if you go to the all posts, you see all the pushed here.

15
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:56,500
So that's the content and that's the sidebar that you could add new you get on the component here.

16
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:01,330
You go to the users, you get the users.

17
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:09,220
So we have to create this sidebar, put it on the side, and then the rest of the area we use for showing

18
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:09,820
the content.

19
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:10,300
All right.

20
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,720
So let's go ahead and create a similar layout.

21
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:19,660
And for that, since we're using and design and design has this layout component, so we're going to

22
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,450
use that so you can search for layout.

23
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:30,220
So here they're basically explaining the design concept, but we want to take out the actual code.

24
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:38,560
So let's go to components and you type here in the components, you have this sidebar.

25
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,590
And we want to check out the layout.

26
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:42,390
All right.

27
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,180
Layout.

28
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,970
You have, you can see some examples.

29
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:48,650
You have to have the content and footer.

30
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,800
You can have the sidebar like that.

31
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,830
We can have sidebar on the right or left.

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:56,350
All right.

33
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,960
So you can see some examples here.

34
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,360
The one we want to use is something like this.

35
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,480
So it will have the sidebar and it will have the content.

36
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,060
Six or so you can take out the code here.

37
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:14,100
Just let's click here so you can see first the import layout component and then they can destructor

38
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,320
these elements from layout.

39
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,140
So header content insider.

40
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,340
So that is used for the sidebar.

41
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:25,290
So you can destructed these components and then you can build you layout.

42
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,260
You can see here you have this wrapping layout.

43
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:33,040
It is wrapping the entire thing in inside layout.

44
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,100
You can have all the layout as really intuitive multiple layout.

45
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:44,110
So what are we going to do is first we import layout, we destructed these components and then we build

46
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:44,710
our layout.

47
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:50,740
So the layout we pulled, say the sidebar to show the menu like this one.

48
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,470
And then we use the content.

49
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,010
Content to show the content here as content like this.

50
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:00,430
All right.

51
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,860
So let's go ahead and take this out.

52
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,920
Let's try.

53
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,850
So we want to implement that in the admin.

54
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:11,280
Please.

55
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,710
I'd say the moon is just empty.

56
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,540
So let's go ahead and start working on that one.

57
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,940
Now we want to.

58
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:27,050
I created a separate component for the sidebar so that we can easily input just so that we don't end

59
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:29,480
up with a lot of code in the same file.

60
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:29,900
All right.

61
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:37,160
So we're going to create a separate component for the layer sidebar and another base for the layout.

62
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:40,670
So the layout is going to be just right here.

63
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,350
So base is admin indexed.

64
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,360
So we have this one.

65
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,200
So let's go ahead and import the layout component first.

66
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:56,750
So import layout, front end and then we want to be structure.

67
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:03,830
So we wanted to structure content out from now.

68
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:09,620
We don't need to disturb the sailor because surgery's going to be in another component.

69
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:10,070
All right.

70
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:16,720
So once we have the content, we can send our deep with layout.

71
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:25,420
I thought we have the layout once we have the layout, whatever content we want.

72
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:31,510
So we put into the content component content.

73
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:39,990
And then let's put this back.

74
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:47,080
Now, if you have a look, you don't see any change at the moment.

75
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,090
What we want to do is we want to actually.

76
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,730
Let's put it inside layout.

77
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,220
Because it has to be inside out because we're going to have the cider as well.

78
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:04,290
All right.

79
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,190
So we have the layout and internal layout.

80
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,040
We have a content.

81
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,480
You could have header as well.

82
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,140
If you want to.

83
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,840
You can check out the documentation here.

84
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,440
So they have the head as well.

85
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,520
But we just want a simple layout with.

86
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,100
Ah, the content.

87
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,510
All right, so we have the content.

88
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:28,520
So we have the layout, we have the content and we have the the page one.

89
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,470
That's the content at the moment.

90
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,870
And we want to have the sidebar as well.

91
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:33,170
All right.

92
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:39,860
So CIDR also let's let's bring here just so that we can see how it works then.

93
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,200
Then we're going to move them to a separate component.

94
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,390
So one to destructor so you can put them here.

95
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:50,510
That's within the first layout.

96
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:50,990
All right.

97
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:54,920
Then you have the sidebar and then you have another layout with the content.

98
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,130
So remember this structure.

99
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:02,040
So now let's have a look.

100
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:06,750
Now, you can see here we have the size of your we have the sidebar and we have the content.

101
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,180
So you get the idea of how it's going to look.

102
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,350
All right.

103
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,460
So that's good.

104
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:19,020
However, we don't want to actually put everything here because later we need to protect so many bases

105
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,640
for the admin only.

106
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:26,000
So only the user with the role of admin will have access to these bases.

107
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:34,440
You can see here to create a post media comments users, some of them, we will make it available for

108
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,830
the author as well, but most of them will be for the admin.

109
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,130
All right.

110
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:45,600
So we need to protect to make sure only the user with the role of admin will have access to these spaces.

111
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,980
And one way of doing that is create using a layout.

112
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:50,370
Right.

113
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,880
So that's actually that's what we're trying to do here.

114
00:06:54,570 --> 00:07:01,050
So we want to create some kind of four admin layout and then we're going to wrap each and every place

115
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,670
that will be only for the admin.

116
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:10,830
And then in that admin layout component, we can make a request to backend to verify that this user

117
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:14,460
is added to protect the the bases.

118
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:14,730
Right.

119
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,710
So we're going to implement all that bit later.

120
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,650
But for the moment, just let's focus on the layout.

121
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:25,440
So basically it's on it's in every place because as you can see, admin will have many pieces.

122
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:26,960
So on, it's an empty place.

123
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:29,790
You don't want to repeat this code over and over again.

124
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,980
And you can imagine this sidebar is going to be quite big as well to make this big.

125
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,090
So you don't want to write that big meaning on each and every page.

126
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,420
Right.

127
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:39,720
So.

128
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,750
All these places, you don't want to repeat the call.

129
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:52,440
So obviously the solution here is to put all this code in a a component we can call that and layout,

130
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,760
and then we can just import that and wrap our content.

131
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,410
That way we can reuse that.

132
00:07:58,650 --> 00:07:58,920
All right.

133
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,030
So that's what we're going to do.

134
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:03,900
So let me just copy this one.

135
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,740
Let's go to component and then let's build a new for call layouts.

136
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,750
And then to make it singular they out.

137
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:17,500
And then in turn here, let's create an admin layout.

138
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:19,630
All right.

139
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:22,240
So for the moment, you copied all that.

140
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:29,380
Could just paste that here and change this to admin layout.

141
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:30,790
Copy that.

142
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:32,740
Based here.

143
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,470
So this is the admin layout.

144
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:35,860
Now.

145
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,280
This admin layer.

146
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,090
Do you want to?

147
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:45,900
Use him in this space and then later you will create mini based.

148
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,770
So on all those mini pieces, you want to import that billion.

149
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:57,000
All right, so let's input admin admin layout from.

150
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,060
So we go one step.

151
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:03,920
Got something in my hair.

152
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,330
Admin layout.

153
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,830
So one step up, two step up and then go inside.

154
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:10,390
Components.

155
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:17,120
Different components add main layout.

156
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:26,410
Alright, so we've got the admin layer and now all this code is already in the ad now so we don't need

157
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:26,950
that, right.

158
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:27,770
So we don't need that.

159
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,830
Get rid of that and instead use the admin layout.

160
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:34,610
Sorry.

161
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,530
Admin layout.

162
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:37,340
Perfect.

163
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:42,650
Now, the way we're going to make it work is we're going to pass the content here.

164
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:50,870
So we can, you know, we can pass a whole lot of content here and that content we need to show in the

165
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:51,650
admin layout.

166
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,980
So at the moment we're just hard coding admin based.

167
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,280
That's not something we want.

168
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:56,000
Right.

169
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,430
So at the moment, if I save it like this, go here, take out.

170
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:03,580
Okay.

171
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,700
So it looks like the path is wrong.

172
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:11,250
That in and we can't resolve.

173
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:12,200
All right.

174
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,090
So we're here.

175
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,890
It's one step up to step up.

176
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,180
Go into components.

177
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:17,960
Lay out.

178
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,810
I guess we missed that clear.

179
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:30,780
So at the moment, if you use that admin layer computer, that's all you see, that's, you know.

180
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:39,600
However, what we want to do is we want to be able to pass the content as props so that we can reuse

181
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,260
this component.

182
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:40,590
Right?

183
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,950
So we can do that.

184
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,290
So you can see here, inside here, we can put whatever we like.

185
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:51,380
For example, let's say H1, H1.

186
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,840
This is.

187
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:03,660
I mean, is Trump's property sort of properties.

188
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:10,020
But for the moment, it just just dummy takes to be distant how this works.

189
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,030
So this is the content, right?

190
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:15,180
So this is the content we want to show using the admin layer.

191
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:19,740
So in the admin layer, what you can do is instead of this content, let's remove that.

192
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:29,640
And so that props what we got this content we will be able to receive in admin layout as children props.

193
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:30,710
All right.

194
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:35,910
So you could do props and then you could do props.

195
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,280
The children.

196
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,600
So that's that's how it works in React.

197
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,870
So anything you pass they will be received their children props.

198
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:51,810
Okay so you could pass the data to your component like this.

199
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,440
And he could receive that, too.

200
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,270
So let's have a look here.

201
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,730
Let me give you a quick refresher.

202
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,130
Sometimes she had to.

203
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,830
In fact, we're not showing anything there.

204
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,180
So that's the profit we're sending.

205
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,000
Add me loud.

206
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,820
Okay, so we have this bit of a typo here.

207
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,930
Let me quickly fix that.

208
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,800
Rename small a.

209
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,220
The foster children.

210
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:30,020
Okay.

211
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:36,200
So you can see it foster children at school and probably it wasn't working because of the there was

212
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:43,280
a lot of the letters kept kept the letter was used to you can hear from now if you try something else.

213
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,620
Paragraph.

214
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,570
More content.

215
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,470
You can see that works.

216
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,690
Okay, so that's beautiful.

217
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:05,150
Now this way we will be able to use admin layout as many times as we like.

218
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:05,600
Right.

219
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:06,590
So that's great.

220
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:11,780
Now, the next thing we want to do is work on the sidebar, right?

221
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:16,880
So we're going to decide where we have to build the entire mini like you can see here.

222
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:22,190
So we're going to use end is end mini component to create this menu.

223
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:32,960
And that way every place that uses the admin layout will have the beautiful sidebar menu on the right.

224
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,900
Now, before I finish this lesson, one more thing.

225
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:39,920
You don't have to access it using this dot notation.

226
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,650
You can just destructor if you'd like.

227
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:47,690
Instead of props to children, you can just directly destructor hits you.

228
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,520
I see that it's a bit more clear than.

229
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:52,180
Okay.

230
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:52,820
The.
