1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:07,380
I actually have done quite a lot in this series for music and most of the features have already been

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,100
implemented.

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:17,950
The next few months we going to work on is and just sign out from this user.

4
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,110
Log in as admin.

5
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,480
So I want to now work on.

6
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,490
Oh, the contact phone.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,150
Thanks to everyone who said need to have a contact form.

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,580
And since we're using SendGrid anyways, it's really easy to send emails.

9
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:39,730
So let's implement that so that you can always use this in your real life project as well.

10
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,150
But otherwise you can see a lot of this has been done.

11
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,110
All this is done.

12
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:45,640
Media comments.

13
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,410
User Now profile is also done properly.

14
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:52,710
You can see user can upload the images.

15
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:53,350
So that's done.

16
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,930
Now customize this one will work with LED.

17
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,050
We haven't stained the home base.

18
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:05,080
We can show the list of post latest post categories so full with images.

19
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:06,670
So it looks good.

20
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,230
Something like this you can see here.

21
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,020
The discounter condone.

22
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,300
So all these things we can do.

23
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,340
So the list of categories.

24
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,630
Latest blog posts.

25
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,420
Of customization.

26
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:24,830
So this is something you can do as an admin to customize.

27
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:30,210
Since the front images speak from the library, for example.

28
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,690
Let me try this one.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,940
Use of text more.

30
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,510
Mushroom stir.

31
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:47,830
All right.

32
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:54,640
And you can see I changed and it's intuitive, beautiful.

33
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,060
So.

34
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,500
These are things we are going to implement.

35
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,960
We will also implement.

36
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,910
The resources here.

37
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,240
We will also show the list of categories and recent posts.

38
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:20,240
This can be reused because you can see the categories and recent posts are also displayed here in Homebase.

39
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,270
Or we can reuse that.

40
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:31,830
We include this nice little footer, so a really cool stuff's nice and easy for you to implement.

41
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:37,050
Now let's work on this contact form and then we will go on to do those things right.

42
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,680
So here, contact form, we will create a basic contact phone where you can enter the name, email message

43
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,370
and send it.

44
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,680
Now this information we will receive in the back in and then using SendGrid, we will be sending an

45
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,450
email to the admin user, the site owner, so he can receive the emails.

46
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,070
All right, so let's create this basic contact.

47
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,270
So let's first close all this.

48
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,660
Let's start from the navigation.

49
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:08,610
We want to add that link here in the now.

50
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,290
So here, now, top nav.

51
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:14,220
Let's go.

52
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,620
So sign and post after the post.

53
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:26,950
Let's you call it contact.

54
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,970
Let me find a nice item for contact.

55
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:56,230
Come on.

56
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:56,680
Okay.

57
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,470
So for argument's.

58
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:07,960
Review the items and find contacts I think we can use.

59
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,320
Mel outlined here that she just.

60
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:19,940
I mean, outline.

61
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,450
It's important.

62
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,460
Give it to reload.

63
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,700
For some reason, it's murder.

64
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:29,880
You.

65
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,140
Middle outline defined multiple times.

66
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:34,500
Okay.

67
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,030
So it was already there.

68
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,700
I think we were using that for something else.

69
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,310
Something that.

70
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,290
Mail is here contact.

71
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,390
So we got that.

72
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:59,970
We did have the basis for this quite quick based go to pages create a new a new fun contact or is.

73
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:08,480
And it's simple rule and call them form and

74
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:11,630
import.

75
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,870
Now, I want to import that contact form.

76
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,840
I want to put that in a component in import here.

77
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:24,230
The benefit of that is related to, for example, let's say now this contact form you want to see in

78
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,730
the footer here.

79
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:34,280
You can do that again, import the component, put it here, or maybe you want to put here on the single

80
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,380
piece anyway you can easily import and use.

81
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:40,470
So that's where I want to put it in separate component.

82
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,150
So import, we don't even have that for now.

83
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:47,050
Let's just continue at the moment.

84
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,840
Print contact will still.

85
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:53,890
Return.

86
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,270
Rule.

87
00:05:59,070 --> 00:05:59,550
Come.

88
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,810
Now I want to center the film.

89
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,840
There's no point taking full with.

90
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:18,300
Four with four from our data center like this so I can use spend two strokes and then offset six.

91
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,010
So both said six.

92
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:24,000
So that'll be 12 in total that's two total 24.

93
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:28,530
That's a full width and bit of a Ben Stein

94
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,810
batting talk, let's say ten.

95
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,190
A 10%.

96
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,020
So here I'm going to show the content.

97
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:50,740
Okay.

98
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,420
So we got the contact phone.

99
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:56,940
Now, I want to use a component for that.

100
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,860
Two components create a new file.

101
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,140
Contact this.

102
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:09,220
And here, let's create a contextual context.

103
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,500
From ABC.

104
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:28,950
Here.

105
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,210
Let me just return.

106
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,820
And just just this for now.

107
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,960
That's important.

108
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,810
Let's make sure we're doing it right.

109
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,590
Import

110
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:49,620
content.

111
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:49,920
From.

112
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,310
From.

113
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:59,910
So from here this will go one of getting set components.

114
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,950
I think we just need to go one step more.

115
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:03,870
And so the.

116
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,820
Complement.

117
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,810
One of the phone components contact phone.

118
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:22,460
So from here we go instead of getting set components contact.

119
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,030
So I call it contact.

120
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,640
Let me call this component contact form.

121
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:32,890
All right.

122
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:34,690
Beautiful.

123
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:40,420
So let's continue working on the contact form.

124
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:47,300
So what do we want to do here is you already saw we have to create something like this name, email

125
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,420
and this text area.

126
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:55,300
Now this looks very similar to our sign in.

127
00:08:55,310 --> 00:09:00,320
A sign up is right, so maybe we can borrow the code from there just to make things little quicker.

128
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,230
So let me do that.

129
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:06,590
It's good to sign.

130
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:07,910
Sign in.

131
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,860
All right, sign in.

132
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:15,410
And you can see we're using the and designs form which has its own state.

133
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:20,480
It has its own rules for errors.

134
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,700
So it's it's quite straightforward.

135
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,350
So we don't even need to have our own state agency.

136
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,980
We just use the function.

137
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:35,100
We can access everything, the values from and the form component.

138
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,430
Let's try to reuse differences, copy everything, go to contact.

139
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:49,430
And in fact, literally just get this one pasted here, which will make it must first send this to contact

140
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:49,850
form.

141
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:54,050
Go and talk to and share contact phone.

142
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,350
So here, what we want is we don't.

143
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,380
Need the earth context.

144
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,430
So assume that.

145
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:06,900
Other things.

146
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,270
Let's leave it for now.

147
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:09,560
So context.

148
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,790
We don't need context.

149
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,860
We need a local state for.

150
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,050
Loading.

151
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:17,920
We can have that.

152
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,630
For the contact form we need.

153
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:28,640
Well, actually, we don't need to have our own stud because we using the end from component that gives

154
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,880
us the value straight away to our function.

155
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,590
So that looks pretty good.

156
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,240
So we don't need to use effect as.

157
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:42,790
On fitness, we can execute the function.

158
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,760
So let's.

159
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,650
All these columns remove for now.

160
00:10:59,170 --> 00:10:59,770
Try.

161
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:08,200
Literally save it for now and just work on the phone first.

162
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:14,770
So let's call it contact and then the phone.

163
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,590
So from the contact phone will have.

164
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,170
Name and name.

165
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,000
First fill.

166
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:27,980
Okay.

167
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,250
So the initial Israelis who don't want that to move that.

168
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:40,960
So that's name from name, but it's a that fits in that name.

169
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:49,600
So the name is going to be name the user's name, whoever is sending us the contact form.

170
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,110
So name, E.M. name, email and Mrs..

171
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:53,440
Right.

172
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:56,920
So the time.

173
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,900
We don't need to review the rules here.

174
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,440
We can use the rules.

175
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,570
Rules make it required.

176
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,140
Quite true.

177
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:21,800
And then, if not, if he tries to submit without anything we can to the Mrs..

178
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,150
Please.

179
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,680
And to you and name.

180
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:29,390
All right.

181
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,100
So that's for the name Field.

182
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,850
It's rooms named rules.

183
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:49,680
Through the rules we can use has feedback by the little be to input prefix we can so the icon placeholder

184
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,490
it's the you name.

185
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:58,360
So we can work on this.

186
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,340
I can speak later.

187
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,480
So that's for the name.

188
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,460
Next one for email.

189
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:12,120
So name email for rules for this one required.

190
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,250
True Mrs..

191
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,140
Please input your.

192
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:16,730
Presenter you.

193
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,530
Email.

194
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:21,960
All right.

195
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,640
Has feedback.

196
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:25,890
Feedback.

197
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:31,180
By the way, all this information you can visit the and documentation.

198
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:34,660
Check out the fun form component.

199
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,170
Right.

200
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:35,680
So.

201
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,240
For Emile.

202
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,130
Internet password.

203
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,090
For email.

204
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,370
Also we use the prefix.

205
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,080
We can choose the icon bit later.

206
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,060
Give us a place for

207
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,530
your email type.

208
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,430
It's no dial.

209
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:00,840
Beautiful.

210
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:01,690
So good.

211
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:08,000
One photo for a name makes one for Emile.

212
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,330
And the next one we want for.

213
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,100
Text area for entering the message.

214
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:15,780
All right.

215
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:21,270
So let me just grab this name, phone and make some sense.

216
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,390
Forgot password lets you move it with an event.

217
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,730
So this one for the misses name misses.

218
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:47,200
This name is important because then we will be able to access this later when we are submitting year

219
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,730
80 on.

220
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:51,460
So Mrs..

221
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:57,970
Also we can use the rules require through writing Mrs. Year.

222
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:03,620
I require to please write to

223
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:10,010
Mrs. Input to text area.

224
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:16,370
Text area with capital.

225
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:19,060
Placeholder.

226
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,790
Write your message here.

227
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:29,910
You know.

228
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:35,020
Next one is the last raised button.

229
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,290
Do you call it Summit?

230
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:42,520
Okay.

231
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:44,620
We don't need this link.

232
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,690
We don't need line break.

233
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,430
All right, so we got the phone.

234
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,080
Let's have a look.

235
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:04,130
Beautiful to get the contact, phone, name, email and the text area.

236
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:04,730
Awesome.

237
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,300
That's extra line breaks.

238
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,300
We don't need that.

239
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:09,020
It's.

240
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:12,480
Awesome.
