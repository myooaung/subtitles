1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,220
Now it's here.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:09,470
First, let's make sure we are receiving the inmates counsel long request, Marty.

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:16,740
So we should be receiving a request in body image because you can quickly go to the client post new.

4
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:23,120
As you can see when you make push to request using access, we are sending the images.

5
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:25,020
Okay.

6
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,840
So this should be accessible as requested board.

7
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,000
So let's make sure we have this one before we continue further.

8
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,550
So let's go.

9
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:37,770
So let me.

10
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,330
Let me leave this and just continue here.

11
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:44,860
Let me give you.

12
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:45,460
Just reload.

13
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,320
So let's try uploading the image.

14
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,030
Let's show the same image.

15
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:01,970
Okay.

16
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:05,540
So we don't see anything here, but let's have a look into the server console.

17
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:08,370
Okay.

18
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,930
So we got four.

19
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:10,290
Four.

20
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:17,660
For forming space in our phones api upload images.

21
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,080
Let's take our out.

22
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:23,470
Upload images.

23
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:25,870
Okay.

24
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:26,740
So what happened?

25
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,870
This happens quite a lot of time.

26
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,990
Luckily, I found it right in time.

27
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:39,310
So anytime we create new file in the we have to bring them to index days and apply as a middleware.

28
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:40,900
I guess that's important.

29
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,320
Don't forget that.

30
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:46,030
So let's put let's call it post.

31
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,020
Postcards from the road.

32
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,990
All right, so we need play there.

33
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,150
That's really where it's coming, then.

34
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,440
Pushups.

35
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,640
Okay, now let's try.

36
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,590
I guess we don't see anything here.

37
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:27,960
But here in this borough council, we have got the image data base 64.

38
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:28,860
Beautiful.

39
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,110
So request borrow.

40
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,940
Don't miss.

41
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:37,500
We give you this data so we can send this to Claudia for uploading.

42
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,590
So let me comment that.

43
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,530
So I'm going to use this feature.

44
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:59,730
Let's put this result in a variable called result equals to a weight we use go generic dot uploader,

45
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,350
dot upload.

46
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,140
So this is the function we used to upload.

47
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:04,680
All right.

48
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:10,190
So upload and we just have to give the data that is request volunteered.

49
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,280
All right.

50
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,060
And then that will give us the result so you can control of the result.

51
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,300
So this result will contain.

52
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,040
The U, r, l and the public.

53
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:33,980
So you get to your one with just his two DP and another with his two tips.

54
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,140
Thank you.

55
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:39,880
So let's have a look at this in the concept before we actually send this as this in response.

56
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:41,650
All right.

57
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:46,400
So let me just give a refresh one more time.

58
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:06,170
Now you can see here the image has been successfully uploaded and we got this response.

59
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:07,910
Beautiful.

60
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:14,540
Now, here we have all this information, but the only thing, the most important one is the earth.

61
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:15,830
Sorry.

62
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,370
In fact.

63
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,260
Oh, yeah, that's right.

64
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:21,140
So we go to the URL and secure your.

65
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,690
So this one is only has to be this one.

66
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,730
It has to be is so always used.

67
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:26,810
This has to be this.

68
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:38,620
When I say always it means I mean, if you'll you will be hosting your website with his tips, then

69
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,720
you need to use this year.

70
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:47,680
Otherwise you know to use history if your website doesn't have the his two tips but then.

71
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,600
So if you.

72
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,440
Um.

73
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,090
Yeah.

74
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:58,210
If you would've said it just has to be without censorship, it not secure.

75
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:04,570
Then if you make a request to the security, you might get some issues.

76
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:13,100
If you, you know, from heads to heads to debate and then heads to heads to base, if you make it cross

77
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,500
communication, I think you get some kind of error.

78
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:16,790
But.

79
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:18,950
Yeah.

80
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,490
Feel free to use one, but I'm going to use one, I guess.

81
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:30,180
In Ferguson, obviously, you'll be using the security area, obviously, and you can even get a free

82
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,380
SSL certificate.

83
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:39,180
And most of these must have the hosting visitors and this application will be really hosting the installation.

84
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,270
And there you can use list.

85
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,070
Let's encrypt that free SSL aspect.

86
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:53,970
Also, if you buy a domain, you'll be use able to use the free has to be as secure assistant certificate.

87
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:55,640
All right.

88
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:58,470
So we're going to use the security guard and we're going to.

89
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:02,980
I think that's a in.

90
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:09,680
You can use the public radio really conserving the database if you later want to remove this image.

91
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,660
But since this will be all embedded in the post, we're not actually going to use that.

92
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:23,720
So we can just use the security URL to console.log result.

93
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:30,810
It's coming, get out and instead send the response.

94
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:31,620
A response.

95
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:38,880
Don't Jason know if you sent like this one?

96
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:45,740
If you send the response like this, the resultant CQ, you are ill.

97
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:52,620
If you do this, then you have to access this here.

98
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,470
You do not have to access dirty coal.

99
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,010
You'll do.

100
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,410
I'm very sorry if you do.

101
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:07,440
This, then you have to access the gear and like this one downloaded here.

102
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:14,170
But if you don't use the URL and just send it like this one.

103
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,140
Just send it like that one.

104
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:25,070
Then there is no need to use data tied to the data itself, just the earth.

105
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,230
So let's keep it like this.

106
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:33,560
Keep it simple, because we don't need any other properties to send, so we can just directly send the.

107
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:36,970
All right.

108
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,660
So this is all we need.

109
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:48,220
We are sending the euro and that euro is received here and that is returning to this year will be put

110
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:54,580
all together with the post content whenever we are creating this post.

111
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:17,240
You see, it's grayed out for a while now and it is finally uploaded.

112
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,590
You can see the actual images here.

113
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,200
He can align the position.

114
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,030
Beautiful.

115
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,580
I'll give you continued.

116
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,740
If you want to, you can download.

117
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:30,890
All right.

118
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:31,900
Absolutely amazing.

119
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,210
Now we can write some surface to make sure the the image content within the.

120
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,570
Within the content body.

121
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:46,840
But otherwise, as you can see, the image has been saved successfully and if you reload this time,

122
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:52,840
it will stay here because the URL is saved along with this one in the local stories.

123
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:57,760
So let me quickly have a new application post content.

124
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,380
You can see the images there.

125
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:01,880
If I reload.

126
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:06,470
Still here.

127
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,610
All right, beautiful.

128
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,600
Let me quickly remove the station string of five in a row using animal.

129
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:18,940
Oh, good.

130
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:19,520
Beautiful.

131
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:23,170
Okay, so you can see the content is overflowing.

132
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:31,670
So let's actually put this content, the editor into the deep so that we can put some styling.

133
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:35,540
We can use overflow scroll so we can make it scrollable.

134
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:46,310
So just copy that and then we use Div and put it into the do so in this.

135
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:50,300
Do I want to write some CAC source style?

136
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,630
In fact, it's totally in this t the class name.

137
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:57,650
Let's call it editor scroll.

138
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:00,910
All right.

139
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,390
So we're going to talk to this classmen now.

140
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:12,750
Ed, I think we already have some courses applied, so let's go to the cease fire stance to see this

141
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,010
is supposed minister that is the editor.

142
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,340
So if you're right, click inspect.

143
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,000
You can see this div.

144
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,530
This class name is first mirror so we can give it a height.

145
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,560
Bigger than 200, maybe.

146
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,940
Let's use 500.

147
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,940
Okay, Murray.

148
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:39,220
Still, we have to make sure it is soluble.

149
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,780
So at the moment, it overflows.

150
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,400
So what he can do.

151
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,340
Is due to a flaw.

152
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:53,900
Scroll.

153
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,550
I guess with that you can see the overflowing content you can scrub.

154
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,420
So that's good.

155
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:09,500
Now next thing, you can also hide this school sign.

156
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:17,600
But if you'll notice in my finished project you can see we can scroll, but you don't see the scrollbar.

157
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,230
So that's just for stylised styling purpose.

158
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:28,790
It's fine as it is, but if you want to remove that and still be able to scroll, then we can target

159
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:29,450
this div.

160
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:36,050
Now this is this content is entitled this div editor scrum.

161
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:38,060
We give the class name just now.

162
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,360
Write this one so we can target this one.

163
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:48,200
So come here and let's just write some thesis.

164
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:57,930
So we have to target the browsers, the Internet Explorer and Safari four on Mac Mac as well.

165
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:58,220
Right.

166
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:07,170
So here what you can do is to fix this in the web, get safari browser.

167
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,970
We can use sort of not like this.

168
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:12,870
So here.

169
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,410
Space.

170
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,200
Double calling with kid.

171
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,010
Scrollbar here.

172
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:25,880
What we can do is displaying none.

173
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,350
So hard the scrollbar in the safari.

174
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:40,880
And for Firefox and Internet Explorer added to scroll.

175
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:50,440
Mix of old style none and scrollbar with no.

176
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:56,860
So with this thesis, we should be able to hide the scrollbar while this to be able to scroll.

177
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,410
Yes, let's try.

178
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:04,660
You can see here, you don't see the scrollbar, but you can still scroll.

179
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:06,880
Beautiful.

180
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,990
After we got the title, we got the content.

181
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:18,260
We are able to upload the images as well and resized images embed here.

182
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:25,460
So even when you upload a bigger image, you don't have to worry because we are resizing to 720 pixels

183
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:27,860
with.

184
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,700
As you can see here.

185
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,200
All right.

186
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,550
So that's awesome.

187
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,080
So your content is not too bloated.

188
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,330
It will not be too heavy.

189
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,330
And so the post will load quickly.

190
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,080
All right.

191
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,180
So that's that's important.

192
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,730
So that is done here.

193
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:48,190
And we are able to pick the categories as well.

194
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,440
So far, so good.

195
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:56,270
The next thing we want to work on is the single upload for featured images.

196
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,430
So it is here.

197
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:07,450
So not just inside the editor, but also the individual images we can upload on each post so that we

198
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:11,980
can destroy them nicely when we are showing the post like this one.

199
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,400
So you can see this is the featured image.

200
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:18,850
Of course, if you want to, you can make it fun with and make it look really nice.

201
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,690
And this is the embedded image.
