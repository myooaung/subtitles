1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:00.750
All right.

2
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.510
So we have admin layout.

3
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.920
We have also layout.

4
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.010
Now, are we going to create a subscriber layout because there will be certain pages only available

5
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:11.550
for.

6
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:14.660
For subscribers.

7
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:22.160
Two subscribers will have access to only maybe comments, comments and then profile missing.

8
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.170
Only these two pieces will be available for.

9
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.980
Everyone who logs into our application, they will get the different all of software.

10
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.370
All right.

11
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.380
So let's go ahead and work on that as well.

12
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:43.640
So for that, first thing you want to do is put your back in because we need to make a request to the

13
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.410
current admin current.

14
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.200
Also in a similar way, we have to make a request to get current subscriber.

15
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.620
All right.

16
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.280
So let's go to some of.

17
00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:59.930
Wrote us.

18
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.530
So we have got an avant garde author in his copy.

19
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:11.750
Then put it down here tends to current score to subscribe for this one.

20
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:19.460
All we need is request and we don't really need anything this square signing and if the user is logged

21
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.330
in, that's all right.

22
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.650
So tune this to actually read the same card user.

23
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.370
If the user is logged in, they will receive the response.

24
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.790
Okay.

25
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:29.090
True.

26
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.710
That's it.

27
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.990
That's the endpoint to take for this subscriber user.

28
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.170
Priceless clues that go back to client and pretty months.

29
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.150
We can simply this copy the existing.

30
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.380
The navigation and the layout and make very small changes.

31
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.740
All right.

32
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.380
So let's go to our components NAV.

33
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.790
Let's create the NAV first.

34
00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.030
Let's copy off and then copy on that.

35
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:01.400
Put a new fire.

36
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.340
That's called.

37
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.080
Subscribe now, Curtis.

38
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.080
It's best to turn this from often to command.

39
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.970
F find and replace.

40
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.890
Subscribe and have.

41
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.270
Okay.

42
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.950
So here.

43
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.290
As you can see, these are not used to read out no voice code.

44
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.550
You can see and remove that and move that.

45
00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.870
So anytime you see some of the components in art, you take control of that.

46
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.540
Okay,

47
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.030
so subscribe now.

48
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.100
What do you want to say?

49
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.810
We want to show a few options.

50
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.870
The main one is this from?

51
00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:00.350
Subscriber.

52
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.660
You should be the best.

53
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.720
Their support for subscriber.

54
00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.910
So we have to create a space where they will lend to subscriber

55
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:22.970
posts will not be for subscribers list and that library will not be for that user.

56
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.590
Remove comments.

57
00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.790
Yeah.

58
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.980
We leave the comments in this from having to.

59
00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.180
Scrum.

60
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.810
Profile will be for this.

61
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.250
Users will subscribe.

62
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.960
Awesome.

63
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.710
Basically these all these three bases we need to create, one is the dashboard, one is for comment.

64
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.700
Y is for profile.

65
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.560
Beautiful.

66
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.950
So good.

67
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:57.790
The navigation for subscriber is good created layout as looks it's copy this off the layout copy on

68
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:14.830
create a new file so for now this turns this to command f auto layout since that to subscribe.

69
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.660
Now.

70
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.990
Let me go back to the previous one.

71
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.140
So scrambling now.

72
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.710
So scrapping that, I guess that's why these two not used.

73
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.370
Okay.

74
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.850
Okay.

75
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.850
Also, lay out some family out here.

76
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.490
Let's go on top.

77
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.130
Bring the subscriber in now.

78
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.240
All right.

79
00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:00.350
Brenda.

80
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:01.460
Subscribe now.

81
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:09.270
And when we make a request to use effect, this should be current subscriber.

82
00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:22.100
And instead of automatically so subscribe and then that is all.

83
00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:27.950
All right, so we have the navigation, we are showing the navigation on the sidebar and then we show

84
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.590
the content using subscribe and build.

85
00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.320
Now let's use this layout and create.

86
00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:40.310
Some are desperate for the subscriber and two more bases, one for comment, one for profile, which

87
00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:41.500
we going to implement later.

88
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:49.880
Also bases, we have these two folders, screen and a folder.

89
00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.110
So, Cheryl.

90
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.050
Quit Index fund.

91
00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:03.160
And Next Steps is read out on comments during teams.

92
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.660
And last one to find it is.

93
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.280
Thank you.

94
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.750
So let me grab some.

95
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.420
What do we have here for the.

96
00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.720
Awesome.

97
00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:20.740
So also index.

98
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:25.590
Author index you.

99
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.710
I mean, this communist system makes it easier.

100
00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.250
Good to subscribe to index based here.

101
00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.170
Let me turn this to subscribing.

102
00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.690
I'll be based here.

103
00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:43.650
Also listen to this from offered to.

104
00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:46.680
Subscribe.

105
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.440
This is subscriber base.

106
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:01.770
All right.

107
00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.210
So that's a subscriber base.

108
00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:09.710
That's the best food limits competition.

109
00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:10.500
The best here.

110
00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.000
The comments.

111
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.140
Comments.

112
00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:37.880
Copy, paste and profile through to this to find copy.

113
00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:41.720
Based.

114
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:49.910
And that is all.

115
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:56.570
So we just created this dummy basis, but they have the layout applied.

116
00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:57.770
All right, so let's come here.

117
00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:07.580
Let's try and log in as a regular user so we may have some user friendly name or you can just sign up

118
00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:12.560
any new user after layout subscriber index.

119
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:14.270
So.

120
00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:17.650
Oh, we haven't.

121
00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:18.300
Yes.

122
00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.090
Since is sending.

123
00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:26.740
Comments.

124
00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:28.840
Common sense were intense.

125
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:34.870
And go to profile since you.

126
00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:49.470
You can see when you log in any regular user, they get redirected to slash subscribe and this is what

127
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:49.950
they see.

128
00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:56.550
They have the dashboard, they have the phase, and they have the profile of this beautiful.

129
00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:03.540
The profile has some weird link is fixing it.

130
00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:11.170
Substrate allowed so square.

131
00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.230
And now let's see why that link.

132
00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:16.850
Looks a little different.

133
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:19.000
Okay, so we have like this subscriber.

134
00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:23.230
You can just leave it like that for no subscriber.

135
00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:33.310
Profile.

136
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:42.660
What happened here?

137
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.000
Sorry to be so far.

138
00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:46.840
From far.

139
00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:52.550
Okay.

140
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:57.320
So profile that profile.

141
00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:00.740
So what we did here to let's say is a file in.

142
00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:03.030
Subscribe.

143
00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:05.960
Okay.

144
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:09.680
All right, so let's subscribe.

145
00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:15.430
Beautiful.

146
00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:23.820
So we get the subsequent profile comments and the decimal.

147
00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:24.550
Beautiful.

148
00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:31.870
Now we have the laird for all types of user admin, author, subscriber, author is able to create post

149
00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:34.090
on do delete the same way the media.

150
00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.850
So we've done quite a lot so far.

151
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:47.150
Now, moving forward, we're going to go back to admin and just implement some more things.

152
00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:55.770
We have to two things like list of users showing the list of users for the admin so that admin can make

153
00:10:55.770 --> 00:11:04.860
them give them a different role like offer they can make and can make another admin as well.

154
00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:10.230
If you want to make make them also maybe update or delete as well.

155
00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:11.940
So admin should have that right.

156
00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:13.740
And.

157
00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:22.100
We're going to work on the profile object in our profile, and it will be used for all the users and

158
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.370
you'll be able to object his profile.

159
00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:26.550
Also, we'll be able to upgrade his profile.

160
00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:31.300
So that will be shared across all these different user with the different roles.

161
00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:33.790
And then.

162
00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:45.200
We're going to work on showing the posts, implement the comment system for the posts and there is some

163
00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.090
more exciting stuff.

164
00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:49.180
But as you can see, we have already done quite a lot so far.

165
00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:55.690
So if you have made it so far, which I'm sure you did, you should be really proud of yourself.

166
00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:59.500
So it's, it's it's quite a lot of work.

167
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:02.830
Beautiful.
