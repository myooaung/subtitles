1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:09,570
All right, so let's work on this field so that we can assume the code field and the new password field

2
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,780
for the user to the end of the values.

3
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:13,110
All right.

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:25,350
So here, let's first what we can do here is set this visible value to true just temporarily while we

5
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:31,020
are working it, so that even if you refresh the base, it is always there.

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,930
Otherwise every time you have to send a chill email to see this one.

7
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,610
So if you tended to fuss, you won't see them.

8
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,490
So just so that we we can continue working.

9
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,080
Create these two forms.

10
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,010
Let's make it true.

11
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:49,880
All right?

12
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:54,030
And then come down here and edit me.

13
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,360
Remove that instead

14
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:00,170
if feasible.

15
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:05,420
It is true we can to choose fragment.

16
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,960
So here we're going to put the funnel.

17
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:14,330
So this is the form that we already had, we copied from Solon.

18
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,690
So let me just cut and put it here.

19
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:25,430
So that is for the user to enter the password answer here we can call please input.

20
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,450
Please enter your new password.

21
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:33,420
That's it.

22
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:34,580
That's for the password.

23
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:35,660
And we want to.

24
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,970
So one input for.

25
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,540
Entering the code.

26
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Let me just copy one of the, the previous one that we used for email and put that here and change this

27
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,220
from email to.

28
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,340
To reset the code.

29
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,610
You said rules.

30
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,020
Let's remove that rule.

31
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:05,650
Thank you, sir.

32
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:06,480
Input.

33
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,050
We can sense that.

34
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:11,560
I can.

35
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,660
Placeholder.

36
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,090
Let's call it.

37
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,290
We said court.

38
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,480
It's called Enter.

39
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,200
We said.

40
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:27,620
So let's have a look.

41
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,280
All right.

42
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:37,610
So once the visible becomes true, we so these two filters will one to enter the reset cooler and another

43
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:38,710
one is for passwords.

44
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,470
This make it a new password name.

45
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,080
That is the place holder.

46
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:52,860
New boss.

47
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,280
Perfect.

48
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:02,590
All right.

49
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:03,130
Now.

50
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,230
That is actually that is all we need to do.

51
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:11,130
All right.

52
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:21,660
So let's come here and write another function, because this function was used to submit the image.

53
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,800
But now now we are showing two more fields.

54
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:31,590
And when they submit here, this time it has to submit to a different function because it is submitting

55
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,820
to a different endpoint.

56
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:39,720
So we have to do a bit of a trick just so that it is the same button, but we are now using a different

57
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,060
function, so that's going to be pretty easy.

58
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:50,190
But first, let's write the function as to this function, we can call it reset password, request,

59
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:57,030
I guess, just like we call it for password request, we call it reset password request.

60
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,640
And if you like, you can even copy this code.

61
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,540
We could pretty much use a lot of food.

62
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:11,520
It's based here and it sends this to the reset password request.

63
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:12,630
All right.

64
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,930
So again, we get all the values of the phone.

65
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:17,780
We send the loading to.

66
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:18,150
True.

67
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,660
This time, the endpoint is going to be reset.

68
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,320
Fast forward, are we sending on the values?

69
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,380
If there is an error, we show the error.

70
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,060
Otherwise we show the success message to this time.

71
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:33,960
Password.

72
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:35,670
Since successfully.

73
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:49,300
Please log in with you with your new password.

74
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,110
All right.

75
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,950
Said Flooring falls visible.

76
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:58,650
It would be false.

77
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:03,890
No, there's no need to continue showing these two films.

78
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,470
So we send it back to the way it was.

79
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,490
Just the email.

80
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:08,450
Yes.

81
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,650
We sent it to France.

82
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:13,640
Okay.

83
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,680
So that is pretty much it.

84
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:22,010
Now, there is one more thing we can do that is empty the the fears.

85
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,510
So empty the values.

86
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,570
So you could reduce the use it to other ways.

87
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:32,240
But I think it's it's a good idea to just empty it and just so that no notification in that you can

88
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,440
log in the new password.

89
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:33,920
Right.

90
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,740
So in that case, we have to empty the fields.

91
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:49,430
Now to empty the fields I showed you in the previous lectures how you can do that with and isn't fun.

92
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:52,070
So basically we had to access that from.

93
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,130
Okay.

94
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,130
Thankfully I commented that commented out Tania.

95
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,410
So it's nice and easy to use that's a

96
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,610
wee destructive from from the end isn't fun.

97
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:14,920
A useful function said gives us the form and this form we have to use in the actual form here.

98
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,710
Let's uncover that one.

99
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:22,170
All right.

100
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:28,850
And then we can use this from that reset to reset the values back to empty.

101
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:33,140
Because when the user suddenly they have a lot of these fields, you don't want to.

102
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:35,930
Leave them here.

103
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,230
Right.

104
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,730
So you want to make them empty?

105
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,490
So visible will not be true anymore.

106
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,240
It will be false.

107
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,070
So we don't have to worry about these fields.

108
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,950
But this image we have to reset.

109
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:47,500
Okay.

110
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,500
So that one.

111
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:54,960
And so if everything goes well, we can show the toast notification.

112
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:03,460
And then from that we set fields and you can choose the foods you want to empty.

113
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,960
So in our case, we want just email, email.

114
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:08,790
All right.

115
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,140
So this name should mess the farm's actual name.

116
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,090
So as Smiths.

117
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:20,580
My guess is that we should be able to empty the fields as well.

118
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,160
This one.

119
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,010
Let's send this forward to reset.

120
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,210
So everything should work.

121
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,290
Let's give it a try.

122
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,400
But actually, before we try, how do we actually execute this function?

123
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:36,700
Right.

124
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,770
So we still have the same submit button.

125
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,790
You can see here the form has the unfitness.

126
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,030
That function executes this one.

127
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,760
How do we execute this one?

128
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,770
So what we can do here is we can take the status of visible.

129
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:54,670
Right.

130
00:07:55,030 --> 00:08:00,670
So these two fields are only visible when this value here.

131
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,560
It becomes true.

132
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:05,810
Somebody can win.

133
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,510
We've made it false.

134
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,320
Let's bring it back to false.

135
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,300
And you don't see those false?

136
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:11,630
No.

137
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,100
Okay.

138
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,020
So by default, visible is false.

139
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:23,420
When the end of the email, then if the response was successful, then we said it's true.

140
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:27,320
Now, when the visible becomes true, we are showing.

141
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:32,160
The new password and the reset code feels right.

142
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,500
Okay, so that's good.

143
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:43,500
So at this point, if we are showing these two films, that means visible is true art, so we can use

144
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,070
the same.

145
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,250
Same conditional here.

146
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,050
He has full on fitness.

147
00:08:51,830 --> 00:09:01,670
We can conditionally exclude different functions if visible then you want to execute this function.

148
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:10,150
Otherwise just continue using the previous form for password.

149
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,980
So if visible is true, execute the reset password function otherwise.

150
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,250
Firefox.

151
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,420
Nice new.

152
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,580
All right, so let's give it a try.

153
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:25,780
And now before we try, let's also go to our back end and have a look at the reset posture.

154
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,860
Let's see how this works.

155
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,080
So that's a forward pass.

156
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,900
Well, we already tried that.

157
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,830
Now reset password.

158
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:38,800
What happens is this time we are accessing these three fruits, email password and reset core.

159
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:45,520
So for everything to make sure you do not change these values when you sending from the client, make

160
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,500
sure it is called reset code.

161
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:48,730
It's called password.

162
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,410
Just like we have done here.

163
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,330
So the form name reset.

164
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,190
Don't give it a different name.

165
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:56,960
Password.

166
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,770
Don't call it new password or anything.

167
00:09:58,770 --> 00:09:59,850
Just leave it like this.

168
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:03,810
Because if you change here, you have to change here as well.

169
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:04,830
All right.

170
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,530
So we access these values from request, Marty.

171
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,440
That leading into stability again.

172
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,140
All right.

173
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,610
So we are getting the values.

174
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,550
We are sending the values that will be received here.

175
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:23,550
Then again, we tried to find the user best in the email and reset core.

176
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:28,020
Now this time we're not just trying to find by the email, but also using the request core.

177
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,480
So this time both values should met.

178
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:37,770
So if we find the user based on this email and this reset goal, which was previously saved when the

179
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,960
user requested to reset the password.

180
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,820
If we find the user, then we can do all that.

181
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,210
Otherwise we are sending the error.

182
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:48,000
Mrs. email or reset code is invalid.

183
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:49,160
Okay.

184
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:58,130
But if you find the user and if you the new password is at least six characters long, then okay, otherwise

185
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,090
we are sending the error.

186
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:03,050
Mrs. Caswell, password must be six characters long.

187
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:11,330
I guess after this, before validation, we basically saving the user's new password in the database

188
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,550
so that he can log in with the new password.

189
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:13,970
Right.

190
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,120
So before we save, obviously we have to test the password.

191
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:26,210
So we use this function to test the password and then the user user from the database to this user,

192
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:35,810
we update this user's password to the host version based on this new password and reset going back to

193
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:44,930
empty strings of previously we saved that code intended to do the immunization, but this one we now

194
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:48,920
reset it back to empty string because that has been used here already.

195
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:49,250
Right.

196
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:54,110
And then finally, we send this user with all the senders and that is it.

197
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,710
Then we can send this successful response.

198
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:58,940
Beautiful.

199
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:06,230
And when this response is sent, we are showing the success message password to successfully.

200
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,730
Please log in within your password.

201
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:09,260
Beautiful.

202
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,190
Let's give it a try.
