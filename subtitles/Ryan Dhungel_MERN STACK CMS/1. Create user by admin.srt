1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,050
I we done with media and now let's move on to uses.

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,730
So we will allow the admin to create a new user.

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,430
So let's go ahead and clear the space.

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,860
So business admin, we create a new folder.

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,350
It's called to use this

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,240
list file called New.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,960
You just knew.

8
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:40,740
All right, so first, let's import some folks who need so we need you state from New York.

9
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:49,890
We need the layout, admin layout, import

10
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,480
admin layout from one state to state, three state

11
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,350
components.

12
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,960
The layout had been layout.

13
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,520
Let's make sure components layout.

14
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,840
And now this makes one we need from end.

15
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,650
So we need x.

16
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:27,750
Let's move on that we need to draw, we need call, we need button, we need input.

17
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,750
And we also need to use the tick box component from end.

18
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,390
All right, next one excuse.

19
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,450
We need excuse to make a request later on.

20
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:43,920
Excuse.

21
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:55,810
And we also actually need one more component called Select so that we can select the user role in a

22
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:56,920
subscriber admin.

23
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,340
Awesome.

24
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,350
Next one toast.

25
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:08,550
When the user is created, we can send the notification to import toast form.

26
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,870
We are top toast.

27
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:19,620
And Roland, we need rather to read the reviews once the user is created.

28
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,980
Simple user review.

29
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,360
From the next round.

30
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,710
And to generate the food.

31
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:39,740
So we going to have that feature where you can click to randomly generate the password.

32
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:40,580
All right.

33
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:45,490
So for that, we're going to use a library that's called a generate password.

34
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,440
So you can have a look at that in the NPM as you.

35
00:02:58,490 --> 00:02:58,770
Okay.

36
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:07,210
So that's how we use jet bass will generate and that will give us the password.

37
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,000
The randomly generated boss Rebecca absolute copy that.

38
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,830
And here we are at the front and it's in-store

39
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,150
and it's around the server again.

40
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:31,010
So that one is involved and generated from.

41
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,880
Generate possible, I guess.

42
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,640
I think that's all we need are the inputs we need.

43
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:50,880
Now let's create a component concept new user it to so cost.

44
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:07,000
So here first we want to create a state and then we just going to return the phone, right?

45
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:12,050
So yeah.

46
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,910
Let's work on the state first.

47
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,610
So we need a name.

48
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,500
That Konst name

49
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:28,160
said name to use the next one.

50
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,390
We want email.

51
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,850
So in a courier, in a new user, we need name.

52
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,850
Email, we need password.

53
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:36,950
Okay.

54
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:47,630
Now for Barcelona we're going to by default use this generate to order generate the bustle generated

55
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:50,000
don't generate.

56
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,070
That's the function that will give us the password.

57
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,000
And you can send the length.

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,970
It's how long you want the password to be.

59
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,280
I want just six.

60
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:00,330
Okay.

61
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,830
So that's the password.

62
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:07,290
By default, we will have some randomly generated password in the state.

63
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,440
Next run is rule.

64
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:10,860
I guess so.

65
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:16,440
User will have a role of either admin, subscriber or user.

66
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,990
Next one is a loading.

67
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:25,950
We can use the loading as well and we will also use the tick box.

68
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,480
So if the tick.

69
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,450
Then let me quickly show you the finished app.

70
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:38,640
So if the take, then we will send the email to this newly created user with all these login details

71
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,120
as well.

72
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:49,320
Owens ticked set to Miss Tuesday.

73
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,410
By default it will be false.

74
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,340
And you said that's all the state we need now.

75
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:02,640
We need a function to make a request to send all this information to the back end, to create a new

76
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,030
user.

77
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,480
For that we can call and suddenly.

78
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,760
So this one will be event.

79
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,050
Summit.

80
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:16,560
Event.

81
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,250
Event.

82
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,140
Prevent default.

83
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:24,780
So we will prevent the base reloading and then more code.

84
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,880
We will be writing there.

85
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,470
Let me just see.

86
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:27,990
Just try it.

87
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:28,830
Can't make it.

88
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,100
Really.

89
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:46,710
So if there's any air to my tongue's twisted toast error sign up fail try again let's have some This

90
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:55,730
is enteric and set loading to false When we are ready to make a ruckus and learning to poop and then

91
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,500
the more code will be added here.

92
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:03,190
Okay, so let's walk on the fun first.

93
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,820
Basically, we all have everything ready.

94
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,700
Let's walk on the farm so that we can show the farm to create and use it return.

95
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:12,260
So here.

96
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:17,450
So this is will be available for the admin.

97
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,880
So obviously we want to use this admin layout.

98
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,060
And inside and out.

99
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:31,090
We want to create a room inside.

100
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,440
We want to create a cool.

101
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:38,860
Call him.

102
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:46,180
So I want the column, the form, to be centered in the middle of the base.

103
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:56,170
So for that, we have the 24 column grid, so we can use 12 to the top and then offset we can use six.

104
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,330
Thank you.

105
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:06,700
And here, let me just even just write something just so that we can see how it looks so far.

106
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,980
Used to do is to find.

107
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:20,670
Used to.

108
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,390
Is it?

109
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:29,980
Is something wrong?

110
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:32,640
Okay.

111
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,440
That's for.

112
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:40,540
Beautiful.

113
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,450
Got the content centered on the base.

114
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:49,090
Okay, so let's continue creating the input fields.

115
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,050
So the first one.

116
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,690
Actually, it's give it a head.

117
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:54,710
It's full.

118
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,890
Let's add new uses.

119
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:04,910
Stuff.

120
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:12,860
Bit of a margin underneath, just the margin for the input filled.

121
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:18,470
So margin bottom is let's say minus.

122
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,360
Minus ten things.

123
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,050
Minus picks.

124
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:29,770
It so good.

125
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:30,190
The heading.

126
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:33,250
Let's use the end event input component.

127
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:39,740
All right.

128
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:47,180
So here we're going to use some stunts as stunts going to you to use margin.

129
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,940
So it will be clockwise.

130
00:09:50,940 --> 00:10:00,260
So on top 20 pixel on right there pixel, bottom ten pixel.

131
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,170
And on the left there is.

132
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,010
Okay.

133
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,210
And then the end design input component.

134
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:16,860
You can pass the size for so size we want to use allows now as a placeholder.

135
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:23,360
Let's write the name, full name.

136
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,970
Venue name in the city to name.

137
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:34,790
And then on turns.

138
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:43,700
Obviously we want to update this state using certainly the Valley's name change event.

139
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,790
We give the event we give the event target value.

140
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,920
So that will give us the user input.

141
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,180
We put that in the state.

142
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:51,680
Awesome.

143
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,770
So let's have a look at this one.

144
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,290
Beautiful.

145
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:55,370
Assume that this beautiful.

146
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,320
Now we need to report this form.

147
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,570
Now a few decimal isolated copied input.

148
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,140
So we need one more.

149
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,880
That one will be a for email.

150
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,720
Full name just right.

151
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,230
Email

152
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:18,890
value email on ten sent email.

153
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,120
All right, let's email.

154
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,330
Next one.

155
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,080
In this first year.

156
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,210
Next one will be 4:04.

157
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:41,120
A full name actually passed from Cantor to generate the next round we can use for website.

158
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,490
So let's add one here.

159
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,860
Phones, websites.

160
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:52,490
It said it wants to use state.

161
00:11:54,980 --> 00:12:04,040
We are the user to we are the use it to handle etc. so place for the website

162
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,150
so the value.

163
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:12,320
So it said on ten CET website.

164
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:16,190
Okay.

165
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,560
Name, email and website is done.

166
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,890
Next one, we want password.
