1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,510
All right.

2
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,010
So let's continue working here.

3
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,570
We want to create something like this.

4
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:15,210
So we want to have the form and we use the sidebar for a preview images I see here, we got this column.

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,780
Let's create a column underneath column.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,560
We actually need to column one will take the span of 18.

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,430
And then another one we need for the sidebar.

8
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,510
So said, but we can keep the remaining six.

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,500
So sidebar we're going to use to show the preview.

10
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,640
It means we can just continue working here.

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:47,100
So here I'm going to use input or actually before input I'm going to.

12
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:56,730
So the option for media, which is very easy, we just have to do that and then that will give us the

13
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:57,090
option.

14
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:58,740
Beautiful.

15
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:07,090
So we got that after the media input

16
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:13,420
stuff and we going by some style margin.

17
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,680
Trying to fix so big.

18
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:26,610
So this is a clockwise or top 20, right general bottom 20 pixel and then left the pixel.

19
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,050
Sides with and these are input into the size as well.

20
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:39,380
Let me pick last place holder.

21
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,040
Give it a time.

22
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,120
And then the value to the value.

23
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,100
We can use title.

24
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,410
So we have the state title and said title.

25
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,280
So that means we use the valid title and we have to use it in.

26
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,820
Put something on since event said title even target fit.

27
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,520
All right, so you two can enter the total.

28
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:08,110
Let me copy this and boost two more times.

29
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,430
The second one is for subtitle.

30
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,570
Give it a subtitle.

31
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,760
Value will be tightly set.

32
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,000
Sid.

33
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,580
So don't.

34
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,390
All right.

35
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:32,930
And then.

36
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:35,890
Um.

37
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:43,350
Actually, we just need food in this food and just need to fit the title and subtitle.

38
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,500
And it looks like I actually done nude style on this one.

39
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,090
I just moved it on the first one.

40
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,000
Okay, so total subtitle.

41
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,440
Let's create a button as well here.

42
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,510
So button and click.

43
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,130
We will execute that handle.

44
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,070
Save function some button.

45
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,080
We call it save.

46
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:13,180
And then here on plate handles save.

47
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,810
Type of the button, we can use the default

48
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:25,270
styling.

49
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,780
I think we need a bit of a margin on this one.

50
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:29,700
Margin.

51
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,290
Ten.

52
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:36,180
Pixel zero pixel two and pixel zero pixel.

53
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,050
In all its glory.

54
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,820
I want to disable the button.

55
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,800
Ensure the loading indicates a loading.

56
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,230
And then I want this to take the full width.

57
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:54,400
So we pass this block that will give us this big full width, but also.

58
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,680
So let's work on the previously.

59
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,730
So in that clip we now upload our set from the library.

60
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:03,900
We see the preview.

61
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,030
So for that we have this section here.

62
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:12,840
What do we need to do here?

63
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:19,140
I'm going to use the media context state and take if we have any selected images then.

64
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,320
Before that, let me use India.

65
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,880
Stein Morrison.

66
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,880
For the pixel jr pixel two pixel two and pixel.

67
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:46,070
And then here we take the media.

68
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:50,570
If we have selected media in the context, then.

69
00:04:51,840 --> 00:05:02,400
We want to so that if not, then if you have already uploaded, then that would be here in our local

70
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,810
state full with image.

71
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,120
So if we have the full width image, we show that.

72
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,120
Full weight of women's.

73
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,230
If we have that, we show that.

74
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,500
Otherwise, we don't say anything.

75
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,430
So here may have to write something.

76
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,760
So if media is selected.

77
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,140
We saw the images.

78
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:30,610
And if we have the full with images, again, we saw the images.

79
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,600
So if the selective media is there, we use that as a source.

80
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:48,660
So with a to use 100% width of the sidebar and then source, that would be media selected.

81
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:49,880
You are.

82
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:51,770
Okay.

83
00:05:52,350 --> 00:06:01,930
Now, if you have uploaded and if the image is in the local state we use, actually this one will be

84
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:02,360
true.

85
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,600
The next time user comes.

86
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,080
So you can see here, this is the finished project.

87
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,740
This is our application's title model.

88
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,410
And then this is the subtitle and this is the image used.

89
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,170
So you can see it is already there.

90
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:23,770
So that means once you create for the very first time that the hope is on this content, once you create.

91
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,990
Next time you come here, you will see that.

92
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:32,860
So it's basically like creating a post and then later updating the post, and it's going to be it's

93
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,670
going to be like that.

94
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:39,600
So the next time you come, we will pre populate the existing existing content.

95
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:43,390
So if you had the image previously uploaded that will be displayed here.

96
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,740
That would be in the state.

97
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:49,120
So that means we will use use effect to make a request to the back.

98
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:55,240
And then if the homepage exists, then we will display pre-populated this form.

99
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,010
So that would be like updating.

100
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:57,640
All right.

101
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,910
So image again with.

102
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,690
100%.

103
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:05,230
And then.

104
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:14,450
Source food with him is door to you.

105
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,390
Okay, let's have a look.

106
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,450
I wish you wouldn't see anything here.

107
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,850
Let's pick one Mimi's.

108
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,460
You can open a new one or select from.

109
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,360
Then it's immediately there.

110
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:30,950
Beautiful.

111
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:38,030
Now we give it a total subtitle and submit.

112
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:43,280
No, at the moment nothing happens because our handle save function is not doing anything.

113
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:44,540
All right.

114
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,320
So we can now work on this handle, submit function.

115
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,250
That function gets executed on button.

116
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:52,540
Click.

117
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,020
So.

118
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,330
Hand and.

119
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,390
We have to create the endpoint in the back end.

120
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:07,230
We don't have that yet, but we can still write the code here and then we can continue that in the following

121
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:07,620
lecture.

122
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:21,370
So what we want to do here is we're going to make a request to our banking accounts, data accounts

123
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:29,110
to await execution of post to make a post request to the end point is

124
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:36,430
I think we should call it home base because this is especially for the home base.

125
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:48,230
Considering his two week Axios post, we make a post request to home base and we have to give the data

126
00:08:49,760 --> 00:09:00,040
that would be used to customize the home base and that would be titled Subtotal and then full within

127
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,380
limits.

128
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:02,990
Beautiful.

129
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:08,560
Now the full width image will actually be in the context of media.

130
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:09,470
If we have the media.

131
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,460
If we have the.

132
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:13,320
Selected.

133
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,460
Then we just grab the idea.

134
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:24,110
I guess it's just like before we just wanted to send the idea of the images that will refer to the media

135
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:24,980
more.

136
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:29,720
And that way we can of face the images information.

137
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,060
Okay.

138
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:37,770
So in the beginning, again, we said loading two false stories to true.

139
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:45,810
When we get the data, when you give the response, including to false and if there was any error,

140
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,940
including two false.

141
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,240
Now we have to create this endpoint so that we can save this information for the home base.

142
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,990
At the moment, if you try, this one doesn't exist.

143
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,940
So let's go ahead, work on this route.
