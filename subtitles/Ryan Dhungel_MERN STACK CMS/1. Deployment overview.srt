1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,530
All right.

2
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:06,030
So you have built this absolutely amazing project, and now I'm pretty sure you are excited to deploy

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:09,570
this to the cloud, right?

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:15,390
So that you can use it for yourself, or maybe you are doing it for your client, or maybe you want

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,580
to put it on your regimen or whatever it is.

6
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:22,800
It is absolutely great project and you should to deploy it and show it to the whole world.

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:23,340
Right.

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:31,890
So the deployment section, in the next section, you'll see how you can deploy a react and next this

9
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:39,630
frontend and Node.js and MongoDB it back end both in the same droplet under the same domain, you will

10
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:40,560
be able to deploy it.

11
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:45,480
No, no, I have I'm pretty sure you already know.

12
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:54,480
I have many courses in Udemy, many full psychoses, and almost all of them have this deployment section,

13
00:00:54,900 --> 00:01:02,580
just the very recent one, for example, this one, it's kind of like any of you, any type of project.

14
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:10,110
This is the e-learning marketplace and I build my site called continue dot com awesome based on the

15
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:10,930
same codebase.

16
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:11,740
All right.

17
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:18,570
So you can see here it is a marketplace anyone can become instructor I create courses students can enroll

18
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:20,400
on that similar to Udemy.

19
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:31,290
So this this product that I use the same course in that now this course has the deployment section so

20
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,510
all these videos I will make it available for you into this course as well.

21
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:42,510
The reason I'm not going to blow this is because it's exactly the same and it's exact the same.

22
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:47,050
The react in next year's front in Node.js and MongoDB be back in its exact descent.

23
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:52,720
So instead of doing the same thing over and over again, I'm going to share these videos, the deployment

24
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,540
six and these videos from this course to this course that you are doing.

25
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,380
So all these videos you will find in the next video, sort of next section, and it will guide you from

26
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:12,290
absolute express how to set up to these lows all the way to configuring your server, pushing your go

27
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,060
digital.

28
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:23,550
Everything, all the steps so that you will be able to deploy your project to the cloud.

29
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,420
All right.

30
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:30,540
So with that said, we have come to the very end of this course.

31
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,680
And once again, congratulations for making it so far.

32
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:42,240
And I hope you will be deploying your project and saying with everyone you can see with me as well,

33

34

35
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,850

36

You can miss me if you have some issues related then of course related.

37
