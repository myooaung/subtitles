1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.550
So now we're going to work on this media section.

2
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:03.750
We're going to have the library.

3
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.650
Are we going to be able to upload new images?

4
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.940
So all that will happen at this point.

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.470
That will happen in here when you try to create a post.

6
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.920
That's where we need this media feature at the moment.

7
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:28.020
But obviously that will be used in many of the pages that our main focus at this time being is having

8
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.430
that feature here.

9
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.910
All right.

10
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.750
So when we click, let me see this one finished, finished here.

11
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.410
So when you're trying to upload, when we're trying to create a new post, we want to have this button.

12
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.160
When we click, we will have these two components.

13
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.970
One is the add new media, which is this one, and another one has all the media library.

14
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:51.860
That is this one, too.

15
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.120
Basically these two components we're showing here.

16
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.320
All right.

17
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.620
So let's first work on this by working this button.

18
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.150
It's create a model.

19
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.730
So that's what we're going to show those components.

20
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:11.880
Okay, so let's welcome this button that screwed the model and then we go and start creating these components.

21
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.960
So let's go to the admin posts new.

22
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.250
And first thing we need here to double the model's visibility from true to false.

23
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.550
We're going to have that in the state.

24
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.390
So we've got the visible already.

25
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.220
Can we just turn to what is that do use from.

26
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.900
That's used for I think preview.

27
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:42.320
Okay.

28
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.470
So that visible is used for preview.

29
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.070
Then we can just create another one with a different name and.

30
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.740
Let's call it.

31
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.180
Media model.

32
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:01.110
All right.

33
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.660
This comment on state media model.

34
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:15.030
State media model equals to use date by default.

35
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.540
False.

36
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.010
All right.

37
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.180
So once you have that, actually, let's call it visible media, right?

38
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.500
Visible media said.

39
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.140
Said Visual media.

40
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.530
Then we want the button, so let's make sure we have the button component.

41
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:39.480
This we do.

42
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.220
So we're going to put that button just under the preview.

43
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.760
All right.

44
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.440
So let's follow it down.

45
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.810
We've got this preview button.

46
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.520
Let me just copy this button.

47
00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:03.090
Put it down here and then turn this to other good featured images.

48
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:05.750
Featured in this.

49
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.430
And we can have that icon as you.

50
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.630
Featured in is this run and.

51
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.880
So what are you going to do on click?

52
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:35.860
We're going to double the visibility of that media said to media visual visible media to two.

53
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.830
When this button is clicked, said visible media and visible media will be true.

54
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.860
Then if it is true, then we want to show that model.

55
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.020
All right.

56
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.970
So let me just go to.

57
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.600
Okay, so we got that.

58
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.300
We got that.

59
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.200
Let's have that icon as well.

60
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:55.320
So let's go on top.

61
00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.580
So we looked in for that.

62
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.590
I come from.

63
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:16.720
And that's.

64
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:22.890
That one is called upload.

65
00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.360
I'm not really sure.

66
00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:30.050
Might be.

67
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.760
This might be just a guess.

68
00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.710
Let's try that 920 soon.

69
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.800
I feel that it means.

70
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.820
Let me put that I can here.

71
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:50.620
Okay.

72
00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:51.680
So that's right.

73
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.730
So.

74
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:53.210
Got that.

75
00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.960
Beautiful.

76
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.730
Now, when we click, we're going to show the model.

77
00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.010
So that means we can come down here.

78
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.780
And create another model.

79
00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:01.720
We already have one.

80
00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:03.920
Let's create another one.

81
00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:07.490
Let's give it a name.

82
00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.440
Bit of comment here.

83
00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.500
This one is used for preview model.

84
00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.290
This one will be for media all.

85
00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.750
Okay.

86
00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.280
So let's create the model.

87
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:42.190
So here in the model we're going to so let let me just read down here from the social media component

88
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.560
with two tabs.

89
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.680
So the two tabs will be

90
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:56.890
upload, upload files, let's call it upper files and media.

91
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:01.820
Media members.

92
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.620
Okay.

93
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:04.280
So.

94
00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:11.920
He basically will be showing the two components, but at the moment, they just work on this model.

95
00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.760
So here, first of all, visible,

96
00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:24.340
visible will be based on the stuff that is visible media.

97
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:29.730
If it is true, it will be visible and centered on the base.

98
00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:32.810
We can give it a title.

99
00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.860
Let's call it media.

100
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.060
And then to close on.

101
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:43.760
Okay we use at a function.

102
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:48.400
So basically we want to.

103
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:57.670
Said the visibility falls to said visible medium to falls.

104
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:07.730
And on council to have them do the same thing to copy based on cancel.

105
00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:15.220
Set the visibility to false.

106
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.350
We can give the costume with some custom with that.

107
00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:25.080
720 And we don't want us for the footer to put in all.

108
00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:28.740
So let's let's try it.

109
00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.560
Let's try clicking on this one and let's see if that works.

110
00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:33.480
And you can see it so started here.

111
00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:35.940
All right.

112
00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:36.750
So when we click.

113
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:44.680
We get this model basically here, we want to show the two components that we need to create those components

114
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.970
and just put them here.

115
00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:52.300
We're going to use the attempts to show these components just like we have here in the finished product.

116
00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.670
It will be like that.

117
00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:58.540
Now you also notice that it is the model is right on top.

118
00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.860
And if you want that, instead of being in the center of the page, you can.

119
00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:05.040
What he wouldn't do is.

120
00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:09.890
Actually, it is quite simple.

121
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:16.460
We just don't have to pass that to move the center and that will put it on the top.
