1
00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:01.080
All right.

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.980
So we walked on this space to category we showing.

3
00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.400
On the post that belongs to a given category.

4
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:11.910
All right.

5
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.060
So it's looking good now.

6
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.700
We have done quite a lot already.

7
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.030
All right.

8
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:22.190
So in terms of content management system, we have done pretty much everything.

9
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.690
Just the last one customers left, but otherwise everything has been done.

10
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.510
Now it's time to try to finish off the project.

11
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:39.500
So, for example, we have the post phase, we have the contact with the admin dashboard.

12
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:47.690
Everything is fine, but we haven't done anything in our homepage yet, so let's try to make it meet

13
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.890
attractive, just like I have done in my finished product.

14
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:58.250
So I want to display this full with images, I guess a full with images.

15
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:07.190
And we put some text in the center horizontally and vertically center text with the button at which

16
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.390
this content we will put with this full width image.

17
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.350
So we welcome that.

18
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.080
And then slowly we will try to implement all these.

19
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:17.210
All these things.

20
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.210
So we have this parallax image effect.

21
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.630
So when you scroll, you can see images stays, but the content scrolls through this nice parallax effect.

22
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.970
Then we destroy the categories.

23
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.950
We create this beautiful footer.

24
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.340
All right, so let's start with this image.

25
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.310
So let's head over to our homepage.

26
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.900
Spaces Index.

27
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.890
And we don't have anything at the moment.

28
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.850
Let's remove this decent string of file.

29
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:52.320
And here.

30
00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:02.150
First we can start by creating a head section because we obviously wanted this to be issue friendly.

31
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:03.020
Right.

32
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.570
So we want some head content.

33
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.050
Head title and mental description we can add.

34
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.630
So involves a head from next head.

35
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.850
So pretend we have this written blog.

36
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.280
Let me use this fragment here and here.

37
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.540
It's huge head.

38
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.140
So inside the head section, we want to have title to title.

39
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:47.890
Let's give it a title of, let's say, modern content management system.

40
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.450
All right, let's write something for head and then meta.

41
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:55.470
Name.

42
00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.180
So description,

43
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.050
mental description.

44
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.100
And the content.

45
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:03.690
We can write.

46
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.920
Write something that describes your face to describe your.

47
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.060
So let's say.

48
00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.700
Read latest blog post on.

49
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.890
With development rights or something like that.

50
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.160
So that's how we can add a section then.

51
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.130
Now let me remove that then.

52
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.580
I want to.

53
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:34.540
So here the full with images is all right so that it's full with images with beautiful content, you

54
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.980
know, the title and subtitle.

55
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.510
And but I want to put that in a separate component so that it is a bit more organized.

56
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.660
So let me go to component and let me create a new folder.

57
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.830
Four.

58
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.100
Let's call it Baz's.

59
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.590
Its component spaces are good inside components.

60
00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:01.770
And here let me create a file called full width in this full width.

61
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.960
He may start to use.

62
00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:16.790
And let me bring that first before we do anything import filled with inmates from.

63
00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.100
So we go one step up.

64
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.900
Second group into components.

65
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.740
That one is Baz's.

66
00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.290
Pages.

67
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.530
And what's the food image that.

68
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.490
Food with him is not here.

69
00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.170
Also pages.

70
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.310
Something happened in pages full with images.

71
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.450
Let's put that here under the head.

72
00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:58.150
Okay.

73
00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:07.880
So we I think we need a bit of a gap here slim use how do you with the just before margin itemized in

74
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:14.300
bottom let's say 50 if we need to change it, we'll come back and change later.

75
00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.150
But otherwise, let's work on this fully with image.

76
00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.680
At the moment we don't really have anything in this full width.

77
00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.370
So let me just go here and write some.

78
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:33.450
So you consult with him as to.

79
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.650
Which even we don't even need written.

80
00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.780
We just use parentheses.

81
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.910
And here we want to show the images, right?

82
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.790
So it means that you mistake source.

83
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:56.530
Now you need to have them a nice full with images, nice and big images that you can use as a, you

84
00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:57.850
know, full with an image.

85
00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.070
So let me see if I have any.

86
00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.920
So I should have images in public folder images.

87
00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:10.740
I've got just one default.

88
00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:16.320
So let me use this form for the moment and maybe we can just get some nice images from the from the

89
00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.620
web.

90
00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.640
I guess so.

91
00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:17.970
Here.

92
00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:25.740
Since it is instead public, what I can directly refer to that directory image is less default mode

93
00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.700
debate.

94
00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:38.640
And then also let me just give it a name, famous alternative name for the image and to make it a full

95
00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:38.910
width.

96
00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:43.080
What we can do if we have a look for it now, it's.

97
00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.290
Let me explore.

98
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:50.450
Fully within its.

99
00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.160
You can see it is full width, but it is.

100
00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:06.250
It's quite high, so maybe you don't want it to be that high.

101
00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:11.230
If you have a look here, we have our images goes up to here.

102
00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:18.820
I guess maybe you want to give it a certain height and then this is a nice and big image.

103
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:25.610
So it is full width, but there is no guarantee that it will always take a full width if the image is

104
00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:26.500
bit small.

105
00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:27.040
All right.

106
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.540
So let's see how we can apply some to assist you.

107
00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:39.700
So here, start with we set it to 100% height.

108
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:41.290
You can said the height.

109
00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:43.550
Let's say we want 500 pixels.

110
00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:45.310
All right.

111
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:46.300
And then.

112
00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:49.870
Overflow.

113
00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:54.670
Who flew Hayden.

114
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:00.070
Okay.

115
00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:01.640
Now that.

116
00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:06.210
It doesn't look right and looks like we don't actually need the.

117
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:12.880
This person talk I guess from that wasn't worth that.

118
00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:17.330
I guess that looks good.

119
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:21.430
So the image is it's not Skilling.

120
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.130
So what we can do here is

121
00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:34.990
we can apply this property object fit cover so we can use this.

122
00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.060
And you can see now it's.

123
00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:37.750
No, it's better.

124
00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:39.310
It is not.

125
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.050
It is skilled properly.

126
00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:42.730
That looks good.

127
00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:48.670
Now, if you want, you can go to big something dotcom.

128
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:51.190
You can get royalty free images.

129
00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:52.660
You can download from here and use.

130
00:08:55.210 --> 00:09:06.790
So I want to use some, let's say futuristic, let's come to option, but you can get some nice images

131
00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:07.360
from him.

132
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.260
They look pretty good.

133
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:10.920
Still in the open.

134
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:11.400
This one.

135
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.290
Let's download a few.

136
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:18.140
It's download images.

137
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:22.250
This is the one I used before.

138
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:24.830
Limit download at this one as well.

139
00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:29.420
And let's try one more.

140
00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:30.830
Let's try this one.

141
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:40.470
So you can click through download to the size download.

142
00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:51.810
I'm going to save directly into my project to get into the Udemy Themis good client.

143
00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.020
Go to the full.

144
00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.730
Public images.

145
00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.850
And let me just call it images one.

146
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:04.690
Another one.

147
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:05.630
I'm going to call it.

148
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:08.480
I'm sorry.

149
00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.100
You missed two and lost one.

150
00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:26.670
It means three.

151
00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:36.750
Okay, so let me try using some of the different ones and let's see how they look.

152
00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:40.470
In his warm.

153
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.080
Oh, that looks great.

154
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.370
That looks great.

155
00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.440
That's another one.

156
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:50.760
That's.

157
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.210
No, I think I'm just going to stick with the first one in this one.

158
00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.700
All right, beautiful.

159
00:10:55.710 --> 00:11:02.610
Now, the next thing we want to do is show the content here in the center.

160
00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:06.060
Horizontally and vertically centered on top of the images like this.
