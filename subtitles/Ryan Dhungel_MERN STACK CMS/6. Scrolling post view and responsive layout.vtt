1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:00.870
All right.

2
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.720
So we have the single most viewed here.

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.420
Now, there are a few things I want to fix.

4
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.820
For example, this from the agency.

5
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:08.980
It is a scroll.

6
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.260
So we're using the same editor, the one we used during Create.

7
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.670
So if you go to the decimal, you will notice that.

8
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.180
This editor, we have set the certain width.

9
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.170
That's I think that's 500 pixel.

10
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:30.140
Okay.

11
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.990
So anything more than that, we have more content, just scrolls.

12
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.110
So we're using the same editor there.

13
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.640
We just seen the.

14
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.720
Discreetly opening a new window.

15
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.790
So we still are using the same agent and actually it is editing as well as you can see.

16
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.950
So we have to change that to make it a mutually agreed only.

17
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.120
And we don't want to make it scholarly like this one.

18
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.110
So let's come in and see post.

19
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.410
So let's come down to that editor.

20
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.100
And first thing you want to do is make it read.

21
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.740
Only read only to.

22
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.220
Me too.

23
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.410
With that, you should be able to edit.

24
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.030
So that's fixed.

25
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.430
Next one.

26
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.400
Oh, fix the screw.

27
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.670
Only we can.

28
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.710
We can go to our states.

29
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.000
And that's the PRISM universe of questioning of the editor.

30
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.940
We have sued the height department, repeated listings that to minimum height.

31
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.970
So that means minimum height will be 500.

32
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:51.570
But if.

33
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.810
If it is more than that, then we will.

34
00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.180
We saw that with their teams.

35
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.880
You can see it's no longer scroll so we can see the full.

36
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.850
Full content here.

37
00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.530
There's no spoiling news.

38
00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:09.190
That's good.

39
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:17.470
But if you still go here, we create so use to be able to obviously.

40
00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.200
The more content you have you can.

41
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.490
And it just goes on.

42
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:23.240
Okay.

43
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.430
So that's fixed by default, minimum five weeks in them.

44
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.350
As you have more content, you get to see them more content.

45
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.800
Now you that's fixed.

46
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.960
Next thing is, as you can see here, we have the sandbox.

47
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.560
So let's try to put some content here and let's see how this works.

48
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.260
At the moment, you will notice that there is a bit of a gap you can see.

49
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.950
Then with things a bit of an issue.

50
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.830
So let's fix that as well.

51
00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:03.460
So we to have the draw with the cultural flow that is the culture that is giving us the extra space

52
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.090
on this.

53
00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.740
And here.

54
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.970
So what you can do is you can just remove that, remove that, and also let's fix that soon.

55
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:18.680
It's supposed to be extra small that x is what it is and I run that by mistakes.

56
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.020
Let's fix that to excess.

57
00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.570
And down here to the center is to excess.

58
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.600
And let me add some more content.

59
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.340
Let me just put some maps and text.

60
00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.690
So I have this basic extension called Learn if you don't have anything.

61
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.930
So that that will help you.

62
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.270
Easy to generate some random test text.

63
00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.120
I used to find that if I typed Norman hit that.

64
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.810
You can see it gives me this default content.

65
00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.730
So to use this extension with Vickery and so it's come at six B and then type.

66
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:14.140
Um, and so type let's call it that step install extension and then you know you can type.

67
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:16.340
Laura.

68
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.730
Anything to generate an interest.

69
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:33.160
Your next segment celebrities I have it installed so I'm going to just to use norm 100 down and that

70
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:39.290
gives me some text content here that is something I can use you can see here.

71
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.620
So I had the medicine and you notice that there's no more gap here.

72
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.250
Make me see that.

73
00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:49.980
Now, as you can see, it is.

74
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.440
Up to the very edge of this content, which is not good.

75
00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:00.740
So we need to have a bit of space here so we can use offset with that instead of.

76
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.000
So on the small screen it would take the full width for that to be fine.

77
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.110
So that takes a full with.

78
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.400
In LA is a screen.

79
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.750
Actually in a small screen or so we can make it 22.

80
00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.650
So we have the two.

81
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:32.850
Call them severely left and hearing sort of and let's use six and then we can use that value as objects

82
00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:41.850
to host a parent to push through that story if we're doing an extra last 6 to 8.

83
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:48.540
So I need eight this column and then this column in a bigger screen, it has six times altogether 24.

84
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.210
So with this offset.

85
00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.230
They just want a quiet.

86
00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.940
Okay.

87
00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.660
It's supposed to be one minute.

88
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:00.050
So.

89
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.470
So observe means it would be applied to both right and left side.

90
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.330
So one means of altering the two.

91
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:07.760
One on the left.

92
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:08.390
One on the right.

93
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.360
So my two streams.

94
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:22.240
Then in fact I was just around Austin so trying to do on the small screen and then one minute so trying

95
00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.500
to get the 24 on screen, six and seven on both side one.

96
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.880
It's so it's totally.

97
00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:30.500
The end.

98
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:31.980
Let's come back to this one.

99
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:34.040
This one.

100
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.600
We haven't applied in health since.

101
00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:36.350
Let's have a look.

102
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.020
So that's how it looks on small screens.

103
00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:49.440
So you can actually.

104
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:57.860
You can take a mission, so that can give you the view.

105
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:08.370
You can choose four responsive bullets from Trump for.

106
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.090
So that's how it works.

107
00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.830
So we just need to be there for Martin and.

108
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:17.450
And.

109
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:20.650
All right.

110
00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:21.610
So.

111
00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.190
So let's add a bit of a margin on top and let's get started.

112
00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:35.890
This is also something we're going to work on a bit later.

113
00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:40.380
So what sort of categories with some of the latest posts that we'll work on this from there.

114
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.380
But otherwise, everything else looks good.

115
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:48.860
So now the next thing we want to work on is.

116
00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:55.440
The delete and edit of the post by the admin wrote to him.

117
00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:58.770
Admin is able to create post and feature image.

118
00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:07.290
Admin is able to see on the post in his desk and all of these posts are provided with him.

119
00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:10.230
And we have the single fiat as well.

120
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:11.510
All right.

121
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:13.610
So let's go back to the decimal.

122
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:15.200
So we want to implement.

123
00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:17.080
Yeah.

124
00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:20.590
The editor in chief said at the moment they don't do anything in just the text.

125
00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:22.270
So let's talk about these features.
