1
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:00.870
All right.

2
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:08.040
So let's go ahead and create this parallax image component there, because this music for a while.

3
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:18.390
So this is basically we're going to just write some pieces to set the images as background images.

4
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:19.050
All right.

5
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.700
So let's read that in two components.

6
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.870
We have the pieces.

7
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:25.920
Let's put that here.

8
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.670
Let's call it parallax.

9
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:40.710
Image dances says, okay, so let's create our function, contrast, parallax and misconstrue.

10
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.120
Or we can just use parentheses.

11
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.690
Actually, you.

12
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:53.090
We.

13
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.950
We sued.

14
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.470
Technically we can we can use parentheses.

15
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.040
It's just going to be a single DB.

16
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:03.860
It's all going to apply.

17
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:11.960
The background name is here and then we let's not forget to export default parallax image.

18
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.820
So here we will be the receiving the props.

19
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.460
Since we want to make it reusable.

20
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.270
So when we want to receive the URL of the image.

21
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.090
So by default, if we don't get any the URL, we can use some images by default.

22
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.330
We can display some images.

23
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.030
So let's get some from our public dude.

24
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.950
So probably less images.

25
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.840
What do we have here?

26
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.220
We downloaded frames.

27
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.020
Let's choose images.

28
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:54.980
Do images less images do don't typically use it by default it will be used.

29
00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:01.100
But if we pass any Google as props that will be used and children.

30
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.700
So any content you want to render, we pass that as children.

31
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:11.960
So all the post lists we will pass to the children that we will import this component and wrap our content

32
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:12.620
with this one.

33
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.260
So that's children and it's our blessed parents so that we have a bit of a bearing on top and bottom

34
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:27.240
bearing top, let's say 100 picks and then batting from bottom.

35
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.840
Let's say 75 beats.

36
00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.330
Padding, top padding, bottom children.

37
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.030
There's some syntax error here.

38
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:47.370
You are l.

39
00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:58.330
Children bearing top so that that's inbred that as C.S. Lewis said, this is the default value I give

40
00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:59.110
the default value.

41
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.720
So this is also something you can process first.

42
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.800
But if you don't, then this is the default value that will be used.

43
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.170
Let me add some gap here, because I think it looks a bit too congested.

44
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.890
It's hard to read.

45
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.210
Command, comma.

46
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.230
Lie and hide.

47
00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.350
I'm just going to.

48
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.310
I use FIFO quite a lot.

49
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.490
I get that's nice and easy to see.

50
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.510
So here we want to.

51
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.770
Return the this deep.

52
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.060
And here we going to apply the background image as thesis.

53
00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:47.360
Thank you, sir.

54
00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.900
Staff.

55
00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.370
We read the style and then here we going to render the children

56
00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:59.690
children props.

57
00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:01.790
Okay, so here.

58
00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:08.030
So let's upload background image's background images, use back to a mural.

59
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:15.650
And then inside here we going to use the actual hearing that we are receiving here as a props or the

60
00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:16.370
default one.

61
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.860
Okay.

62
00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.100
So that's how we apply background images.

63
00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.310
I'm not sure it might not work, but we will see.

64
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.600
Background Buddhism.

65
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.560
We can use.

66
00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.270
Center, top center of bottom center.

67
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.830
We can choose those options, I think.

68
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.370
Center, center, let's leave it.

69
00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.030
So what this means is you can see this is the image.

70
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.180
So this is the top.

71
00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.900
This is the center.

72
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:45.560
This is the bottom.

73
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:52.250
So when you set it as a background image, sometimes you may see the top quite a lot and not so much

74
00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.760
the bottom.

75
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:59.360
So in that case, you can choose whether you want to focus on the top center or bottom, right?

76
00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.120
So that's the that's that background position.

77
00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.980
Background

78
00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:07.640
attachment.

79
00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.250
It's a background attachment we use fixed.

80
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.270
So that will give us that nice parallax effect.

81
00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:23.900
But in thought, whatever we getting, that's our use, the default value that's on top, batting bottom.

82
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.720
Also we use that value.

83
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.650
Background.

84
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.730
Repeat.

85
00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.980
Back background.

86
00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.930
Repeat we use?

87
00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:41.440
No.

88
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.120
Repeat.

89
00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.860
We will not repeat the background.

90
00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:46.120
And then.

91
00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.940
Background.

92
00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.350
Background size.

93
00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.450
Use code.

94
00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:04.660
By the way, if you make any typos or if you don't feel like typing all this, you're gonna lose copies

95
00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:05.440
from the source code.

96
00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.460
I'll make it available.

97
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:13.250
Background, size, background and finally display display.

98
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:16.640
BLOCK.

99
00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:23.170
Okay.

100
00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:25.030
So this is a parallax image.

101
00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:26.920
Let's try to use it.

102
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.680
So let's import an index.

103
00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:39.960
Components.

104
00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.130
Basis.

105
00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:46.450
Alex Simmons.

106
00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:48.130
And then we use that.

107
00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.650
Let's go all the way down here.

108
00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:58.900
Let's remove that and use that component parallax in music so we don't have to pass any here.

109
00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.680
If we don't, the default will be used.

110
00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:08.030
All right.

111
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.370
Now, you can see here we have got the images.

112
00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:11.760
Parallax seems nice.

113
00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:12.300
Beautiful.

114
00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:15.210
Again.

115
00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:21.610
Now let's pass this content as props so it will be received as children props and then we will be able

116
00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:21.740
to.

117
00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:28.860
So at the moment you can see hundred pixels bearing on top and 75 on the bottom or the 175.

118
00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:29.660
That's all we see.

119
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.250
But once you pass this content, it will look better.

120
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.210
So parallax in Ms..

121
00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:40.740
This is how we can pass the children.

122
00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:46.440
So the heading and the dif altogether.

123
00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:49.100
Court and pushing.

124
00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:52.200
All right.

125
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:57.520
Now, you can see here we have got the parallax images with the ladies post.

126
00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:58.430
They're clickable.

127
00:07:59.130 --> 00:07:59.600
Beautiful.

128
00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.880
Let's make sure this one is centered.

129
00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.230
And maybe we can.

130
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:05.400
I bless him standing there.

131
00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:13.530
Sir Keir Starmer.

132
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:22.330
Let's center the text specs in center and font size.

133
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:27.900
I want to use.

134
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:29.610
I'm quite big.

135
00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.960
I want to make it maybe 75 pixel.

136
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:38.980
I can get some text said.

137
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:40.370
A

138
00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:43.880
text said.

139
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:51.560
We can apply pixel on top and bottom to pixel horizontally and vertically.

140
00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:59.390
It's in the saddle and the color black and then the text color.

141
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:02.060
We can make it white.

142
00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:07.150
All right.

143
00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:08.810
Beautiful.

144
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:15.210
All right.

145
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:17.360
So that is looking good so far.

146
00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:24.460
So the next thing we want to do is know.

147
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:26.510
So we got that.

148
00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:33.410
So if you want something like this, that is also something we can do and then we can display the categories.
