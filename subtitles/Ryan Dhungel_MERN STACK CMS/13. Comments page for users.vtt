00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:00.960
All right.

2
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:09.000
So we're going to show the comments to other users, admin, sorry, author and subscriber.

3
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.860
And there will be few differences.

4
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.910
For example, they will be able to update the the comment.

5
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.360
Okay.

6
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.220
And then the list of comments.

7
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:26.070
They will be seeing their own comments list unlike m22 comments for an admin.

8
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.620
So let's let me sign out as an admin and let me log in as author.

9
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.160
It will work for author and subscribe both.

10
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.220
So let's start from the author.

11
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.290
The comments, the comments base I think we've done have.

12
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:44.490
Let's have a look.

13
00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:00.030
So bases for comments and obviously didn't create a new fire comments Nazis.

14
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.560
And let me just copy one of the layouts.

15
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.190
Let's grab from the index copy.

16
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.600
Go to comments based here.

17
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:18.850
So what I want to do is I'm going to have all the comments function and all the code in a component

18
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:25.240
so that I can import that for the author and later import for the subscriber as well, so that I don't

19
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.130
have to keep writing separately.

20
00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.180
And I see here.

21
00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:36.520
I'm going to import the comment component, which you don't even have at the moment.

22
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.570
So let me just go let me leave it like this for now.

23
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:50.410
Actually, let's try to have a look why we didn't get to see that base.

24
00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:52.780
Let's go to the navigation,

25
00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.720
the components nav off her nav comment.

26
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.180
So I guess it should be I think that should be also.

27
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:09.120
All right.

28
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:17.010
So that's also a comment and four so square and then let's go.

29
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.900
Subscribe to me.

30
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.590
That looks good.

31
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.610
I can now.

32
00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.820
Yes.

33
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.450
So now we are in the comments phase.

34
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.980
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a component comments and send him

35
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:41.630
comments.

36
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.980
Let's call it user comments.

37
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.970
User comments.

38
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.620
Today's.

39
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:49.080
Okay.

40
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.020
So let me create a function.

41
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.950
Wants to use a common sequence to.

42
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.900
Let me just return.

43
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.190
Something for now, let's say.

44
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.070
Comments.

45
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.660
Export default user comments.

46
00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.160
So it should be down here.

47
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.490
Contexts export default.

48
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.790
All right.

49
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.210
So let's try importing this one.

50
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:53.740
Let's do it here.

51
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:03.840
He's a comments.

52
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.880
Okay.

53
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:22.630
Let's have a look.

54
00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.000
Okay, so we got that component.

55
00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.450
Let's log in as a subscriber as well.

56
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.310
Actually, I have another user called Forever.

57
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.290
Oh, I actually don't.

58
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:51.100
I do.

59
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.300
I just continue with that.

60
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:54.160
Three.

61
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.370
It'd be good to.

62
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.550
All right.

63
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.100
So it looks like this is Arthur.

64
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.840
You can see the desperate looks different.

65
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.100
Let me try different eyes around nine.

66
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.220
Really subscribe.

67
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.610
Okay.

68
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.560
All right.

69
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.870
So you can see the common space issues on it have.

70
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:22.620
Let's go.

71
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:29.550
It's good to subscribe to comments again here.

72
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:37.620
That's important component input and user comments from.

73
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.490
Components comments user comments and we should that you.

74
00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.590
All right.

75
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.400
Now we have that here.

76
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.470
I guess we have for the iPhone.

77
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.390
We have for the subscriber as well.

78
00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.470
Let's continue working on this user comments.
