1
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:03,820
So we have the title.

2
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:07,840
We can make this clearly relate to.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:08,970
We can make this claim.

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,680
So you can visit the post if you want.

5
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,600
Okay, so that's cool.

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,080
So here the accents

7
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:23,380
delete.

8
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:36,570
So I was saying you can make this clickable or you can just have one click link, maybe call it a view.

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,830
All right, so let's do that.

10
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,070
So let's have two items.

11
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,650
So this one, let's call it delete.

12
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:52,340
And.

13
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,540
Only we want to execute Hindu function.

14
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:07,270
And you give the item, which is the comment so that we can send the comment.

15
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,860
I need to delete the comment.

16
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:09,210
All right.

17
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:15,640
To handle delete, we have that we are receiving the comment as an argument to work on this one.

18
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,510
So that is.

19
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,080
But is it?

20
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:26,690
Excellent.

21
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,340
So that's that's one item.

22
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:38,630
Another one we want to create to see the post.

23
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,470
So in the clip from the time, I think it's very attractive to do it here.

24
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,680
Makes more sense here.

25
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:47,990
But if we do it.

26
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,590
We have to use a function.

27
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,060
I think it's better to do it here and we just to use lead component from next.

28
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,010
I think it's duty to link.

29
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,480
Let's make sure we have link.

30
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,640
Yes, you do.

31
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,970
Perfect link.

32
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:13,090
Let's call it view we.

33
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:23,830
So if you the admin want to see the post to which this comment belongs to, we take them then to link.

34
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:26,780
We?

35
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:34,160
It's where victims post stress.

36
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,450
We need to give the slot.

37
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,280
So that would be.

38
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,820
I don't.

39
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,250
Post Ida dot slug.

40
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:47,880
Right.

41
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,320
And let's put it into get back.

42
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:57,810
Beautiful.

43
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:03,530
Now you can see here we can delete at the moment that function doesn't do anything.

44
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:04,880
Okay, that's fine.

45
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,160
Now, if you click view it to take us to that base.

46
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,550
So let me try a few.

47
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:17,170
You can see it Texas that beautiful add to that comments belongs to this post.

48
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:18,400
Both.

49
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:22,850
No.

50
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:23,690
What are you going to do?

51
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:27,960
Okay.

52
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,850
So all these comments.

53
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,150
Welcome to this post.

54
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,220
Let me try a different one.

55
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:42,400
So when you land in the space, maybe you want to take them to this comment section instead of just

56
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,850
directly landing on this space like this.

57
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,820
So that's a little trick you can do.

58
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:53,470
What you can do here is you can send.

59
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:56,610
Slug.

60
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:56,970
Right.

61
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,810
And then use less and then use some kind of identifier.

62
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:04,870
For example, let's use the net associated item.

63
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,120
Don't unscrew it.

64
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:17,040
Now you go to the space and then create a DB with the idea of create a dip and give the idea valid.

65
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,080
Just like you give the class name for sheer size.

66
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:23,550
Give the ID value with that comment i.

67
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:32,720
So let's go find this comment section and use the idea as a.

68
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:40,840
Adam idea has this added value that is in the post slug.

69
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,320
And let's go to the comment section.

70
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,070
Comment from is there.

71
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,400
I think we let's just quit div here.

72
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,540
Accident.

73
00:04:59,340 --> 00:04:59,670
No.

74
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,530
We need to know that comment.

75
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:05,490
And that is here the list.

76
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,600
We have the list.

77
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,920
We can take the user to extract the comment ID.

78
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,330
Okay.

79
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,530
List item.

80
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,210
Item.

81
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,470
Agenda is item.

82
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,260
Give the idea value.

83
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:30,150
Hopefully this one takes the idea equals to.

84
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,960
So just like the class name we would use class name.

85
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:41,450
This one we use for I.D. and that would be item don't describe.

86
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,250
All right.

87
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,290
So this is going to be the comment I.D..

88
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:51,750
That's where we want to take the users when they click here.

89
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:55,030
If you do that, let's go back.

90
00:05:58,570 --> 00:05:59,710
So you want to.

91
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:06,540
When you click, you want to take the user to exactly on this comment.

92
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:06,880
Right.

93
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:08,700
On Code Refactoring editor.

94
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:09,660
If I click here.

95
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,700
You can see I take them there.

96
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,840
So I'd go to defect.

97
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,260
And that was the post title.

98
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,320
And here that comment.

99
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:30,450
Ryan I've actually been issuing the commentary, just seeing the post title.

100
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,470
So maybe I think we've missed two.

101
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:42,560
So the comment description here, let's use that.

102
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:49,790
So we have the description item list, item meta.

103
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,230
We can use the title as well.

104
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:02,860
Description that ends here and then title item to content.

105
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,730
That content is the content.

106
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:07,690
Content will be there.

107
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:10,350
Okay.

108
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,550
That's the comment.

109
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:13,920
That's the comment.

110
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:17,130
So, for example, let's say you click view.

111
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:21,980
When you click view, you want to land in this exact comment six.

112
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,610
Now we can leave comments.

113
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,470
Let me try.

114
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,730
Now we can leave.

115
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:29,270
Comments.

116
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,530
Beautiful.

117
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:33,460
I try.

118
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,430
And test this one in Troy.

119
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,280
You can see.

120
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,150
Yeah.

121
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,620
That's how it works.

122
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:42,400
Texas.

123
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:42,880
Exactly.

124
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,750
They're beautiful.

125
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,000
So that was an extra tip.

126
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,460
You could do something like that.

127
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,160
All right.

128
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,200
It looks beautiful.

129
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,800
Now, what we want is we want this to work.

130
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:54,580
Such.

131
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:57,790
All right.

132
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,610
So let's see how we can do that as well.

133
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,770
So we already have.

134
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,520
The input?

135
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,590
I guess so.

136
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,550
All we need to do is a filter.

137
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:12,570
So the data source comments instead of that.

138
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,480
Maybe we can write a variable.

139
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:20,230
You can't filter comments it goes to.

140
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:27,710
So you can see when it changes the value cured changes in the state.

141
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,160
So based on that, we can filter the comments, comments.

142
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,360
Dirt filter filter common.

143
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,370
So this filter function.

144
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,700
Takes function as an argument.

145
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,990
So we use our function here.

146
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:51,440
So that gives us the is comment from the commenter.

147
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,430
So is comment.

148
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:57,680
We want to check if that includes the keyword that is typed.

149
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:09,950
I guess a comment comment or to look is includes the keyword.

150
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:19,490
If that includes that item you want to filter out and this filtered comment you want to render here

151
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:25,580
I a by default you saw all the comments, but as soon as you start typing something based on that,

152
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:31,820
do you want to filter so copying that value and use that as.

153
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,510
Dr. Swisher All right.

154
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:42,590
No comment, lower case comment.

155
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,790
Also comment dark content.

156
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,070
Right.

157
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:51,390
So.

158
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:57,120
Point of content that contains that common dirt content.

159
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:58,860
All right.

160
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,600
So we got that.

161
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,680
No more.

162
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,060
Awesome.

163
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:07,340
Chris Cillizza, I want to feel that seamless.

164
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:11,360
He can do that filter's awesome, right?

165
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:12,390
You.
