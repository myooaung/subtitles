00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:00.720
All right.

2
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.790
So we have the media, everything is working, single upload, multiple upload, everything.

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.970
Jordan We have the selected file as well.

4
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.090
So the only thing left is when you create a new post, now you want to send this all together.

5
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.580
All right, so let's fix that.

6
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.240
So on.

7
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.870
Submit.

8
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.090
So we have this function that executes when you click the button.

9
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.990
This.

10
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.340
So here in the new.

11
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.810
We have this function handle pop, right?

12
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.610
So we are sending the title content and categories.

13
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.070
Now we can send this featured images as well.

14
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.210
All right.

15
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.050
So what are we can do?

16
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.600
We can call it featured image and the value give.

17
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.190
That will be media

18
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.580
selected.

19
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.870
Don't.

20
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.920
You are out.

21
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.190
Okay, so you want to take you to the media, then try to access the selector and they have that to

22
00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.210
you and to send the.

23
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:08.310
You actually, instead of here, we can save the object, the IED, just like we've been doing with

24
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.730
the categories posted by, you know, all of them.

25
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.510
For example, posted by we don't have the posted by user's name.

26
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.130
Instead, we save the user's ID.

27
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.380
Now, based on that later, we can use properly to get all the information.

28
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.010
All right, so we can do the same thing.

29
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.870
So selected dot id so we can actually send the ID instead of fear.

30
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.440
Oh, we do that.

31
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:38.220
And then when we get the successful response that time, you don't want to keep seeing the preview,

32
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.430
you want to remove that so else.

33
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.930
We do that before we redirect, said media.

34
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.800
Media Show.

35
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.360
Media model.

36
00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.220
False or actual?

37
00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.470
Do not know.

38
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.430
The social media model.

39
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.210
The selected.

40
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.950
Selected Make it district.

41
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.210
All right, beautiful.

42
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:14.770
So when we send, we sending the featured images, and when we get the successful response, we remove

43
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.770
the selected one so we don't show the preview anymore.

44
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:24.560
Now, for this to work, you have to make sure the featured image property is in the post model.

45
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.060
So previously we didn't have that.

46
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.780
This is a concept we thought about a bit later.

47
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.430
All right, so in that case, you want to make sure you have this in your model first.

48
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:42.340
So let's go to your server, go to model model's post and to here.

49
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.990
I'm sure we don't have that.

50
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.860
So we don't have.

51
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.470
So let's end that here.

52
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:56.110
To featured in this we want to add one more property and this one also will be saving the IED and it

53
00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.970
will refer to the media model.

54
00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.170
Oh, that's beautiful.

55
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.500
So once you have that, you can actually save the featured image as well.

56
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.400
Now let's go to the post controller.

57
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:12.680
Control of force.

58
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.850
So when we are creating a post, let's have a look at that.

59
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.550
So when you're creating a post.

60
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.020
We are doing all this for categories.

61
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.010
We create a new post title content categories

62
00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.540
so we can make a small turns here.

63
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.120
So title and content we get in the request body, right?

64
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:47.080
Title content we get and we also get the featured images in the request body.

65
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:54.310
Now these fields are dynamic, so we have to use drug free to give this long categories have been generated

66
00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:02.200
dynamically using this function to get the ideas posted by okay so these fields can stay, but let's

67
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.240
remove the content and title.

68
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.260
All right.

69
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.110
So instead of what you can do, you can just spread out requests for 40.

70
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.180
Now, when you do that, you get the title.

71
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.750
We get the the content and any other information.

72
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.440
For example, if there is featured images that will also be available here.

73
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:26.170
So when you spread out like that, when you create a new post titled Content Featured Images, all of

74
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.830
them will be there and all these are distinct properties also will be there.

75
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.310
And when we save, everything will be there.

76
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.640
I guess to do this, make this change and we can give it a try.

77
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.600
I guess so.

78
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.640
Here posts.

79
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.930
So so far none of the post have the feature image.

80
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.030
So let's try one.

81
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.490
Let's try creating a new one.

82
00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.410
You repost title.

83
00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.120
Let me just to use some dummy down and see what I can find.

84
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.520
I'm still in the Scottish end index doesn't really matter.

85
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.150
School is too beautiful.

86
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.680
And to some categories react note.

87
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.700
All right.

88
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.800
Let me let me see.

89
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.240
We have the featured image.

90
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.620
Let's continue using that.

91
00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:32.910
If you don't have, you can upload.

92
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.320
All right.

93
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:35.220
So let's.

94
00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:38.370
Click published.

95
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.360
By the way, if you want to show this here in the preview, you can do that as well.

96
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.680
But since you already know it will be, there it is.

97
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.600
That's not no point.

98
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.710
But you can, obviously.

99
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.300
So the selected one is okay, so let's click on this.

100
00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.370
Beautiful post created successfully.

101
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.770
We have been redirected back.

102
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:08.410
Now when you go to edit, we don't actually see the the featured image but we will bring that that's

103
00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:14.660
that's really easy since we have these component media component, we can simply bring that component,

104
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.090
put it there, and it'll be very straightforward.

105
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.200
All right.

106
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.150
So let's have a look here.

107
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.540
Let me just give it a refresh.

108
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.960
And moving forward very soon, we will be now able to.

109
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:35.120
So all these posts, you know, landing bays, maybe on landing bays, or maybe clear another base called

110
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.480
Post.

111
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.310
And we want to show all these beautiful posts that we have created.

112
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.200
We want to show something like this.

113
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.310
We want to show like that.

114
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:51.050
So the featured image, so the post title and when they click, we show the full content.

115
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.140
And so we're going to implement something like this, which would be awesome.

116
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:56.690
Let's have a look.

117
00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.530
This is my focus and that's still the old one.

118
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:08.020
WordPress inspired me a library and this one has the featured images.

119
00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:08.920
The object, right?

120
00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:09.820
Beautiful.

121
00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:15.430
Now obviously I've divided is not useful, but when we are sending the response from our controller,

122
00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:21.580
we can use dart populate and that will give us the in more information about the images it will give

123
00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:28.990
us the URL created did push to invoke where we created the post just like here.

124
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:30.400
Beautiful.

125
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:36.950
Now moving forward, we're going to.

126
00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:46.480
What are you going to do is so all the media so here in the if they go to the media library I want to

127
00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:51.160
show all the images available we have in the database just like you can see here.

128
00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:04.220
So when you go here, we saw the existing collection too, and I saw that and I give the delete option

129
00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:04.580
as well.

130
00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:10.580
So we work on this one and then we're going to move on to showing the posts on the the home.

131
00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.170
Home on the page here.
