00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:06.990
All right, let's walk in showing the comments for the admin.

2
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.580
Let's start from admin and then later we implement this to other users as well.

3
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.070
So at the moment comments.

4
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.220
Oh, I guess for some reason we had this admin comment, let's visit that.

5
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.090
So the client base is admin.

6
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.990
Add min and then comments.

7
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.010
All right so comments we don't have let me visit the in the now.

8
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.880
And now let's see what we have here.

9
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.690
And this last comment.

10
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.420
I mean, and don't have the common space.

11
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.510
I wonder how this one's coming up.

12
00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:59.320
Go for it.

13
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.040
I mean, that's the ad.

14
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.560
That's the one that's being rendered.

15
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.120
All right, let's create a new folder.

16
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.690
Comment and said here this could a new file and experiences.

17
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:27.430
So here we can show all the comments and allow the admin to update and delete as 0 seconds comments

18
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.600
equals two that screwed this function.

19
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.480
Return div comments are considered included like the export default comments.

20
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.300
Okay.

21
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.040
So we've got that.

22
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.240
Got the right base.

23
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.960
Now, what do we need here?

24
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.440
Is this like we had in other bases?

25
00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:01.310
We need the basic layout of the common imports, so probably I can go to post index.

26
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.070
So here again, this looks pretty neat.

27
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:15.290
Let's, let's grab this put let's get everything and just paste in our comments index just so that it

28
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:21.020
is easier to, you know, so that we don't spend time writing the import in.

29
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:29.900
So we need the context so you can leave that the post actually let's start from the name.

30
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.690
Firstly change the name to comments.

31
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:37.320
Comments.

32
00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.330
All right, so let's leave the imports for now.

33
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:43.420
Let's leave it like that.

34
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.710
Post context.

35
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.510
We don't need that post list with a need that again.

36
00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.530
So here in the context, we can access us.

37
00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.080
We can.

38
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:00.740
The pay's.

39
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.120
Post.

40
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.590
Let's remove that tweet.

41
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.650
And in the post, the state.

42
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:15.360
So the state we need we can have this keyword, we can implement the service.

43
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.010
So he appears.

44
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.700
So the comments have the presence.

45
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:31.990
And so we should be sending the basic context is it is NC use state to give the default value of one.

46
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.030
And this is something we already did before for post post based.

47
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.510
All right.

48
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.320
So that's the goal.

49
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.020
We inc best here too.

50
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.060
It's not something new.

51
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:44.710
We only tried.

52
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.710
This is comment.

53
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.540
We do store the comments.

54
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:59.230
We can create the state comment set comments to use state materi.

55
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.280
Now when we working on the business and not only pairs, we need to know the total, right?

56
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.170
So we have the root, the endpoint in the back end that will give us the total.

57
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:22.270
So total state total equals to use state give the different values zero keyword.

58
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.660
And then let's also add one more for loading columns.

59
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.410
The default value of fonts.

60
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:44.790
All right so we got the state pays total that will be used for pagination comment to store all the comments

61
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.390
learning and then keyword to later printed comments.

62
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:57.480
All right now what we want to do first thing is when the component mounts, when our user lantern displays,

63
00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.680
we want to fade all the comments from the back end, right?

64
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.140
So here you can see paste post and sort of that we call it fits.

65
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.060
Comments.

66
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:10.800
Yeah, I guess.

67
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.520
Let's see.

68
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.990
This first name, first comment equals two posts.

69
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.870
This one we call it just comments.

70
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.550
Right.

71
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.050
And we applied the is admin middleware.

72
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.240
So that means the admin should be able to access all the comments as long as we're sending the token,

73
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.500
make sure we have the token first before making a request.

74
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.260
I guess a set.

75
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.050
Comments.

76
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:42.760
Sid comments.

77
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.860
And I think we do need this.

78
00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.320
We just need to do.

79
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:59.130
All right, so face the comments and then we don't implement edit for admin because admin if you find

80
00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:03.540
some comments that should be deleted, he can delete.

81
00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.830
But object is not something we implement for admin.

82
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.210
Instant update we will implement for the other users.

83
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:18.960
If they created the comment then they will be able to update I guess to handle delete.

84
00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:20.190
Now let me.

85
00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.650
Let me just come back to this one.

86
00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.770
Let me just delete all this from I will come back to it.

87
00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:35.880
And then here in the layout, you can see what you want to do is we want to show the comment.

88
00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:37.050
So

89
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.030
add new let's remove that button.

90
00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:53.080
So you're heading we can saw the comments and how many comments we have still comments length.

91
00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:01.670
Comments and the search later.

92
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:03.650
We can use this and leave it like that.

93
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.490
We copied this from post so it's useful.

94
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.730
That's good post list.

95
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.070
No, we can have that.

96
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:17.210
Instead we can use the list component to show the list of comments to right here.

97
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:25.940
So here, let me for the moment just use positions three, five comments.

98
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:32.270
No, for I just want to have a look at the comments before we do anything new.

99
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:34.190
All right.

100
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.100
So post 922.

101
00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:42.380
Well, I still don't have that.

102
00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:51.620
I guess we have we still have the post here that should be comment.

103
00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:54.500
So we drop on this later anyways.

104
00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:59.000
So here you can see beautiful to have this source while we have the comments.

105
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:04.070
We have material at the moment that meant we're not getting any comments for whatever reason.

106
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.120
Excuse.

107
00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:13.240
Get comments on some long

108
00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:16.510
comments.

109
00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:27.430
Let's have a look.

110
00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:32.260
So four, four days not found for four months is not found.

111
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:33.560
Comments.

112
00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:34.990
So let me have a look away.

113
00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:41.500
We getting that is good to so take the round post round.

114
00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:45.530
Okay.

115
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:45.860
Sorry.

116
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.050
So we should be sending the base as well.

117
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:49.070
But I did.

118
00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:50.470
So let's try.

119
00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:57.690
So we make a get request to stress comment that she's back takes comments.

120
00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:59.390
Plus we need to send the based.

121
00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:04.270
All right?

122
00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:05.710
No.

123
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:10.320
It's good comment.

124
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:12.240
You still don't have.

125
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:17.070
Three or four.

126
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:28.020
Okay.

127
00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:29.310
So I had a look at this.

128
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:38.220
The error message that you can see here, we are getting this error skip value must be greater than

129
00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:38.670
zero.

130
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:42.330
We we got minus five for some reason.

131
00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:47.760
So what let's have a look in the to make a request here.

132
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.830
Let's go to.

133
00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.720
Controllers post.

134
00:09:59.190 --> 00:09:59.630
Skip.

135
00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:01.090
Okay.

136
00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:01.510
So what?

137
00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:03.460
Okay, so Bayes minus one.

138
00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:04.930
That is one block.

139
00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:11.530
So let's put them in the parenthesis, I guess a place minus one multiplied by puppis.

140
00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:13.690
I think that was the issue.

141
00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:14.030
All right.

142
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.450
So let's fix that with that.

143
00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:17.520
Let's give it a try.

144
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:21.580
Beautiful.

145
00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:23.650
Now we get all the comments.

146
00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.560
One, two, three, four.

147
00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.800
We got four or five comments.

148
00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:29.750
We should be creative.

149
00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:33.340
We should create some more so that we can see how the business works as well.

150
00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:37.510
But it's great we have the comments.

151
00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:43.210
Why don't we try to arrange them as well?

152
00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:46.550
So now that we have a list of comments, limits, comment there now.

153
00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:49.300
So all these comments here.

154
00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.520
Instead of distance, Schaffer.
