1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:00,720
All right.

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,620
So the next thing we want to do is work on the media component.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,510
That's a media library.

4
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:14,380
So here, if you go to the library, you will be able to see all the media, all the images that users

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,210
have uploaded to our site.

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,220
And they maybe they're used in some post.

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,790
Maybe they are not used.

8
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:22,780
It doesn't matter.

9
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:29,460
So whatever has been uploaded or whatever has been uploaded to be used as a featured image.

10
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,890
That is the functionality we will be adding to our post.

11
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:34,390
So all the images will be here.

12
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:34,930
All right.

13
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:41,170
And then here they can go to add a new one, or they can just go to the library and see all the images.

14
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:46,990
And then also they can add more than one just one upload image.

15
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:47,290
Right.

16
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,680
So, so this will be inspired by WordPress if you have ever used WordPress.

17
00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:00,850
WordPress has this beautiful media library section where you can upload the images and later use them.

18
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:07,530
When you are creating post, you can use them to put in your post as a featured image.

19
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:13,180
You can manage the photos in the media library by deleting them.

20
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:13,720
Yeah.

21
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:16,750
So they're going to have something like that too.

22
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,210
You can order more than one bulk upload as well.

23
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,000
So let me quickly show you how I did it in the finished form.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:32,730
And so you can go add a new one to just upload one, or you can go to library and upload here from here

25
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:38,500
so you can of work from here, you can upload from here, you click, you can click and drag all to

26
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:42,850
work and you can see these are the images we currently have in the site.

27
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:44,890
Now you can delete as well.

28
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,760
Now delete is for admin.

29
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,350
They can delete any any images.

30
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:50,980
What for?

31
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:55,210
Also they will be able to delete only the once they're uploaded.

32
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,660
So they will also see only the ones they have uploaded.

33
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,090
So we have that security feature as well.

34
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:12,130
So the media, this is the one we're going to use and then this component will be used in other sections

35
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:12,430
as well.

36
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:17,430
For example, when you are trying to create a post, for example, let's go to.

37
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,140
If you try to create a post and you need a featured image, when you click that, you see we have these

38
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,280
two deps.

39
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:31,100
So the first one, basically this clip to upload is the same thing you saw here.

40
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,320
So that's the component I have used here.

41
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,470
And now in the glacier, that's another component.

42
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,330
That's a library component I show you.

43
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:45,920
So you can see how I'm using the reusing the same component in multiple phases, in multiple situations.

44
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,620
So when they want to upload a featured image, they can either upload one.

45
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:55,970
Now this is this component previously you can see that has one button and nothing else.

46
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,380
So that's that component.

47
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,260
We just saw that in this model.

48
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:07,460
So we use the end event model and we just so that we have the two devs on one tab, they will be able

49
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,080
to upload.

50
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,390
Basically we saw this component.

51
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,530
And on this tab we saw another component called library.

52
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,630
Now just notice, listen to this one and then the library component.

53
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,980
It's the exact same thing.

54
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,740
We just doing this in our model here.

55
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:34,010
So this will beautifully we will be able to use the media component in many basis, for example, here

56
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:37,880
when we are creating and then when we are updating the post.

57
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:45,360
So when we are doing that and also you can access that, you can see this post using the feature in

58
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,190
limits, you can access the same functionality here again.

59
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:58,230
So those components will be used in multiple, multiple places whenever we need to add this media feature,

60
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,310
which is pretty nice.

61
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:07,380
I guess this is one of the strengths of our first team is so we're going to replicate some similar feature

62
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,220
in our application.

63
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:09,450
All right.

64
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,150
So that was a bit of explanation.

65
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,090
Now let's move on.

66
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,440
Work on these media components.

67
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:18,630
So we.

68
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:19,650
Okay.

69
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,600
So we have created the base.

70
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,020
Okay.

71
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:22,830
Actually, we don't.

72
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:32,430
So we need to create one for the new to operate a new media and another one do so on the media in the

73
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:32,910
library.

74
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,340
So maybe we don't have the base yet.

75
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,880
So let's go ahead with bases and work on those components.
