1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:00,840
All right.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:07,860
So let's go to our client and try to load all the images from our server.

3
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:19,720
The components media media library see here.

4
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:22,510
Let's use Busey factor

5
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:29,950
and here let's.

6
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,510
Actually, we didn't need to create a state because we using the the context for media.

7
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:39,850
Right.

8
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,440
So we can use use effect to load all the images.

9
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:51,090
And then when we get the images, we can put them in the media context in which has the array of medias

10
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,550
and the selected one to.

11
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,920
Let me just quickly have a look at that.

12
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:03,570
So we have the array of images we can put to put the the response here.

13
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:04,890
Okay.

14
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,060
So let's try.

15
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,100
Use effect.

16
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,710
So let's create a function.

17
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,630
Let's call it fits.

18
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,680
Let's call it going for it.

19
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,610
Media equals to let's make it async function.

20
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,380
So you could put this function outside or you can just put intent on doesn't really matter, but you

21
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,360
need to make sure to execute this one.

22
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,180
All right, so here, let's try

23
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:56,660
to get all the media cats in here from long.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,380
So we use ecstasy.

25
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,100
Let's import that first.

26
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,510
And let's use that too.

27
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:21,930
That gives us the data and we distribute from excuse to get request to make a request to media rights.

28
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,990
That's the end point.

29
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:25,960
That's media.

30
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,540
Okay.

31
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:39,680
So once we get all the media, we want to put in the state specific media.

32
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,520
So media has other properties as well, which we don't want to touch.

33
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:51,260
So let's use a function so we get previous, we let you verify so previous.

34
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:55,520
So whatever it is that you want, you don't want to do anything with that.

35
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:02,180
You just want to update the images here with this data, which is going to be the array of images,

36
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:02,630
right?

37
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:07,190
So that is all we need to do it.

38
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:13,550
And so now we should have the media has all the media files in the context.

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:22,940
So let's have a look at that so we can use a math function to map all the media's and so them right

40
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:32,960
underneath this drag and drop, I guess here, let me just to use a react fragment so we can put more

41
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,120
than one over here.

42
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,890
So let me just right here from the media, Don Lin.

43
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,010
Thank you.

44
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,280
So here we are accessing media context.

45
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,820
So from there, we can access the media.

46
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,250
Actually, actually media

47
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,340
images.

48
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,200
All right, let's hold.

49
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,980
So we don't see that.

50
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:17,320
So that obviously so you see we have 19 immediate beautiful.

51
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:24,100
So let's map through all those medias and display them nicely here, just like we have here in this

52
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,660
finished project like this.
