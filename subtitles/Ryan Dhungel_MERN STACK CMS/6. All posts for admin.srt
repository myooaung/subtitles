1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,510
All right, so we have the post, we have the normal working.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,190
However, there is a problem.

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:11,670
If you go to your desperate outpost, you don't see any post.

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,690
That's because we have to end our end point in the back end.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:21,840
Previously it was ebooks who wrote posts.

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,100
Previously we had.

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,980
This right pose didn't have zero tolerance, but now we do, so it's no longer work.

8
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:40,970
Now what you can do is obviously we can we can send the best number and implement business in here for

9
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:42,020
the admin as well.

10
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:46,010
That is one way, but I'll show you how to do that.

11
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:52,730
So into that, I'm going to take a different tweet and that is showing all the posts.

12
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,000
Now, that's not necessarily bad.

13
00:00:55,010 --> 00:01:04,760
If you send just the post post title and then the post log this the basic information because here on

14
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:11,730
the post you can see we are sending a lot of data, we are sending the emails, we are sending the users

15
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:12,370
information.

16
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,090
Quite a lot of data is sent.

17
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:20,540
So that can be a bit slow when you are sending them in thousands and thousands of posts.

18
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:27,890
However, for admin we can just send the title in because that's what we are showing.

19
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:29,660
This is a finished product.

20
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,310
Quickly sign in and have a look.

21
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:42,250
So here you can see all we need to do is send the post title and the slug so they can disagree.

22
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:43,840
All right.

23
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:48,850
So let's let's work on this one and then the next we are going to work on is this sorting and filtering.

24
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,760
So admin will be able to see the post.

25
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:57,430
For example, let's say you want to find out this one with the total bootcamp.

26
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:03,280
So going through all of this one by one can take a lot of time, so you can just source bootcamp and

27
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,550
then that would field from a similar mark where you can filter out all this post that are marked.

28
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,130
Okay, graph.

29
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,330
Q All right.

30
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:18,970
So that's how we're going to we can easily sort and filter the, the result.

31
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:19,360
Okay.

32
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,740
So we're going to open that next.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,390
And before we do that, let's fix this so that we can show the list of post for the admin.

34
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:35,680
So for that, we just going to create a separate front thanks to let me copy this one and then just

35
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,160
put it here.

36
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:39,970
I'm going to call it post four and.

37
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,110
Most fine.

38
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,490
Yes, that's fine because we already have the post by other.

39
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,880
So post for our admin we can create this one post for an admin.

40
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:05,730
Let's import this function and go to this controller and let's run that here.

41
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,420
So basically that's going to be similar to what we had before.

42
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:21,780
But and for I've done it in export post post for admin, it goes to async request response try.

43
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,560
Just and error.

44
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,000
Also explore costs.

45
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,280
So you can't post equals to avoid post.

46
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,560
Find another post.

47
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,220
And here we want.

48
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,540
We can select only the fields we need.

49
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,760
So we need.

50
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:58,900
Don't

51
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:02,770
slow

52
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:07,000
dieting.

53
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,880
Just don't take the model post-mortem.

54
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:11,230
Yes.

55
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,200
The title and the slogan.

56
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:16,450
So I get to that.

57
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,480
So since 19.

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,570
And then don't select targets.

59
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,700
So that's all you need to respond to.

60
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:30,770
Jason Post.

61
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:31,680
Okay.

62
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:40,320
So now that we have this end point that will send us all the posts, we can go to our admin posts.

63
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,820
Page's admin posts index and here.

64
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:53,210
We are making requests to post before, but now let's send this to post for ADD.

65
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:55,020
All right.

66
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,330
So with that, it's come here.

67
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,040
Give it a reload.

68
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:10,210
You didn't see post four and then only just opened.

69
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:41,670
I think I didn't go to almost I, I went to Desmond.

70
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,410
They continue.

71
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:48,300
We have the other posts I so we can click edit.

72
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,770
Post less on o k.

73
00:05:59,240 --> 00:05:59,750
So we need.

74
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,250
We should.

75
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,710
Probably we were using the ID here.

76
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,390
Let's go back to Control.

77
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,740
Let me move that and I want to get you.

78
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,950
We may need to select.

79
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,940
Okay, so that's still undefined.

80
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,450
That one is fine.

81
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,690
So something happened in this one?

82
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:37,780
They're fine.

83
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:38,510
Okay.

84
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,900
So let me bring back that left.

85
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,440
We're back.

86
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,480
Click here.

87
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:52,550
So it's more than that just on this one on undefined.

88
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:57,600
So probably we know, but we still have.

89
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,340
That's a bit weird.

90
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,690
So this is the first post.

91
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:08,360
Supposedly that time we did have this slug implemented as something must have been, something must

92
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:08,780
have been done.

93
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,430
So let's delete that post.

94
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:22,910
Yeah.

95
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,170
So everything's working.

96
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,670
It's cool.

97
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,200
Let's try some more.

98
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:36,020
Our posts, by the way, we can do one more thing here, and that is restrict the access to this endpoint

99
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,260
only for the admin because you can see at the moment.

100
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,510
It's open for anyone.

101
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,850
If you want to restrict it, you can do it.

102
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:45,570
Is adamant.

103
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:53,960
Make sure to use request sign first require

104
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:00,150
signing is admin and then post that.

105
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:07,830
No, I think we we get the get an error because that will make sure we send the token and even though

106
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:12,180
we do on the very first time it might not be available.

107
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,250
So we need to have a bit of a tick.

108
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,130
So let's go ahead face post.

109
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,520
It's Axis V of context.

110
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:29,700
Context.

111
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:34,370
Also, let's use that context.

112
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:45,990
Context, Konst said they could try to use state.

113
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:53,980
I sort of returned to use to use context or context.

114
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:58,980
Okay.

115
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,520
And then now we can use that as.

116
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:04,200
Token.

117
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:09,880
And we make requests only if of token.

118
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,210
If only if we have the right token.

119
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,510
Only then we make a request.

120
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:20,100
So that will guarantee we get we give the post I get now.

121
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,970
This time you can see it's a little awkward.

122
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:23,540
Beautiful.

123
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:30,090
Awesome.

124
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:40,120
Now, like I showed you in my finished product, we can implement this certain filtering so that this

125
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,250
is really cool no matter how be done.

126
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,300
But you see in this.

127
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:51,290
Filter out, is it in this is something you can reuse in many other components as well.

128
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,130
All right.

129
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:54,280
So let's see how we can implement that here.
