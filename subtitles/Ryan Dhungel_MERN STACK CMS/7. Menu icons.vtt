1
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.120
All right, so let's work on these menu items.

2
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.700
Let's fix the key.

3
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.830
So we give them to you.

4
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.340
Keep.

5
00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:16.750
So let's start from the top so that from the very first item, we have that one.

6
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.740
Um.

7
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.640
This one.

8
00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:20.900
Let's call it two.

9
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.340
Do this in this country.

10
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.370
This rule is called for.

11
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:32.950
Five.

12
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.200
Six.

13
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.830
Seven eight.

14
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:48.370
Nine.

15
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.460
Ten.

16
00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.180
Love in.

17
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.880
12.

18
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.130
All right.

19
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.460
So.

20
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.640
Good.

21
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.200
Now you're going to be working individually.

22
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.680
You know, if you want to keep them open, I want to keep them open.

23
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.560
Post media and you just say let's take out the Keith Postmedia.

24
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.490
And he uses.

25
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:22.640
To that.

26
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.660
Post to.

27
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.140
Media is 626 and uses 10 to 6 and ten.

28
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.380
We want to keep them open.

29
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.710
So come here and turn this to two.

30
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:42.520
Six.

31
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.880
Did this way as a default select key.

32
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.450
Let's leave it like that.

33
00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.680
So that's a decimal.

34
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.150
By default it was selected.

35
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.180
However, later, when we have all these pages, we are going to come back and fix the active link as

36
00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.360
well.

37
00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:59.170
So.

38
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.760
When you click, for example, all post the page will be different.

39
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:04.840
What if I continue?

40
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.980
SEO will be different.

41
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.130
The sidebar will stay the same, but the content will be different.

42
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:16.150
So that time the page reloads and as a result you might not get the the active link here.

43
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.430
So we're going to fix that up.

44
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.420
We're going to work on how to show the active link at all time, even on page reload.

45
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.640
We're going to worry about that bit later.

46
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.830
So for the moment it looks good.

47
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:34.520
Now let's focus on the icons so you can see here we have the relevant icon to that, the pin that's

48
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.440
the camera icon.

49
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.570
That's a message icon to users.

50
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:43.130
So all these icons I've used from and is an icon.

51
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.830
So obviously you could use font awesome icons or any other icon library we could use.

52
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.400
Oh, they're pretty good.

53
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.800
And they come with the is an icon so why not.

54
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.070
Right.

55
00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:00.970
So let's use them so you can see the ones that are not used.

56
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.690
Yeah.

57
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:02.110
Great.

58
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.670
Outstanding.

59
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:03.670
Remove that.

60
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:10.040
I know that and I know the names of them I guess down to use.

61
00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:19.570
So the one is who's been outlined to that one we use for the post just like you can see here and the

62
00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:27.820
finished with its full screen that's camera misses all that we're going to impose who's been next one

63
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.990
is camera outlined.

64
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.890
All right.

65
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.600
Next one is usr st outlined.

66
00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:53.750
Next one is settings settings outlined in security singularity city setting outlined.

67
00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.130
The next one is background color.

68
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.680
Outlined and then user outlined.

69
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.440
Awesome.

70
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.290
All right, now let's use them.

71
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:15.880
So here.

72
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.070
For the desperate since the deaths were too weak to use sitting outlined.

73
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:33.520
Sitting out about right now for the post they're going to use who's been outlined.

74
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.780
For the media.

75
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.080
We use camera automated.

76
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.210
The next one comments.

77
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:55.280
Yeah we can use I can card various.

78
00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.620
Comments.

79
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.890
Outside.

80
00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.370
So it should be like that.

81
00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.370
I get that comment out loud.

82
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.010
Next one we can use for users.

83
00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.210
That's a user.

84
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.070
Using sweets of alternate.

85
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.170
For the profile.

86
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:33.210
I come

87
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.090
for the profile we're going to use.

88
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.730
And this one's called.

89
00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.470
User outlined user outline.

90
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.650
And finally, for the customer, we use that background color.

91
00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:56.420
I can.

92
00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.240
B the color argument.

93
00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.170
I'm not sure if I have decided to leave this.

94
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.760
Comment outlined is not defined.

95
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.910
I guess it is going to.

96
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:18.410
In this.

97
00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.440
I want our land.

98
00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:24.600
Use our advantage.

99
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:25.840
This government is there.

100
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.460
I guess sometimes you have to give a refresh.

101
00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.100
It must be some type of higher.

102
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.950
Or maybe we don't have some of the inputs.

103
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:46.000
Okay.

104
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.030
I realize it should be colors, not color.

105
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.740
So when you try to import something that doesn't exist, then you've got that kind of fair.

106
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:56.270
I said.

107
00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.800
We call this default and named imports.

108
00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.970
And so hopefully it'll fix.

109
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:06.720
Busy caller.

110
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:12.830
Okay so we fixed that here the input but we haven't fixed down has this fixed that.

111
00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:20.230
So be the callers.

112
00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:29.640
Okay.

113
00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.940
So we've got another area that's quickly.

114
00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:37.140
Let's go through the inputs again.

115
00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:38.730
Know the type it should be.

116
00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.880
The outlook is full speed ahead.

117
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.670
The caps looks at this make it all push.

118
00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.670
By the way, all this component names you can copy from.

119
00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:49.370
Yeah.

120
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:51.390
And that way you.

121
00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.040
Most likely it will make any type of science.

122
00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:00.560
So in, you know, search, for example.

123
00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:04.040
Yes, you can certainly use a street.

124
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:05.150
You copy that.

125
00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:09.440
You get the component copied like that and you can easily based as well.

126
00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.610
And let's hope there are no more.

127
00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:14.620
Oh yeah.

128
00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:15.970
It's one fullscreen.

129
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:17.710
Ah, it's that one we fixed.

130
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.910
You or not.

131
00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:22.340
You don't have to speak.

132
00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:25.330
All right.

133
00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.740
Let's have a look now.

134
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:28.580
That's beautiful.

135
00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:34.810
Now you can see here we have all the menu items with the proper items beautifully.
