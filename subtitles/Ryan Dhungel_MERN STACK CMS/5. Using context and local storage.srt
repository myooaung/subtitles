1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,930
All right, so we have the orthodontics.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,220
Now, let's try to make use of this one, right?

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,090
So when we sign up, we know that we give the user information.

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,530
And talking to that information, we want to see the context.

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:14,730
All right.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,850
So that and also we want to in the local stories.

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,370
So let me come.

8
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:27,980
Let's open the inspect, click on the inspect, open this console and then if you go to application.

9
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:29,670
You'll see.

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,940
We have the local stories section in there.

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,050
You will see the current domain, too, that level of 3000.

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,850
And we have bunch of things saved.

13
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,200
Now, this one is the Chrome plugin, so you can do that.

14
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,100
Tim we said, well, we use light and dark.

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,890
It you can see here it is we are saving the.

16
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:51,750
Local stories.

17
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,170
So whenever user come back again, we always assume the users.

18
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,470
So a preferred theme, right?

19
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,070
You can see changes from light to dark.

20
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,150
We already know that.

21
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:07,490
So anything else, Liam?

22
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,350
Just remove.

23
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,330
You can manually remove like this one.

24
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,600
So you can manually remove one by one by clicking on some members.

25
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:18,490
If you want to just clear out the entire level smoothing, click here.

26
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,090
So you can click here in the applications stories.

27
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:26,410
Come down here and then you can select on that.

28
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,350
And then you can click here to side.

29
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,470
I guess it'll clear everything out.

30
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,590
If you come back here again, you'll see there's nothing there.

31
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,330
Now, if I give relooked, then obviously the thing will be saved here.

32
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,070
As soon as you ten you can see.

33
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:49,920
Beautiful.

34
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:51,180
All right.

35
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,740
So we will also look at a lot of stories and we also look into the context.

36
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,600
All right, let's go to.

37
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,050
Santa.

38
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,400
So on faith we are getting the.

39
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:07,470
The response.

40
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:13,650
And at the moment we're just showing this stuff notification how now we're going to send that information

41
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:13,980
in.

42
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,110
The context and the local story.

43
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:21,740
So console.log data.

44
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,370
Let's call the response.

45
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,750
Sign of response.

46
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,290
Let's have a look at it one more time.

47
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:30,250
Right.

48
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,630
Let's have a look at that.

49
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,360
Let's try Santa.

50
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,000
Run!

51
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:40,560
Run!

52
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:42,930
It's a five.

53
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,210
I think I used all the other ones.

54
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:55,750
To register successfully sign up if you have looking to your console.

55
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:00,730
We got that kind of response and you can see we have got the token and use it.

56
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:06,250
So that is the information we want to save in the local stories and the context.

57
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,090
So let's do that.

58
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,340
So let me come in there.

59
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:14,770
So little comment, save in context.

60
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:22,930
So in local stories, so local, it's easy to say in the context.

61
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:24,670
First we have to access the context.

62
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:31,060
So let's import use context to use context from React.

63
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:39,460
We also need the host context to import context from.

64
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,310
You want to get into context?

65
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:44,940
Oh.

66
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,940
All right, so we got the hook.

67
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:48,920
We got the context.

68
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,100
Let's try to use them.

69
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,600
Context, state.

70
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,620
This local state.

71
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,710
Let's leave a comment and hear

72
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:09,750
us and set up those values we of the structure from the context, using the use context.

73
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:11,580
All right.

74
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:18,190
So once we have that, we can use the set of function to update the context state.

75
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:18,750
Right.

76
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,130
So let's use that.

77
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,130
So said.

78
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,530
And all we have to do is give the data because this data basically has.

79
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,170
The.

80
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,810
Token and use.

81
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:36,590
Good.

82
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,510
See, that's all we had.

83
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,840
However, know actually that that's not who you had to do that.

84
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:49,520
But when we say in the local stories, we have to save as a decent data so we can use this JSON string

85
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,270
file so local stories don't set item.

86
00:04:53,900 --> 00:05:03,320
We save these data, we use the JSON strings for a function so that it is saved as decent data and we

87
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,100
save that as a value off so you can see it.

88
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,490
This said item function has the two arguments.

89
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:16,040
First one is the key, the name for the data that we are saving.

90
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,930
So that's we called it off.

91
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:23,030
And the second argument you can see here is the actual data we got as a response.

92
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,520
We just had string for it and saved.

93
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,980
It's pretty simple to get item.

94
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,440
You get item to save you select.

95
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,130
Okay, so this way we can we populate the context, populate the local stories.

96
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,240
All right.

97
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,390
Now, for the moment, I'm just going to comment this out, all right.

98
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:46,760
Just so that we can see why there was a need to saving the local stories.

99
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,620
And so let's try to understand that.

100
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:54,440
So let's just save in the context now and if you go here.

101
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,360
And if something happened, let's try one more time.

102
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:05,500
Ryan six By the way, we can delete all these dummy users later.

103
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,520
That's horrible.

104
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,980
Let me put this.

105
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,770
This console on the right side of the answer.

106
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,090
Let me register.

107
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:22,080
Okay.

108
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,430
Successfully signed up.

109
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:31,470
Let's quickly have a look at our context and there is user information and the token is that that's

110
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:32,280
beautiful, right?

111
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:39,390
So based on this we can so the currently logged in use this name based on the user's role and we can

112
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:46,890
allow him to click on the despot and then based on his role so we can redirect him to a different piece.

113
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,040
If it is admin, we can take him to a less.

114
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:55,620
Decimal SLAs admin if it is auto, maybe some other place.

115
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,270
You know, we can do a whole lot of things.

116
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,240
The that's the power of authentication.

117
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:00,810
All right.

118
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:06,870
And then later in our server, if we have certain routes that we want to protect only for the admin

119
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:15,360
user, then that time until we can use the token to verify that the user is logged in and also extract

120
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:22,410
the user ID from the token with only our server can do it because only our server knows the secret that

121
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,360
is used to generate a disturbance.

122
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:25,080
Right.

123
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:34,290
So we can extract the user's ID which was used to generate the token based on the you know, along with

124
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:35,520
the secret.

125
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:43,230
And then using that idea we can query the database and find out who the who this user actually is if

126
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,900
it is admin or not.

127
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,140
Right.

128
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:49,350
So for the admin then we can allow him to do certain things.

129
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:55,920
Now you could also send the role from the front in this client to the back end, but that will not be

130
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:02,040
safe because anyone can turn the role and make a request.

131
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:06,780
So we cannot depend on the data that is sent from the client to server.

132
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:13,110
So we just to use the idea that is embedded in this token, which is also only now so we can decode.

133
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:18,960
And then based on that we find the user from the database and then, you know, allow him to do certain

134
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,260
things.

135
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:24,210
Now of course we will be going through all this domestic, so you'll get full understanding of that.

136
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:24,780
All right.

137
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:25,740
So it looks good.

138
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:32,490
However, the problem is if user come back to this application after closing it, somehow the paste

139
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:33,270
gets reload.

140
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:39,360
Unfortunately, Darryl Cohen, this did become empty again.

141
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,380
Right.

142
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:46,530
So that is the reason why we had to also see it in something like local stories.

143
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:54,210
So that way when something like this happens, when the user gets the base reloaded or something like

144
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:57,190
that happens, you can see it in a context.

145
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:04,950
We are we have this huge effect that runs on the component months and it takes for the oath in local

146
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:05,400
suits.

147
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,830
And if there is, then we want to grab that value.

148
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:15,000
Hopefully it states that we we will to use this information and the token will not be lost.

149
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,330
All right.

150
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:20,910
So that's the reason why we sitting in the local stores and grabbing the venue like this.

151
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:26,070
Now, at the moment, if we go to application.

152
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:32,260
We don't have we haven't saved this information in the local stories, but this time, let's do it.

153
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:36,880
RYAN 717.

154
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:38,380
Jim In fact.

155
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:47,470
This pride this time, by the way, we can redirect as well at the moment we stood here.

156
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:53,150
Then if you go here, we have it in the context.

157
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,850
And we also saved here in the local stories.

158
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:01,320
You can see.

159
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,240
We'll just send it in the local stories.

160
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,900
Now if you really go to the base.

161
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,180
Previously, we lost this.

162
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:08,570
Nada.

163
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:14,600
However, since we are using this effect in our context to take if we have the art in the local stories

164
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:18,110
and if there is, we want to grab that and put in the state.

165
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,520
Because of that, even on page reload, we still have that information.

166
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,750
I guess that's the beauty.

167
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:26,330
Okay.

168
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,230
So that's great.

169
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,550
And then finally, let's finish up on the sign up.

170
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:37,130
So we want to redirect the user to some other page when they log, right?

171
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:42,620
So at the moment we only have one admin desperate.

172
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:43,690
We do.

173
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:51,230
So let's not worry about the other user roles the author and subscriber will know.

174
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:57,900
You know, make some changes in our code later, but for the moment let us directly redirect them to

175
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,200
admin desk and that will be just less.

176
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:10,370
And I guess for here to redirect again we have to use a hook from next steps and it's important that

177
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:18,150
it's called use throughout from next to this one.

178
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:23,640
You have to restructure like this one and then let me just write.

179
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:29,670
Yeah, this one is hook const are equal.

180
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:36,810
So you can put it in a variable order and we use this function and we simply execute this, execute

181
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,220
this one that will use this.

182
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:47,130
The functionalities we put that in our variable ruler and this gives us the functionality like redirecting

183
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:48,480
the user to a certain place.

184
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:55,920
For example, if you want to take the user to a less admin based on signup, then you can use something

185
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,330
like row to do it puts.

186
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,630
If you're curious, you can even come to love.

187
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,000
And stick around.

188
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,870
Let's see what we what you can access.

189
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,130
This one.

190
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:15,400
I think it's better to sleep slayer like that.

191
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,500
If you go to sign up.

192
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,060
Now you can see him here.

193
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,860
The senator has.

194
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:36,440
All this information so you know the path nim using the road you can use back to go back to the previous

195
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:42,660
base, you can use PWS to redirect the user to some other base.

196
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,610
You know, it has a lot of this functionality.

197
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,790
So the one we're going to use now is this puts.

198
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,000
I just lost track.

199
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,790
So, Laura.

200
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,840
Once we see the user.

201
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:03,290
Instead of slowing the toast notification, which is not really important for.

202
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,420
No, but let's leave it anyways.

203
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,490
We do it.

204
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,140
So don't lose.

205
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,370
We use the push function and where do we want to push?

206
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:21,410
We want to push to every segment is okay.

207
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:29,770
Now next time we sign on the very first time when the sign of is successful, the user will be taken

208
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,510
to the admin base.

209
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,280
And since we have this log in loading thing.

210
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,850
Are we using that in the bottle?

211
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:43,050
Okay.

212
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,880
So we all adhere to the buffet.

213
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:48,630
Okay.

214
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,760
Let's try one more time.

215
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:56,510
It's clear in the views of Ryan seven, Ryan seven and immediate.

216
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,750
Let's try this.

217
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:02,970
Three.

218
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,760
Who in ministry seven is undertaking.

219
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,720
Let's try it.

220
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,050
You can see here.

221
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:18,240
We have the information here right in it in the local stores, soda.

222
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,040
We have it in the context as well.

223
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:26,490
And then we were also redirected to this list and this beautiful.
