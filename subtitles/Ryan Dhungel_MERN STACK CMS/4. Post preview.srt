1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:01,170
All right.

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:04,170
So a bit of a change in our plan.

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,380
So previously I was saying that we're going to have.

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:14,890
This featured in the section so that each post can have its own featured images.

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,510
But we're going to wait for that.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:24,850
That's because, as you can see, this featured image is basically going to display the library and

7
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,520
add new media.

8
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:30,970
So it's a big six and we have quite a lot of things to cover in this section.

9
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:41,200
So all the media that the entire application will have, you will be able to access all of them in the

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,130
library and then you will be able to upload one or multiple images abroad.

11
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,140
Drag and drop support.

12
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,270
I will say it will look something like this.

13
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:55,630
So this is one component, the add new component we will display like this one and then the media library.

14
00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:01,450
We will show all the files that are currently uploaded.

15
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:04,650
Into our application.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,160
Right.

17
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:11,940
So when you want to add a featured image, you could choose from here, the existing one, you don't

18
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,260
have to always upload.

19
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:16,770
You could choose existing one or before time.

20
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:24,630
You could go to the library and click and drag multiple images uploads and save it for later so you

21
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,950
could use the later as well.

22
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:32,220
I guess it's a similar concept used by WordPress to begin to implement such a feature.

23
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,930
And those images can be used here.

24
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,770
Click and selected as featured image so we can do that.

25
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,510
Or you could just upload individual images as well.

26
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,130
No problem.

27
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:46,000
All right.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,930
So we'll come back to it later for looking at the featured image.

29
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,030
But for now, we are almost ready to.

30
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,760
Save this in the database.

31
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:58,910
Right.

32
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,580
So we have the post starting with the first content we can embed images.

33
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,080
We have the categories.

34
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:11,890
So let's have a button here so that we can send it to the back end to save in the database.

35
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,420
Now, before we did that.

36
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:20,110
We can actually do one more thing, which is not the most important thing, but we can work on this

37
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:20,860
preview six.

38
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,650
And basically, we just saw the title content and that's pretty much it.

39
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:32,390
So basically you learn to use this model more of the component of it, which will pop up like this one.

40
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,600
So let's quickly go through this one and then we're going to work on the button, make a request to

41
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,350
back in so that we can start saving this in the of this.

42
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:47,770
So we're going to import the model component from end, right?

43
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,940
And this model will be visible and not visible.

44
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:52,870
So true and false.

45
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,060
So when it's visible, we will show the model.

46
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,770
Otherwise it will be hidden.

47
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,220
Right.

48
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:02,380
So that means we need to have a state state here.

49
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,920
All right, so let's add one more step.

50
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:15,790
Const visible set visible equals to use state by default, it will be false.

51
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:23,410
Before I continue, I want to move these two functions to a separate file just so that we have a bit

52
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:24,340
more space as well.

53
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:34,540
This is getting quite long, so let's create one folder in this client plan directories.

54
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:40,120
So here the new folder, I'm just going to call it functions.

55
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,230
All right.

56
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,840
So here.

57
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,380
It's called a new file.

58
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,980
Let's call it upload notice.

59
00:03:54,150 --> 00:04:06,180
All right, so here from here, let's copy these two functions and put them here, got from here and

60
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:06,960
just based here.

61
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:13,600
And then we need some inputs as well, so resulting in an excuse.

62
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,940
So let's go.

63
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,220
Let's compare that.

64
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,660
It's cool to upload.

65
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:26,060
Let's put it on top and let's input exercise to.

66
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:36,420
I guess we got the resizing, we resize the image, the upload image that is using X use, we've got

67
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:36,960
all that.

68
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:41,400
So this function gets the file as an argument.

69
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,200
So all we have to do is put export on this one.

70
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,590
We're exporting this file.

71
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,300
So we can now import this one.

72
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,900
We can import this in our new.

73
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:10,180
Import the structure of load from regions to work boosted of three stack of functions.

74
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:17,280
Folks in South Florida, and that is it.

75
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,680
We didn't have to do anything here because we have the.

76
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,210
We have the function.

77
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:25,210
And that function is used here again.

78
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:31,080
And that function knows everything, whatever it was doing before, we just put them in a separate file.

79
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,660
I guess that's a good double thing just to make sure.

80
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,330
So immense.

81
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,010
Let's upload this one.

82
00:05:59,130 --> 00:05:59,430
Okay.

83
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:02,790
Now, if you're curious, you can even take the size, I guess.

84
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:12,000
At the moment this is to me, that's 2100 KB right now when you upload, it has been resized.

85
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,580
So it is uploaded now if I downloaded this one just for a testing.

86
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:22,250
Okay.

87
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,030
Now, let me show you this image.

88
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:30,920
You can see it has been reduced to only 260 foot Kimmy.

89
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:37,400
Originally it was 2.1 and mid that means 2100 Kiwi from that to this size.

90
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:43,850
So it's like ten x reduce the size and you still have this pretty good quality image.

91
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:45,500
All right.

92
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,290
So that's the beauty of image resizing.

93
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,170
Now let's continue.

94
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:51,740
Walking.

95
00:06:53,830 --> 00:07:00,130
And is we going to work on the model so that we can serve it pretty right?

96
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:03,340
So we created the context of the state

97
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:11,320
so we can use that visible value to show and hide the.

98
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:20,740
So we came to we can put that anywhere that's put that we have decided versus let's put that here.

99
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,170
We can put that on the photo.

100
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,600
So we can put a button.

101
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,720
All right, so let's create a button.

102
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,780
I mean, the burden is clear.

103
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,070
You want to show the model.

104
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,360
So we change the value from visible false to true.

105
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,760
Some button click.

106
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:54,550
We use this to add a function said visible.

107
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,990
We make it true.

108
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:56,920
All right.

109
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,150
Let's keep this a button and.

110
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:01,510
Pretty few.

111
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:07,720
Okay.

112
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,970
So let's make sure we have the button component.

113
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:15,350
Okay.

114
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:22,130
So let's make it full with and maybe a bit of a pairing, but let's come down.

115
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,240
Preview.

116
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,200
Bottom line is that this year

117
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,180
we can use margin on top.

118
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:42,340
Let's use ten pixel, right?

119
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,280
Zero pixel on bottom, ten pixel on left to pixel.

120
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,840
It's a clockwise value.

121
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:52,780
With.

122
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,570
With what we use for ways.

123
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:07,010
Okay.

124
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,950
So we got a preview.

125
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:15,810
Now on click, the visible becomes true.

126
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:18,770
So when it's true, we want to saw the model, right?

127
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,360
So we have this column.

128
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:24,140
The model can stay in here, doesn't have to be inside the column.

129
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,550
So we can use model here.

130
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:29,670
Okay.

131
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:34,020
So here in this model, we give this model a title.

132
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:37,830
Preview.

133
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:48,380
You want to center it on the base of centered and give that value visible.

134
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,220
So this is the most important one.

135
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,310
So based on the value we have in the statement, it's true it will display.

136
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,740
Otherwise it would be hidden on.

137
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,440
Okay, also.

138
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:08,160
So this model will have the.

139
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,430
We will slow the buttons on.

140
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:12,940
Okay.

141
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:13,870
And on cancer.

142
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:21,670
Cancer saying in both case we want to say it's a visibility to false.

143
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:22,500
Thank you.

144
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:26,890
So when user type something on the label, say this one.

145
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:31,360
So when you type something, something on the body.

146
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:34,620
When they type, yeah.

147
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,440
When they click here.

148
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:36,100
Right.

149
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,400
So in that when they do that, we closed the monitor.

150
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,260
And then you can serve the custom with as well.

151
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,440
So let me actually save this like this as it is.

152
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,140
And then so you can see the model looks like that.

153
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,360
Now you don't want to show this, okay?

154
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,100
In general, you just want this to work.

155
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,780
So at the moment it works.

156
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,370
You can see beautiful.

157
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:04,310
Now, one thing I want to fix is I want to hide these buttons.

158
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,780
So for that, you can use which are no.

159
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,130
So that will hide them.

160
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:14,120
And you can see the width is here this big with no.

161
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:17,880
If you want to make it bigger, probably it's a good idea to make it bigger and bigger.

162
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,210
So it's a preview of the post.

163
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:24,500
So let's make it bigger by passing a custom size.

164
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:32,120
So with again, person seven 2900 just use 17.

165
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:39,270
Now that looks bigger and it's a bit wider.

166
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,440
Now we don't have any content on it.

167
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,200
So the content here.

168
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:46,050
So in the model, we want to show the title.

169
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:46,410
Right.

170
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,310
So that's it.

171
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:50,970
Page one title.

172
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,780
And then you want to show the feature they miss.

173
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,910
Later at the moon, we don't have.

174
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,960
We want to show the editor and it's the content.

175
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:05,050
Now, this one again.

176
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,750
Let me just go back to my editor here.

177
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,790
And let me just copy everything here.

178
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,560
I guess I am in control of that.

179
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,190
Replace that.

180
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,130
So we need to use the team so that we leave.

181
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:26,740
That default value will be content.

182
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,840
And we didn't need to upload and content because this is only for sharing.

183
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:37,070
So we'd only make it true.

184
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:42,980
If you don't do, then it will be editorial content, which is not something you want to read.

185
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,820
Only true.

186
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:45,980
All right.

187
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:46,880
So let's have a look.

188
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:54,150
That's how we can show the preview in this monologue until we have the content heading into the editor.

189
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:56,870
You could show the categories as well if you want to him.

190
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,590
Now let's try.

191
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:05,190
You can see the previous year we get the title.

192
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,000
We got the quantum.

193
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:06,780
Awesome.

194
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:15,490
Now if you ask for the categories or again the same this select component.

195
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,780
All you have to do is copy that and put it here.

196
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,940
But I think that's not necessary.

197
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,980
It's clearly here.

198
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,010
So we just saw the total country also.

199
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,120
Okay.

200
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:30,920
And so we are ready to send the store back in.

201
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:36,320
So let's work on the a function that works, that gets executed.

202
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:42,650
When the department is clean.

203
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,150
Now we don't even have the buttons.

204
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:49,040
Let's create a button that is called something like this, called published.

205
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:55,580
And then we make a request to a back end with the title content categories, and then we send it so

206
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,800
that we can start saving in the database.
