1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,040
All right, let's go to the back end.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,310
And you can see we are making a to object to by admin.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,900
Let's create another one.

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,810
Another out called object user by.

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:20,620
By anyone, you know, object user by user, we can call them.

6
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,790
So let's go to server.

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:34,930
Wrote us a copy, then placed him a bill to use it by user if we are signing.

8
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,850
This is the one we need to remove.

9
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,650
That's the issue of the user by user.

10
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,130
Okay, let's write this function.

11
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:49,390
Okay, let's go to this controller.

12
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:56,080
Now, that will be very similar to abilities of admin so we can copy this function properly.

13
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:05,600
We've done here and the difference is going to be obviously it sends the name to by user and here what

14
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,100
do you going to do?

15
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,650
Is we going to check if.

16
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,790
This user use user from DV.

17
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:22,820
So if this user and the logged in user is simply because we want to make sure only the users are updating

18
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,890
their profile, not everyone else's profile.

19
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:25,910
So here.

20
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:35,010
I think if you do it himself or herself.

21
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:35,490
Right.

22
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:36,750
So of course.

23
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:43,380
So you're not going to take if you are from DB

24
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:54,890
if you are from DB and we compare the I.D. I.D. to string equals equals equals.

25
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,640
This use not equals.

26
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:05,070
So if you use it from database, that user side does not mess the currently logged in use society.

27
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,080
Then this user is trying to do something wrong, right?

28
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:18,090
So in that case, we can send we can send response status.

29
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:25,220
Well, actually we are showing the JSON response we could send there.

30
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:29,300
Mrs. Response Status 403.

31
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,790
Don't send your content.

32
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:35,260
Well, you can.

33
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:35,860
You, Jason.

34
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,340
You're not allowed to use it.

35
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,500
We can send something like that.

36
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:48,210
So that will prevent the user from doing anything extra, anything that I get.

37
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:54,850
But otherwise, everything else can say, Listen, I guess we have the validation, we have the profile

38
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,600
update.

39
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,920
Everything is fine.

40
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,210
You just have to do that.

41
00:02:58,810 --> 00:02:59,260
Beautiful.

42
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,370
All right.

43
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:04,150
So that means now back to our page here.

44
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:14,830
Now, you can see if this profile page is being accessed by user other than admin, then this turns

45
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:15,520
to user.

46
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,520
Otherwise we it should be admin.

47
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,190
So let's try to pass this value here.

48
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:28,390
Let's try to pass this value either admin or user edition that we can make this dynamic.

49
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:31,150
All right.

50
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:35,230
So let's go to this profile of dead first and here.

51
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,110
What I'm going to do is I'm going to destroy the base.

52
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:48,220
And by default, we use and so by default, we will assume that the profile update component will be

53
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,990
used for admin, right?

54
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:54,460
So by default assignment, that's fine to use this base variable.

55
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:05,340
And you know wrote admin this part just the end product we replace with basis I guess so by default

56
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,930
or bridge user by admin it will be because the is different values admin.

57
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:15,210
However, whenever this component is being used in.

58
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:17,780
Here.

59
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:22,300
You can see not in the ad, but in the author and subscribers.

60
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:30,670
We will give the different value so that the request will be sent to different abilities and by user.

61
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,510
So that's how we are going to make it dynamic.

62
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:44,560
So I mean also add here we can fast the dynamic properties and this time we give user sort of a value

63
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,990
give that where the request will be sent.

64
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,110
And we want to do the same for a subscriber.

65
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:55,430
All right, beautiful.

66
00:04:55,790 --> 00:05:02,450
Now, if you are a subscriber, also, when you submit this form, it will be sent to.

67
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,870
Update user by user.

68
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,110
In that way, it should work.

69
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:14,750
All right, so let's try this.

70
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:19,550
Use software to run the images and then.

71
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:30,710
Let's say I want to give them a name like that website.

72
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:36,800
Ryan Genuine Dotcom Subscribe now.

73
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,200
Okay, so there are a few things we have to do very soon.

74
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,490
Allow the user to change the rules from here.

75
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:45,590
Again, they should submit.

76
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:46,670
It works again.

77
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,360
It works.

78
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:55,430
And if you take here helps you can see the request has been sent to.

79
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,580
Update user by user.

80
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:01,960
All right, so that's good.

81
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:02,840
It works.

82
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,330
Now let's fix a few things.

83
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,890
This rule option shouldn't be here.

84
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:13,800
And for subscribing, we should show this media as well.

85
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:19,030
So subscriber will not have this functionality because they cannot upload the file.

86
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,370
They're going to speak from the media library.

87
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,720
If you want, you can leave it, but we will not allow them to update.

88
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,490
So let's come here

89
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,710
just for a security reason.

90
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,540
You can see this.

91
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:43,810
Even though we disable this field, users could be sending their rules using some other tools.

92
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,640
And that's not something we want.

93
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:50,830
We want to make sure that this cannot be compromised because if they can become admin, they can do

94
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:51,580
a lot of things.

95
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,510
So let's remove that functionality from our controller too.

96
00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:00,100
So you can to update user by user here, let's remove this rule.

97
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:08,260
So rule will be updating using this function.

98
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:14,530
Okay.

99
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,530
So back to profile updates.

100
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:20,230
So here we want to hide the role.

101
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:29,860
Actually, we should hide the role role input all together for author and subscribe I see here role.

102
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,780
So we get the base.

103
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:40,140
So based on that, we can do some conditional rendering.

104
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:53,240
Is equals equals equals admin and we so, so only for the admin.

105
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,100
We are showing these options.

106
00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:03,230
So it's not that beautiful now since we have removed that role functionality from the control.

107
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:09,110
So even though somehow they were able to send it, it won't be operating in the back end.

108
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,020
All right.

109
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,520
That's good for our road.

110
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,680
Next one for media.

111
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,100
Media is here.

112
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,150
Again.

113
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,770
See here, what I'm going to do is.

114
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:30,150
It would signal a cause and mean.

115
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:46,740
Actually, we can do this because we want to show this to author as well and we passing on it is working

116
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:47,090
on it.

117
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,420
So that's an easy way to fix this.

118
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,420
So we have access to the currently logged in user.

119
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:59,060
So if the currently logged in users have all these subscriber, then we don't want to show this one.

120
00:08:59,270 --> 00:08:59,510
Right.

121
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:10,540
So us user or not equals equals.

122
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,290
Subscribe then only then we social media.

123
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,320
If it is not subscribed, then only then we show media.

124
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,060
All right.

125
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,800
Now, you can see here the subscriber can update on the name, you mean.

126
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,520
Only name, email, website and password.

127
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:40,260
All right.

128
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,530
So that was beautiful.

129
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,600
Sign out that sign.

130
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,470
And as also.

131
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:48,610
Profile.

132
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:58,690
Okay.

133
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:00,850
So you can see here he can update.

134
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,710
He has the options for media.

135
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:10,600
If he has the existing media, then we should show that.

136
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:22,450
I'm dead so we can go on to the best food.

137
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,080
Come here.

138
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,930
We should add existing media on.

139
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:26,740
Please reload.

140
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,280
We saw that sweater looks good.

141
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,060
Perfect.

142
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:36,020
And obviously for it wouldn't work for Edmund as well.

143
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:50,510
Beautiful.

144
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:57,520
He can again continue using it.

145
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,200
You can just go from here as well.

146
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:02,090
It's the same thing and same with the other uses.

147
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,810
One, two.

148
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,070
This is a subscriber.

149
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:11,860
Also this autumn round three subscriber lists.

150
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,560
Let me try changing the rules to offer.

151
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,480
Beautiful scumbag.

152
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,160
Ryan.

153
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,600
Three other beautiful.

154
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:46,540
I guess I had a look around why I see this disabled and I figured out the reason is when we upgrade

155
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,080
the user.

156
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:52,750
If you come back to the update profile here, so we have this function when we upgrade the user, we

157
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,500
get the response.

158
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:59,740
When we get the response, we update the local stories based on the response we've got.

159
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:06,220
So as an admin, when admin objects, he's not updating one of his profiles, he's upgrading other people's

160
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:06,790
profiles.

161
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:11,950
But with and thing is a really good idea, to be honest, we shouldn't be updating our this profile,

162
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:17,110
but it can be useful to change the the role.

163
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,190
But you know the use case is turned really doesn't really make sense.

164
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,400
What anyways we have that functionality.

165
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:32,740
So what happens is when it is updated we get the response to at that time user if he's not updating

166
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:39,040
his profile, but instead of building someone else's profile, then that person's response is received.

167
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:46,660
And whatever response we get, we update the local stories and context, which means the currently logged

168
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:52,450
in user has been replaced by this response user, whoever that is.

169
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:59,470
Now that works for in every other case except t admin is trying to update some other user.

170
00:12:59,710 --> 00:12:59,950
Right?

171
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,230
So we have to be careful here.

172
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:08,200
So what we can do is we can do some kind of take to make sure this doesn't happen.

173
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:18,400
So what we can do here is we want to update the context and local stories only if.

174
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,850
The current user updated his own profile.

175
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:23,950
Now, how do we know that?

176
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,750
We can know that by taking the IP.

177
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,760
So the currently logged in you decide.

178
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:29,870
We know that.

179
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:37,250
So if the current trend of the news society, which is in the context, if that I had met with this

180
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:41,980
response IED so whichever user has been updated, the IED never changes.

181
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:46,990
So if that IED and the currently logged is added Metz only then we do our bit.

182
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,360
Otherwise we don't have to update the logged in user status in the context in local stories.

183
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:58,070
All right, so let me just got everything here and take here.

184
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:05,660
If posts the user I.D. equals, equals, equals.

185
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:13,010
This response data don't underscore, Andy.

186
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,170
Yeah.

187
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:18,580
Then.

188
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,270
Only then.

189
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,880
We update the context and local stories.

190
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,090
Update and local stories.

191
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,440
For current use only.

192
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,800
All right, so let's do this and let's see how this works.

193
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,720
So this is me.

194
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:42,910
Maybe I'm it myself.

195
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,530
One, two, three.

196
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,840
Summit.

197
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:48,880
Okay, it works.

198
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:59,240
So good to all uses so you can see it stays there.

199
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,950
The last time it was there too.

200
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,230
It's this too.

201
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:05,470
So sign out.

202
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,190
It's free stuff again.

203
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:19,010
So when you implement things like this one admin will be able to object, delete, do a lot of things

204
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:19,670
for the users.

205
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,830
Then all this complexity comes in.

206
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:27,980
But if you think about it, it's, it's, it's not hard to understand, but sometimes it can be quite

207
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,310
a lot.

208
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:33,590
So if it is, if you're feeling like it's quite a lot, just take some rest, take some time and then

209
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:40,730
start first, you know, let's go ahead here so you can see I can do it myself.

210
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:43,640
So if everything looks perfect, returns this.

211
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,960
Let me remove that.

212
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:48,420
Submit.

213
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:49,800
That works.

214
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:50,910
Let's go back.

215
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,040
Let's try someone else.

216
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:01,650
One year

217
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,520
it's changed it subscriber.

218
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,330
They may even make him an author.

219
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:13,190
Also, Tintin subscribed to us.

220
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,830
Okay, so it's come back here now.

221
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,240
You can see he is there as it is.

222
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:21,780
No problem.

223
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,010
And I'm still there.

224
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:25,140
Okay, that's perfect.

225
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:26,070
Okay.

226
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:33,300
So it was quite a lot and it might have been very complicated and a bit confusing, but when you're

227
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,430
building bigger application, things like this comes in.

228
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:41,490
I recommend you to repeat this User Management six and to updated it one more time.

229
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:46,590
If you're feeling a bit confused, don't trust this repeating because once you understand this thing,

230
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:53,160
it will be used useful for you, for the entire life, for many different applications that you'll be

231
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,030
building in future.

232
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:55,440
All right.

233
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,030
So hopefully you made so far.

234
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:01,070
Now, moving forward, we're going to just focus on other things.

235
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,600
Now, most of the hard look, we wanted it done.

236
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,700
Now there's maybe one more.

237
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,110
Saxon, which is not super complicated.

238
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,610
It's actually quite easy.

239
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:17,190
That is adding the functionality to add a comment in our posts.

240
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:23,700
So we'll do that and then basically know many other small cool things we'll be implementing in this

241
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,190
application.

242
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:30,180
But most of the core features have been already already built except that common six.

243
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,730
And we look good so far.
