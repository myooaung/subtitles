1
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:09.330
So here to fix this, we we can use the spin that is actually necessary.

2
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.840
So you can see the first column we use the spin 12.

3
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:20.610
So this column also we can use span 12 subtotal 24 column grid.

4
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.200
So that's the one used by.

5
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.480
And so you can see as soon as you do that, it's nicely laid out.

6
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.040
You can see the light and dark feel on the dark blue.

7
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.240
You get these beautiful horizontal lines as well.

8
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.640
Now they are too close with each other, so we have to have some kind of a offset.

9
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:50.010
So what we can do here is we can have a set of, let's say, one.

10
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.260
This will be a problem because you can see it's a 24 column grid.

11
00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.880
So this is already taken 12 and this is already thing 12.

12
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:01.870
So that's 24.

13
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.430
And now when we offset one and it's size two, that becomes 26.

14
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.620
So if you want to do if we need offset like that, then we have to reduce this to ten.

15
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.850
So it's ten and offset on both side, right and left one on.

16
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.710
So all together becomes 12.

17
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.680
So this is 12 and this column is 12.

18
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.230
So altogether 24.

19
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.220
If you do that, it looks.

20
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.780
All right.

21
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.890
Now, what are you going to do if you are in a small screen?

22
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.670
Maybe you want to move this to underneath this first column.

23
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.530
I guess if you want something like that, you can have a different value here.

24
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:55.110
For example, on small screen, small, you can have you can will you undertake a full width for so

25
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.560
you could have 24 to give it to full width.

26
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:05.220
However, since we're using offset one, we can use try to subtract two in one of said 24 is for do

27
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.050
this on small screen.

28
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.240
It will take the full width instead of just.

29
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.600
Trying to fight with each other.

30
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.200
All right.

31
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.450
And on last one.

32
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.090
Last one you can use.

33
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.920
Just like we were doing before.

34
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.510
But you have to make a dent because it's offset on both side.

35
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.830
So on last year, just like we used to spend to before, it's the same thing.

36
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.850
But on small screen you take the full width.

37
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.880
So that's similar to 24 and 12 of since.

38
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.330
And because of the opposite, the two has been added to.

39
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.590
You can use the same value in the previous one as well.

40
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.600
So they will be fully responsive.

41
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.470
In a small screen, deleted the full width.

42
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.730
And on a bigger screen, they will be split into half.

43
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.550
So don't get confused.

44
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.510
This is actually 24 and this is actually 12.

45
00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.590
Okay.

46
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.030
So because of the offset on Woodside, we reduce the value to value by two.

47
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.620
Okay.

48
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.210
It is right now.

49
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.520
You can see a bit of a space on both side.

50
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.000
And they're taking ten and offside once altogether, 12 and 12 on the biggest screen.

51
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.640
But if we're in a small screen.

52
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:27.000
Okay.

53
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.700
Let me just refresh.

54
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:32.360
Oh, sorry.

55
00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.050
Small screen this should be.

56
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:39.200
Okay.

57
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.750
So on small screen, isn't it key?

58
00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.110
On very small screen, it doesn't seems to be a problem.

59
00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.100
But with this much bigger you can see it is taking full with.

60
00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:57.940
For.

61
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.850
If you were about a very, very small, you can use the excess model as well.

62
00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.290
I'm pretty sure you can.

63
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.500
I guess you can do this as well.

64
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.830
So that was the first column.

65
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.330
Let's go to the next one.

66
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.370
All right.

67
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:24.750
So let's try.

68
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.650
Even on extremely small screen now.

69
00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.350
It works beautifully.

70
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:34.080
Okay.

71
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.290
So we have been able to create a category and display them here.

72
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.840
However, this might actually not work immediately if you're a French fry.

73
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.710
So the view.

74
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.970
It is created, but we don't see that immediately.

75
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.810
Now, to fix that, obviously there are multiple ways.

76
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.430
One, you can.

77
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.820
Take this data that he got from the.

78
00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.380
This create response and this data means a new category.

79
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:10.660
So you can push this to the state and that way you have the categories list that is fully updated.

80
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.940
All right.

81
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.770
So that way, as soon as you create, you will immediately see the categories.

82
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.150
So let's do that unfinished.

83
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.360
We get the data as soon as we get the data.

84
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:30.910
You want to populate the these categories list in the context in the state and so set.

85
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:33.930
Said categories.

86
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.850
So what are we going to do?

87
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:42.090
Is we going to just spread out using this spread of it so it will spread out all the values that you

88
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.790
have in there.

89
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.040
So spread out.

90
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.140
And now we're going to put another one.

91
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:48.970
Said categories.

92
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.790
And then the data that he got.

93
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.020
Which is right here.

94
00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:00.560
Actually.

95
00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:06.580
So you can use this to spread out all the categories.

96
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.100
And then the one you got.

97
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:14.260
You just put it, put this, you know, if you want this to be in the very front, you can put it in

98
00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.190
the beginning as well.

99
00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:17.890
Let's give it a try first and see how this works.

100
00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.030
Let's try another one.

101
00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:23.670
Let's try.

102
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:27.290
Another popular library.

103
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:27.650
You.

104
00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:35.240
You can see immediately it comes up here right at the end.

105
00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:37.850
But if you want this to come on the top.

106
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.490
In Uganda streets this.

107
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:46.790
To this way.

108
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:52.790
It would appear on top Cannes next one.

109
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:54.910
Meteor.

110
00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:01.350
I guess it comes into an on page reader as well, because these are the latest ones.

111
00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.100
We have the sorting in the controller and that means.

112
00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.010
We?

113
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.870
Get them on the very top.

114
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:16.220
I just noticed one small issue that if I reload the base.

115
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.150
I am redirected.

116
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:19.840
Mm hmm.

117
00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.830
I think that was the reason I need to have.

118
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:31.540
I had to have that kind of broken down, because what we're doing at the moment, I mean, discreetly,

119
00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:40.540
su su in the components admin layout, what we're doing here is.

120
00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:42.970
If we don't have.

121
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:48.290
The response current and whom it should be okay to.

122
00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:49.870
So.

123
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:54.060
We try that.

124
00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.270
If there is an error, we push to the home.

125
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:01.490
Said, referring to false by default.

126
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:02.060
It's true.

127
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:03.660
So by default, it's true.

128
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.550
So when it's true, we are showing the loading.

129
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:17.340
Okay.

130
00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:24.450
So I think what we need to do here is we need to take if I took.

131
00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.120
Because we are accessing this value from context.

132
00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:34.020
So we might not get the value immediately when this huge effect front.

133
00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:38.550
So we want to make sure we have got the token and then only then make a request.

134
00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:38.930
All right.

135
00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:41.300
So don't get confused with the syntax.

136
00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:45.960
This could be written here if token you could do it like this.

137
00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:53.040
But if it is just a single statement, you could do it all in line in a statement as well.

138
00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:56.280
So if this confused, you just make sure to use the code address.

139
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.140
But otherwise it's it's neat.

140
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.700
It's quite simple.

141
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:02.970
One line used it.

142
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:05.880
Okay, so let's try if that fixes.

143
00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:09.490
Let's go to categories.

144
00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:12.800
All right, so let's give it reload.

145
00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:15.300
All right.

146
00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:16.670
This time we stay here.

147
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:23.300
We don't get redirected like we did before, because we are now making sure that we have got the token

148
00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:27.920
and then we are making requests to this endpoint.

149
00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:28.880
It's beautiful.

150
00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.560
That is beautifully done.
