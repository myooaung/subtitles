1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.250
So we have the ADD new phase.

2
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.930
Now let's work on the library as well.

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:14.490
So what we can do here is come back to this new new base admin media new.

4
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.730
And basically we need the same layout, right?

5
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.730
So we can just copy everything.

6
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.400
And just so a different component which is media library.

7
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.600
So that's pretty much it.

8
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.910
All we have to do is that okay, so let's copy this base.

9
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:37.400
And then go here and especially to this to media library.

10
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.000
And it's called Admin Media Library.

11
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.540
Just so that the name is not confusing to admin media library.

12
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.920
Okay.

13
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.930
So we import another component this time it's called media

14
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.410
library, which is.

15
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.000
Yeah.

16
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:17.560
And so we import that and then we actually don't need this due bearings and it's that bad.

17
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.930
And now instead of showing this component, we are showing different.

18
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.660
All right.

19
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:26.470
Simple as that.

20
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.840
And this report as well.

21
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.750
I mean, media library.

22
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:34.840
So we've got that prisoner.

23
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.800
Okay.

24
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.880
Now, you can see here.

25
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.170
We are showing all the images.

26
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.500
So drag and drop is then you can delete it.

27
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.270
Let me try delete some of this.

28
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.360
I guess you can tell when it's deleted.

29
00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.490
Maybe you want to do some kind of notification that it's good to dispose of this component.

30
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.410
By the way, we're done here.

31
00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.360
This is very straightforward.

32
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:06.720
Media library.

33
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.920
We have to delete.

34
00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.090
It means delete.

35
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.140
2 minutes deleted.

36
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.640
We update the media context and then post don't error.

37
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.020
All right.

38
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.190
So that notification so that it's a bit better.

39
00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.080
Actually, it's not coming up.

40
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.400
Let's make sure we have the component.

41
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:41.530
It's important that.

42
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.550
We are taught to.

43
00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.370
Okay?

44
00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.980
Yeah.

45
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.270
All right.

46
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.090
So we got these two pages as well, so it was nice and easy.

47
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.150
We just had to import those components and put them here.

48
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.440
So we're done here.

49
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.190
We're done here.

50
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.040
We'll work on comment six and a bit later.

51
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.300
Now let's move on to users.

52
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.230
So as an admin, you will be able to create new user from within your dashboard.

53
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.650
Right.

54
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:22.510
And.

55
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.790
You'll be able to see all the users you will be able to delete.

56
00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.940
You will be able to obey them.

57
00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.140
Give them the new rule.

58
00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:36.290
For example, you can make some users also so that they can start writing posts, right?

59
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:43.040
So that's, that's the six and we're going to Auckland moving forward.
