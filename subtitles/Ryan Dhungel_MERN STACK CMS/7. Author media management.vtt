00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:06.850
Now let's also work on these and the media sexy library and add new are basically they are already accessible

2
00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:12.960
or during the post creation so this author whenever he goes to quit post.

3
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.730
He has access to the media so he can upload a new one.

4
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.140
Let's try promoting a new one.

5
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.240
It's a press release from.

6
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:39.030
I so you can see, I think in upload media, single media or just multiple medias.

7
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.540
Yeah.

8
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.580
So that works for already.

9
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.950
However, we also want it to appear here nice and easy.

10
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:48.270
Right.

11
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.330
So let's let's work on that as well.

12
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.370
So that should be very straightforward.

13
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.580
We had to have that for his admin media.

14
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.550
So we have the these bases, so we should be able to just use them.

15
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:06.090
Right.

16
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.570
So.

17
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.900
Let's try creating a similar structure for Arthur.

18
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.360
It's called a new folder media.

19
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.030
And here, create a new file.

20
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.050
Libraries, churches and new churches.

21
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.400
So let's start from the library.

22
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.900
I'm just going to copy code from admin library to be very seamless.

23
00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:43.370
Copy.

24
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.360
I'll come back here.

25
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.020
Based here.

26
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.400
This is the layout.

27
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.210
Add me now.

28
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:51.440
Come on.

29
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.900
If Brian and me loud triplets.

30
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:54.890
We are too loud.

31
00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.430
Don and Cindy, the component name for an all.

32
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.600
All right.

33
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.190
Same here.

34
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.050
Done.

35
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.410
So that's for.

36
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:16.190
The library and its school and do the same for a new it's good admin media and new.

37
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.330
Scorpion on the court.

38
00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.100
Come back to Autumn Media.

39
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.160
New beasts called.

40
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.530
Since the lyrics of Command F.

41
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.930
Something happened.

42
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.600
It surprised me and mean I'm down to earth.

43
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.010
And now it turns out that.

44
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:53.270
And I think we can leave the name read it is there.

45
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.490
We may want to pass the piece.

46
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:56.540
Props again here.

47
00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.620
But let's let's really have a look at it first.

48
00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.160
Let's see.

49
00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.270
So this is the offer currently, not Denise's offer.

50
00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.430
And he had access to library.

51
00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.910
Beautiful.

52
00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.510
He has access to uploaded new images as well.

53
00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:15.080
Also.

54
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.150
So here am for library and new bullets.

55
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.710
Let's pass the base probe based probe.

56
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:35.110
So whenever it is used in the also a directory we want to redirect the user to.

57
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.570
All right, so let's do the same here.

58
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.200
So let's go to upload five.

59
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.010
Now, just have a look at it first.

60
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:53.380
So we have the function and once the upload is successfully, you can see we are redirecting to admin

61
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.100
less media.

62
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.710
So this will not change.

63
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.730
This will be dynamic based on the props.

64
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.040
So for fun.

65
00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.920
Is it good to default value?

66
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:11.360
We admit, but if we receive the offer, a different value here that can be used as a base.

67
00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.170
Let's use that.

68
00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.890
So we use base here.

69
00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.950
So let me just got put inside back to admin.

70
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.070
I said, you know that face.

71
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.740
So whether it's ortho, I mean, that's where they get redirected.

72
00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:34.920
So that's for upload file.

73
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.090
Let's work on the media library as well.

74
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:45.640
So we need a library also we use is admin really the default value?

75
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.540
Let mean make sure.

76
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.920
Yes, that's right.

77
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:52.770
So everything's a different value.

78
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.850
Come down here.

79
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.150
Redirect.

80
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.120
So let's face media.

81
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.460
That's face media, that's props sit media.

82
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.920
So in it, we don't have the redirect code here.

83
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.620
Okay.

84
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.710
That's how.

85
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:25.870
B since it is a library.

86
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.430
So we just leave the user there.

87
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.290
Okay, that's.

88
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:29.470
That makes sense.

89
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.950
I guess so.

90
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:31.690
We don't need that.

91
00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.560
All right, so let's give it a try.

92
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.240
Let's try adding a new one.

93
00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.840
When we upload finished the upload we may get redirected to.

94
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.060
I don't have new images.

95
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.220
They just do this just one more time.

96
00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:04.650
You can see all the media libraries.

97
00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.100
So single upload has been done and back to library here.

98
00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:11.820
Okay.

99
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:12.310
It works.

100
00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:17.350
Now, there's one more thing we need to do here, and that is allowing the user to delete.

101
00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.600
Now, if the image has been uploaded by this user, he can delete, but otherwise he can.

102
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.110
Indeed.

103
00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.240
But still, we are showing all this again, so maybe we want to hide.

104
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:34.600
I can't even though we have the the the take in the back end.

105
00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:40.660
So if I tried to delete other users media, it would not work.

106
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.390
But I should be able to delete my.

107
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.120
All right, let me just try.

108
00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.850
You can see if I try, I get four three forward in error.

109
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.830
But if I try to do it my own.

110
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:55.920
That works.

111
00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:56.460
Okay.

112
00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:59.280
So that, you know, it is secure in the back end.

113
00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:08.370
But still, we may want to show only this this icon only on the image that actually belongs to this

114
00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.800
author writes this, that's better.

115
00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:20.400
So for that, it's good the library and let's write some conditional rendering for that cross I to this

116
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.090
delete item.

117
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.670
So here close circle out.

118
00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:30.640
And so what I'm going to do is for something to take for the control.

119
00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:35.730
All right, so this is media library.

120
00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:39.350
So we take from the images.

121
00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:41.690
So we have the images.

122
00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:45.410
So we are in the Smith function.

123
00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:46.810
We have access to the image.

124
00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:50.300
So we take in most.

125
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:57.670
And it is posted by on this Friday.

126
00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:03.190
So if the image is posted by 80 people equals equals currently logged in user.

127
00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:06.310
So it makes sure we have the health context.

128
00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.100
We have, you know, we have.

129
00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:13.170
Okay.

130
00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:20.850
So if the image posted by I.D. equals equals equals us don't user.

131
00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:29.110
As usual and disquieting for this to work.

132
00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:31.300
Posted by Adi.

133
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:37.800
Whenever you were sending the media libraries to, you must have used the populate function in the backend.

134
00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:41.020
I guess that is something we can take.

135
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:43.060
Just let's finish this first.

136
00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.860
If you haven't, then you don't have to access it.

137
00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:49.960
You can just leave it later like that.

138
00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:51.550
That would be the idea.

139
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:56.140
But I think we have to use the populate.

140
00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.360
So let's continue here first.

141
00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.200
So images posted by and the logged in.

142
00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.780
You decide if that meant then.

143
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:08.830
We should do it again.

144
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:09.950
Thank you.

145
00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:15.810
Otherwise, if it is and then also we do this admin will have access to delete.

146
00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.020
It doesn't matter if he uploaded or someone else uploaded.

147
00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.720
Admin has this super crazy.

148
00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.130
Right.

149
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:22.460
Right.

150
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:26.600
So we are going to.

151
00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:30.500
If.

152
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:33.100
Oh, if.

153
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:41.220
Um, actually, by default, we showing this icon for everyone.

154
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:54.390
Actually we can take for the the default piece valid which is admin.

155
00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:55.320
Right.

156
00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:57.120
So if it's.

157
00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:02.490
Equals, equals, equals.

158
00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:08.820
And then we have the admin that is accessing this library at the time being.

159
00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:16.260
So in that case, again, we can show the item, disclose item.

160
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:20.640
Otherwise, if none of that is true, then we just don't say anything.

161
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.770
We just saw M district.

162
00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:24.190
Okay.

163
00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.490
So here, let me just cut.

164
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.560
Put it here, and then we put it here.

165
00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:34.560
So it's itself beautiful.

166
00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:40.600
So if it means boasted about it in the London news site?

167
00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.680
Immensely so.

168
00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.200
If it is admin, we show.

169
00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:47.050
Otherwise we don't show the egg.

170
00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:48.970
So come here.

171
00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.230
So it looks like we don't have the postman by.

172
00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:00.900
Populated on the media in that case.

173
00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.940
We just used that.

174
00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:09.440
I think that will do it because that basically gives us the idea.

175
00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:17.900
I guess that is also not true.

176
00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:24.110
So let me bring back the ad and let me go have a look at the civil response.

177
00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:28.160
So we have all the images.

178
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:33.840
Feed me media, stress media.

179
00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.910
So let me quickly have a look at that in the back.

180
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:38.730
And it's post media.

181
00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.600
We have posted by.

182
00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:44.140
Okay.

183
00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:45.190
So we populate.

184
00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:48.320
We didn't have to do this.

185
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:53.390
We didn't have to do this.

186
00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:57.110
Now that we have done it.

187
00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:00.500
And let me leave it because it doesn't.

188
00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:05.420
It might be some might put it some other issues.

189
00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.000
So let's leave it like they did at time.

190
00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:17.050
Let's go back and let's figure out why we don't see it's hiding.

191
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:22.610
We can go back to library and continue thinking.

192
00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:31.120
Probably instead of 2.8.

193
00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.830
Who has that?

194
00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:42.550
Actually, this media library didn't go to Page's author.

195
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:44.380
Library.

196
00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:49.250
So we were actually going to pass the props before.

197
00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:50.740
So let's pass the props.

198
00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:53.050
This can be very helpful as well.

199
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:59.080
Let's continue passing with props and media library we have the default is admin.

200
00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:02.980
But we can always use that.

201
00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:10.630
So not just that we cannot take for that test like we did here.

202
00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:15.440
If it is a consequence, it was awful.

203
00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:19.070
And we will do all this to.

204
00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:21.560
Okay.

205
00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:22.940
So we still have this issue.

206
00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:30.860
I think it's time to just do some take it is a good sequence equals.

207
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:37.620
No.

208
00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:45.750
Jason Stringer.

209
00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:46.740
Five days.

210
00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:52.960
Author also.

211
00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.130
Oh, no, it seems to work.

212
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:10.810
And so looks like it worked with this additional tape.

213
00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:23.000
So that means we can only take four that we didn't have to do this.

214
00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:24.110
Let's know that.

215
00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.170
We could do that.

216
00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:33.630
But then let's keep it simple because at the end of the day, we have the security in the back end as

217
00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:33.810
well.

218
00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:37.410
So we can definitely depend on this value.

219
00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:47.420
It's a different value or if it is passed, as I said from the auto directory, then we used it again.

220
00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:48.300
Yeah.

221
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:49.110
It's nice and it.

222
00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:00.580
So I sat in my bed and seemed to work.

223
00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:02.650
So let's continue using bed.

224
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:05.290
Let's continue using bed.

225
00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:10.420
And I will actually have a look at that using this in Springfield, because we want to make sure we

226
00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:14.350
don't want to just leave it like this.

227
00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:16.790
It's a living dry tree.

228
00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:24.820
I'm really curious to find out what's condition string if my image is.

229
00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:34.180
So it is called the IED.

230
00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:41.850
Images got posted by I'd seen recently posted by Heidi.

231
00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:50.540
Then amidst the misuse posted by Durbin's side.

232
00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:51.590
So we got that.

233
00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:56.990
Let me try Jason Stream.

234
00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:57.490
Fine.

235
00:15:58.070 --> 00:15:59.180
Let me try it off.

236
00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:03.200
Don't usually use it in this fight.

237
00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:08.390
Yes.

238
00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:15.290
Actually we got those values since these values you.

239
00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:20.990
Should the Mets fall into the triple equal?

240
00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.550
Maybe we can draw a double digit.

241
00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:28.310
Negative.

242
00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.770
Let's remove that too.

243
00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:31.940
This is definitely very.

244
00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:40.380
So let's just try to double equal and let's try removing this one just to give it a try.

245
00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:41.190
It's you know, this will.

246
00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:51.210
Now that works.

247
00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:51.910
That's for.

248
00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:56.010
So it's the same issue as we had in the Bakken before.

249
00:16:56.340 --> 00:17:03.570
So you could use double equal or you could use different equal, but then you use dot to stream for

250
00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:03.900
here.

251
00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:10.860
And he has routes just so that both types are simple to use the triple equal strict operate.

252
00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:16.410
So let's just continue using double equal and let's use this various.

253
00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:17.160
Awesome.

254
00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:19.350
Finally, one more time.

255
00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:20.720
Let's just reload.

256
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:21.240
Make sure.

257
00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:23.880
All right.

258
00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:24.480
So that's good.

259
00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:26.580
So on the other.

260
00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:29.140
On the author.

261
00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:35.540
He can delete his own upload, but let's log out in, log in as admin and see how this works for admin.

262
00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:44.790
My computer is running heavy.

263
00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.470
It's making a lot of noise.

264
00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:50.790
Might need to give you some rest later.

265
00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:55.710
No admin has access to all the images.

266
00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:56.820
You can delete.

267
00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:57.830
All beautiful.
