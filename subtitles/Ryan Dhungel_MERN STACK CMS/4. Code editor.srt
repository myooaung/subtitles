1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,070
So we are almost ready to start building monastic applications.

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:06,930
Now, before we do that.

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,310
First we have to.

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:15,250
Set up our development environment and we do not really need a lot.

5
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:23,680
And since I think I'm pretty sure, you know, the basics of react, that means you have already used

6
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:30,790
NPM to install a react locally in a computer and tried a few times.

7
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:31,090
Right.

8
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,060
So that means you may already have Node.js installed.

9
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:41,050
If not, you want to make sure you have that right so you can use terminal command prompt.

10
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,310
Let me clear all this out.

11
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:54,470
I get so here I have my right here and I'm going to show you my note versus currently which version

12
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,010
I'm using.

13
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:55,960
So no deaths.

14
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:00,020
V, I'm using version six, which is latest.

15
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:00,830
All right.

16
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:07,520
So if you don't have if you want to upgrade to the latest version of Node.js on this visit, no, it's

17
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,430
just an old download, the latest version.

18
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,440
In fact, they already have seven in here.

19
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:13,550
All right.

20
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,140
All right.

21
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:23,270
So once we have Node.js install, next thing you want to do is decide.

22
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:29,600
I'll make sure you have the text editor, which I'm sure you have as well.

23
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,940
So I'm going to use voice code for this one.

24
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,410
Visual Studio code.

25
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,620
If you don't have that, you can download it for free.

26
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,470
And this is the one I recommend.

27
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:47,180
It's very easy to use and there are a lot of plugins that will make your development process so much

28
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,080
easier.

29
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:49,310
All right.

30
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:58,980
So here are some of the blog that I'd recommend you have is a preview and some React plugins.

31
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,000
So if you want to install, I'm on my Mac.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,540
So on Mac, you can try Command Swift B and that will open up this window here.

33
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,700
You can choose to.

34
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,200
Install extensions.

35
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,030
You can choose themes.

36
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,830
Themes are basically for.

37
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:18,990
Oh.

38
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:26,420
The visual purpose is not super important, but obviously you want to have your favorite theme so that

39
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,650
you feel more motivated to code.

40
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:34,370
Right now, let me show you some of the plugins that I have.

41
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:43,290
Thanks to the blog list so you can see how I have these themes.

42
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,210
They're not super important.

43
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:48,930
The most important one I want to show you is truly.

44
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:51,840
All right.

45
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,730
So you can see I have already installed Superior Court format if you want to use this.

46
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:03,270
The beauty of this is whenever you type something, some code in your editor know and only hit save

47
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,100
comment is that tool.

48
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,580
Well, as soon as you do that that will or the format of court.

49
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:18,900
All right so this is a very useful plug you want to use that some react plugins which will be extremely

50
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,350
helpful.

51
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:23,880
So this is quite popular 187 React Redux.

52
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,430
You can do so to react and install that.

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,620
So any other plugins that I might use during the course I will be showing as well.

54
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:37,870
Amongst Sift e in the explorer window.

55
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,680
I usually have the side row using command to.

56
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,420
You can do that from here as well.

57
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:48,790
View Sidebar Explorer will show you the files here.

58
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,110
At the moment we don't have any.

59
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,880
Obviously we will create set above project and bring them here.

60
00:03:55,150 --> 00:04:03,550
At the moment there's nothing there so you can hide the sidebar if you want to come on to do trauma

61
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,300
command.

62
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:06,700
Appearance.

63
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,980
So sidebar you can just control.

64
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,740
Among one and two will hide that.

65
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,120
Come on two will had then.

66
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:16,130
All right.

67
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,140
So the basics of this could.

68
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,490
It's close, this one.

69
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,610
And let's also quickly have a look at the applications.

70
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,620
This is the application we're going to build.

71
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:34,580
And this is already live on the Web.

72
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:42,050
So you can always come here, have a look at this application, log in and then just walk with me altogether.
