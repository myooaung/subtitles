1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:00.780
All right.

2
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:02.760
So we have the comment system.

3
00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.570
We added food comments in one of our posts on this front.

4
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:18.790
So now any logged in user, they can leave a comment now and begin defer comment and we render the comments

5
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.000
as good to create and read is done.

6
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.180
Now what we need to do is update and delete, right?

7
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:32.380
So the comments the admin will be able to update and delete and at the same time the users will left

8
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.070
the comment.

9
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.960
Any user can leave a comment, admin, subscriber, author, anyone can leave a comment.

10
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:39.230
Right?

11
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:45.130
So if they left the common, then we will show the list of their comments in the dashboard.

12
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.700
Right.

13
00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:55.840
So this is admin, but it's not just for admin but even for any other user due to able to see the list

14
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.290
of comments in the dashboard and they will be able to update and delete.

15
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:07.660
The difference is if the users admin here will be able to see not only his comments but everyone's comments

16
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.740
part and then admin will be able to update and delete.

17
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.800
So that means we need to now work in our back end, create some routes, controller fonts and some middle

18
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:24.400
words that will allow the user admin user to update and delete the comment.

19
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.880
So when we're doing that, we also need to fit all the comments.

20
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:36.970
And if the user is not admin but anyone else, then they will be able to view their own comments and

21
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.140
be able to update and delete their own comments.

22
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.370
All right.

23
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.710
So let's start talking of that.

24
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.570
So let me go to server.

25
00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.000
Let's start from root.

26
00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.260
Let's go to.

27
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.230
post-Trump.

28
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.920
And here, let's add some more rounds.

29
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.550
We can quit about to get all the comments.

30
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.590
So here are the target

31
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:13.560
comments and then we will implement resignation as well because you can imagine there can be thousands

32
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.140
of comments.

33
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.990
You don't want to load all of them at once.

34
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.850
So we going to implement pagination.

35
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.660
So we will be getting the base

36
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.090
this one views to have to be logged in.

37
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.430
This is for the admin is admin for now.

38
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.620
Later we will create another one for other users.

39
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:37.250
Comments.

40
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.420
Okay.

41
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.400
So this for the admin, we're going to store all the comments in that decimal.

42
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:51.880
So this one, right next one is to work with this spiciness and we need drawn.

43
00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.700
We'd need to know how many comments we have in the database.

44
00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.940
Right?

45
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.540
So to get that number, we can create another problem.

46
00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.680
Don't get

47
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:03.700
comment count.

48
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.870
We can call that comment comment.

49
00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.150
That's a real quick disrupt.

50
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.610
And another one is to delete around a dot.

51
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.870
Delete.

52
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:26.670
So comment and then to delete, we will send the comment ID so that we can find that particular comment

53
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.090
from the database and then update, right.

54
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.210
So comment it.

55
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:39.780
We need to send the user must be logged in and instead of his admin, this time we're going to create

56
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:48.240
a middleware, a different middleware that will take if the user's added then okay, that's okay.

57
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:57.990
But if user is not admin, they should be able to update or delete the delete the comment if that comment

58
00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.730
was created by that user.

59
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:00.180
Right.

60
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.320
So in server this one, we're going to create another middleware.

61
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.850
We'll come back to this one and we can call it to remove comment.

62
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:18.450
So that middleware also let me right here can update delete command.

63
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.190
So we're going to create this middleware.

64
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:26.310
So we have to create that one and let's also create another one for updates.

65
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.200
So we will implement update as well.

66
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.250
So that would be it would vote for beta.

67
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:38.280
So we're going to send the comment daily, require sign in, can update and delete comment.

68
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.930
We applied that middleware and then this one we call it update comment.

69
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.820
I know you can see one, two, three, four.

70
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.420
So we added this four out.

71
00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:55.590
So that means we need to create these four middleware functions and one new assert a full control of

72
00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:56.100
functions.

73
00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.820
And then one middleware function we have to create.

74
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.360
Okay.

75
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.570
So unless you have that, you get the error.

76
00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.260
All right.

77
00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.680
So make sure we import first.

78
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.800
So that one is comments.

79
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.250
Comments.

80
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.690
Don't object.

81
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.130
Comment, remove comment.

82
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:27.960
Comments, comment, comment, update, comment, remove comment.

83
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.780
So we have to quit this full control of functions.

84
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.420
All right, let's go to control post.

85
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.520
So let me quickly write them here.

86
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.630
Someday I'm going to quit.

87
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.430
HOBSON I'm going to click.

88
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:59.170
HOBSON And then why the option key option e option key is pressed.

89
00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:07.950
I'm going to click here, I want to see a command and then the left here and we just going to write

90
00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:08.470
like this.

91
00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:16.360
Export const comments equals to async requests response.

92
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:24.030
Okay.

93
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.940
Well, actually, we can even do some cards.

94
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:27.630
Try.

95
00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:36.440
All right.

96
00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.270
As you can see, we have these full control of functions in.

97
00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.800
List of comments, comment, count of dead and more.

98
00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:48.910
All right.

99
00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:51.240
So that's all for the control of functions.

100
00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:59.600
Now let's make sure we have this middleware as well so that one we can bring from middleware as well

101
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:00.010
as you.

102
00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:01.500
That's good.

103
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.160
Mealworms.

104
00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:05.850
And then I'll describe that here.

105
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:21.290
Next that the callback function is important for any middleware gets in the air.

106
00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:25.960
All right.

107
00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:32.510
So now that we have all these control functions and this middleware all imported here, we don't have

108
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:33.110
any errors.

109
00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:34.100
Perfect.

110
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.220
All right.

111
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:40.720
Now we can continue working in our control functions.

112
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:44.090
But before we do that, let me work on this middleware.

113
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:46.000
I get.

114
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:53.030
So let me work on this middleware and then we will continue working in our control functions.

115
00:07:54.830 --> 00:08:00.020
So here, basically what you're going to do is we going to take if the uses admin, he can update and

116
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:07.820
delete if users not admin, that user may be still able to audit ability in order to do it if he created

117
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:08.570
that comment.

118
00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:09.770
So we have to do that.

119
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:12.710
All right.

120
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:18.200
So here first I'm going to do is I'm going to get the comment ID from request params.

121
00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:18.680
All right.

122
00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:24.230
So I can do structured comment ID from request params.

123
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:28.430
Always make sure you get this from you can always console.log if you have some issues.

124
00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:38.890
So you can see here, whenever we want to delete a comment or did a comment that time we are getting

125
00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:41.200
the comment ID in the root params.

126
00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:47.500
So based on that, we can find the comment from the button from the database and then it's common comment,

127
00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.480
have the posted by user information.

128
00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:49.750
Right.

129
00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:58.840
So we can take if that comment posted by user ID met with the currently logged in, you decided then

130
00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.850
he's the right user, he can delete or did whatever he wants.

131
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:07.420
All right, so we get the comment ID now let's find the comment.

132
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:14.530
So constant comment equals to await comment model.

133
00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:16.930
Let's make sure we have that imported on top.

134
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:25.960
Perfect.

135
00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:30.700
So we find the comment.

136
00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:32.410
We await comment.

137
00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:37.730
Comment, don't find bad.

138
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.080
And that is the commentary.

139
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:51.420
So we find the comment by commentary and then yeah, we find we find the user based on the the currently

140
00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:55.080
logged news is that we get using the request and mirror.

141
00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:55.770
All right.

142
00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:58.950
So user equals sorry to use a friend by the request to use aid.

143
00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:03.360
So now what we have is we have the comment and we have the currently logged in user.

144
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:05.520
All right.

145
00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:12.600
So here now we can use switch switches and then it'll switch for the user for all.

146
00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:14.430
All right.

147
00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:17.920
So if the rule is added, we don't have to take anything.

148
00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.780
Who created the complaint or whatever?

149
00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:23.620
We don't need to it because admin can object and delete anyone's comment.

150
00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:31.900
I guess if the case is admin, if user role is admin, we can just execute next and break the code execution.

151
00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:38.190
It's that case next week.

152
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.720
Oh, so that's terrible.

153
00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:44.840
Okay.

154
00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.700
So if cases admin would do that.

155
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:56.150
If the case is awesome, then we can still allow him to update didn't did the coin, but we want to

156
00:10:56.150 --> 00:11:03.620
make sure that it is created by that user so we can do this thing if the comment posted by and let's

157
00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.470
convert them using to st.

158
00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:05.970
Okay.

159
00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:07.700
So if comment posted by.

160
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.100
Does not, Matt.

161
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.410
Let's use for the Mets.

162
00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:24.870
If the comment posted by Mets with the currently logged in users Andy, then that is the right user.

163
00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:26.030
We can allow him to.

164
00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:38.240
Delete added his own comments so we can execute next and then break.

165
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:41.120
Now let's take another case.

166
00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:45.350
Now, if the case is

167
00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:54.290
so squarer, then again we have to do the same take.

168
00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:57.910
If the comment posted by Matt with the logged in, you decide.

169
00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:00.500
Then we execute next.

170
00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:01.730
So that is also fine.

171
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:03.550
And then we break.

172
00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:05.710
Okay.

173
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:13.360
And finally, the default case by default if none of these case mats we want to send the air to Mrs..

174
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:18.880
So send the response with the status of 403 unauthorized.

175
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.460
Thank you.

176
00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:22.940
So this is our middleware.

177
00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:30.770
So we can apply this middle way in our route where we need to update and give the comment.

178
00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:40.220
So it will do all the all the check if it is admin again, if it is are also in subscribe and they're

179
00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:45.590
already met with the commentary, then comment positive are added, then they can.

180
00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:52.760
Otherwise we throw this unauthorized error response perfect.

181
00:12:54.570 --> 00:13:00.390
All right, so we had our meal, whereas well, now in the next lecture, let's work on these four control

182
00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:07.410
functions to get all the comments, to get the comment count, update the comment and remove the comment.
