00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:08.100
Also you can see on the admin post slug base that was used to edit the post.

2
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.120
So let me just.

3
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.490
Move this to a component.

4
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.440
Now, before we do that, let me just log in as admin to so that we know how things are doing.

5
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.660
Plugin is admin on posts.

6
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.360
So when I click here and it and this base, so we ended the post.

7
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:39.330
This post does not belong to this user, but since this uses admin, he cannot edit anyone's post.

8
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:45.660
Just go back.

9
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:50.780
If you want to, you can.

10
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.240
So.

11
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.600
Who uses them here.

12
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.430
It's really if you want to just say that it is I didn't do.

13
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:05.120
But as an admin, like I said, you want to give all these rights, but maybe you want to solely use

14
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.530
and then do make it.

15
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:20.720
More kind of readable so that you don't maybe want to update on other authors post, right?

16
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.680
Oh, you should.

17
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.030
This one, you can see here we have the laser and so on.

18
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.340
This is here and let's see how we can refactored this group.

19
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.550
So post slug.

20
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:42.380
Let me copy all this called go to components posts and it's clear to me why.

21
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.970
Edit post component js and paste everything here.

22
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.980
Now we may have to fix some input path.

23
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.970
For example, admin layout.

24
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.730
We don't want to use layout on this one.

25
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.130
We want this layout.

26
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.390
Context.

27
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:08.680
So from here we go.

28
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.870
One step up to step up.

29
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.410
Context.

30
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.330
So you just have to remove one step from its.

31
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.900
Actually for media, we are actually already inside the components folder.

32
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:42.490
So we go one step up and then media let's that actually let me come down actually let's remove introducing

33
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.810
the content and slide come down to the return block.

34
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.240
To this layout.

35
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:57.890
And one that.

36
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.960
Perfect.

37
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.370
All right.

38
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:10.930
Now, let's try to import this in the slot admin post slot.

39
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.510
So all this quote we can remove except the layouts.

40
00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.370
Let's keep the layout and just single everything removed.

41
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:41.970
I guess in this photo, Sorenson glanced at it, posted to the return admin layout.

42
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.490
And here we want to show that component.

43
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.800
So we want to import that as well.

44
00:03:52.630 --> 00:04:07.450
Import it first component from one stick up to step three still components posts.

45
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:11.580
Indeed most.

46
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.950
Compliance, I guess, and we can put that here

47
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.870
and maybe we want to pass the process based process.

48
00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.040
When we used in the offer later.

49
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.200
At the moment it's it and let's come.

50
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.920
Yeah.

51
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.360
Now let's make sure.

52
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:38.250
Beautiful.

53
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.510
Right.

54
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.130
So we reflected the court walked looked ah the court to a different component.

55
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.020
And it's absolutely beautiful.

56
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.890
It's talking.

57
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:52.610
Everything's all updated of this.

58
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.280
Beautiful, awesome.

59
00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.670
Okay, so that works for offer.

60
00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:06.420
Now let's sign out as also log in as a sort of Saturdays and all admin log in has also.

61
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.580
Good all posts.

62
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.640
I've got to cut only one post now.

63
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:22.230
Edit.

64
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:30.830
Actually, we don't have the base yet and it's going to include displays and that's going to be quite

65
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:31.640
similar to this one.

66
00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:42.860
This copy that the admin post slung this crop and then was all these so basis author posts security

67
00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.680
file slot is.

68
00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.070
Now it's best that here all we need to do is turn to Adam now.

69
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:54.120
Come on.

70
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.870
F from the ad we now replace with ofa layout.

71
00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.270
Save the genders.

72
00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:01.680
Come back here.

73
00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:03.270
Give it reload.

74
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.190
Beautiful.

75
00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.060
Absolutely.

76
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:21.210
All right, so here, once we upgrade the posts, we want to redirect them to also base, right?

77
00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.290
So back to all post office less post.

78
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:32.660
But if you have a at this post component on the submit function handle of this, we are redirecting

79
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.870
to add winters like we had before for creating new post.

80
00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.190
So we want to change that so we can post that Facebook again.

81
00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:50.470
Bass, the bass from Awesome whenever it is used in the author or folded by the author.

82
00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:53.430
And then let's go to this one.

83
00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:54.990
Go and talk.

84
00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:07.690
I received that Facebook and give a default value of and so by default it can be admin but if the any

85
00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.510
anything else has been passed as process that would be used.

86
00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:11.710
Okay.

87
00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:16.480
So we can use the space value in our hands some mint and from this.

88
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:17.980
Yeah.

89
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.600
To is that to base.

90
00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:23.690
Semantics.

91
00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:30.790
Baseless.

92
00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:34.350
Most.

93
00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.310
Let's give it a try.

94
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:41.910
I guess it's a date post by Orion.

95
00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:44.520
The author updated

96
00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:52.410
pick some categories from this.

97
00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:56.260
Beautiful.

98
00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.200
You can see it has been updated.

99
00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:01.740
You saw not just the images, it still shows.

100
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:06.790
Edit So published was created.

101
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:08.330
Let's send this to posts.

102
00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:09.390
David.

103
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.080
You do.

104
00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:16.290
So you saw you're trying to re-using the components.

105
00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:23.220
Who would have been easily able to say the same features for admin as well as often isolated?

106
00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:28.350
Okay.

107
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:30.300
So we are pretty much done now.

108
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.020
Categories, we haven't actually worked on the categories.

109
00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:39.330
I think categories is not something I want to allow access to.

110
00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:45.450
The categories can define how you want to structure the application.

111
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:48.750
So I'm not going to implement categories for.

112
00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:51.580
Office.

113
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.920
I can, but if you want to, you already know how easily you can.

114
00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.990
Do you just move your coat to a component.

115
00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.830
Bring them in like this and then just implement that.

116
00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:01.880
I salute me.

117
00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:02.780
Good to.

118
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:06.810
Components.

119
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:13.110
Layout of the layout and it's good to offer.

120
00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.890
Now let's remove that categories.

121
00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:32.990
I guess Adnan will be able also will be able to only create posts and to work on the media.
