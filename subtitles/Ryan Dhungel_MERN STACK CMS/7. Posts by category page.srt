1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:07,650
So we created the category post by category that gives us all the boost that belongs to a certain category.

2
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,980
Now let's create that piece.

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,600
We have the back in done.

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,820
So let's clear the space so that we can show the list of posts for any given categories.

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,500
So that means we need to have the space categories less notice.

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:31,260
So here in our Clean Spaces folder, we need to create one for all call categories.

7
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,050
I see that category.

8
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,490
Have you said let's make it singular?

9
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:38,580
We name

10
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,010
called category and enter here.

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:53,910
Let's create a file called Slow that would receive the dynamic slug and version that we show the the

12
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:54,480
result.

13
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:00,990
All right, so first, we need some basic inputs.

14
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:14,540
So first excuse from excuse, then we want a couple of components from and import.

15
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,930
So we need cart.

16
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:28,950
So we're going to use card to show its force card row and column four layout button and then divider.

17
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:44,730
We may use divider and then have it for and we use Avatar to show the the post image's import head component

18
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:51,690
from next because we will make this issue friendly place because this is one of the actually the most

19
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,790
important piece if your focus issue.

20
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,920
Actually we wanted it done that we have the single push.

21
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,140
These are the most important bits.

22
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,400
We have already worked on that.

23
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,350
But this is also pretty good for issue four is category.

24
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:12,180
If we are showing a lot of this post relevant post, then obviously that helps one issue.

25
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,400
So this is quite important as well.

26
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:28,670
I guess we import head component and then next one we want link as well link from next link then to

27
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,600
formatted the date.

28
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:35,300
We need pages in both pages from basis.

29
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:44,690
Then for this to work, we need to import the related time plugin for to work with this.

30
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:52,250
And then here also just like we did before, we showed the categories and we'll just post on the sidebar.

31
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,850
We can do the same thing here if you want to.

32
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,310
That's not really important, right?

33
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,910
You can sort it like that if you want to.

34
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,700
Let's let's do.

35
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,180
We did so already.

36
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:09,260
It's really easy just to just need to import these hooks.

37
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,290
Use category from

38
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,510
use category.

39
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,690
I'm sorry he's carrying you from.

40
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,460
So we are here.

41
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:26,810
So we need to go to hooks in the use category.

42
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,860
Copy and paste.

43
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,100
Here.

44
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,530
Change this to use.

45
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,670
Latest posts.

46
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:39,200
All right.

47
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,080
And that's on, Renee.

48
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:51,020
Now, let's extend this period of time to these years, and then let's try the function component.

49
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,380
Single category equals to

50
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,720
no, because we want this space to be some server interface issue.

51
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,110
We are not going to use use effect.

52
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:12,620
Instead, we're going to use the get some side props, okay, to export the default

53
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,100
single category.

54
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:28,100
And then just before that, we use this gift service as props export async function, get server side

55
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:28,820
props.

56
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,440
Now we need to access the slugs which we can access from params.

57
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:48,160
So here we use const data inputs to are we excuse don't get we make a get request, let's use bektic.

58
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:57,640
So that would be the the API so process stored in v dot API.

59
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:06,010
We have this variable in our eon bid because when we're using it in the server side mode in gives some

60
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:11,020
said proves the emu variable API will be accessible.

61
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:12,520
All right.

62
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:22,240
So SLAs API, SLAs post by category.

63
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:27,640
And then we need to send a strong so we use less foreign slack.

64
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,290
All right.

65
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,310
So we make a request.

66
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,350
We have some issues.

67
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,490
Excuse.

68
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,300
Oh, yes, it was.

69
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:46,510
My type of head should be input.

70
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:49,540
All right.

71
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,160
See, that's the X yes request.

72
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,390
And then you give us the data.

73
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,720
And now that data, we can return the return.

74
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:03,280
Okay.

75
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,080
So here I think we have to.

76
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,780
So when we return, we always have to return props.

77
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:14,920
So instead, props posts.

78
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:23,890
Tara, let me quickly go to Sarah because here I'm not just I want to show the post, I want to also

79
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,210
show this category in which every category has been collected.

80
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:30,250
You can see a post in Node.

81
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,250
So we are showing the category name as.

82
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:39,430
So that means we need to not only show the the post that belongs to this category, we want to actually

83
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:42,130
have some information about the category as was just about to.

84
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:52,120
We so here for that let me go to my server control category and here I'm returning post only instead

85
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,790
of just return post, let me return category as well.

86
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:58,060
So that way I can throw the category title on the heading.

87
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,470
So post and category.

88
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:07,120
If I do this, we will not only get the post but also get this category.

89
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,420
By the way, let's have a look.

90
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,620
You can see we're getting the posts and categories.

91
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,220
Beautiful.

92
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:19,430
Okay.

93
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:27,560
So that means let's go back here and now we are returning data don't host and we are returning categories

94
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,850
which that would be donna dog category beautiful.

95
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:35,000
So this way we will have access to both posts and categories.

96
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:42,740
Now to render that we can just destroy through the what has been written as props will be accessible

97
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:50,630
here post category and we can just show them.

98
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:56,450
Now before we do that, actually, yeah, we can do that to return.

99
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,720
Let me use fragment here.

100
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:11,450
First I want to use the head six and there's room for a superb was head here let me give the title.

101
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,840
We can show the category name.

102
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:28,250
And matter description we can use.

103
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,980
Let's use category name.

104
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:38,210
Let's let's use that text.

105
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:43,440
And let me just right here read latest post.

106
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:46,820
Category name.

107
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:56,420
Sorry.

108
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,670
That should be.

109
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:01,640
The Baptist.

110
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:06,420
Okay.

111
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:07,500
All right.

112
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:12,930
So we have the health and now let's work on the content, showing the content.

113
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:18,750
So we want to show the content in a room room column.

114
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,240
Grow can have the culture as girls.

115
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,290
Let's use Twitter and then call them.

116
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,660
Small.

117
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,580
We can make a dress.

118
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,110
One, two, three.

119
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,200
In a small screen.

120
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,980
We want to take the full width, so make it tougher for a small screen.

121
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:41,790
Lars use 18 and the remaining.

122
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:46,290
We can show the categories in the sidebar.

123
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:55,290
Make it just margin bottom 12 bit of margin on the bottom.

124
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:04,790
I want to have a bit of a gap here on the very top, so let me use it for that.

125
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:12,130
In that one stone margin, top six big.

126
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:22,040
So I guess just for the sole purpose of having this margin now in this quarter, let's try to show the

127
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:27,740
information about this category and how many post it heads I get.

128
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,570
Let me start from page one.

129
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:42,740
And let me just right here post in the category name category don't name let's make it give it a bit

130
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,610
of a storm.

131
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,220
Text Ally and center.

132
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,270
Yeah.

133
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,810
I just want to make it sound.

134
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:59,290
You can see here we have the heading post in the category.

135
00:10:59,290 --> 00:10:59,590
Name.

136
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:00,550
Is that beautiful?

137
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,530
Let me remove the star sign.

138
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:03,760
Awesome.

139
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:14,650
No, it's not centered and unfortunately this one looks like it's not required objects.

140
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,240
Maybe just a little bit.

141
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,280
I think we can put that here.

142
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:20,800
Yeah, we can.

143
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,630
But then we will have the sidebar.

144
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,400
So I think it's better.

145
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:26,620
It's just undo.

146
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,570
Send this to me in between.

147
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:30,850
And that's that's fair.

148
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,610
Okay, so we got this one.

149
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,220
Let's continue working on this one list.

150
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:38,410
So all the posts that belongs to this category.
