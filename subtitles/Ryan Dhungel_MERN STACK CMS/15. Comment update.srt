1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,330
So far so good.

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:02,310
It's so that.

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:10,890
Comment from this from this comment from requests, couple of arguments, comments at comment and submit

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:11,400
and loading.

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:13,710
This fosters values.

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,310
Pendal submits.

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,510
So now this function will execute.

8
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:29,780
And what it will do is it will send the venting that will have it in the state, the object value.

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,050
You can see here the content.

10
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,220
This valley will send to the back end to update the comment and his comment.

11
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:44,100
We are getting that information we can get from here, that comment idea we can get from this selective

12
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:44,550
comment.

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,440
All right, beautiful.

14
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:54,910
So let's make sure we have right that function we don't have at the moment to handle.

15
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,650
From me comment.

16
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,550
This one, I think we don't actually need the.

17
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,330
Arguments.

18
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,030
On Summit.

19
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,520
We'll come back to this right here.

20
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:18,310
Cartoon.

21
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,750
All right, so let's come down here.

22
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,830
So we need to send in some information.

23
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:32,250
We need to send the comment this.

24
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:38,490
In the state that will be content, I guess, to make sure it is content.

25
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:46,170
The comment venue, comment form, that's the content and set comment will be set content.

26
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,060
And do we have loading?

27
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,900
Let's make sure we have a floating.

28
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,510
We have.

29
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,520
We have looked like beautiful.

30
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:11,350
And Summit.

31
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:13,840
Now, we should work on this one.

32
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,630
Let's see how this looks so far.

33
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,900
Edit You can see the content.

34
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,100
Content is already there.

35
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,230
User can make some changes.

36
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,820
Hit submit and this should trigger this function.

37
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,110
Beautiful.

38
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,140
You can click anywhere to close that model.

39
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,130
You can click here.

40
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:34,630
This is looking good.

41
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,530
Try to edit.

42
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:36,820
Beautiful.

43
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,620
All right, so let's work on this handle summit.

44
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,780
On the handle summit.

45
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:46,510
We have already created the endpoint in the back end.

46
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:58,530
So handsome if one of the do I mean to make you put request concert

47
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:11,730
in concert or wait excuse don't put make a put request to the endpoint and that is less comment less

48
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:19,620
comment ID right now that comment I do we can access from the state selected comment on the click on

49
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,140
the comment to edit.

50
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,680
We need to put that in the state.

51
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:27,900
And that's the reason we did that because we needed to access the I think it's comments less comment

52
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,100
ID.

53
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:32,010
And we are sending the content as a request, Marty.

54
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,540
Now we can send like that that's at.

55
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:38,030
Then.

56
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,390
We get the response right.

57
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:40,760
So.

58
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,800
We can consult?

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,410
No.

60
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,820
Let's have a look at this.

61
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:54,490
David.

62
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,890
We have some type of here.

63
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,920
Koonce diagnosed or it just put.

64
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,980
I noticed we have some typos there because you can see the code is not formatting and there was no space

65
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,160
here.

66
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,530
So I immediately noticed something's not right.

67
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,840
That's because I have 48.

68
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:32,910
And as soon as I have as soon as I have that you can see performance.

69
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:34,080
That's beautiful.

70
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,160
Thanks to PGA rights.

71
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,650
That's a really useful plugin.

72
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:40,670
I hope you using that and submit.

73
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,170
So let's try.

74
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,420
Edit let me open inspect.

75
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,000
Council.

76
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,370
This comment is updated.

77
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:02,280
Let's post we got the response content.

78
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:08,010
Quentin hasn't endorsed Quentin, didn't update.

79
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:19,570
Okay.

80
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,550
So let's figure out why it's happening and we can continue working on this function.

81
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,530
So I tried it.

82
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,260
It didn't work.

83
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,750
Let's have a look at this.

84
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:38,100
Is the function responsible from that when we click and edit.

85
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:40,420
So let's end it.

86
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,310
All of these have been said, selected.

87
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,330
We have this visible.

88
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,710
We have just said content.

89
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:54,570
And here in the model we have the comment form handle submit that gets executed when the button is clicked.

90
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,870
I said, but honestly handsome it gets executed.

91
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:05,240
So that means I'll handle some it function is right here.

92
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,310
Make a request.

93
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,660
Put request comments.

94
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,710
Let's comment and.

95
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:22,150
We sent the Content Council for comment, updated, retain and then just try it one more time.

96
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,090
And it didn't open network dev.

97
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,030
Updated post.

98
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,370
We got the response.

99
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,610
We're getting the response, but it's it's not updated.

100
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:47,650
Okay.

101
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:48,550
So let's.

102
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,850
Put 200.

103
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,900
Let's have a look into our control.

104
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,460
Comptroller's post.

105
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,230
Let's have a look at the round first.

106
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:16,160
I would put comments less comment, add requests and can object delete object comment.

107
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,000
I will look at the object comment.

108
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,740
So we send the comment.

109
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,050
We get the icon comment.

110
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,430
Comment in the request for this limit.

111
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,000
Check that.

112
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,310
So the content content is being sent.

113
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:44,430
Okay.

114
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,330
So let's go to the content.

115
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:50,990
Okay.

116
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,320
I think that's what we need to make tends to content.

117
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:58,250
And I think that that will update it.

118
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:01,180
Post.

119
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,660
You can see now it works beautifully.

120
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:11,080
So that was the issue you reload that has been sent to updated.

121
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:17,880
All right.

122
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:18,660
So it works.

123
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:25,980
But you can see here, when we see when we post, we're not doing anything at the moment, we just console.log.

124
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,510
So let's fix couple of things.

125
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:36,240
We want to close the model, hide the remove the selected item and update the list immediately.

126
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:36,780
Right.

127
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:45,720
So he came back to use a summit and a summit to hear after the meeting a lot.

128
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:52,380
So once we get the data, what I want to do here is the most important one is I want to update this.

129
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,820
So I have a list of comments.

130
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:02,550
I'll have to find that comment from the list of I have to find that common that has been just updated

131
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:06,120
and then replace the content with the.

132
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,690
The object writes for him.

133
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:13,290
First, let me put all the comments in a variable.

134
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:17,200
Let a good student comment.

135
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:23,610
So all the comments in the state are put in this variable and I'm going to use find index function on

136
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:26,730
this very nice sort of cost index.

137
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,150
So I have to find the index because you can see the.

138
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:35,730
So with the the comment that has been just updated.

139
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:40,920
I need to find the index and then only then I can just make make the changes here.

140
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,200
The cost index equals to R3.

141
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,380
Right which is the all the comments.

142
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:56,200
Don't find index we use the find index function and this function takes another function as an argument.

143
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:01,500
So this friend index function will run its time for is item in the array.

144
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,340
So we receive them as comment.

145
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:05,730
See.

146
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:10,290
Okay, so it's comments add if that met.

147
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,900
With this selected common daily.

148
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,770
So this is the selected one that that is the one being updated.

149
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:19,040
Right.

150
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,000
So if.

151
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:29,320
That comment met with the selective comments and then that is the comment we have to find and update

152
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,400
the content.

153
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,800
That's the one need to be updated.

154
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:33,970
All right.

155
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:36,210
So we can find that using a way.

156
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:42,310
So array means all the comments we have to have in the state and then index our items we can always

157
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:47,770
access my indexed, the first one always be zero and then one, two, three, four, five.

158
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:55,060
So that's how we can access the array based on the index so we can find that item from the very best

159
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,800
in the index, whatever we got.

160
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:01,240
And then that item's content I want to tends to

161
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,100
data content.

162
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,020
All right.

163
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:15,190
So that way we will be able to find that particular item of its content valued with this value that

164
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,510
we got from the back end.

165
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:17,590
And then.

166
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:20,930
CIT comments.

167
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:22,430
Are we?

168
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,470
And again, because we have made modified this way.

169
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:32,840
And finally we can send it back to the state said comment.

170
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,400
Now you said that's done that will immediately of did.

171
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:45,540
Yeah you can try edit updating works instantly.

172
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:51,520
I guess it's.

173
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,790
It's not working.

174
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:53,170
Okay.

175
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:53,590
It's for.

176
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:07,530
Host so model has to close when the model plus we see it happens.

177
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:13,500
I guess so let's do let's change the model sources for some.

178
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:16,540
Success.

179
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,050
Mrs..

180
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,150
Comment updated.

181
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,490
Now that is not so important.

182
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:33,060
So again, to the end said visible falls so we don't show the model anymore, said loading.

183
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:34,660
False.

184
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:40,920
In fact, we haven't used the learning hit till it's due, said loading first.

185
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:42,420
We said it's true.

186
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,490
Once we get the response, we set it to false.

187
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,390
Any error.

188
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,710
We said false.

189
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,360
I guess that visible said loading and then said selected comment.

190
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,620
Also the mate empty.

191
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,580
And that is it.

192
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,790
That should work.

193
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:00,510
Let's come here.

194
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,100
Try it.

195
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,840
Now, let's try this one.

196
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:11,330
I can now update my comment.

197
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:13,950
He.

198
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:14,910
Is it beautiful?

199
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:15,690
All right.

200
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:16,620
It walks awesome.

201
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:23,030
You know.

202
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,090
No, I'm sure it works for a subscriber.

203
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,390
So he has a meta comment.

204
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,830
He can filter out.

205
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,380
He can click.

206
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:52,380
I have made an update to this comment.

207
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,240
Beautiful.
