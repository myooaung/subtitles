1
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:00.840
All right.

2
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.860
So you can see here we have a list of users and admin can delete the user ID.

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.420
It is the next feature we we're going to implement.

4
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.710
So when we click on edit, let's try.

5
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:22.300
So when we click at the moment, this is the address which we take, we open a new base, less admins,

6
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.540
less users, and then the user ID.

7
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.180
So let's go ahead, create this space here.

8
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:36.610
We going to implement user object, which is going to be similar to user create base that we had earlier.

9
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:37.600
All right.

10
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.270
So we can even copy the code from there, make some changes and implement the user object.

11
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:49.810
And then we're going to move this code to a component and then try to reuse for other users, for example,

12
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.430
authors and subscribers.

13
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:52.720
All right.

14
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.040
So let's go to pay.

15
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.970
These admin users screwed a new file.

16
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.180
Indeed it is.

17
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.190
So it will be a dynamic bass based A.I..

18
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.660
So what about how do we get based in that we make a request to back in, get that user.

19
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.160
I put that to use this information in the update form.

20
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.880
All right.

21
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:25.150
So if you go to new displays, he's the one we use to create a new user.

22
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.190
You can see we have a form.

23
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.200
To create a new user name, email, password, all that is there.

24
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.980
And then we have a function that sent all this information to back in to create a new user.

25
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.130
All right, so we need a similar base.

26
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.850
So let's copy all this, go to it and paste here.

27
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.210
So we have that form whose can stay the same.

28
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.550
Only thing we need to do is change this function so that we update the user.

29
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.150
Create uses.

30
00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.430
Let me just remove all the score.

31
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:14.180
Yeah.

32
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.260
Update user update.

33
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.120
Phil trying to let's leave this.

34
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.840
So we'll work on this one bit later.

35
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.190
And it is the component.

36
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.340
A name from a new user to update user.

37
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.350
Whereas it tends to combine them.

38
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.290
So we haven't done anything at the moment.

39
00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.340
We just changed the name.

40
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:54.400
We removed this code here, the ex use request and everything else is as sim as it is in the create

41
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.790
piece.

42
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.110
So let's have a look.

43
00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:03.850
And you can see here we have the similar base of this is the base we had here.

44
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.670
So when you when had been want to add and use it.

45
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.590
This is the base ranger.

46
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:09.820
This is the phone we were in.

47
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.980
So the SIM phone is now being used on edit as well.

48
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.280
So this good and you can see we have the same phone.

49
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.730
Now, the only difference here we need to make is faces the information about the users based on the

50
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:25.090
80.

51
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:31.500
Let's grab this 80 from this route and use this to make a request to back in so that we can give that

52
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.450
user information and we put that response in the state and then pre-populated on the phone.

53
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:45.850
Then any changes necessary, we can make the change in summit to finally update the user.

54
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.570
All right.

55
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.450
So that means let's grab this and send a request to back in to get this user information.

56
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.650
For that, we need to use state use.

57
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.600
So to use effect.

58
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.160
So you can use that here.

59
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.740
So use the fact we need to get the user.

60
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.950
Now we don't have the endpoint for this one.

61
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.150
We don't have the endpoint that gives us the user base tonight.

62
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:31.540
So let's go ahead and create that endpoint in the back in first and then we we can continue here.

63
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.560
So about us.

64
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.710
It's create one more gift for our team to run.

65
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:42.880
Don't get.

66
00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.220
We want to give the user.

67
00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:46.780
So user

68
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.340
sorry, the users less user.

69
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.550
I.D. user.

70
00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.070
I know this will be for the logged in user only.

71
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.790
So request.

72
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.090
I need to remove that.

73
00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:14.390
The reason I don't when I play is admin is this robot we can use later for other uses for office and

74
00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:15.080
subscribers.

75
00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.770
Also they can.

76
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.960
When we are updating the information, we will make a request to this end point.

77
00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.540
So we just use requested it and.

78
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:33.620
Current user, let's call it current user profile because we already have the current user here.

79
00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:41.460
So we use current user profile and it's just imported from our controller.

80
00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.070
Let's go to controller also.

81
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:51.090
So current users already there, that one just returned the.

82
00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.660
Okay, so let's go and create another one.

83
00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:06.670
Export const current user for front equals to async request response try.

84
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.940
So here what we want to do is we want to find the user from the database.

85
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:28.210
So user friend ID and we give the user I.D. from that middleware.

86
00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:35.470
And we also want to populate, populate images.

87
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:39.620
And don't take the moral.

88
00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:44.900
Make sure this property we have model C user.

89
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:47.640
It is here.

90
00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:53.070
So it means we want to we need to access the earth.

91
00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:59.640
So when you are updating the profile, we will allow the user to upload the featured images as well.

92
00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:06.800
So for that reason, we can show the images if the user already has the images.

93
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:13.260
So we populate the images and we can send the response response to this user.

94
00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:14.790
All right.

95
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:22.180
So we get the user information along with the image by making requests to the endpoint user slash user.

96
00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:24.720
Okay.

97
00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.130
So it's close this move.

98
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.930
Go back to the client and here, let's try making requests.

99
00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:36.460
Let's put it in a frozen.

100
00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:38.340
Um.

101
00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.170
Can't actually we can just right here.

102
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:42.950
It doesn't really matter.

103
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:48.260
Const current user to async.

104
00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.020
So we have this function.

105
00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.600
We need to make sure we execute this function.

106
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:16.030
So execute now to give the current U.S. we should be sending the token.

107
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.700
That's important to to make sure we send the token.

108
00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.190
Let's use the off as a dependency.

109
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:27.340
And then here we take if we have us, don't go.

110
00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:34.360
Only then we make a request so that when we make a request, the token is sent for sure.

111
00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:37.600
And that will give us a response.

112
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:38.300
You.

113
00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:44.110
So here const data equals to a weight.

114
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:46.120
And it's used to get.

115
00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:52.620
Current user.

116
00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:54.450
All right.

117
00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:59.400
So let's have a look at this consumer law.

118
00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:04.850
According to user.

119
00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:07.000
Data.

120
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:11.850
Okay.

121
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:16.460
So we haven't access the context.

122
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:19.790
So let's access the context so that we can use both.

123
00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:21.210
I agree.

124
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:31.770
So let's make sure we use use context to and then input our context import of context from.

125
00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:38.810
Context was.

126
00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.930
They put it context on targets.

127
00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:50.880
What I always like to do.

128
00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:57.390
Context, Ernst said, includes to use state.

129
00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:03.210
So use context or context.

130
00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:04.650
All right.

131
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.700
Now we should be able to access all.

132
00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:10.470
You can see here, the form is here.

133
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:12.060
Let's have a look in the console.

134
00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:21.910
It really depends.

135
00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:38.800
It's going to need to go on until we have air cannot get full for not phone apps like oh sorry shouldn't

136
00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:49.300
be current should be users less user ID right less users less user right now how do we get the user

137
00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:59.050
81 we could get from the context, but that would that means it will always be the logged in user,

138
00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:02.440
but as an admin you want to object other you just hassle.

139
00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:08.260
So we can't actually depend on the context authority.

140
00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.960
Instead we have to grab it from the roots, right?

141
00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:16.660
So that means we need a hook user which is already there.

142
00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:17.920
So let's use that.

143
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.020
It's grown stronger.

144
00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:24.630
It could see use for our.

145
00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:34.420
And then we can access the programs from the root programs.

146
00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.320
You just got to love.

147
00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:45.860
I wrote.

148
00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:48.000
To query.

149
00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.170
Out that.

150
00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.000
And so that's the name of our base.

151
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.350
So we can actually that's using Roger don't we.

152
00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:03.750
We don't I.

153
00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:09.270
I guess you can hear we get the idea.

154
00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:16.350
So we need that we can actually destroy the ghost I.D..

155
00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:19.700
It goes to Reverend Query.

156
00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:22.600
Thank you.

157
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:23.630
Let's know that.

158
00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:25.500
So we have the I.D. we need to send that.

159
00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:26.700
We can put that here.

160
00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:28.310
I.

161
00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:33.120
Okay.

162
00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:37.700
Now you can see we get the current user response from our back in.

163
00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:42.920
We have all the information we need for this user.

164
00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:48.940
This user haven't uploaded the image so we don't see the image, but everything else is there.

165
00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:53.820
Let me double check.

166
00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.410
So what are you going to do now?

167
00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:58.960
Is we going to populate the state?

168
00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:00.570
You can see at the moment they're empty.

169
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:03.330
So based on this response, we can populate.

170
00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:06.360
So as soon as you populate, those values will be

171
00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:17.970
reflected here in the form, because the forms value is bind to the state, whatever we have in the

172
00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:18.450
state.

173
00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:23.090
Okay.

174
00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:30.620
Now, before I finish this video, let me just go back to and I just wanted to take that we had the

175
00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:36.140
upload images feature and unfortunately we don't have I think I forgot.

176
00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:45.600
Oh, and maybe that it was intentional because when you create a new user, you may not want to upload

177
00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:49.080
the images because that is something maybe users want to do themself.

178
00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:49.680
Right.

179
00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.680
So we can leave it like this.

180
00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:59.730
But when they, if they want to add the image or mislead, they can add by updating their profile.

181
00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.600
At the moment, obviously admin is doing more later.

182
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:09.870
They will be able to do themself as well in the profile, will be using the same same code.

183
00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:16.530
So we put it in a component and try to reuse so that they can go to the profile in upload the images.

184
00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.690
So that will be a similar process.

185
00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:20.670
So we will land them on this space.

186
00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:29.100
So here, one more thing we want to do is so the images option so that they can upload the images as.
