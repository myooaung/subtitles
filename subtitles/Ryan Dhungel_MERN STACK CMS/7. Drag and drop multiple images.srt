1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:00,580
Okay.

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,890
So previously we were able to upload the image, a single image, which is awesome.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,090
It's working.

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:13,170
When it is successfully uploaded, we got the response and we're not doing anything with that response

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:13,680
for a moment.

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:19,400
We just console.log, but very soon we'll put that in the media context, I guess.

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,420
So let's wait for this one because let's also work on the media library.

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,160
So we have both components ready.

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:26,970
All right.

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,940
So let's work on the the media library.

11
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:34,650
Now here we're going to have the multiple upload with drag and drop.

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:42,070
So let's roll that and then we can just work on this response.

13
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,920
So we will put in the context.

14
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:45,570
Okay.

15
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,930
So let me close this test for now.

16
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,250
And media libraries.

17
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:54,910
Let's go.

18
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:00,760
In fact, the North, there would be a lot of similarities, so maybe we can just split window.

19
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:10,990
Let's keep a profile here in media library here, just so that we can save some time by copying the

20
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:11,650
inputs.

21
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:17,080
So pretty much all all that we need here familiar library as well.

22
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,900
So we have the upload, we have the misses.

23
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:21,490
We didn't need the button.

24
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,860
This time we're using the drag and drop.

25
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,470
Upload outlines instead of Rhode Island.

26
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:35,500
We need another one that's called inbox outlined.

27
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,430
All right, then.

28
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,430
What are you going to do?

29
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:46,850
Is this props we might be able to use?

30
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:47,960
Pretty much as it is.

31
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,430
So let me just copy that.

32
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,760
Call me the props.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,690
But yeah.

34
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:00,230
And let's also access the.

35
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,700
Context so that we can use the token.

36
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,350
All right.

37
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,590
So so far, you can see it's pretty much similar up to here.

38
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:20,720
The only difference we're going to have is the upload.

39
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:24,830
Now, instead of upload, we're going to use drag.

40
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:30,350
A drag is also something and destructor from the upload.

41
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,410
Let me quickly show you the other example.

42
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,590
So this is the one we're going to use drag and drop multiple upload.

43
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:41,760
You can see the code looks pretty much similar.

44
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:45,800
We just have to change, make some small changes to our props.

45
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:53,240
And here we just saw the drag instead of upload, we saw the dragon and then we have some text, we

46
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:53,960
have the icon.

47
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:58,670
So this is the text divide into you can see it's pretty similar.

48
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:04,100
The only thing we want to change is make it multiple so that it supports multiple upload.

49
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:05,510
Okay.

50
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:11,720
So let's use the drag so we can destructor drag from upload, which we already have.

51
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:19,940
We already have the upload, so let's destruction that and then let's use the drag.

52
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:28,990
So to return, we want to then that with Dracula.

53
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:35,950
And here again, just like abroad, we use props.

54
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,940
And I think this driver is mindful of its multiple.

55
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:46,810
So we don't have to probably use multiple yet the paragraph.

56
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:51,310
Mm hmm.

57
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,170
What he can do here is.

58
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,200
They give you the class?

59
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,640
Well, in fact, we may not need class name in books.

60
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:07,910
I would mainly just use this item for now.

61
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,280
And another Peter.

62
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:16,130
And here we can right click and drag.

63
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,660
Click and drag find to.

64
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:27,380
This area had two problems.

65
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,460
All right, so let's see how this looks.

66
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,070
Beautiful.

67
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:38,710
All right.

68
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,690
That's looking good.

69
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:46,230
Now, obviously, you can write some cheeses to make it look nice and big if you want.

70
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,100
Probably.

71
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:53,960
Actually, we can use the default class name they used here and upload drag icons.

72
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,110
Let's try using that.

73
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,280
Let's have a look.

74
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:09,030
Yeah.

75
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,140
So that makes a difference.

76
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:15,420
So we can use the different class names from the and documentation as well.

77
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,440
James and Blue Text.

78
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:33,810
Okay.

79
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,510
Let's have a look.

80
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,350
Beautiful.

81
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,210
All right, so we've got that drag and drop.

82
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:46,510
And now let me close this and just keep one window.

83
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:47,860
One window.

84
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,320
And let's go on the.

85
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,280
And this one, Brooks.

86
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,980
So we still are going to use the same endpoint.

87
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:03,970
So this endpoint will receive the images as a form data and upload the cloud in every save in the database.

88
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,970
Give us the rest once it will continue to work with.

89
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,620
It's one file of many files.

90
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,220
Doesn't matter.

91
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,260
So that's that's fine

92
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:14,800
here.

93
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:15,160
Okay.

94
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,470
So here we have to use multiple.

95
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:20,670
I can.

96
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:21,950
So, multiple truth.

97
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,510
That's the accent.

98
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,100
Let's put it on top.

99
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,900
Name one.

100
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,170
And then that one gets a multiple drew.

101
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:35,990
We got X and we get the token on the ten's everything as it is.

102
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,910
Happening with the upload.

103
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,290
Fine.

104
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,580
It's the same thing when it is done.

105
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:45,730
We saw the success.

106
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:46,180
Mrs..

107
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,670
We console.log the infra file.

108
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:57,800
There's one more thing you'll notice in the document doesn't on drop until we have this function.

109
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:58,160
All right.

110
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,800
So let's just make sure we have that function as well.

111
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:02,710
So.

112
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,310
So that's on tens and on drop.

113
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:10,980
They basically console.log.

114
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:14,680
But this probably will work behind the scenes.

115
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,360
Whether you are drag and drop or you just click in select multiple operative will work.

116
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,470
All right.

117
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:26,620
So into a fun drag draw.

118
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:33,310
So at the moment we just want a logging here and console.log here, here in both components.

119
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:37,630
I guess it will work on this response.

120
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,520
We will put in this context state.

121
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:47,770
But so far let's try and let's make sure media libraries also working for multiple upload answer it's

122
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:56,650
here and we have the console and then try this time I'm going to try to upload it so you can upload

123
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:57,700
as many as you want.

124
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:01,490
Okay.

125
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,350
Now you can see here.

126
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,550
We got both of these players.

127
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,080
Both of them are successful.

128
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,730
We got the response.

129
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,180
Both of them have been assembling the database.

130
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,100
All right.

131
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,930
So that's awesome.

132
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:22,510
You can have a look at the database if you go to media.

133
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:30,360
You can see all these images have been uploaded so we can grab from this.

134
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,220
So in the library.

135
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,030
One more thing I noticed then too when we.

136
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:44,630
When we are abroad, we should see some kind of uploading files name and this upload status just like

137
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,340
we saw in the of France.

138
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,480
So we should see that here as well.

139
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,380
But for some reason, I didn't see that.

140
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,630
Let me just try one more time.

141
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,460
Featured image.

142
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,330
Click and drag.

143
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:14,650
Now, another problem with this one is it will probably select all kinds of files.

144
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:15,210
All right.

145
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,390
So you want to limit this to only the immune state.

146
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,400
So let's fix that.

147
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,590
Dragon.

148
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,390
So what you can do here is.

149
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:32,690
You can use that property concept.

150
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,610
I sit and you are searched.

151
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,250
All kinds of images.

152
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,150
Images, less everything.

153
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:52,680
Now you could do imagery being or something like that.

154
00:09:53,130 --> 00:10:01,770
But when you do this one wild card still in Mr. Debate PNC, all of the file types with images you would

155
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:09,590
be able to upload obviously with that tens if I come here and select something different, for example,

156
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,000
this file, TNT, you can select.

157
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,860
So let me try them.

158
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,310
Try these two friends.

159
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,810
I just want to see.

160
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:20,550
I can see.

161
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:24,510
Looks like there's something there, but you can see this height increase.

162
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,850
But for some reason we don't see that.

163
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:42,040
So the size has increased, but we don't see that it's inspect.

164
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,790
And upload drag.

165
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,110
So we just used it.

166
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,320
And I think it's the height issue.

167
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,770
So height, let's say 150 feet.

168
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:08,040
So.

169
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:13,530
Okay.

170
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,380
So that's reason.

171
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:24,310
So we have the France but it was somehow it was just marking these files for the reason so we need to

172
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:29,950
and this year is I guess this so that we can see the uploaded files.

173
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,690
So let's go and put inside probably.

174
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,730
Stents or C assistance.

175
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:39,330
Put them here.

176
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:41,700
Okay.

177
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:46,470
Now, let me just try some more.

178
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:52,740
Let me just try three and even two while they're happening.

179
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,370
We see that and they're absolutely beautiful.

180
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:58,050
Okay.

181
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:04,170
So we have been able to upload single images as well as multiple images along with the drag and drop.

182
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:05,580
All right.

183
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:11,040
So all this response we receive in our approach to this function.

184
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:17,460
So let's go ahead, create a context so that we can put all this uploaded media France to have context.

185
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,510
So I've been saying drag and drop, but I haven't actually shown you the dragon drops.

186
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,690
William Quigley show you how that works as well.

187
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,210
So let's go to desktop.

188
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:38,610
Let's go to images and let me just address this three image limit.

189
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:43,080
Just click and drag and you can see the drag and drop works.

190
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,050
Awesome.
