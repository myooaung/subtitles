1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:01,050
All right.

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:08,280
Now that we have the context to make sure this is available for the entire application, let's input

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,630
in addresses.

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:11,250
All right.

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,450
So that's important.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,560
We have to do structure use.

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:17,880
Sorry.

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:18,690
Theme.

9
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:26,740
Provider from the start up.

10
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:34,090
So we go one step up here in this level and then we go inside context and theme.

11
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,550
So that's how we get theme, provide it.

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,220
And then once we have that, we can to wrap.

13
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:47,850
So at the moment, we're just returning this default to all the component with the props.

14
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,320
So we just want to wrap it with.

15
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,200
In provider.

16
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,220
And we put that here beautiful.

17
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:02,990
And with this, we should be able to access the context values.

18
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,290
Theme and setting in our application.

19
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:06,740
All right.

20
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:12,890
So to give that a try, we could try in home the home base.

21
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:20,330
Oh, we could create a separate component and just import that here that we later we can easily import

22
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,250
that in our navigation and use that.

23
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:22,670
All right.

24
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:29,120
So let's create a component and we can call that toggle theme.

25
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:37,820
I guess so here, client, let's create a new fold called components inside here.

26
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:41,330
Let's create a file called toggle

27
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,380
double tin bridges.

28
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:54,560
By the way, you you will notice that whenever I'm creating any component, the name will start with

29
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,520
the capital letter.

30
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,120
But everything else will be using a locus.

31
00:01:59,270 --> 00:01:59,450
All right.

32
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,010
It's only for the components.

33
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,140
Only for the components.

34
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,600
I would be using the uppercase name.

35
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:12,290
All right, so here we want to add that functionality to toggle the theme.

36
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:16,250
All right, so first, let me write a very simple component.

37
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,510
So import.

38
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,820
In fact, we may not even need to import React because I think with Nexis, you don't have to.

39
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,430
It is imported by default.

40
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:28,920
All right.

41
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,350
Let's create a component.

42
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,070
Let's call it

43
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,630
double theme equals two.

44
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:43,990
We return for the moment just to make sure that everything is working.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,930
Let me just to use one and let's call it.

46
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,410
Double team component.

47
00:02:52,450 --> 00:03:00,420
I just want to make sure that we can import it and have a look in the home base before we add that functionality.

48
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:00,910
All right.

49
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:07,030
So hue exposed and default toggle thing.

50
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:08,770
All right.

51
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,760
So let me just import this one in our home based.

52
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,570
Import double team from.

53
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,040
We go one step, one components.

54
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,020
Terrible thing.

55
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:32,330
All right.

56
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,970
And then let's put that here temporarily later.

57
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:39,930
We're going to put it in the navigation instead of home base.

58
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:44,820
But for the moment, since we don't have the navigation, we just put it here just so that we can give

59
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,360
it a try.

60
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,130
All right.

61
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:54,300
So let me put some land bridge here and then use that component double theme.

62
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:56,460
All right.

63
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,770
So we imported the theme and we put it here.

64
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:02,070
So this way, we can easily use the components here.

65
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:02,630
Okay.

66
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,920
So we can bring down to call if there is a lot of quarter we can bring down and put in a multiple component

67
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,730
and bring them all together here and build up a base.

68
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,500
I guess that's the beauty of React.

69
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:14,680
All right.

70
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,480
It's a double theme.

71
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:21,270
Let's see if we have and yes, we have that text is coming from that component.

72
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,160
So everything is working so far.

73
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:23,790
Beautiful.

74
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,890
So now let's go here.

75
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:33,030
Now, instead of here's one obviously we want we want to actually use the.

76
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,350
Icons.

77
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:42,560
We can use icons or we can use emoji, you know, like theme, dark theme for the moment.

78
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:50,390
And maybe we can even use a but simple, but why not before we actually implement the the emojis here?

79
00:04:53,330 --> 00:05:00,230
By the way, it's really easy to use emojis in verse code and I think I should see, I say, let's go

80
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,170
install this plug in if you don't have it.

81
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:10,820
By the way, you could also copy the emoji from emoji.

82
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,760
Let me just write some email.

83
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:23,030
You can just copy paste from the website as well.

84
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:30,040
But obviously this takes a lot of work, so we're going to install that plug more difficult if you want.

85
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:32,690
You could just copy like that as well based here.

86
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:34,910
Okay.

87
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,620
So that doesn't work.

88
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,140
Okay.

89
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,550
So they had this awesome copy.

90
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,850
Okay, then return.

91
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,770
Now let me use India and let me paste that here.

92
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,080
So this is how also you can use emoji.

93
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,130
I guess we've got that.

94
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:03,180
But obviously there's a better, easier way, which is using a plugin.

95
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:13,170
Let me show you that once that you can use circle command, command, sift beat or you can go

96
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,280
in.

97
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,390
So from here you can.

98
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:26,160
If you don't have the sidebar open, you can use command to to open and close and the school.

99
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,080
I didn't really use the menu.

100
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:30,800
I always use soccer.

101
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,560
But let's see if we can.

102
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,710
Find.

103
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:39,980
Come on, palette.

104
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:40,790
I guess that's.

105
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:41,720
Come on, Sophie.

106
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:46,010
So from here also, you can search for the plug in to the one we wanted.

107
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:46,560
Emoji.

108
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:46,850
Right.

109
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:47,930
So emoji.

110
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,480
And since I did have insulin, you can see it's already there.

111
00:06:54,580 --> 00:07:00,610
But if you don't have it already installed, you can just use command to open the sidebar.

112
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:03,490
Click here and then search for emoji.

113
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,080
All right, so.

114
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,050
Extensions said click here.

115
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,300
Emoji.

116
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:22,630
And you can see this one I have already installed.

117
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:29,470
So this plugin will allow you to easily insert images in you could.

118
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:38,200
It's not very nice to install this plug in emoji and then once you have that installed command swift

119
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:46,540
e let me close this once you have that installed, let me remember that what I can do is command swift

120
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,470
feet again.

121
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,780
Same as you did before.

122
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,970
Good to.

123
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,390
What is that command palette?

124
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,750
Come back better.

125
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:00,320
All right.

126
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:06,890
So once you have it installed, you can type emoji and then click on into the music and then you can

127
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:07,910
just type, right?

128
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:11,900
So let me type something and you see, I get that.

129
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,330
So that is the full song.

130
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:15,710
All right.

131
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,670
So it's here.

132
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,390
So then you've got that food here.

133
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,340
Beautiful.

134
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,750
So that's how you can use Moses.

135
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:29,020
All right, so what we were doing is we wanted to add that functionality.

136
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:34,740
Now, before we do that, first we want to access the theme context, right?

137
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,520
That's the one we want.

138
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:40,920
So for that, we can use use context.

139
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,250
You can see we've been using a lot of these react hooks.

140
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,590
Use context from React.

141
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,820
And this hope will allow us to access the context.

142
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:53,470
All right.

143
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,030
So we have this hope.

144
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,570
And we need to actually import the context as well.

145
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:06,970
So if you remember, we have exported the context and provide the provider we import in averages and

146
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:07,470
left.

147
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,290
So that's all.

148
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,210
You don't have to import this provider anywhere else.

149
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:11,760
That's it.

150
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:12,430
It's done.

151
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:17,860
But in this context, you will be importing all the time whenever you need to use this context.

152
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:18,340
All right.

153
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,310
So let's import this one here.

154
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,050
Import in context from.

155
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:33,140
So we go one step of get inside context theme.

156
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,520
So we have this use context hope.

157
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,550
We have the actual thing context as well.

158
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:43,180
Before we start using it, we can

159
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,260
access the theme and then set team.

160
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:57,070
From use context and the give the venue theme context.

161
00:09:59,170 --> 00:09:59,480
All right.

162
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,920
So this way we can use the global context state.

163
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,900
So let me quickly take you there.

164
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:15,490
So when we were creating this context, we have this local theme that's our local state for this component.

165
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:21,940
And for that, whenever you want to use local city, you use use state hook.

166
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:28,270
However, why do you want to access the the global context to use the use context and you pass the actual

167
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:28,810
context.

168
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,890
And that will give us the value here if you want to.

169
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:37,630
If you're curious, you can even try have a look at it.

170
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,280
So this is a disk so we can put those to port here.

171
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:46,570
So this way he can have a look into the value theme.

172
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,130
So let's see what we have here.

173
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,260
You can see current theme is light.

174
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,610
That's where you select.

175
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,220
So that means you have been able to access the global context.

176
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:57,550
All right.

177
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:03,100
So now if you turn this to dark, you can see send this to dark.

178
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,800
So that's absolutely beautiful.

179
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:13,260
You have been able to access the global state in your component here.

180
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,140
So awesome.

181
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,830
Now we can create a we use a button to.

182
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,560
Let's use a button.

183
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,680
Oh, we could make it clickable.

184
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:25,980
Right.

185
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,370
So let's actually make it clear.

186
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,000
I guess so.

187
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,110
Let me use.

188
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,870
Let's use fragments.

189
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:43,080
So this is something you're going to use and react to if you're going to react multiple elements here.

190
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:48,880
Then you can put them all together within these.

191
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,820
The syntax is called react fragment.

192
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:52,720
All right.

193
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,110
Because you cannot return to items.

194
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:02,290
Everything you want to return must be wrapped in this outside a wrapper, which should be just one.

195
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:06,700
But I'm going to inside this fragment so you can put your code.

196
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:13,180
So here we want to use this icon.

197
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:20,700
So let me use span tag for that span again, then another span.

198
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:25,720
And here I'm going to use that another half for the dog thing.

199
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:29,500
So command TV emoji inserting movie.

200
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,350
Let me use some.

201
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:40,560
This time I'm going to choose this half duct first for the moon symbol.

202
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,370
He is that.

203
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:42,460
All right.

204
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,660
So conditionally.

205
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,060
We would be sharing this one to end the click on this one.

206
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,780
We saw the light theme when they click.

207
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,030
And this one we saw the duct.
