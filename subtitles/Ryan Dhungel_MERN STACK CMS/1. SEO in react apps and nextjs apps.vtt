00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:00.750
All right.

2
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:07.920
So we have done almost everything we need to clear the post along with the featured image so we can

3
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:08.610
create a post.

4
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.310
We include, we can add a title.

5
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.310
We have there is a text editor, we can add images.

6
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.770
We can embed images in the post.

7
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:27.420
We can do all that and we can now we can two categories and we can now choose the featured images as

8
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.470
well as you can see you.

9
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.850
Right.

10
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:38.320
So what we need to do now is show the all these posts that we already have created for post.

11
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.650
Right.

12
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.020
So let's just create one more word here.

13
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:49.240
And in the next video, we're going to start showing the the post.

14
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.700
I guess we can create a wrote the endpoint in the back end that will give us all the posts and then

15
00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.040
we're going to display all this posts we can display either in the homepage or maybe we'll create another

16
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.220
piece called Post and that's where we can decide the post.

17
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.190
So maybe we could have a base for posts like this one.

18
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:07.720
This is the finished project.

19
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.580
And see we have the post office and here we show all this post like this.

20
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.140
All right.

21
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.610
So we're going to work on that now before we do the link discretely, finish this one.

22
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.040
Let's create this one.

23
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.140
And then in this video, I'm also going to talk about the SEO.

24
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.500
Right?

25
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.860
So search engine optimization, that is very important if you want your website to be found on Google

26
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:33.320
Search.

27
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.610
Right.

28
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:40.930
So by default, the React applications, if you use create React by default, they are not not very

29
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.340
SEO friendly technically.

30
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:49.240
Google says they still call these websites the building itself and that was stripped entirely.

31
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.530
But still, I will give you the examples of you will see the difference.

32
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.960
So this is let me quickly create this post

33
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.150
the last post from.

34
00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.480
Right.

35
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.480
Let me just copy some content from here.

36
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.520
Oh, and personally, I don't have any.

37
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:15.700
Let me.

38
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.520
Let's go down.

39
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.490
Let's try this one.

40
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.960
I guess I've got some content and I mean copy.

41
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.260
And then let's go back.

42
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.240
It's best you.

43
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.590
And also so we have the featured images as well.

44
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.630
So let's go ahead and publish this one.

45
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.680
All right.

46
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:35.730
So it has been created.

47
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.170
We got all these posts right now.

48
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.020
It's time to show the post in the new piece.

49
00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.770
Now, before we work on that, let me quickly say the importance of next year.

50
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.200
The whole reason we're using next year and not create React EP is for SEO reason.

51
00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.960
For example, you know this website we are creating now, this is a finished one.

52
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.760
So this is issue friendly.

53
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:07.540
This is built with the next year and we're going to use the get initial props function to load all this

54
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.710
post from the back in.

55
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.660
Not use it this time because this piece will be for users.

56
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.240
So people will be visiting the space.

57
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.190
This will be available publicly.

58
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.470
So far, whatever we did here, for example, admin, this base doesn't have to be issue because this

59
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.410
is for the user.

60
00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.430
When they log in, they will access this space.

61
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.360
So this is not a publicly available place, so it doesn't have to be issue.

62
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.530
So that's why we used the use effect hook to load all the post.

63
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:45.360
Now when we want to create the post base for the public, then we want to make sure they are certain.

64
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.710
Don't really know.

65
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:56.130
What I mean by that is you can see this when we lowered anything using user effect, those content that

66
00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.300
we are showing on the page, they're actually not available in the bases really.

67
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.230
So when the base is ready immediately, it is not there.

68
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.630
It it is there for a few seconds, a few milliseconds.

69
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.320
Okay.

70
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:15.570
However, if the page is so said rendered, then the content until the content is there, the business

71
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:16.830
will not learn at all.

72
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.530
So in the page load, the content is already there.

73
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.440
So that's why when the of the search engine.

74
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.900
Roberts For example, the Google search engine bought, when they come looking for your site, they

75
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.690
will on the very first load.

76
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.620
If they don't see any content, they will just move on.

77
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:35.040
Yeah.

78
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.620
So that's why they probably will not index because they will see the empty site even though you have

79
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.430
the content the load bit later because the you using use effect.

80
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.750
So when they don't see the content, they just move on and they don't index your site.

81
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.850
So that's why it is not really great for issue.

82
00:04:54.030 --> 00:05:00.300
However, if you're using next year and using the get initial props instead of use effect, which we're

83
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:08.760
going to use in the very next lesson that will make sure that your business does not render until the

84
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.410
data is received from the server.

85
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.720
So that is also known as server side rendering.

86
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.490
All right.

87
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.450
So we're going to use that so that our pages are issue friendly now really quickly.

88
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.310
So you are two sites, one using just create React app.

89
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:24.240
Okay.

90
00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.610
So let me go to Ryan to the intercom.

91
00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.050
That's my side here.

92
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.890
I show some of the the project based course.

93
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.960
They have the lab demo here.

94
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:43.470
So let me show you one recent lab built a ecommerce application to take out the demo, but then now

95
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.660
this one is not really cleared.

96
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.160
Face you all right.

97
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:55.950
That's because you can see this space has all this content to this is the new arrivals the product title

98
00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.410
in a product description.

99
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.190
I guess some more product category names, subcategories names.

100
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.630
All this content is here.

101
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:06.960
It's really good for you.

102
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:13.140
However, it might not be noticed by search engines.

103
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.090
That's because it really means right click and spew business.

104
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.700
You can see this is the the code that the searching robot will see.

105
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:31.340
Now you can see we have a div with the idea of root and it is empty I guess because by default it is

106
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:38.660
empty only when the when we get the data then we have some content to show on the page.

107
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:43.760
So by default, the search in the robots, they will see the empty space.

108
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.130
So they will probably not index.

109
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:52.820
Now, technically, Google says that they index all the pieces, even they are built with full JavaScript

110
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:53.790
they will index.

111
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.550
However, obviously there is a difference and it's not if you.

112
00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:06.290
Primary focus is issue, then you want to use next year or some kind of associated rendering instead

113
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:09.830
of just using a create react like this.

114
00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:11.990
I guess this is the create factor.

115
00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.170
Now, let me show you another side.

116
00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:23.970
That is built with Nexus and that is issue friendly, which is a simpler platform.

117
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.890
So here we have all these blocs here.

118
00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.510
So we have some discontent here.

119
00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:35.160
Now, let me rightly and you base source.

120
00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.390
Now you can see here all that content you can see here.

121
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:53.920
It's not just the empty div like this one for that ecommerce exhibition.

122
00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:54.860
You see the difference.

123
00:07:55.730 --> 00:08:01.500
So when a Google search, the search engine boards, they come looking for the site.

124
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:06.230
They will see all this content for the very first time when the bases loaded.

125
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:07.370
So they will know that.

126
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:11.510
Okay, so this website has a lot of this content, so we should probably index it.

127
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:12.740
So that's how it works.

128
00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:16.070
However, with the plane and react, it's a little bit difficult.

129
00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:25.340
Now, of course, over time, once you so it gets more and more traffic and Google will people will

130
00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.440
come to your site for useful information.

131
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.330
Then obviously over time Google will index.

132
00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:30.170
It's not like that.

133
00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.420
It will be invisible for search engines.

134
00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:39.500
It's not like that, but it's not a great starting point if you want to focus an issue.

135
00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:40.850
Okay.

136
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:44.960
So with that said, I showed you, for example, a bit of a theory.

137
00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:53.210
Now let's move on and let's create a post piece like this so that we can so all this post with service

138
00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:58.640
and so said drini using he the get get sort of sad thanks.
