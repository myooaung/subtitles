1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,150
So we want to show the list of comments here.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,150
And also I want to get the response.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,270
We want the user information and not just diety.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,330
So let's go go to our back end.

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:17,310
It's going to be the control function we created to create form.

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:22,200
So once we create a new new comment, we're sending that as a response.

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,560
Now, before we do that, let's use broccoli.

8
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:25,260
Okay.

9
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:29,070
So new comments.

10
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:41,010
So we're going to make changes to this variable and let's change that from concept to let me comment

11
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:41,850
dot.

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,170
I me commit equals two weeks

13
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,230
away.

14
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,300
So this new comment, it's it's the mongoose model.

15
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:05,510
You know, you can see this is this entire the model is pulling this variable.

16
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:09,300
So we can actually use this as a model.

17
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,580
So our new comment, don't build to the end.

18
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,200
Use it like this to populate.

19
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,960
And in our case, we want to populate.

20
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:19,460
Posted my.

21
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:32,190
So we want to populate the user's name I.D. We don't have to it will automatically include so just that.

22
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:35,320
All right.

23
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,870
And then we send this new comment.

24
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,080
But this time, the information has populate.

25
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,180
All right, so let's try one more time.

26
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,330
It's cool.

27
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,660
Now the user info is returned.

28
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,460
Most.

29
00:01:53,240 --> 00:02:00,260
Let's see this time you can see now this post and why it's not just data but we have their user information

30
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,220
name and then 80.

31
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,030
Beautiful.

32
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:04,310
All right.

33
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,070
So that's good.

34
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:11,270
When we create a new comment, we immediately give that comment.

35
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,490
So obviously we are putting that in.

36
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,020
The comments are safe.

37
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:15,740
All right.

38
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:25,310
So you can see, oh, here we going to put that we are putting that in the commentary each time a new

39
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,270
comment is created.

40
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:33,620
However, when we load the space for the very first time that this post may already have comments,

41
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:33,840
right?

42
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,710
So we need to be showing that.

43
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:44,360
So at the moment we don't have that yet because if you go to your controller one more time, let's go

44
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,050
to post.

45
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:51,320
Let's see what End Point is giving us this single post.

46
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,840
So for that again, let's go here.

47
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,040
Let's go all the way down.

48
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:00,860
So this is how we getting the single post so you can see posts less slow.

49
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:01,750
All right.

50
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,170
So let's have a look at that.

51
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,040
We can start from the root.

52
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,650
So to get out to get the post posts, let's look.

53
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,180
So this is the one single post.

54
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,640
All right, let's have a look in the single post.

55
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,270
Control of once single post.

56
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,350
In a single post.

57
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,160
It's not sending the comments.

58
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,520
And then you just take the moral.

59
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,080
We need to make sure we have.

60
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,770
Comments in the model.

61
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,590
Oh yeah.

62
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:51,530
Unfortunately we don't have because when I was building this app, even in the beginning, I didn't

63
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,760
think about adding comments.

64
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,600
But that's fine.

65
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,610
What we can do is we can add, No.

66
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,910
Actually, I just realized that we don't need to have the comments over here.

67
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:09,180
That's because a comment is a a new document, the economic model.

68
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,710
We have the common model already.

69
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,310
You can see.

70
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:14,180
So.

71
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:22,230
We can query the comment comment model and try to find all the comments for any post.

72
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:29,150
You know, we just need the post daily so we can find all the comments based on the Post A.D. and we

73
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:32,190
written all the comments that belongs to this post.

74
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,450
Okay, this is better.

75
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:34,560
Actually, this is much better.

76
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,650
So that's great.

77
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:41,740
That means let's go back here to single post.

78
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,130
So whenever we are sending the single post.

79
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,800
So we have the single post now, not just the post.

80
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,530
We want to send the comment as well.

81
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:50,640
All right.

82
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:55,500
So let's see how we can find all the comments that belongs to this post.

83
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:00,300
So what we can do here is we can use the comment model find.

84
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,330
Now only differences we can find based on the post side.

85
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:05,250
Right.

86
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,730
So we have the post idea property in the comments model.

87
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:15,870
So we find both post idea and the value we give is this one single most beautiful.

88
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,290
So this will give us all the comment because you can find the comments based on the post 80, which

89
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:25,560
is at this post 80 right here we giving the value.

90
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:34,560
So now, now that we have that, when we send the JSON response, we can send post and.

91
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,770
Dick comments.

92
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,740
Now let's use the object posts.

93
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,070
Post comments.

94
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:42,920
Okay.

95
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:49,050
So now that we have made this change, we have to slightly change how getting the data in the front

96
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:49,170
end.

97
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,890
But now that.

98
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,190
Great.

99
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,470
Now we can actually do one more thing here.

100
00:05:54,690 --> 00:06:04,400
Dot populate again the comments that don't actually populate the user's information.

101
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,710
They just have the posted by ID.

102
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:13,760
So each comment when we are sending we want to show the user net who created the comment.

103
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:14,180
Right.

104
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,580
To limit clearly so the finished happy.

105
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:20,510
You can see whenever we shrink the list of comment we need to show the user's name.

106
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,860
The user should be different.

107
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,430
Right.

108
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,490
So that means we need to populate.

109
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,730
Dot, populate.

110
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,340
And we just need to populate the name.

111
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:36,410
All right.

112
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:41,210
So we we're sending the comments instead of ideally sending the actual user information.

113
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:46,970
And then so let's sort the comments based on the newly created ones.

114
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,720
We want to be them on the top.

115
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,280
So created and mentioned.

116
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:53,870
All right.

117
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,530
And we sending both post and comment now.

118
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:58,850
Now with this tens.

119
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,600
If it come here, give it reload.

120
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,510
It will probably it will not work again.

121
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,270
You can see it.

122
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,190
We have issues.

123
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,860
That's because now you.

124
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,680
We're not getting the post.

125
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:25,550
This data has data Deutsche Post and data documents.

126
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:26,450
All right.

127
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:30,590
So what you need to do is data Deutsche Post.

128
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:37,640
So that's what you need to do because that's how you're sending the object.

129
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,080
Okay.

130
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,810
Now, with this change, it will work.

131
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,390
I can see how that works.

132
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:55,130
Now, that also means that we should be getting the comments as well.

133
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:01,970
So let's return the post comment as well, which should be done in the comments.

134
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:02,960
Thank you.

135
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,880
So these comments we can.

136
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,290
Access that you.

137
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:19,630
And then we can render all the comments so we can render the comments right after this comment form.

138
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:20,590
Right.

139
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,360
So we can.

140
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,280
Let me just use preprint on.

141
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:34,740
Comments.

142
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,470
Let's have a look at it.

143
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,790
We have material in.

144
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,120
Give it a reload.

145
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:50,060
Comment has already been declared.

146
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,450
So we looks like we have some naming conflict.

147
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:57,550
Okay.

148
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:58,300
That's right.

149
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,970
Because we call it comments.

150
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,700
And then we are receiving the common sense.

151
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,980
So there's a naming conflict.

152
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,510
Let's not change the state in selecting this.

153
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:16,750
So instead of calling comments, let's call it post comment.

154
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,310
Let's come down here.

155
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:25,220
Let's give this as props post comments again.

156
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,820
Now we can access post comments,

157
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:37,630
post comments, and then that value will be the comments that here.

158
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,050
Right.

159
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,290
So instead of away we use post comments.

160
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:43,870
Beautiful.

161
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,200
All right, let's keep it a reload.

162
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,330
All right.

163
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,950
We have the comment form and then.

164
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,920
Empty area of comment so something's not worked.

165
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,770
So let's have a look, you know.

166
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,690
Control us.

167
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,070
Single post comments.

168
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,830
It's continual love.

169
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,720
Let's see what we get here.

170
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:28,760
Reload.

171
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,250
Go here.

172
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,990
We have the MTA.

173
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,330
We?

174
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,430
Post IED.

175
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:08,470
Let's have a look how we saved the comment.

176
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,300
Quick comment.

177
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,820
Content posted.

178
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,410
So that's that's the issue.

179
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,510
So we've saved it as posted.

180
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,930
Should we post D right soon before stating.

181
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,100
That is request body request for arms for say.

182
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,210
So that's the reason.

183
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:34,470
Now, now that we are saving the post idea, I think this time once we know start saving it should work.

184
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,620
Single post we finding on the post.

185
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:39,780
Based on the post only.

186
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,950
So this time it's a dog.

187
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,020
Let's give it a try.

188
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,670
Let's read a few comments.

189
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:49,570
And comment.

190
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,480
You can see immediately we have this new comment.

191
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,500
Second comment.

192
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:02,510
So this happens whenever we create a new comment, we push that.

193
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,550
So right here.

194
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:13,040
We put that to the comments in the state, but now we need to make sure we give them when the beast

195
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,720
loads for the first time.

196
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,280
Let's try for.

197
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,890
It's really slow in the development mode.

198
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,290
Can it populate?

199
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,730
Because it is not in your schema.

200
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:50,540
That is less a single.

201
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,220
So it's glued to the controller single post.

202
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,430
Cannot populate.

203
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,500
Making silly mistakes.

204
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:30,480
It's not popular.

205
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,480
It should be posted.

206
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:33,750
But

207
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,460
hopefully you you notice that.

208
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:49,030
Awesome.

209
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:49,790
I can see.

210
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:56,520
When we load the pope the bush for the very first time, we give them an A whenever we create that time,

211
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,430
once we give them there's one more thing I need to show you.

212
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:07,860
And that is if you go to the dashboard, go to all post trying to edit the post, you will not get the

213
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,300
post.

214
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:13,380
That's because we have changed how the post is sent.

215
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,000
Right?

216
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,000
So let's go.

217
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,700
Let's fix them.

218
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,870
That one is basis.

219
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:33,210
So that's that's in the components that's posts and post.

220
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:39,410
So here we're making requests to give that post.

221
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:45,040
And this time here we are getting data don't post, don't title.

222
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:50,540
So since we have, we're returning to object post and comment.

223
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,130
So here we need post.

224
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:54,230
So dot, dot, dot post.

225
00:14:54,590 --> 00:15:00,860
I guess so let's make sure we add then data dot post and same here.

226
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:08,780
Doesn't.

227
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,320
Don't.

228
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:18,630
Postcode categories are used to hear and then hear everything we are accessing.

229
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:25,950
Previous stats data we need to make tends to Dr. Dawson to know it walks into.

230
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,190
It.
