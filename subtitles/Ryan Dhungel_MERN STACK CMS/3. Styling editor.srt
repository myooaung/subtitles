1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:00,810
All right.

2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:01,500
So we got this.

3
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,050
Ed, let's try to fix a few things.

4
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:08,800
For example, you can see this icon is pushing out.

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:09,820
So let's fix that.

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,370
So I think what we need to do is we need to give it a certain width.

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:14,970
All right.

8
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,960
And then on the sidebar, we will have a few other things.

9
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:25,170
For example, preview button, publish button option for uploading the image, things like this.

10
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,590
We will put on the the small column.

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,290
And then here we will have this editor.

12
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,290
All right, so let's come here.

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,590
So now we have the editor instead.

14
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:40,460
I'm going to.

15
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,310
Clear the rows and columns.

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,370
It's got and it's used to rule

17
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,120
in set rules.

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,890
It's used call and put that content back here in the column.

19
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,130
Let's make sure we have the rows and columns from end.

20
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,050
So this column I want to divide.

21
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:12,880
So let's use this spend 16 I guess a total of 24 column groups.

22
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:24,460
So we give this column 16 and for the sidebar we can give it a span of eight, two, eight and six,

23
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,520
and all together it will be 24.

24
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,460
So let me just write this sidebar for now.

25
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,020
It's going to have a look.

26
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:33,010
Okay.

27
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,870
So we got decide where we got that one.

28
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:40,960
We should have a bit of a gotcha quarter or whatever we called it previously.

29
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:46,030
That base we were working, that was categories, right?

30
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:51,070
So here if you have a look we have built for gap.

31
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,410
So that's that's how we want to.

32
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:58,170
Wanted to look here in the great new year as well.

33
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,320
So let's quickly have a look at how we did the categories.

34
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:07,130
So the column we have the Rose column.

35
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,370
So this is how we did it.

36
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,960
So on the small screen, we give it a full width and.

37
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,890
It's very small and small.

38
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,880
In the last one, we split, so we give it.

39
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,500
We give it a.

40
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,750
Ten offset to altogether 12.

41
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,190
So we split into half.

42
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,400
So what we want to do is we want to use offset.

43
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,830
And if you care about the very small screen, then obviously you can use these values as well.

44
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,270
So offset.

45
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,950
So that's what I want to use you.

46
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:43,180
Spent.

47
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,370
So let me go back to Categories Index.

48
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,600
I guess they sold us offset.

49
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:04,920
So let's use this article and forward it and then we will have offset one on both sides.

50
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,890
So altogether six.

51
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,580
And same here.

52
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:13,230
Let's give it to any of six and offset one.

53
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:14,850
Okay.

54
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,290
So let's see how this looks.

55
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:16,830
Okay.

56
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,260
So we got this beautiful space that looks good.

57
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:27,150
The next one we want is the size 30.

58
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,260
It's too small.

59
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,200
So let's make it kind of big.

60
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,200
Something like this one.

61
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,440
So let's make it look something like that.

62
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,160
And we should have this icon also inside this box.

63
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:49,950
So the editor we have here, first of all, let's fix the theme.

64
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:52,310
So when we go dark, let's make it dark.

65
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,980
When in light it is light.

66
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,460
All right.

67
00:03:55,460 --> 00:04:01,700
So for that, we have to access the theme context, its existence, import

68
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:16,700
theme of context from one sentence, 232 context theme to use context, let's import use context to

69
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:31,160
import use context from react are then we can use that hook, you know, context, context.

70
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,260
So we want to do structure theme.

71
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:44,300
So theme set theme from use context and we give the context that is theme context.

72
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:46,740
Awesome.

73
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,630
Now we should be able to access the theme.

74
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:56,600
If I have a look at it gone to long theme, we should be able to see the theme in the console is created

75
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,560
to give that a try.

76
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,050
So you can see it's currently light.

77
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:03,950
It's light.

78
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,290
If I turn this, it becomes dark.

79
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,670
It becomes light, I guess, if that's how it works.

80
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:13,470
So we get the value from the context, which is great.

81
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,250
So let me remove that consumer.

82
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:21,390
So we're going to use that value to dynamically change the background of this editor.

83
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:32,020
So previously we so it takes this box dark and then if we give it a value of true, it becomes dark.

84
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,670
If the value is false, it becomes flat.

85
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,790
Okay, so let's try to turn this dynamically.

86
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,160
So what are we going to do?

87
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:49,870
Here is the one we have in the context, if that is equals, equals equals light.

88
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,540
So we have the two themes, light and dark.

89
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:52,870
All right.

90
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:58,390
So if it is light, we want to set value to false.

91
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:01,930
Okay.

92
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,440
So we need to use the donor.

93
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,450
Okay.

94
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:10,250
So if it is light, we set it to false.

95
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:16,760
So if you give the value false to dark, then you see the light integer, right?

96
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,100
So if we have the light thing, then we want to use the light editor.

97
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,510
So we give it the value false.

98
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,690
Otherwise we should.

99
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:33,590
That suit dynamic the tensely dry he can too in a good dark dark it becomes dark.

100
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,520
When I go to light, it is light.

101
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:39,200
Beautiful.

102
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,660
Now let's add some padding.

103
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:44,960
You can see it is the content is up to the very is.

104
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,080
Let's add some styling.

105
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,670
So here editor, let's use some style.

106
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,630
By the way, actually, it's not going to work in.

107
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,640
You can't apply the styling here.

108
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:06,380
Instead, we have to find out the see if this class name this editor is using and we have to apply some

109
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:06,620
here.

110
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,840
So let me open the inspect,

111
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,760
go to element.

112
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,020
He's just here.

113
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:22,440
And let me right click on this one, this particular element, and click inspect.

114
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,190
That takes me to this element you can see here.

115
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:30,200
So I'm trying to figure out the wrapping.

116
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:31,500
Do you?

117
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:37,350
So this you can see this is using the class name of Bruce Miller.

118
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,070
So this do we want to target this?

119
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:46,620
So let's take this class now and we can apply some see assists to discuss them.

120
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:52,740
Now I have this plug in the addon in in my Google Chrome.

121
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,160
So it's not mandatory.

122
00:07:55,170 --> 00:08:01,440
You don't have to have, but it is helpful for trying out some live cases.

123
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:08,580
For example, to this class name I can write some C assume that you will see applied immediately here,

124
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,230
which can be very helpful.

125
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:21,990
So if you want to install this ad into your Google Chrome, you can go to Chrome Extensions Chrome Web

126
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:28,950
store and you can use the one that is called Live C.

127
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,870
S as editor.

128
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:39,450
Life, she said.

129
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:41,620
Which one is the a lot?

130
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,470
That's the one I'm using.

131
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,400
I think the this is the one.

132
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,360
So you see, I have this option removed.

133
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,260
So this is the one.

134
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,000
If you want, you can use.

135
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,060
It's nice and easy to use and it's very helpful.

136
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:02,560
Ah, so I'm going to target this deep with a class named macros pros.

137
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,780
Let's try.

138
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,190
So let's say height.

139
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:09,910
We want to give it a bit of a bigger height, let's say 200 pixel.

140
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:19,860
I guess you can see you mean deletions change barely padding top and bottom.

141
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:23,650
Let's say we want 15 pixel and right and left

142
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,380
for this icon to be inside the body.

143
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,440
Let's say 25 picks.

144
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:35,130
All right.

145
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,770
So that looks

146
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:39,870
awesome.

147
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:42,640
Okay.

148
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,910
And what else we can do here?

149
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:51,550
So this is the editor and let me try border radius.

150
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:31,700
I think that will do for the moment to discuss this studying and copy and go to your thesis for other

151
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,230
studies or to assist in this.

152
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:42,080
But that here I come, here you may need to restart sometimes.

153
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:47,540
Okay, so we've got this beautiful now, atria.

154
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,610
We can die.

155
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,100
We have this thing inside.

156
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:58,820
Okay, now, if I told the theme, I guess that looks good as well.

157
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,510
Beautiful.

158
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,500
There are few more things we want to do.

159
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,410
For example, this valley we want to put in the state.

160
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:09,340
All right.

161
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:15,940
So this time, we are going to use the, um, the desert form component.

162
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:24,610
We could, but we're just going to use the input field for the title and then we have the series editor.

163
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:28,990
So all these valleys we want to control and for that going to have our own state.

164
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:36,940
And so we need to use the user state hook put all the value from this end is for whatever user types

165
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,430
and we take that value put in the state.

166
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:49,300
And for that we can import use the state hook and here let's write

167
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,570
the screw in our state so we can call that const.

168
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,840
We can call that content said content.

169
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,160
You can still use state.

170
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:07,410
All right.

171
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:18,630
So when the value changes, we can put that value here that we later when we have all the information,

172
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:24,660
for example, the content, the featured images, the post title, all that, all together we can send

173
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,510
to the backend and we can save that in the database.

174
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,540
So we put in the state.

175
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:37,890
Previously, if you remember in the categories and sign in and sign a basis we were using the end isn't

176
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:43,680
from component and that had its own state and that would give us the values on finish function.

177
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:44,010
Right.

178
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:48,740
But this one I said will work a little differently because we're going to have our own state.

179
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:53,010
So let's come down here.

180
00:12:53,040 --> 00:13:03,450
So this editor, whenever you get user input, the value changes on terms we can do the error function.

181
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:10,830
It's on change, you get the value and then you can control of the value just so that you can see or

182
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:11,400
to get.

183
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,980
Before we try to put it in the state.

184
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,260
So let's have a look at terms.

185
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,450
Now let's console.log.

186
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:20,880
One

187
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:29,310
thing you actually return valid only the function we get in control.

188
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:29,880
Okay.

189
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,970
So that's that's the tricky part on this one.

190
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,890
You can see we get only the function in reality.

191
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,430
We have to execute this function.

192
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:41,610
So the way it works is this value you see on until you get the value.

193
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,530
That value actually is a function.

194
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:47,490
So you have to execute that and that will give you the actual value.

195
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,320
I guess it's a little bit tricky.

196
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:50,310
You can see you.

197
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:51,780
To do that.

198
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,780
And this time it comes in.

199
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,200
Beautiful.

200
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:05,850
So instead of canceling now we want to put in the state now to put in the state.

201
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:09,810
All you have to do is sit content.

202
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,130
That's all you need to do, right?

203
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:20,350
Now, once you do that, if you're curious, you can file for a temporary use.

204
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,870
We can just have a look at it.

205
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:28,870
Pre session street fi content.

206
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,310
No.

207
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:30,940
Four.

208
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,870
Let's have a look at what we have in this state.

209
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:48,000
You can see I see the time and the line breaks are then a swarm in.

210
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,960
Make it bigger.

211
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:55,110
You don't see it when you don't see the actual heads table because this is a markdown markdown editor

212
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,520
but it will render.

213
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,460
Has Tim went on the base?

214
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,710
I guess that's beautiful.

215
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,150
So we cut the content.

216
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,310
What do we type in that is put in the state?
