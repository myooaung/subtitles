1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,500
All right, so before we work on this for control function, I realize we need one more.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,050
You can see here to get all the comments.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:13,080
At the moment, only admin can get on the comments, but we will also need to get all the comments of

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,740
the user right.

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:20,910
So any user, any comments delivered could be in one post, could be in many posts.

6
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,460
Doesn't matter all the comments that they have left.

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,910
We want to wait for users as well so we can we can do use this because this will return all the comment.

8
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,110
This is only for the admin.

9
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:37,260
So let's it's another out for the user comments.

10
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,940
So what does it get?

11
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,010
Let's call it user comments.

12
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,550
Require a signing and then the user comment.

13
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,570
Make sure to include this control function.

14
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,340
And it's pretty.

15
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,530
So no need to credit this five functions.

16
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,210
Here's a comment.

17
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,810
Let's make sure we have that.

18
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:11,230
Let me just copy that.

19
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,590
Extend this to user comments.

20
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:16,490
Beautiful.

21
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,290
All right, now let's start working.

22
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:25,850
So let's first swerve in the comments which will return all the comments.

23
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:30,360
Now we need to make sure we have the pagination because we own.

24
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:38,000
Have implemented this business concept for the admin because the admin will be receiving all the.

25
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,900
All the comments, that can be quite a lot.

26
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:45,160
All right.

27
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,990
So we are we will be receiving the base as a root for arms.

28
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:59,400
And you see here first, just like we did earlier for the post, if you remember, Bob Baselitz said

29
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,940
it to our little G six.

30
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:10,680
Of course you can set it to 50, 100, let's set it to six because we don't have many comments at the

31
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:18,390
moment because we should be receiving from the request, perhaps a request from base.

32
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,520
If we have, we use that value.

33
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,310
Otherwise, by default, we use the value one.

34
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,090
All right, now let's find the comments.

35
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:29,760
Comments.

36
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:37,090
Let's use our comment Eagles to await

37
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:53,560
comment model user defined function and then we keep is minus one multiply or base.

38
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,700
Then we populate.

39
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,720
Posted by you this information we want just to name.

40
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:19,480
Then we want to also populate post forestieri so that we can get the post information title struck.

41
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:21,520
So no comma.

42
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:30,280
This can be useful because when you send all the comment for admin or the user, it would be useful

43
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,580
to know this comment was left on which post?

44
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:33,970
Right.

45
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:37,900
So we should be able to show the post title.

46
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,030
For each comment.

47
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,790
Otherwise it can be very confusing.

48
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,820
We saw all the comments, but I use this done.

49
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,090
Not on which post the comment belongs to.

50
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:48,360
Right.

51
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,580
So we need to send the post information as well.

52
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:52,710
We can do that like this.

53
00:03:54,210 --> 00:04:00,270
Now let's start by the latest one at the limit parties.

54
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,960
So that's six and that's pretty much it.

55
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,930
No written response.

56
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:10,950
All comments.

57
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:12,510
Beautiful.

58
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:18,150
So that's how we can send out the comment with the pagination two is time can be hitting six.

59
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:19,580
Okay.

60
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:25,710
And then as the BS goes up to three four, that will.

61
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,480
We have this minus, so that will be deducted.

62
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,540
So if it is to do minus base.

63
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:43,600
So if the baby's due to management, there will be one that will be skipped party so that six posts

64
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,400
will be skipped when it is three.

65
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,170
Then that time poo poo poo comment will be skipped and so on.

66
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:56,400
All right, so we've already done this similar thing for the Post as well before, I guess.

67
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,160
So that's four comments now for user comments.

68
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,540
So now this time we want to find all the comment that belongs to that user.

69
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:11,660
And so this time, what you can do is go and count.

70
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:12,260
Sorry.

71
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,290
Not that one can't.

72
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,980
Let's put it in a variable comments.

73
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:23,030
It looks to avoid comment front.

74
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:28,280
So we find all the comments based on this posted by information.

75
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:37,760
So posted by the logged in, you decided I guess, to find all these comments and then Richard.

76
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:49,770
Actually, let's use some probability, just like we did before for the admin.

77
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,240
So we're going to populate.

78
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:55,380
Published.

79
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:56,730
Posted by.

80
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,030
We want to get the users name.

81
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:07,430
Then again, we want to populate the post information as well.

82
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:10,430
So post it.

83
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,100
We can send the title in slot.

84
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,920
We can search.

85
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:23,890
Based on the created date, the latest ones, and that is it.

86
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:35,820
So that's how we can get all the comments of to use it and we can return the response station comments.

87
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:44,560
So we return all the comments for the admin, we return all the comments that is found based on the

88
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,990
posted way for user comments.

89
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:55,150
Next one, we want to get the total of the comments so that we can use this in the pagination.

90
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:55,750
All right.

91
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,690
So count equals of it.

92
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,160
Comment on documents.

93
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,910
We can use that.

94
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,140
That would give us all the count.

95
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,040
So if we have nine comments that will give us the number nine.

96
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:07,180
Yep.

97
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:07,740
Like that.

98
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:11,860
That would be the response we send that like this.

99
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:13,540
Now.

100
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,060
Next one, let's work on.

101
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,440
Update and remove.

102
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:22,440
All right.

103
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:29,490
So to update the comment, all we can do is we can find the comment, find writing update pretty straightforward.

104
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:35,850
So first we can find we need to know which comment to update.

105
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,020
This comment ID is something we will be receiving in the request frames.

106
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:40,440
Right.

107
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:44,530
So we can grab that destructor from request params then.

108
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:49,230
Now we should also be sending the comment.

109
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,570
In the request body.

110
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:58,830
In fact, that will be content will be sending the content from in the request body.

111
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,540
And then once we have this information, we can finally update the content.

112
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:06,150
So fine by adding an update.

113
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,800
So fine by the, based on this idea.

114
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:13,590
And then what you want to update is we want to update the content, right?

115
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,970
So content.

116
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:26,260
Um, I'm not sure how we, I think before we had it common.

117
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:31,510
So if we are receiving the comment, then we could just leave it like this.

118
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,290
Content.

119
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,400
Slim into some of that.

120
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,060
I'm pretty sure we can send the content.

121
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,010
Let me quickly go up.

122
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,480
Previously we had.

123
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,770
Create comments or when we accredit, we sending the comment.

124
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:50,420
Okay.

125
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:53,460
And then the content value would be comment.

126
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:53,760
Okay.

127
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,950
So that means we want to do something simple.

128
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,290
Copy that.

129
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:05,680
And then instead of content, actually we are receiving the comment like it's use comment.

130
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:09,130
So content will be comment.

131
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:15,460
Perfect new truth and we return the updated comment immediately.

132
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,510
No.

133
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,980
Next one is to remove the comment.

134
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,080
So here again, we can use the similar fonts and find bad idea and they move.

135
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:34,570
We can use that to const comment comment fine by adding delete, remove or dig.

136
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:42,490
Both works the same way and have that valid ID we will be getting in their request frames commentating

137
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:46,240
so you can destructor like this all you can do it it like this.

138
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:48,040
Okay.

139
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:57,130
And then he sent the response okay too because we don't really need to send the due date comment in

140
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,870
the front it beautiful.

141
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:06,220
You can see here we have all these functions to remove, update, get the count, get all the users

142
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:11,140
comment and the entire comments collection for ADD Beautiful.

143
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:19,060
Now that we have this one, let's head over to our client and start working in the decimal.

144
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:27,120
The youths, desperate admin and other users desperate for the comment and allow them to update intimate.
