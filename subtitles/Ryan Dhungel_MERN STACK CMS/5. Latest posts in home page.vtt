1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:00.780
All right.

2
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:02.630
So it's looking good so far.

3
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:07.800
We have the full within minutes we have these these counters.

4
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.060
Next one we want to work on is let me show you the finished project.

5
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.850
So next one is this one.

6
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.170
So we saw this should dismiss at the background you can see the images stayed the content scrolls.

7
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.180
This is called Parallax Image's Parallax Effect.

8
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:34.710
So we'll create a separate component for this one so you can pass your favorite images in this path

9
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.400
and then you'll be able to display it like that, and then you can display whatever content you want.

10
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.300
All right.

11
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:50.850
So here we just will write some of the blog post, the title and the latest blogs we will show.

12
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.180
And in the background, we will have this image if it.

13
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.900
All right.

14
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.890
So let's go ahead.

15
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.120
Create that.

16
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.240
I guess some things.

17
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.990
Except this one doesn't exist.

18
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.160
This is accessible to everyone.

19
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.990
So I'm not sure what you guys are doing.

20
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.730
Looks like a card file and it's delete.

21
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:21.960
So it isn't.

22
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.100
So you can see as an admin, you can just clean up some of the stuff if you don't like it.

23
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.820
You know, then you have the right to.

24
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.410
You are able to manage your content.

25
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:40.610
All right, beautiful.

26
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.720
So let's go ahead and work on that section, though.

27
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.490
So let me head over to my home base back again.

28
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.480
So this is the home base.

29
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.570
So I've got all these the counters in this column.

30
00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.210
Now, let me create another rule.

31
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.950
Brand new room.

32
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.460
So in this role I will sort the parallax image.

33
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.870
But let's wait for that.

34
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:18.410
I will create a separate component so that you can always reuse that, you know, that nice, beautiful

35
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.470
parallax background you can use any way in the application to make it reusable.

36
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.470
But for now, let's focus on the content first.

37
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.650
So instead of this brand new role, let's clear the column.

38
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.500
Give this a span of 24 to date full with.

39
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.300
Let's make sure it is Capital C column component.

40
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.260
And so here we will open the image I live in.

41
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.320
Leave living like this.

42
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.730
Let me just read like that for the moment.

43
00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.410
And here, let me quit heading.

44
00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.470
Let's call it blog posts.

45
00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:11.630
And then down here, let me show all the latest posts.

46
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.290
All right.

47
00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.250
So we all have the hook for that.

48
00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.550
So let's import hooks.

49
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.680
Import use latest posts.

50
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.760
From.

51
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.970
So we go.

52
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.400
We go inside.

53
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.730
So we are here in two bases.

54
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.090
So we go one step.

55
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.030
One step.

56
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.920
Get inside hooks.

57
00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.460
Huge slit exposed.

58
00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.630
And here we are going to show the categories.

59
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.360
As usual, it's important to use

60
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:08.470
use categories.

61
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.480
Use categories from use category.

62
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:22.640
Use category.

63
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:25.240
Okay.

64
00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.870
And I shouldn't be destructing.

65
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.120
Actually, it's a default export, so let me fix that.

66
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:39.920
So we've got them now.

67
00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.100
Let's use them.

68
00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.410
So called latest post from use latest first at home.

69
00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.660
And then we want a category, as you said, that would be categories.

70
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.000
News category.

71
00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.460
Great.

72
00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.780
Now we can map through the post and through the list of post down here.

73
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.680
So blog posts dried off from that made me creative.

74
00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.200
And here let's move through the latest posts.

75
00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:23.360
Dog met so we map to East Post and here we can render is posts.

76
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.580
We can use a link component.

77
00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:30.650
So when you use a click on the posts, we can take them to view the actual post.

78
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.980
Right?

79
00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.080
So let's make sure we have a link as well.

80
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:41.770
It's import link from next link.

81
00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:44.520
And then down here.

82
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:55.630
Link requires hedge funds for hedge riff that would be less or less post slung.

83
00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.880
And here we need to have anchor tag.

84
00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:00.810
And then here we can.

85
00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.500
So the post title post.

86
00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.720
Darth.

87
00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.000
It looks like we have some tape over here.

88
00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:17.460
Link cement.

89
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:25.280
Okay.

90
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:27.380
So you've got the least opposed.

91
00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:28.370
Let's have a look.

92
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.780
And yes, we have we have the the heading.

93
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.970
We have all of them just all in line.

94
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.190
So let's fix that.

95
00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:43.700
Um, what we can do here is we can use history to display this post.

96
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:55.760
So let me just cut and use page three based here and let's give some style as well for the DB style.

97
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.730
I want to center the the headings.

98
00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.610
So text line center

99
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.220
next run for the post.

100
00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.390
I think we don't really need to do much of that.

101
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.500
Let's have a look.

102
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:14.860
All right.

103
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:15.730
So that looks good.

104
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:16.690
It's white.

105
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:21.610
Now, when it says the theme, the black suit.

106
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:26.480
Always feel free to change if you need to change the color, you know.

107
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:27.070
Is it right?

108
00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:31.660
If you want it to always be white, you can always right.

109
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.310
You see, this is what I think we can display.

110
00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:33.790
We like that.

111
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:34.510
It looks all right.

112
00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:42.730
So now that we have that, let's go and.

113
00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:52.390
Work on the parallax image so that we can just be here and then we can put this content that this whole

114
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:56.350
content on top of the image, just like this one.

115
00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:03.030
So for that, we need to go ahead and create a parallax image component.
