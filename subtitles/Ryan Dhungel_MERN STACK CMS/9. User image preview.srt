1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:02,760
Okay.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:08,910
So if there is media that has been selected so we can show the previous, that is something we can do.

3
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:11,990
Good.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,370
So let's work on that.

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,010
Let's try to show the preview.

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,830
So we're going to use the Avatar component from and let's make sure we have that.

7
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:33,670
It's come down.

8
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,490
So we have this written block.

9
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:38,230
We have media.

10
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,080
Let's put it underneath the media.

11
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:55,370
Probably we should have a line break and here we can to show the users immense.

12
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,330
So here first we took.

13
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:08,980
Actually, instead of using brake, let's just use a dip and do some use some scissors cluster.

14
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:18,520
All right, so div class name or even class news guys, start, start margin bottom.

15
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,320
Let's use 20.

16
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:32,780
And then text a line center here.

17
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,020
We check if we have the media in the context of media

18
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:39,390
selectors.

19
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:43,520
If we have the select media, then we want to show

20
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:47,570
the selected media.

21
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:52,730
Otherwise we want to show the other media for the images.

22
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,860
So here, what are we can do here?

23
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:05,420
If we have the selected media, we can use the to use fragment.

24
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:11,960
And here we show the avatar.

25
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:25,400
And we give the source the source of the image that's going to be media or selected, don't you?

26
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:31,610
And then we can give the size to this avatar and let's gives the size.

27
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:35,590
Of 100.

28
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,110
I say if we have the media, we use that

29
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:47,570
we want to have a bit of a lambrechts in the media, use MTV, not Glenn Beck.

30
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:48,890
So it's a bit of a space.

31
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:55,640
So let me use the empty div with some style, style margin bottom.

32
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,830
I'm going to use just 50.

33
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,730
I guess if we have the selected media, we display that.

34
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:08,660
Otherwise, if you don't have the media, then we have to check if we have the image.

35
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:15,140
So if you don't have the media in the context, but if the user didn't select from the library or didn't

36
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:20,090
approve the new one, then this user may already have the images.

37
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,080
So if that is true, then we have to take those rules.

38
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,820
Now we can take the images in the state.

39
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:33,740
So if images this is a nested ternary, we do something that otherwise we just don't see anything.

40
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:40,250
So if we have the images, then again, let me just copy then paste you.

41
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,050
That immense hero we saw.

42
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,910
Otherwise, we don't see.

43
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:48,690
All right.

44
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,280
So this bit of good will.

45
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,140
So the preview is come here.

46
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,660
You can see we have the images.

47
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,570
Now, if I pick another one.

48
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,120
If I pick this one.

49
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,020
I guess that has been selected.

50
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,090
Now, once that is selected, this stays here.

51
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:13,120
So you would have to just go to toggle the tap.

52
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:20,590
Now, if you don't want to do that, you can pass some kind of a prop that will toggle.

53
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:22,330
All right.

54
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:33,790
I think what we can do here is when you select the media library, it just comes up and that blocks

55
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:34,210
the view.

56
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:40,980
Let's move these images on top of this one so that then it makes sense when they select their kids,

57
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:46,510
then they can see the preview in real time and then they can just continue in the form.

58
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,240
So let's just change the order.

59
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,050
By the way, I was trying this props.

60
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,350
Let's not use that scooter only.

61
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,720
I was trying to pass the process, insert doing that.

62
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,900
Let's just reorder some media.

63
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,090
We put underneath this preview images.

64
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:22,630
Maybe so that makes sense because now when they select the media, they can see the black preview in

65
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:30,340
real time and they can discontinue don't oh, they can just toggle and just go gone with the phone.

66
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:31,420
All right.

67
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:34,080
So we got the update.

68
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:34,930
Let me open.

69
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,410
Let's make sure everything work.

70
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:47,690
So for example, try updating without income with only a race or password.

71
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,460
So we are getting this error message, but we're not showing that.

72
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:55,370
So let's see how we can do that as well.

73
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,300
Back here,

74
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,900
let's just handed the errors here so they are misses.

75
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,160
So if.

76
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,330
If Dona error.

77
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:19,600
So if you got the time to do it and then to stare into the error so the misses otherwise.

78
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:29,230
Otherwise what we can do here is we have to update the user right to use our builder successfully.

79
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:34,210
So when it happens we also need to make sure we ordered the user in the context and we also ordered

80
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,830
the user end of stories.

81
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,710
So let me just note we have the other context we have like.

82
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:50,960
So in that case, what we can do here is we can.

83
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,600
I'm doing the context.

84
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:10,030
St Paul's spelled out the rest of the venues and we went on to submit to the user.

85
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,910
We did have to object the token to leave it like that.

86
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:16,590
Just the user with the data that's already we got.

87
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,220
So that's how we opted.

88
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:24,550
The context and local stories also is there, said Adam.

89
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,950
Before we actually do that.

90
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:33,960
First let's get because again, in the local stories, we have to only update the user.

91
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,350
We didn't have time to talk.

92
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:45,700
So let's grab the van from local stories and put in a variable first to lift from the local stories

93
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,060
it can.

94
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:56,620
So we have to pass the value to Jason because the local stories to ticket item by then keep us.

95
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:04,330
So we grab that that is in the decent format so we use decent bars so that that is ready to use here

96
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:06,760
then.

97
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,140
So we get the object here using decent bars.

98
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:13,120
So we want to update the user.

99
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:17,440
So look at this variable, that value dot user.

100
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,260
So it has a user token, right?

101
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,910
So we just want to object the user.

102
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,130
So don't use a construct data.

103
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,290
And then finally.

104
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,050
In Syria.

105
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:32,910
Back to the level stories set out on us listeners far from large stories.

106
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:38,250
When you serve it back, the data for the user has been changed.

107
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,010
Okay.

108
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:45,360
And then we to the toast notification and that is it.

109
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:48,670
All right.

110
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,610
All right, let's try and just put it on actually better.

111
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,420
Let's try with the three on this short password, we give that notification.

112
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,870
If I give long enough, that works beautifully.

113
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:13,940
Um.

114
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,990
What else we can take.

115
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:21,250
So if we don't turn the vanity mirror format, inverted image to that works.

116
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,430
In real world.

117
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:31,730
Most likely you may not want to share this email as editable, free, maybe just make it disabled or

118
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,410
don't use the input as well.

119
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,220
Because when they.

120
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:35,840
If the.

121
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,230
I'll do the email then.

122
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:44,210
Yeah, there might be some consequences.

123
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:49,620
Just think about that, because most of the sites you visit to, you know, they don't allow you to

124
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:50,790
update the email.

125
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:54,980
But it's technically okay, but it's up to you.

126
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:03,190
So I can change the rule, but I don't want to make myself authors.

127
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,280
Let's leave it like that.

128
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,170
So it looks good.

129
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:11,180
Let me just give it a refresh and make sure the dialogue is there.

130
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,680
And you use it.

131
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,190
And new mobile just ended.

132
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,480
Submit your back to all users.

133
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,040
Reload.

134
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,250
You see, it has, you know.

135
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:50,420
Beautiful.
