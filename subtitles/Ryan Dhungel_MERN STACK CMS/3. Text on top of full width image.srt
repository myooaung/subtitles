1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:01,260
All right.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,180
So let's continue working here.

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,790
So we want to show some content.

4
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,230
So we've got these images here.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,380
So right after the emails and it's great to know that did.

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,570
And here in David is right.

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,940
Let's use H1.

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,740
Let's call, it seems.

9
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:31,210
Let's use paragraph and here let's call it content management system.

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,910
And then we also use a button to the let's import button from and

11
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:56,620
import button form and and then let's import I can handle to use with the button import send outlined.

12
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:06,190
I come from and icons and then let's import link as well from next link.

13
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:09,610
I.

14
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,350
So here, let's put that burden.

15
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,440
It's okay to be a burden.

16
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,230
Let's go explore here.

17
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,880
We just make it a link.

18
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:33,980
So let's actually cut this one.

19
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,200
Put it into a link.

20
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,060
Put into a.

21
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,140
Based that here in the link requires.

22
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,520
So history of.

23
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:50,720
Lisa Sylvester.

24
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,520
So any user who loves him, they will get this decimal subscriber, right?

25
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,010
So we take them there.

26
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:03,500
But if the user is not logged in, then obviously they will get redirected to log in base automatically.

27
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:03,950
Right.

28
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,590
So go this button.

29
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,150
Now let's have a look.

30
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,760
Now you can see we have this content.

31
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:16,190
Now what we want to do is we want to put some apply some styling and put it right here on top of the.

32
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:22,490
So for that, this day we do our best and stuff.

33
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:29,810
Here we use we want to send to the contents of text line center.

34
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,910
Let's add a bit of a margin margin to,

35
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:43,100
let's say -400 for 20 pixel.

36
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,040
Foreign sites.

37
00:02:48,010 --> 00:03:00,910
One says, let me use 75 big so and then they just said, oh, I want to use a bit of a tech, so to

38
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:01,350
speak.

39
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:01,870
So.

40
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,000
To be so.

41
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,180
So horizontally and vertically.

42
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,350
We applied the saddle and then the blur for pixel.

43
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:12,570
And then the color.

44
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,960
We just use black.

45
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,150
All right.

46
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,680
As you can see, it's already there.

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,590
We have applied some margin.

48
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,420
Don't send to the text.

49
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,220
Apply some CC into.

50
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,860
So that looks pretty good.

51
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,830
Now, this content, this gap, we don't need that big.

52
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,210
And then this content.

53
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,310
We want it to be mid small.

54
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,140
So had to run.

55
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,930
What are we going to do here is apply.

56
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,690
Actually, we don't need to apply any thing on this one.

57
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,260
That's fine.

58
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,660
The paragraph stuck.

59
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,730
I want to make it smaller.

60
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:55,430
Font size.

61
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,560
So font size.

62
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,530
It's a 18 pixel.

63
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,300
Margin talk.

64
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:10,120
I want it -150 picks and probably that should be a right color.

65
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:13,940
I think is fine just by default.

66
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,130
And.

67
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:18,560
Okay.

68
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:20,150
But that's a bit too much.

69
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,420
-150.

70
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,130
-200.

71
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,530
It looks good.

72
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,000
And we've got the button here.

73
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,510
Let's give it a type primary.

74
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,330
Size.

75
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:43,930
Last.

76
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,240
And then.

77
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:57,280
What we can do here is we can use the icon and one icon.

78
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:07,860
Send our plan, we use that icon and then this link that we have.

79
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:11,760
Yeah.

80
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,320
I think we need to really do anything in this.

81
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:14,670
Good.

82
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:20,250
If you don't like this most space, you can use margin dope, negative value.

83
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,390
But I think it looks pretty good.

84
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:27,180
My family here, we take them to the subscriber base because the user is logged in.

85
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,500
But if not.

86
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:33,720
And if they click here, they will get redirected to.

87
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,500
Log in page.

88
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,410
This should be redirected logging.

89
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:43,710
Let me.

90
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,220
Let me see.

91
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,210
Why is that happening?

92
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,400
Let's go to.

93
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:58,930
So that would be insert components layout, subscriber layout.

94
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:06,880
So if we have the authenticated using token, we run this code.

95
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,180
And if we get the data, we set the loading defaults.

96
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,500
Otherwise we take we reader to home base.

97
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:19,560
Okay.

98
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,580
So I realized that we have to do some kind of redirect.

99
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,700
Maybe we can use said interval.

100
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:34,470
So start the countdown, maybe a couple of seconds, and then we redirect the user to our home page,

101
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,270
the log in page, whichever piece we want.

102
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:36,720
Okay.

103
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,700
Because it is very secure.

104
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,520
You know, we do we're not showing the content, we showing the loading.

105
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,300
But obviously that doesn't help because we can just show loading.

106
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,820
We have to redirect the user after showing loading for a few seconds.

107
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,180
We want to redirect the user.

108
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:51,510
Right.

109
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,310
So we can create a component.

110
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,280
In the next video, I'll show you how we can create a component that will show the loading for a few

111
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,660
seconds and then redirect the user to any page you want.

112
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,020
All right.

113
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:11,460
So instead of this icon, we can use that loading to redirect component so that we saw the loading for

114
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,140
a few seconds and then we'd redo it.

115
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:14,730
So we welcome that.

116
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:20,670
But otherwise, you can see so far we have already started working in the home.

117
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,750
Looks pretty good.

118
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,870
RC Let's see how we can fix this issue.

119
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:30,060
Let's see how we can redirect after showing learning for a few seconds.
