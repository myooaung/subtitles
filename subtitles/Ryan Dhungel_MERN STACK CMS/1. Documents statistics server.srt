1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:00,600
All right.

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:08,520
So the next thing we want to work on is should the number of post comments and uses that we have in

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,080
the in the application for the admin.

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,560
So this data will be showing in the admin desk for to let me show you.

5
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:24,240
So the one I want to implement is something like this so we can even display here in the homepage.

6
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,100
But first we will start from the admin, so let's log in as admin.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,530
You can see when the admin leant in his Beth desk class admin.

8
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,740
We are showing this statistics.

9
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:46,750
You can see 17 post categories, comments, and the use of this number is the actual number of these

10
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,290
posts that we have in our database.

11
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:56,200
So this is the actual numbers to let us see how we can implement something like this.

12
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:56,800
All right.

13
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:02,290
So first of all, we need to create a road in our banking that will give us these data.

14
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,990
Number of post categories, comments and uses.

15
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,810
And then in the front end, we can use.

16
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:14,460
This and design component to display them nicely here.

17
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:15,280
Something like this.

18
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:15,730
All right.

19
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:19,350
All right.

20
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,710
So let's see how we can do this.

21
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,750
Let's go to our project.

22
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:28,570
So this one actually, let's start from the back end.

23
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:33,550
Let's bring it out so that we get all the data we need and then we can just walk in our admin desk,

24
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:38,110
work as the server, what's website?

25
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:44,170
Let's start, let's right here all the way side related to what we put here.

26
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:49,270
So this one, let's call it numbers dot get.

27
00:01:52,100 --> 00:02:00,980
Number two, we want to get the numbers of all the all the the post and guys who have to use this so

28
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,270
require signing.

29
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:07,740
Requests.

30
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:07,960
Request.

31
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,080
I mean, actually, this one.

32
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,280
Let's put it in.

33
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,240
Let's remove here.

34
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,480
Let's put it in the post category.

35
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:22,480
The reason for that is to get all these the numbers for the post categories users.

36
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:27,670
We have to import all these models and they are already used in this post model.

37
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:33,230
So we create in a way do extra work trying to do it in the websites.

38
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,120
Let's do it here.

39
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:44,740
Well, it don't get so we call it numbers and we actually don't need to apply any middleware because

40
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:51,910
later we want to display this this value of the totals in the homepage as well.

41
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,230
So we don't want it to be.

42
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,880
That requires signing anything.

43
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:02,900
So just so I get the numbers next, let's write this one to the function.

44
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,660
So it's good to control this post here.

45
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,210
Export cost and get numbers.

46
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:19,470
It goes to async request response.

47
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,690
Try gets in error.

48
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:35,220
So here what we want is we want to give the total posts you just comments and categories who you actually

49
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:35,820
want for it.

50
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:43,050
That's should start from posts post equals 2.41..

51
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,140
Count documents.

52
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,350
So that's that'll give us the total cost.

53
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,080
Let me copy and paste three more times.

54
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,250
The next one will be for users.

55
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:03,780
So that would be you just use a model next one for comments.

56
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,990
That will be for from the comment model.

57
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,040
And finally, this one for categories.

58
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,420
Categories from category more.

59
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:21,500
All right.

60
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,370
Once you have that, we can.

61
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:31,140
He's for some reason it's highlighting.

62
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:33,480
Okay.

63
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:46,180
So once you on that, we can return the response station and we can return posts, posts, users, comments

64
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,020
and categories.

65
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:49,830
That is all we need to do.

66
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,710
I said that to give us all the tutorial.

67
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,960
We can even try it from the road.

68
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,140
If you curious, let's try it.

69
00:04:59,070 --> 00:04:59,820
8000.

70
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:00,990
That's our server.

71
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,490
It's less EVA, it's less numbers.

72
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:11,130
And you can see we have 13 Boston users six and comet forgetting beautiful.

73
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:16,290
Now based on this data, we can display them nicely in our desk or something like this.
