1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.650
It's good that I got this here.

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.440
I will show you because you will come across this issue.

3
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:05.730
So to fix this one.

4
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.590
One, we have to make some changes in our civil front and push to GitHub.

5
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:24.450
So let me go to civil it's good to road course this happens in the upload video doing that so upload

6
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.080
video.

7
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.910
So we have the opera video.

8
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:38.680
We have the formidable you can person configuration max file size.

9
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:46.660
You can set it to let's say 500 and be if you want then you will do something like 500 multiply, then

10
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:47.410
24

11
00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.570
multiply, then 24.

12
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.450
All right, so this and push this changes.

13
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.820
So this should help you get past this request entity.

14
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.250
Does that ever make it to want to have added to your file.

15
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.780
They can push distance.

16
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.060
So let's go to my server here.

17
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.220
Get status.

18
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:19.120
Okay.

19
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.550
One file, intense and geared and kids commit the same.

20
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.080
Formidable config update.

21
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:32.730
Good push.

22
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:37.160
Okay.

23
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.420
Now let's go to digital.

24
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.720
Awesome.

25
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.710
See the server sudo get to.

26
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.740
I guess one fellow's been pulled.

27
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.840
Let's start this.

28
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.680
Restart the server pmta and restart the juice.

29
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.820
Okay.

30
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:13.650
And let's try.

31
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.320
It might come across one letter.

32
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.910
Let's give it a try first.

33
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.750
You.

34
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.570
First lesson with video.

35
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.200
Let's upload a video.

36
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.680
Let's try uploading quite large video.

37
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.310
53.

38
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.790
Let's try this 153.

39
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:35.120
Me?

40
00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.890
It might take a while to let me pause, and if I come across any issues, I will see.

41
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.340
I'm still getting the same error in me.

42
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.620
Go to network and I have this error here.

43
00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.130
Request entity to lives.

44
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:08.640
In the next.

45
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.560
So this is related to engine X.

46
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.920
Okay.

47
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.520
So we have to.

48
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.360
I can let me just Google it.

49
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.780
Okay.

50
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.470
So this is this is the solution.

51
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:37.860
Max file size.

52
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.920
You have to add this in the config plan max body size.

53
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.060
So we have to add that in the server block.

54
00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.100
Let's go.

55
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:54.480
Let's come back here.

56
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.710
City and I still have this open.

57
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.640
Still best to deteriorate.

58
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.010
Let me go back.

59
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.960
Okay to get inside the file.

60
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.430
We need to go there.

61
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.350
So let's try.

62
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.930
See the space exit from engine x.

63
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.450
Sites

64
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.480
available to them.

65
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:37.120
Oh.

66
00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:40.880
The default.

67
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.040
Let's press I.

68
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.730
And let's go inside our server block.

69
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:53.750
I guess it's.

70
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.460
Yeah.

71
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.650
Server.

72
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.980
Here.

73
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:01.520
Let's.

74
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.360
Based that Glenn bought a max body size.

75
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.760
Let's make it 500 and be.

76
00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.670
Okay.

77
00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.390
Now let's sit.

78
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.390
Skip Colon WQ.

79
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.720
Let's.

80
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:26.820
Let's make sure we have enough.

81
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.130
Ursula and the next desk de.

82
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:34.330
It is successful.

83
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.150
Now let's make sure we restart in the next.

84
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.520
All right.

85
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.020
Now, let's go back and let me just one more time.

86
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.020
Didn't kill all the running process being to kill.

87
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:58.780
Just so that we have, we make sure everything is back up and running with this new configuration.

88
00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:13.840
Now, let me go inside, see server in to start server this and let's go back to the client to start

89
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.730
NPM desktop.

90
00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:19.280
Perfect.

91
00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.370
Now let's give this a try.

92
00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.220
So we have this app running.

93
00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.780
Let me just give a refresh.

94
00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.970
All right.

95
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.020
Now let's try adding.

96
00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:29.410
Listen.

97
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.660
It's for uploading video.

98
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.910
It's with 53.

99
00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:46.500
And besides, let's see.

100
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.640
This time.

101
00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.020
I am pretty sure it is going to well, Buffy.

102
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.400
All right.

103
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.200
So it's done and sincere.

104
00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:17.980
And we have our very first video game in just a few more seconds less.

105
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.390
All right, so minimum five listener must be there to publish.

106
00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:47.390
Now you can hit publish.

107
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:48.380
Okay.

108
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:50.150
Now it is.

109
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.670
Should be live on the marketplace.

110
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:54.350
Yes, it is beautiful.

111
00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:55.460
It is a free course.

112
00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:57.560
Beautiful.

113
00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:02.050
Okay.

114
00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:10.280
In this lesson, you learn about asynchronous programming being offered.

115
00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:12.060
I can show you.

116
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:13.680
All right.

117
00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:21.420
Now, why don't we try making it a better course so that we can try out our payment system as well?

118
00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:23.130
So let's get at it.

119
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.350
And it's make it paid.

120
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:30.830
Give the price, maybe.

121
00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:35.010
Door to door.

122
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:36.060
Let's try in.

123
00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:38.620
Okay.

124
00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:39.310
Awesome.

125
00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:42.670
And you can see we have the paid cost.

126
00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:43.210
Beautiful.

127
00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:46.900
No, let me log in as a user.

128
00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:51.280
Ryan Stripe buyer Niteroi saw first.

129
00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.480
Make it registered successful.

130
00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.200
Please log in.

131
00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:07.480
French fry by.

132
00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:13.820
Okay.

133
00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:15.800
Let me draw.

134
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:20.000
Luckily, I didn't have to pay real money.

135
00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:22.280
That's in the test mode.

136
00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.190
Oh, so that.

137
00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.360
That's a great email.

138
00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:30.760
Email.

139
00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.460
Ryan Stripe.

140
00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:35.290
My.

141
00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:47.360
That concludes it.

142
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:55.130
Perfect.

143
00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:58.310
No user has successfully enrolled into the paid course.

144
00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:59.000
You can see here.

145
00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:00.710
Absolutely beautiful.

146
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.690
In this lesson, you learn about this.

147
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:06.380
You can mark as complete.

148
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:08.600
You can Mark is complete.

149
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.600
Become an instructor, browse the courses.

150
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:16.180
Awesome.

151
00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:21.980
Now if you want to log in as the instructor instructor you can go to the dashboard.

152
00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:29.060
You can obviously create, edit, have a look at the revenue and you have this instructor have got the

153
00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:29.570
revenue.

154
00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:35.000
You see 75% out of the total the user paid.

155
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.140
How good is that?

156
00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.510
And he can also check out his payouts.

157
00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:42.330
I guess that's my bailout.

158
00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:48.180
I can go to account and have a look at the bank details, make the changes and I can send out a written

159
00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:48.720
back to.

160
00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:51.880
The application.

161
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:55.110
Beautiful.

162
00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:56.240
All right.

163
00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.680
So if you haven't made this so far, congratulation.

164
00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:01.590
This is absolutely incredible.

165
00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:06.990
I spend many years to get to this point where I was able to create such a marketplace.

166
00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:17.280
It has incredibly powerful payment system powered by Stripe, and you build the entire of the e-learning

167
00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:24.470
platform where instructors and students can interact, create courses in enrolled to the course and

168
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.110
whole lot.

169
00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:25.650
Right.

170
00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:32.190
So I'm sure you learn some incredible amount of knowledge and based on this knowledge, you can build

171
00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:34.650
groundbreaking produce.

172
00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:37.230
And I'm pretty sure and you know, you can do that as well.

173
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:37.500
Right.

174
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:38.820
So I wish you all the best.

175
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:39.870
Stay in touch.

176
00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:42.510
We will see you.

177
00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:45.870
So I will see you in future courses as well.

178
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:53.430
And if you want to stay in touch with me, you can always find me on Twitter at Colorado.

179
00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:56.920
All right.

180
00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.360
Thank you very much for being part of this course.

181
00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:01.360
I will see you sometime in future.
