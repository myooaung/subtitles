1
00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.400
All right, so we're done with categories.

2
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.650
We can create rid of the delete.

3
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.370
Now we're going to move on to working on the posts.

4
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.870
So let me take you to the finished product so you can you can see we have the post space where we will

5
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.610
show the post and we will allow the admin to edit and delete as well.

6
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:28.530
Our admin can search our filter out from the list of posts and then we have the button.

7
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.900
When they click on the button, we take them to the add new bits, which is here.

8
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.590
All right.

9
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.770
So let's go ahead and create these two pages.

10
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.140
One is to show all the posts and the other one is to create a new post.

11
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.240
So we will enter the title.

12
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.970
We will use this rich text editor

13
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.820
and this is absolutely beautiful, restricts energy.

14
00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:02.130
So you can see here this is you can write something like that.

15
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:09.570
You can formatted text with all these options, it can come down and if you want to just type in quickly,

16
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.850
you can type the less and that will give you all these options as well.

17
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.640
You know, you can have the different page.

18
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:25.500
One history you can create to do list bullet points, tables, quotes.

19
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.660
You can put your code, the divisor, you can insert images.

20
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.000
And we work on this one.

21
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.360
So when we entered the image, we will upload that image to cloud energy and receive the yellow and

22
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.520
that here will be saved in the post.

23
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:49.470
So we need to actually save the base64 image which will make your post really huge and you can actually

24
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.200
insert a very large image file because that will make it too big, right?

25
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:56.940
But that's how it's going to work.

26
00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.080
We're going to just put the the URL of the image.

27
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.440
So it's going to be extremely fast, very small in size, no matter how big images you upload.

28
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.240
All right.

29
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.490
So we have the alert boxes, says, listen, there are so many features in this restriction.

30
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.620
Really, it's a dream come true.

31
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.790
You can to have the bullet points we have.

32
00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.450
The list.

33
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.980
We got, um, the table.

34
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.700
So amazing.

35
00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.890
Actually.

36
00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:56.310
Thank you, sir.

37
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.050
Steph, go to the next line.

38
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.860
When you create a table, I think you get option to format as good to how many you want to you table

39
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:08.340
and.

40
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.210
This one you can just remove.

41
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.770
You can.

42
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.910
Add one more.

43
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.980
Thank you.

44
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.660
It's absolutely amazing.

45
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.470
All right.

46
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.210
So this is a risk text editor based on markdown.

47
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.310
So we're going to use this to create our blog post articles.

48
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.700
We will have the title for the article and then you can preview how it looks as well.

49
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.490
We will obviously have the option to select the categories.

50
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.410
Using this and component select companies is absolutely amazing.

51
00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.830
And we will also approve the featured images.

52
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:07.770
And then when you saw your post here, you can show the featured images like this that look really nice.

53
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.310
You can see if that's the featured image.

54
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.020
That's the blog title, some meta information about the blog.

55
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.870
We will have these here icons as as layer.

56
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:20.880
And this is the content.

57
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.080
And you can even put the images in between the content as well.

58
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.490
All right.

59
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:35.280
So that's how we going to implement the post feature, which is one of the main highlight of discourse,

60
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.380
because when you talk about any content management system, this is one of the most important thing.

61
00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.520
You want to have a really good rich text editor that will.

62
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.490
Allow you to create exciting posts.

63
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.970
All right.

64
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.080
So we're going to have this one.

65
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.300
So let's go ahead and create these two pieces.

66
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.580
One is to solve the post.

67
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.910
And one is to create a new post.

68
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.150
So let's go to our add new.

69
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.840
I guess we all have created the space.

70
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:13.600
You can see admin posts less new, but I think we don't have the space for this one for all post which

71
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.950
is admin less post.

72
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.240
So let's go ahead and create this piece.

73
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.220
Let's start from there.

74
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.770
So admin post.

75
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.320
This one is boasts.

76
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:26.340
Post new.

77
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.450
I think.

78
00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.590
I think we should call it post just to make things a bit more.

79
00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.590
Easy to use.

80
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.990
I said it's called posts and then tech posts.

81
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:53.490
We can create a new format called index dances, which will work as the basis for the post contest postings

82
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.730
to.

83
00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:01.320
Which let me just write one just to give it a try.

84
00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:02.760
Course based.

85
00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.550
And exports different ways.

86
00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:09.580
Okay.

87
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.440
So we can have a look at that.

88
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:13.480
We turn the page.

89
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:19.790
Now let's go and fix, because since we have changed the name, we should go to the navigation.

90
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.120
Let's go to the top nav and update the link.

91
00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:24.670
I said it's good.

92
00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:25.000
Done.

93
00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:26.920
No, actually, it's not.

94
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.370
It's.

95
00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:29.570
We should go to admin.

96
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.920
No.

97
00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.810
So component now admin.

98
00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.450
That means less posts for new.

99
00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.120
Let's make it as.

100
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:49.650
All right.

101
00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:50.830
So you can see here.

102
00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.260
We've got to add new.

103
00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:59.490
Admin posts now.

104
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:01.130
So that hasn't changed.

105
00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:04.610
And no.

106
00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.030
We changed it.

107
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.700
So we changed only the active name for this.

108
00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:16.680
For the active plus, let's add.

109
00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.150
Yeah, it's

110
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:21.930
all right.

111
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.460
Also admin stress boosts.

112
00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.400
And the other one you see that is fixed now.

113
00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:40.310
All right.

114
00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:46.590
So we'll let's go and set up this is the way we did with the other one.

115
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.820
So we need to have the admin tab in the sidebar.

116
00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:57.180
All right, let's go the posts new and you can see we are using the admin there too.

117
00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:58.480
We need to make sure we use that.

118
00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:00.420
So I didn't copy that.

119
00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:04.420
Go to index and let's actually do that with that one.

120
00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:07.330
And to this to post.

121
00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:16.710
First, let's not worry about this one admin layout we're importing.

122
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:18.270
So that is.

123
00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:23.690
So we go one step, two step up, three steps, and that looks good.

124
00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:29.380
Posts.

125
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:43.970
I guess we got the post office and we get the new one.

126
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:45.040
Beautiful.

127
00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.610
Now let's have some basic layout here.

128
00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:53.650
So here, what we want to do is we want to use the columns in rows.

129
00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:53.970
Right.

130
00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:54.970
So let's remove that.

131
00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.310
Let's use the row.

132
00:08:58.630 --> 00:08:59.590
I guess the inside rule.

133
00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:00.640
We can have a column.

134
00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.940
Column spend 24 we can use.

135
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.300
All right, so here, what you want to do is we want to let so a button.

136
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:23.180
I guess this is this is actually we're going to show the list, a post that is already created.

137
00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:31.400
Just like here we can see in the finished finished app we will show the list of posts in right on top.

138
00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:41.720
So this button, just so that it's easier to just click here and go to the add new page just for the

139
00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:42.830
same purpose.

140
00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:44.300
All right.

141
00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.540
So it's import button component.

142
00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:54.590
We also need to make sure we import row and column from end.

143
00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:56.480
All right.

144
00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:01.160
So here, let's use button.

145
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:06.950
We can give this the type of primary.

146
00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:17.650
Let me use this nice blue button has the animal side submit, which is not something we need here.

147
00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:21.160
Let's have a bit of a stand here.

148
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:28.600
Margins, just so that we can have better margin just on the top and the side.

149
00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:29.740
That's a margin.

150
00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:39.040
Let's use ten pixel on top, digital picture on right.

151
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:45.820
Ten pixel on the bottom and zero picture on the left side clockwise.

152
00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:49.570
We use this very top right bottom.

153
00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:52.720
And the left.

154
00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:54.880
All right.

155
00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.770
So we're going to give the button a name.

156
00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:00.010
Actually, we have to use the link component.

157
00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:03.430
So when they click, we will take them to this new base.

158
00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:03.790
All right.

159
00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:16.150
So we can import a link component from and so on and mixed link.

160
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:23.290
And then we use that link here instead linguine to make sure we have the anchor tag.

161
00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:27.880
And here on the anchor tile we can give the text and.

162
00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:30.910
All right, so the link you can use.

163
00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:31.960
Right.

164
00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:41.770
So it will take two steps and means less new and less post slash.

165
00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:50.180
By the way, you can also use this item, plus our talent.

166
00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.310
So let's import that as well.

167
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:58.070
So an import from and icons.

168
00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:01.460
So that icon is called gloss.

169
00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:04.580
Cross Heartland.

170
00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:06.110
All right.

171
00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:12.860
So before this ad you text, we can use that plus our outlined.

172
00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:14.600
All right.

173
00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:15.140
Beautiful.

174
00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:21.370
So right under this button is still within this column.

175
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:23.320
We can then.

176
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:27.130
So the H1 four posts.

177
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:27.670
All right.

178
00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:31.930
And then we will be issuing a list of posts underneath.

179
00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:34.180
All right.

180
00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:35.230
So let's have a look here.

181
00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:37.390
It's I'm back here.

182
00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:40.490
Let's give it a reverse.

183
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:44.700
Okay.

184
00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:45.390
So my bear.

185
00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:46.770
This one, you see?

186
00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:50.750
You likely forgot to explore the component.

187
00:12:51.230 --> 00:13:01.220
It is the import issue that happened because I tried to disturb the link, which is not right.

188
00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:04.390
So you just input link directly like this.

189
00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:11.030
Now this is very confusing if you coming from the React React Create React app.

190
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:19.040
So if you using the real counter, don't you usually do this structuring because with next you just

191
00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:22.210
directly input without destructor.

192
00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:23.030
I guess that's it.

193
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:23.780
Fix the issue.

194
00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:25.550
Skip refresh.

195
00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:27.920
All right.

196
00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:30.410
So you can see we have the bottom.

197
00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.020
If you click, you're landing on this piece.

198
00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:34.090
Okay.

199
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:34.940
Beautiful.

200
00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:41.980
I think we don't actually need any padding.

201
00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:47.390
This styling, unfortunately, that wasn't worth it.

202
00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:50.140
I think that looks good as it is.
