1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,430
All right, so there's one more thing we can do.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,780
Give the Senate keys so that we can start sending the forward pass through e-mails as well.

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,400
And then we're pretty much ready to go.

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:12,660
Let's do that.

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,380
Send it.

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,050
So if you don't have an account, you can sign up or you can use your existing account.

7
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,540
I'm actually going to sign up.

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,650
That's for the noggin.

9
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,190
They have very strict requirements.

10
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:38,820
You have to have 16 character parts or something like that.

11
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:44,770
It's really a difficult assignment and didn't have the social login option, says the.

12
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,470
I was smiling because I was going to say that I'm going to sign with Google, but I'm physically, you

13
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:53,470
know, anyways, use the name.

14
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,990
So I'm using Monster.

15
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:56,370
Ms..

16
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:02,140
I mean, let me take this alone with a single sign.

17
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,850
And what is this the administration

18
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,170
used to mean more serious.

19
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,680
So I can do that.

20
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,880
Anyways, let's create a sign up for the new account.

21
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:27,460
Sign up.

22
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,360
It's a free plan to take a trip plan.

23
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,650
I guess the email address, ma'am.

24
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:39,630
Siemens and G.M. come.

25
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,690
I'm not a robot on my own.

26
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,690
It's $0.60.

27
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,950
It's crazy hours, crude accounts.

28
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:02,770
Okay.

29
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:09,580
Lots to do in Dingle Company name, let's say, Carlos said.

30
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,310
Actually I had my own.

31
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,710
All I'm doing in Turkey is a no.

32
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,580
That's not right.

33
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,420
It's straight into phone number.

34
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,560
Hopefully it doesn't.

35
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,660
It's not required.

36
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,700
What's a real developer?

37
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,390
How many emails there?

38
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,680
10 to 100000.

39
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,690
How many employers?

40
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,560
That one.

41
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,660
Let's get started.

42
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:47,020
We sign up with MongoDB and this single, this is something you could probably do, but many times the

43
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:51,160
new users they're used to is those get confused on steam.

44
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:53,620
All right.

45
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,700
So this is a brand new account, low key.

46
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:01,000
So any time before you start sending emails, you have to create a single sender.

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,420
I This is this one way to do SQL.

48
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,000
You are required to include your contact information.

49
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,130
Ma'am seeing.

50
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:26,930
And Jim in reply to attempting to send.

51
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:27,900
I guess.

52
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,880
So what do you want to do is you want to use the same email from and to.

53
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:37,580
So when you're sending email to some other users, even at that time, you'll be using the same.

54
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:42,770
For example, if you have a contact form and someone contacts fill out the form and suddenly you want

55
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,000
to receive that even, right?

56
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:49,790
So from Intuit it's going to be sent company after us.

57
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:55,040
I got 100 sin in New South Wales.

58
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:03,580
See the man on the Sydney Street doesn't actually exist.

59
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:12,020
I think that's why we're doing it for the wrong proposition.

60
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:16,550
From Denmark on the street in Estonia.

61
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,700
Okay, let's choose the country first.

62
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,810
Australia zipcode 2000.

63
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,580
Nickname is the Quiet Kid.

64
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:29,120
This is.

65
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,040
This is crazy.

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,020
More serious.

67
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,510
Center has been created to very, very similar.

68
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,680
Take your mailbox.

69
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,420
All right.

70
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,790
Let's take it to the mail.

71
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:04,820
Okay.

72
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,620
That's perfect.

73
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,000
We got an email from Alison.

74
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:08,400
Great.

75
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,380
Please verify your address.

76
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,700
All right, let's click.

77
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,720
Now, I am logged into a different window.

78
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,340
This approach.

79
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,760
Private window, sir.

80
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,110
I'm going to do what I'm going to do.

81
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:23,560
I'm going to copy the link address in this open in this process.

82
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:28,000
You could just click on that button.

83
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:28,800
It's no problem.

84
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:35,070
I'm doing a show that I don't have to log in again in a private window.

85
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,830
Okay.

86
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,510
Return to Congress.

87
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,420
Listen to you, Senator.

88
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,850
And it has been successfully verified.

89
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,140
Beautiful.

90
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,280
I guess so.

91
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:50,730
Once you have verified owners use this verified email address to send emails from your application and

92
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:51,690
you should be good to go.

93
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:52,730
All right.

94
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,940
So that's perfect.

95
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,410
Next one, we want to get the API kids right.

96
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,620
So let's go here.

97
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,160
Click here.

98
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:03,570
API keys generate API key.

99
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:09,840
By the way, make sure to not expose this API key anywhere.

100
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,980
I guess in the moment it is expose it will not work.

101
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:18,810
And you might they might put some restriction to your account as well.

102
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:19,950
They're really strict.

103
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:23,520
So if you pushing your code to GitHub, make sure.

104
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:34,990
We have the ignore file and your EMV is ignored so that in we file is not uploaded to GitHub because

105
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:39,730
if it gets public view you won't be able to send emails anymore.

106
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,040
This key will not work.

107
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,520
You have to generate another key.

108
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,100
They might put some restriction as system.

109
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,000
Don't do that.

110
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,110
Full access.

111
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,030
Alright, that's good.

112
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:50,950
Maybe a key name.

113
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,350
So moon see?

114
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,470
Misleading comment.

115
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,610
I could say Becky has been quiet to let me just copy this one.

116
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,220
Beautiful.

117
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,360
Done.

118
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,350
Once it's done, you can copy that again.

119
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:10,010
I guess that's that's gonna have to create a new one if you want it to.

120
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,430
Anyways, let's put that here.

121
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:20,270
Send key and then email from the students.

122
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:24,050
Now, ma'am, seeing this beautiful.

123
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,870
That's everything we need now.

124
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,850
Now did a beauty secret.

125
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:35,300
Obviously, you can just put anything in a such random characters, and that's it.

126
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:35,750
We're done.

127
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:44,090
So from the following lecture, we can start sending requests, name, email, password.

128
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,460
Send that to our sign route.

129
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,780
Sign up right here.

130
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:59,580
You can see whenever you get a push to request this function, we'll handle that so you can take out

131
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:04,980
the sign of function in the it's coming from the control center.

132
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:05,280
Right.

133
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,080
So we'll go through this code one more time.

134
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:07,650
Don't worry.

135
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:12,690
When we made a request, first we have a look at the controller.

136
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:23,130
Console.log and then we'll just go through all the code so that you understand how everything's worked.
