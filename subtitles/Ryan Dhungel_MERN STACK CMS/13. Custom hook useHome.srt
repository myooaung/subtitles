1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,440
All right.

2
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:08,250
So we are so close to finishing this project, but I just don't feel like going away because it's been

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,550
incredible and it is looking really, really good.

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,090
Now, I don't want to just finish it yet.

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,160
I want to do one more thing.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:24,120
And that is you can see here in Customize and in the homepage we have the code repeated of the date

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,090
of this state and this use effect has been.

8
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,200
He reused Hugh in both files.

9
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:34,220
So I encourage you to create a custom hook.

10
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:35,220
Just give it a try.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,770
But I will show you anyways.

12
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:38,160
So.

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,420
So that you don't get stuck.

14
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:40,910
Okay.

15
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:48,170
So what I'm going to do here is let me just copy everything and then we'll be just deleting everything

16
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:48,800
we've done it.

17
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:54,200
That is the easiest way to turn it into a custom one.

18
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:55,430
So copy everything.

19
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,200
The customize base for the component components.

20
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:02,250
Who?

21
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,600
What a hoax.

22
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:06,350
Okay.

23
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:07,790
It's not intel component.

24
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,180
It's outside component.

25
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,740
Okay, let's create a new hook.

26
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:12,950
We're going to call it.

27
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,880
Uh, use home currencies.

28
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:19,750
Yeah, that's one.

29
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,860
They tend to use.

30
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,120
He's home.

31
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,830
So here we won this state.

32
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,780
We actually don't need.

33
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:36,990
Context.

34
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,920
But we can live there and we can work with the state.

35
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,920
We didn't even know which title subtitle full width and this huge effect.

36
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,990
And we don't need this function.

37
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,080
We don't need the region cured of this whole block.

38
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,790
We don't need it.

39
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,460
So here all we want to do is return.

40
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,820
We want to return the title.

41
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:11,260
So total and said full with so full with limits.

42
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,330
So all we need to do is that.

43
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:19,690
So we just written this and then let's treasury of use this in our customers base.

44
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,680
So let me just comment them out for now.

45
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:30,590
So we don't need full width here.

46
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,060
Title subtitle.

47
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,170
We don't need that.

48
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,890
We don't need this huge effect here.

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,900
That lured home Bay's dysfunction dysfunctional it.

50
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:48,840
So this bit whatever I have commented out as you can see here they have been moved to use home.

51
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:54,370
Right so hopefully we can we use that to you know at the moment if you live like this and go to admin

52
00:02:54,370 --> 00:03:00,280
you get an error go to customize of course does work.

53
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:10,300
Now let's try to use that import to use no use home from.

54
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:20,840
Hooks use home, and then we can destructor all those values we need.

55
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:25,370
Konst.

56
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,680
Writing the subtitle.

57
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:39,810
Full length images means we can districts often use home.

58
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,700
We execute that.

59
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,170
And I think that is all we need to do.

60
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:47,920
Wow.

61
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,770
That looks good.

62
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,180
Let me see.

63
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,340
Oh, sit down.

64
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:53,960
That's right.

65
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:59,780
Since we have moved the state altogether and we still have here.

66
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,740
Sit, idle.

67
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,010
Sit.

68
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:05,680
Subtitling This input sled means we need to return them as well.

69
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,380
Let's go.

70
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:12,140
Let's also return these functions to our bit.

71
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,060
Still set.

72
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,000
Don't set.

73
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,620
Subtitle and set full with images.

74
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:23,750
All right, so with that, we can just destructor them here and customize.

75
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:27,690
Okay.

76
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,970
Now that should work.

77
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:30,660
All right.

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,250
Okay.

79
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,060
Let me just make some changes.

80
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,960
Ryan Dingell.

81
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,720
It's big, different image.

82
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:56,880
Save.

83
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,110
All right.

84
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:58,830
Let's have a look.

85
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:01,940
Beautiful.

86
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,470
That works.

87
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,310
Beautiful.

88
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:06,940
Okay.

89
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:11,710
So we moved out cause he could use it as a custom hook to simplify.

90
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:15,790
And now we can do the same thing in our home base.

91
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:16,180
Right.

92
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:21,280
So let me just open a home base here in this sidebar.

93
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,370
Here I have customers.

94
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,150
Here I have home.

95
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:31,870
I'm going to bring the hook just like it did, then bring the hook and then

96
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,130
destruct all that.

97
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,340
That means I don't need this anymore.

98
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,860
It just come in that out for now.

99
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:46,900
I don't need this.

100
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:47,680
Yeah.

101
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:53,830
Since you're using custom hold in that symbol as that nice and easy.

102
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:56,780
You just import.

103
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,500
We use that.

104
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:58,790
No.

105
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,190
Okay.

106
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,880
So the path is not right.

107
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:09,900
So from here, we just need to go one step up and then inside hooks.

108
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,830
All right, beautiful.

109
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,300
Awesome.

110
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:17,960
Let's do it one more time and we're done.

111
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:24,230
Let me change the media to this one.

112
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,100
That looks good.

113
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:40,960
Save.

114
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:41,860
Go have a look.

115
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:42,970
Beautiful.
