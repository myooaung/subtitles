1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,020
All right.

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:07,170
So here we are showing the loading insert that let's create a component that will not only show the

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,690
loading, but redirect the user in few seconds.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,170
All right, so let's create one file into a component.

5
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:23,510
Components and I'm going to just call it loading to redirect.

6
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:30,410
Or this might be this component you can use in all you react projects for other projects as well because

7
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:36,920
this concept is very useful and you might want to use it in your other projects as well.

8
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,540
So it's I find it quite useful.

9
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:45,470
I have used this code in many other projects as well and actually tried this one import.

10
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:59,220
We are actually would have to import, react, use effect and use state from React, import the use

11
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:09,380
user from next row and then let's throw the function loading to redirect it instead.

12
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:16,160
So here on which page you want to redirect, you can pass the path if you want to.

13
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,000
You can destructive path.

14
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,090
And I give a default value of home base.

15
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:28,280
But if you want anything else, you can always pass the path as props I suppose.

16
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:37,310
First in our state I want to have the sum count, something called count and set count equals to use

17
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:37,970
state.

18
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:42,080
And I give it a value of let's say a three, three, seven.

19
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:48,620
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to use use effect and I'm going to use set interval in that one

20
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:57,960
and it will stub the count down from three, 3 to 1 as soon as it hits one, we redirect to the path

21
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,580
of Homebase.

22
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:02,180
So we want to to redirect.

23
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,440
And once you have that, we can use use effect.

24
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,870
See, use effect.

25
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,750
And we want to run this huge effect.

26
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:18,970
And the county in this county, in the state, and here we're going to create a set interval.

27
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:25,750
So I'm going to put in a function interval equals two set interval and we're going to do here you can

28
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,180
see since integral this is a function.

29
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,940
This function takes another function as an argument.

30
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,770
So that's another function.

31
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:35,650
And the second argument is the duration.

32
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,780
So that's 1000 means 1/2.

33
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:38,620
Okay.

34
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:43,540
So first argument, the function second argument is the duration.

35
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:50,920
So in the function, what we're doing is we basically dick decreasing the value from the state.

36
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,340
So set count whatever that is, minus one.

37
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:59,050
So every second it runs and every second it will minus one.

38
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:03,370
So it'll go from three to 2 to 1 every second.

39
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:13,960
So as soon as we hit zero 3 to 1 zero after 3 seconds, then we want to clear the interval and then

40
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,560
we reduce the user to path home base.

41
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:20,130
All right.

42
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,250
So that's that's all we need now.

43
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,290
After this huge effect, we can return.

44
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:32,630
We can slow the loading for 3 seconds and then we'll redirect.

45
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,920
All right, so here, it's good to deal with the class of stuff.

46
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:47,480
Let's use Display Flex so that we can center this in the the base horizontally and vertically.

47
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:55,370
So display, flex, justify content center, a line item center.

48
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,700
And then for this to work, we need to give it a height.

49
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:06,020
So height we can use 100 vertical height again then.

50
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,110
Here.

51
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,130
We can write something.

52
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,120
You don't have to write.

53
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,440
If you want, you can write.

54
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:15,210
Sorry.

55
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,730
Not there, but intended here

56
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,500
so I can write something.

57
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,750
Redirecting in.

58
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:33,260
You can use the account you can so that seconds.

59
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:34,850
All right.

60
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,920
So we can say something like that, too.

61
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:43,500
And this is a loading to redirect component to, again, default export.

62
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:47,570
Beautiful.

63
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:56,030
All right, now let's try to use this one instead of that lowering indicator we had so good to subscribe.

64
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,620
A import

65
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,850
loading to redirect from.

66
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,350
So we go one step.

67
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,510
We are already in two components.

68
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,080
So learning to redirect.

69
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:11,380
Okay.

70
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:16,060
So I'm going to use this in all other layers as well.

71
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,810
So learning to redirect.

72
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,470
And I'm going to just replace this.

73
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,140
All this.

74
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:31,200
With loading to redirect.

75
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,420
I guess if it is loading.

76
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:38,580
We saw that for a few seconds and in 3 seconds it will automatically redirect the user.

77
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:43,860
But if we get the data from the back end, then we saw the content.

78
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:45,150
Perfect.

79
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,620
Now let's give it a try.

80
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,660
Let's go.

81
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,600
3 to 1.

82
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,310
And then we get rid of it.

83
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:54,480
Absolutely beautiful.

84
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,800
Now you want to do the same in other layouts.

85
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,230
So let's import this from.

86
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:04,980
Let's copy that good auto layout based here.

87
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,960
And then use that.

88
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,130
Nothing to redirect.

89
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,760
And let's also use this in admin.

90
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,270
Since that, too.

91
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,440
Learning to redo.

92
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:25,810
Beautiful.

93
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,080
Okay.

94
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,870
So if we're not logged in, we get redirected.

95
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,060
But if you're logged in, you should be all right.

96
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:39,830
Beautiful.
