1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:00,530
Alright.

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:06,990
So let's use the Indigenous card component to display the post like this.

3
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:10,650
Thank you.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,620
So let's in full card.

5
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:23,180
And from God we can destroy matter as well that will be used for additional information.

6
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,450
Meter equals to car.

7
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:32,660
Now you could use cardboard meter, but I'm struggling just to make things a little bit easier.

8
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:34,460
All right.

9
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:39,500
So here, since you want to make this position friendly, we want to have the basics.

10
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:47,990
And as soon it's important, six from next tend to have sex.

11
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,690
And if you knew to have sex and that is something like.

12
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,650
You can see the recent blog post on the tab.

13
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:02,100
Now, when you go here, you see a different attitude that controlled by the mirror information and

14
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,220
that will be read by search engine, says Watson.

15
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:14,880
If I show you The View based source, you can see this page has let me just find command f title.

16
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,380
So you can see the metadata.

17
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,580
That's the title and that's the description.

18
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,110
We had a description, this description.

19
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,480
This is really good for search engine optimization.

20
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,350
So we're going to use head section to have that information.

21
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:32,460
All right.

22
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,620
So here, let's start from the head.

23
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,110
So let's put that.

24
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:46,670
So he good to return the roll.

25
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,640
Let me just put it in the fragment

26
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,900
and let's put it here.

27
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:01,790
So inside here we want to have the most visible mirror information you can have is the title and description.

28
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:07,310
So let's call it recent blog posts I get to.

29
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:10,820
Let's go and then meta.

30
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,450
It's a matter of description.

31
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:30,370
We want to have a description and a let's call it a blog post about with web development, programming,

32
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:30,940
etc..

33
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:31,600
I you.

34
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,120
That's I have six.

35
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,910
And if you write Kivu episodes, you will immediately see that

36
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,580
I'm f title.

37
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,340
You can see recent blog post, the style and description.

38
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,450
We wrote that.

39
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:50,680
Okay, beautiful.

40
00:02:53,530 --> 00:03:00,520
Now let's map through all the ports and destroy them in this nice card from any design.

41
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:07,930
So let's remove the pre and insert and I'm going to map through the posts

42
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,430
posts dot map.

43
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,920
I get it post.

44
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:20,980
So to use our function here so we return card

45
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,530
card component from and.

46
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,530
And inside guard we are showing the medal

47
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,170
and a title.

48
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:36,880
We can show

49
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,230
that we use postcards.

50
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,810
Now you can see here we have these beautiful cards.

51
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,070
They have the turtle.

52
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,090
Awesome.

53
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,310
Now, of course, we want to show the images.

54
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:58,860
So let's use we have multiple options here we can use.

55
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:05,130
The image's component of we can use Avatar component to display the images.

56
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:12,470
I'm going to use the Avatar component because that gives you really it's really easy to use and especially

57
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:17,620
it fits the the width and height, this killing of the U.S. So let's use amateur.

58
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:21,230
So inside this calling card, you can see here.

59
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,300
Here we can use all that information.

60
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:30,680
So here, hovering, we can make the card hover over.

61
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,250
So as soon as you do that, by default, that is true.

62
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:40,490
You can see there's a hover effect when you go into quality in this.

63
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:44,870
Thank you.

64
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,040
Next one.

65
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,400
We use code so we only for the cover images.

66
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,200
So here in Tacoma, you could use images.

67
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,320
You could use Avatar.

68
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,880
We using Avatar.

69
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,870
So Avatar will have this stick.

70
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,110
He's square.

71
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,090
We can use circle.

72
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:12,820
So seven square stone height.

73
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:19,580
You can give the height and based on height, the image will scale automatically.

74
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:30,890
So height 200 pixel source of the image is a source that's going to be post dot so you can see we're

75
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:33,890
getting it's supposed to dot featured image.

76
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,760
So if we have the featured image because some post may not have.

77
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,960
So we need to take that.

78
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:49,350
If we have the featured image, then we want to access the URL, otherwise you can to some kind of a

79
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,040
default.

80
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,110
The different images.

81
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,030
Maybe you can have one.

82
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,560
You know what?

83
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,430
Somewhere.

84
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,320
Let's see if we have any.

85
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,570
We don't have so we can have some image, then we can just float from there.

86
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,330
Oh, you can use some.

87
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,160
Now you are from the cloud.

88
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,010
So let me just leave it like this for now.

89
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:22,500
And then alternative day for the image so that it will be found by search engine.

90
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,960
So old it can be post type.

91
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,920
And that is pretty much all we need is come here.

92
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,490
Now, you can see here, beautiful.

93
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,720
We got these cards.

94
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:38,640
Now, the ones without the images, they are broken.

95
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:42,030
So obviously we can fix that by using.

96
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:47,680
The default are, but otherwise this one has the image looks skewed.

97
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:49,930
Now this one.

98
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,710
Let's fix that.

99
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:56,850
It's full with.

100
00:06:59,510 --> 00:06:59,760
Okay.

101
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,400
So I actually noticed that we amendment through the post and the column actually should be inside,

102
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,150
not outside.

103
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,200
So let me just take that bit.

104
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,460
So we map before the card, we put that here and we also need to close

105
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:23,960
this map just right here after the closing card to put that here.

106
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,190
And once you have that column that you can remove from here, top.

107
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,050
Remove from the top.

108
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,360
Remove from here.

109
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:34,720
All right.

110
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:41,730
Now you can see it is taking the 16th.

111
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:47,640
Actually, it was my wrong calculation because I was planning this for the for the single post image.

112
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,110
But here it.

113
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:57,250
I was planning for this one, but obviously we're not on that phase with this on the post phase where

114
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,240
we're showing on the post.

115
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:02,020
So each of them must have, you know, like three columns.

116
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,510
So 83 is a 24, so it should be eight.

117
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,990
So let's send this to eight.

118
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:13,660
And if you want to, you're going to actually go for extra layers and extra.

119
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:19,000
So that will work for pretty much all the screen size.

120
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:20,030
All right.

121
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,640
So we don't actually need sidebar because we're not.

122
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,800
We're not going to sidebar here.

123
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,250
We just showing the Boston.

124
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:30,840
Okay.

125
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:32,970
Now you can see.

126
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:33,900
It's nice.

127
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:34,410
Beautiful.

128
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,280
This looks exactly the same as this one.

129
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:39,930
Beautiful.

130
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:40,590
No.

131
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:43,440
The only thing we want to fix here is the images.

132
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:50,220
So if the car doesn't have the Mr. Bush doesn't have the image, then we want to do some kind of a different

133
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:50,550
images.

134
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,790
So let's quickly find a nice images here.

135
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:57,420
Let's go to Pixelmator.

136
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,820
We can get royalty free images here.

137
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,630
Two different one.

138
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,380
Then this was technology related.

139
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:16,370
Some kind of image for suitable for blog series.

140
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,300
Maybe we can use that.

141
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,290
Content management system.

142
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,220
Let's use this software developer

143
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,290
freedom.

144
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:49,900
Its choose this size download let's download directly to the project folder inside public so we can

145
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,320
go.

146
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:57,250
Udemy theme is client public.

147
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:05,400
So let's create a new folder images and inside here and just call it default.

148
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:17,830
Okay, now this is a good time for me to show you the there are the use case of public funds to anything

149
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:22,420
you put in type of default of for example, CCS images to many images.

150
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:29,200
So if it is intact public folder, you don't have to leave whenever you want to load that image.

151
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,540
So that's only in your basis.

152
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,670
You don't have to go like this.

153
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:36,310
One step, two, step up, three, step over.

154
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,420
You didn't have to do that.

155
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:45,580
If it is in, say, public folder, you can directly default to, for example, images less default

156
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,090
dot

157
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:51,700
unzipping or so.

158
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:57,040
You can directly refer to your images if it is inside public folder.

159
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:04,000
For example, my one is less images, less the name, so I can directly use that I don't have to go,

160
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:09,520
you know, like one step after step you don't have to write the path.

161
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,500
So that's the beauty of.

162
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,890
Using the public for you.

163
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:23,650
So the default URL, if the post doesn't have the featured image, then we want to show this default

164
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:23,890
one.

165
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:28,900
So that phone will be just that images default or two.

166
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:30,050
Okay.

167
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:36,840
Now, you can see here we've got this default image for all the posts that doesn't have its own image,

168
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,650
but this one has.

169
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,240
So we show the default.

170
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,320
We show that image.

171
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,250
Nice.

172
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:47,310
One more thing I want to fix that is you can see here we have a bit of a gap on top.

173
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,250
Let's quickly fix that up and we're pretty much done here.

174
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,560
On the top and bottom.

175
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,720
So it's kind.

176
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:07,910
Column.

177
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,610
I think we should.

178
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,440
Unpleasant study.

179
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,180
Go.

180
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,610
Monsanto.

181
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:17,910
Five.

182
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,290
Marlon Brando five.

183
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:24,310
Okay.

184
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,740
So that that gives us a bit of a gap.

185
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:29,360
You.

186
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:32,750
Okay.

187
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,460
So the next step is making it clickable.

188
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:42,050
When we click, we open this post in a new place where we can see all the information about the post,

189
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,340
just like you saw when we would take them to the single post base.

190
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:56,450
So we have the person who would have the Post slogan based on the title that was generated, right?

191
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:04,910
So we saw the images and we saw the post content on this matter information and we will later use this

192
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,040
sidebar to display some other information.

193
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:08,990
Okay.

194
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:13,820
So let's make them clickable so that we can show them our individual face.
