1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,940
Let's go and visit the next district.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:04,260
Org.

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,280
It's always good habit to visit the documentation.

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,900
Sometimes it change over time.

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:17,400
So you know, you want to keep this habit of going to the documentation and take out the instructions

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,530
so you can see how to get started.

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,090
You want to have Node.js 12 or higher, which we have.

8
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,610
We have version 16.

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,640
And there are two ways of creating mixed this app.

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:37,890
One is by running this command and b create next app whether NP X is available as soon as you have Node.js,

11
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,400
insulin, a computer, you can use this command or you can just manually set up like this.

12
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,880
Yeah, you can use here or you can use NPM.

13
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,700
We just going to continue using and build the NPM.

14
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,230
Create next app.

15
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:01,290
You could use that or you can go with a manual set up, NPM, install and install these packages separately.

16
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,780
Next, react and react.

17
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:10,950
So we going to take this approach because this command will create a few files and folders, which is

18
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:11,790
not a big deal.

19
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,090
Very basic information.

20
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:20,430
However, I want to start from absolute clean still so that you understand isn't everything how everything

21
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,300
is what you know.

22
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,400
All right, so let's copy this one in women style.

23
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:26,820
Next.

24
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,340
React and react.

25
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:35,520
So we want to insert that and we need to update our prejudice and scripts, and that's pretty much it.

26
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,040
That's how you set up next this project.

27
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:51,300
So let's come here and go to the terminal and let's run this so that we give these libraries, these

28
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,030
packages from NPM to our application.

29
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:01,230
You can see here, as soon as you run that node modules, this folder gets created and you can see in

30
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:06,060
packages that this and now we have the dependencies next next react and react.

31
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:14,280
Now these packages are installed here, the code base is installed here and along with them there are

32
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,300
so many other things.

33
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:20,430
Now you might be thinking, how come we have so many of these packages?

34
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,690
I installed only three.

35
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,470
And that's because these three packages also depend on are the packages.

36
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,170
All right.

37
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:28,760
Okay.

38
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:35,310
So that's how you see quite a lot of them, because these three packages depend on all these other packages

39
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,150
as well, because each of them will have their own package, a decent file.

40
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,530
And based on that, yeah, we need to have all these files.

41
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,740
So all this code base is here thanks to NPM.

42
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,620
We have next react in React.

43
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:55,800
So that means we we're very close to set of this project.

44
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,990
Now the next thing you can see here, open package edition and add the following scripts.

45
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,420
So we have to add this to the scripts.

46
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:04,950
All right.

47
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,970
So let's copy that here and I'll explain to you what they do.

48
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:16,580
So in this starts the scripts here content and just based that here.

49
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:25,830
All right so these commands will allow you to run so for example, you can run in the terminal NPM run

50
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:30,600
div, you can do an NPM run build, you can run engine start.

51
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,180
So that's how you can use this commands.

52
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:33,900
All right.

53
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,000
So throughout the development, we will be using this and do so npm run dev.

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,890
So that is the command you will use to run the development server.

55
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:50,850
And later in production we will be running NPM, run, build as well, which we would obviously correlate.

56
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:59,160
So at the moment these are the scripts we have and we will be mainly using the NPM Run Dev Connect.

57
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:00,540
Okay.

58
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:07,770
Now before we do anything here, one more requirement there is for Nexus and that is you need to have

59
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,530
the basis folder.

60
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:15,090
I guess that that's the most of it because the installation is done now we just need to have at least

61
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,820
one base so that the application works.

62
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,090
Yeah.

63
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:24,300
So here in the client folder let's create a new for the basis of this name is important.

64
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:24,600
Okay.

65
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:29,970
All lowercase and the name is basis that is a requirement interfaces.

66
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,250
You want to have at least one file to give it a try.

67
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,930
Let's try in the expertise.

68
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:35,530
All right.

69
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,060
So indicators is.

70
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,550
So we had to write some code here.

71
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:47,680
And this code will appear in as soon as we run this application as a home base.

72
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:48,160
All right.

73
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,900
So let's go to function.

74
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:56,230
So in React, everything you write is treated as a component.

75
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,670
So you can call it a component.

76
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,800
Call it a function that's going to function.

77
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:00,850
Function.

78
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,920
Let's call it home.

79
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:06,800
I go to these fronts.

80
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,400
Now you want to return?

81
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,220
Return parentheses.

82
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,440
Inside parentheses.

83
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,250
You want to return?

84
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,370
Some has to remove its reg div.

85
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:25,620
And here, let's write H1, H1, and let's write home.

86
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:26,970
All right.

87
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,190
So this is a react component.

88
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,610
It's a this is the name of the component and this component is returning.

89
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,160
This has steam.

90
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:41,210
Now within react you don't actually call it has simply called D6.

91
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:46,190
That means JavaScript and has since the mixture.

92
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:50,560
So the beauty of react is you use this d6.

93
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,460
Don't get confused with the A6.

94
00:05:52,460 --> 00:06:00,750
It's it's so it's has dimmer but with additional features so that you can mix JavaScript with your estimate.

95
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:05,450
That's how it is so much easier to build UI components in React.

96
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:13,370
All right so this is has similar looking for it is technically the A6 but you can do today has team

97
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,980
with very very little differences.

98
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:20,500
Okay so instead of class you call it clustering.

99
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,500
So that is one of the most common difference.

100
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,940
Otherwise, it's pretty much like hysteria.

101
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:34,610
And you will be able to write JavaScript because you hear, you know, which we will explore a bit later.

102
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:35,390
All right.

103
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,680
So we have this component now.

104
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,650
We want to export export the default home.

105
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,100
All of this is important.

106
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,960
If you don't have this, you will get some error.

107
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,140
So when you write a comment, you want to export.

108
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,120
I said, That's extremely important.

109
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:56,050
Now, once we have this much, we have done the setup.

110
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,670
We are ready to give it a try.

111
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:58,810
I say let's try.

112
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,070
Come here

113
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,650
into client folder.

114
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,920
Now we want to run our application and to run the application.

115
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:13,010
Have a look here in the package position and you have to run this command and development server.

116
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,440
NPM, run, dev.

117
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,860
NPM, run, dev.

118
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:20,720
You can see.

119
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:27,710
Started on localhost, 3000 to 3000.

120
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:33,660
You can visit and have a look at your beautiful application and it suits so home.

121
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,870
Let's give it a try.

122
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,160
Localhost, 3000.

123
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:49,970
And there is our beautiful head swan and where to listen you have said of you react project to using

124
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:50,850
next this.
