1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.640
So we have built this awesome application.

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.170
Now, the next thing definitely you want to do is deploy it, right?

3
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.290
So you want to deploy it to the cloud service.

4
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.540
We're going to deploy to this solution.

5
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.920
So we will be deploying the back end, front end all together into a single droplet.

6
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.100
So in this deployment steps I will be going through.

7
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.920
You can use this to deploy a full stack app or even just the front end, just the back end.

8
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.480
Either way, it doesn't matter.

9
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.470
So you will learn how to deploy to the cloud.

10
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.630
So this is the deployment part.

11
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.270
It it is it involves a lot of steps.

12
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.060
So I have written a tutorial which will take you from start to finish step by step.

13
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.500
Right.

14
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.760
So we will follow that article so that next time when you have to deploy again, you don't have to watch

15
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.150
the video.

16
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.640
You can just follow that article and easily deploy your full stack app any time to do it.

17
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.930
All right.

18
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.770
So you can search could continue deployment have to disclose.

19
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:00.030
All right.

20
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.190
So you will click on this link.

21
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.610
So the first thing you want to do is sign up to disclose them.

22
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.880
So if you don't already have account, you can use this link.

23
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:18.200
You can either click here or click here, and that will give you between 10 to 90% discount.

24
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.370
They always run this offer depending on the timing.

25
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.190
Sometimes they offer minimum 10% to 90% discount on your next billing.

26
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.670
Right.

27
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.150
So if you're signing up, make sure to click on this link.

28
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.060
So let me click on this one.

29
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.380
This one doesn't really matter.

30
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.670
Okay.

31
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.710
So you should see some kind of referral link there.

32
00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.470
Let me just go to sign up.

33
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.580
And if it don't have the account, obviously you will go through all the sign up process.

34
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:55.990
But I have already created an account, so I'm going to just log in and I will see you once I'm inside

35
00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.670
the decimal.

36
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:11.180
Just so you can see, I'm already logged in and I have open two window one here that is the tutorial

37
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.040
will go through the steps.

38
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.380
And then here you are in the loss and.

39
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.200
So once you signed up, you must have they must have asked you to enter the credit card details and

40
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.590
all that.

41
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.340
So once you are gone through all that, you should be able to create a droplet.

42
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.820
All right.

43
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.800
So here you come here and create a droplet to click here.

44
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.630
Go to the droplet.

45
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.960
And here first, we we just have to follow these steps.

46
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.400
So we're going to choose a went to the default one choose a plan.

47
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:55.790
We can choose a plan, the basic plan, the range from minimum, the range from $6 and they go up.

48
00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:03.160
So you see the ram one G it two ZB and so on for our purpose, even this one should work.

49
00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.770
But I'm just going to go with this one later on.

50
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.760
You can upgrade your droplet as well, but that might be a bit of a hassle if you have to.

51
00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.090
So if can try to pick this option.

52
00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.100
But this should also work.

53
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.800
But sometimes I get issue when I'm trying to run NPM, run, build to build our frontend.

54
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.050
So that takes a bit more memory.

55
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:31.250
So in some situations this is not enough to perform that action, otherwise usually it should be.

56
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.250
All right, so if we can just go with this one higher.

57
00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.560
All right, so let me go with that one.

58
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.870
Next one, we can do the data center.

59
00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.520
You can choose the the one near you.

60
00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:44.920
I'm just going to leave.

61
00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.660
There are some upsets in India, Canada, Singapore and so on.

62
00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:55.090
Down.

63
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.040
So we had to create a password.

64
00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.470
Security password to access is lost.

65
00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.980
Right.

66
00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:07.250
So we're going to use that with Andrew Fastow and make sure to remember this.

67
00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.690
You need this all the time.

68
00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:24.300
Then to recreate one droplet, you can give a unique name to a droplet.

69
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.050
Let me call it Eden.

70
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.100
And this club that Eden.

71
00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.140
And there are some other options backups if you want to, you can do that.

72
00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.200
Otherwise, you can just go ahead and create a droplet.

73
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.180
So you get the IP address.

74
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.440
This is where we're going to access this droplet.

75
00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.300
So you can copy that and put it somewhere.

76
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.940
Let me just put this here from the IP address.

77
00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.700
And you, I'm sure you the memory of Boston.

78
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.860
Once we have that, we can follow the steps here in the studio.

79
00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:12.920
So once you sign up, do those and use this to learn by using your terminal command.

80
00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.720
So we can do assistance into the IP address using the route.

81
00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.840
And then later, we're going to turn this to another user.

82
00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.110
All right, so let's open our terminal and this terminal.

83
00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.390
Let me just put it like this.

84
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.870
That way I can just look in the to do it and follow everything.

85
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.180
All right, so I have the project run.

86
00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.180
Let me just stop for now.

87
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.900
Open a new term.

88
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.680
Go to the root directorate and let.
