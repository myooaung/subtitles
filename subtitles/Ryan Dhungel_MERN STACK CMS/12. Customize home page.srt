1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:01,770
All right.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:06,900
So we created our roots in the back end to save the base and also get the base.

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,000
Now, you can see we have functioned to save the base so we can give it a try.

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:14,820
Let's give it a try.

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,610
More, let's call it.

6
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,330
More steak is the best steak.

7
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:31,770
I guess we have that image as well.

8
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:32,960
Let's hit save.

9
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,830
I guess we did get in response.

10
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,300
Let's have a look.

11
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:47,010
We've said to create or save is not a function to get some issues in the control.

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,630
52 line 52 let's have a look created equal.

13
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:59,110
So if said dot okay it should be new create a new instance of website

14
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,830
created new instance of website based on the request wording and see.

15
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,350
So let's try again.

16
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,610
Um, and let me just take the data.

17
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:21,030
This.

18
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,370
You can see we have got the websites already.

19
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:30,980
Awesome.

20
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,290
We already have saved it in the database.

21
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:37,890
So you can see we have the base pairs name and subtitle images ID.

22
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,060
Awesome.

23
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:40,680
Let's.

24
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:44,650
So this one.

25
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:45,610
Okay.

26
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:53,440
So once it has been created, next time it will be updating, it will be creating again.

27
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,220
And you should not be creating into mean give it reload.

28
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:06,640
Now when next time Edwin comes here, I want to show the existing information about this homepage.

29
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:12,040
So the existing title subtitle, the preview image, everything that has been saved here.

30
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,640
I want to show you next next time they call me.

31
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,730
So that means we can use use effect.

32
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,490
Good customers.

33
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,820
Please bring the use effect to use effect.

34
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:34,650
And let me just right here use a fake when the component mounts immediately.

35
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,770
What we want to do here is phase the information.

36
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:43,950
So let me call it load home base.

37
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,230
No.

38
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,370
This will work.

39
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,670
This home base kit drought is also predicted.

40
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:01,780
I don't think we really need to protect this one because there's nothing there, right?

41
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,560
Nothing private.

42
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,590
It's it's the information you see in the home base.

43
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,720
So let's not worry about these roads, these Middle West.

44
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,130
We don't need that again.

45
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,560
But if you keep that there.

46
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:23,500
Actually, you shouldn't apply the militia because otherwise you cannot despaired in home base, because

47
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,070
home base should be available for everyone, doesn't have to be locked.

48
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:27,550
Right.

49
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,710
To make sure you don't have the Middle East then.

50
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:34,360
Because if you do, then you have to access the token.

51
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,390
And only when you have the token, you want to make a request.

52
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,740
Otherwise you get there.

53
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:47,860
All right, so let's clear this frozen ghost load home, basically still async.

54
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:50,410
Try.

55
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:54,560
Cats.

56
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:55,310
Yeah.

57
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:04,420
So here what we want to do is we want to make a metric $1 equals two.

58
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:10,590
Or wait excuse to get make a get to to base less.

59
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:16,200
We need to give the root for air and that is the name of our base that's home.

60
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:18,810
That's home base.

61
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,070
That's what we saved earlier.

62
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,050
Okay.

63
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,070
No.

64
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,050
Immediately.

65
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,130
You should consult your doctor.

66
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:30,910
You should be able to see the page, information, images.

67
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:31,540
Right click.

68
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,920
Have a look in the console.

69
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,980
You can see we get the information already.

70
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:46,760
You can see it.

71
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:49,610
It means you are told subtitled everything.

72
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,780
Absolutely beautiful.

73
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,420
So this information in sort of console.log.

74
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,820
I want to populate here.

75
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:56,400
All right.

76
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,220
So settle down to the title.

77
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:04,400
Said Subtitle data added Subtitle set.

78
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,720
Full of images that are just full with images.

79
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:13,600
That way you can see the information gets pre-populated.

80
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,410
The first time it was empty, but as soon as they create it is there.

81
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,950
Now anytime you have it sends you continues from here.

82
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:29,810
Now, before we turn here, let's try to see how this appears on the homepage.

83
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:38,080
So the main idea, whatever we do, we're doing all this because we want to dynamically change the home

84
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,690
based layout, virtual home base images, title and subtitle.

85
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,210
We want to change based on what we write here in this despot.

86
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:49,030
So let's see how we can do that here.

87
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:52,300
So basically what we need to do is we need to do the exact same things.

88
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,380
We need this function, we have to put it in the state.

89
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:02,350
And then based on that, we can change the values.

90
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:03,310
Right?

91
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:06,430
So includes all of the deps.

92
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,140
And let's go to.

93
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,980
The IS index.

94
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,230
So let me copy this.

95
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,570
Actually, this is something this is a good case where you could use it as a custom.

96
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,860
So we have already done great in many custom books.

97
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:33,450
So if you want, I encourage you to create a custom home.

98
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:33,810
Right?

99
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,460
So for the moment, let me just.

100
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,830
Copy this bit.

101
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,950
Go to places index.

102
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:52,660
And then here I'm going to just based here, I'm going to call it the for biz.

103
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:59,540
Customization, I mean, just based to you.

104
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,090
So that is the state.

105
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,250
Actually, I didn't even need learning.

106
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:11,170
And then use effect in this function.

107
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:11,950
Let me cut.

108
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,340
Let's put it just underneath this.

109
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:17,140
Beautiful.

110
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,810
So it's similar.

111
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,450
So I moved the.

112
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,980
I copied the state.

113
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,110
From MySpace to here, it's going to be Sam.

114
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:32,370
And then we need the user fix that will work exactly the same way.

115
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:38,820
So whenever you use a lantern, the hope is we make request, get the information about the home base

116
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,670
and then all that information we already have in the state.

117
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,150
Right.

118
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:47,580
So that means we can display this state information down here and make everything benami.

119
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,210
So what do we have in the home bed at the moment?

120
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:53,910
Is this full within this?

121
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,630
Actually, this is the one that is showing this information.

122
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,020
The title and subtitle.

123
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:07,140
So that means this component is responsible.

124
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:13,440
We can pass the title, subtitle and the image as props.

125
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:21,290
And it's a full with title equates to title subtitle and then featured image.

126
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:32,380
Sorry.

127
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:37,110
Fun with him is something that should be fun with.

128
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,670
All right, so we passed this data as well.

129
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,970
So that means we can now use that here to make it dynamic.

130
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,460
Now, before I do anything, let me just.

131
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,570
Use date is not defined.

132
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,080
This is our home base.

133
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,160
Let's make sure I have a use effect.

134
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,890
So you use data as well.

135
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:19,140
All right, so so far, there's no change.

136
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,210
Everything is as it is before.

137
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,640
But now we should be able to change the image to the text, to the subtitle.

138
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,620
Let's see how that works.

139
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:33,950
Let's go to full with images because we have already past the data as props.

140
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,820
Title, subtitle and full width.

141
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,300
So we go here and we do structure.

142
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:44,690
Title subtitle and then full of images.

143
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:45,500
No.

144
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,550
Following the we can give it a different value of this one.

145
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,050
So if we don't have the value, we can use this different value.

146
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:00,590
But otherwise the source will be now dynamic source will be full within.

147
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:12,160
And here the heading again we can always give the different value is give the different value for 30

148
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:17,230
missions of same subtitle learn stay.

149
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,170
Okay.

150
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:25,960
So here we can use the dynamic prop title and then here

151
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:30,370
subtitle.

152
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,270
Okay, now let's see what you can see here.

153
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,210
Actually, the image is number one.

154
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:46,810
That's because this one is full of images, dirty URL until we're doing it here, actually, we can

155
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,250
just pass it from here.

156
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,920
It's past the year.

157
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,570
Just a year.

158
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:54,420
And the object.

159
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,960
And looks like.

160
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:01,550
I think this is the one.

161
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,900
And so we have some styling issues.

162
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,750
We don't see anything, actually.

163
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:17,200
So we then have the total loss of totality.

164
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:17,980
Why is that?

165
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:21,240
So here.

166
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,470
Title subtitle.

167
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,110
Home base.

168
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,450
Let me just come to love the Donna.

169
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,930
Reference error excuse.

170
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,210
Sorry, I don't have access.

171
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:05,720
It's a really good idea to make it a custom move so that we can use here and in the customized as well.

172
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:07,790
Beautiful.

173
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:12,710
I can tell you this is the image we chose and this is the title and subtitle we write.

174
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,600
And you can see here it's here.

175
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:15,530
Awesome.

176
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,550
How good is that?

177
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,430
That is absolutely incredible.

178
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:26,570
Now, let me go, since, you know, you can tell us how the place looks from here.

179
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:29,770
Customize home based.

180
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:43,660
More months that the ultimate mom seems by right.

181
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:51,320
I didn't even go to emoji.

182
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,070
I feel like adding some images.

183
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,560
Let me just combine that.

184
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,070
I let's.

185
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,210
This is.

186
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,080
I really like it.

187
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:24,690
But let's send this to its peak.

188
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,600
Another aim is.

189
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,140
Let's pick this.

190
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,470
Save.

191
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,890
When we say I want to see some kind of a problem, it's good customers.

192
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,150
So when we save.

193
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:47,840
Central Falls.

194
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:49,280
Toast.

195
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:54,350
Success saved.

196
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:57,840
Okay.

197
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,480
All right, that's great.

198
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,340
Now let's go to homepage and let's see.

199
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,740
You can see it has been saved.

200
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,900
How good is that?

201
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:15,670
Now this this is just the beginning.

202
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:19,300
If you want, you can just customize so many other pieces.

203
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,280
Everything from the decimal.

204
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,090
And you can.

205
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:28,030
We have only control the sets and now you can control more sex and you can control here you get control

206
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,830
over sex and so other things as well.

207
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:31,590
You also.
