1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:00.840
All right.

2
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.750
So we have got these two elements here.

3
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:05.690
Okay.

4
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.690
So we've got them here.

5
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.170
Now let's give them some styling so that they look a little bit bigger.

6
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.050
Style, font size.

7
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.890
Let's use 24 pixel.

8
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.540
Let me use the same for this one as well.

9
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.220
Let's have a look.

10
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.180
Ah, so that's.

11
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.680
That's a decent size.

12
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.500
Now, when you click on these items, we want something to happen, right?

13
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:43.000
And we want to first determine what is the team at the moment, if it is like theme, we saw one icon,

14
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.930
if it is dark, then we saw the icon.

15
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.380
Right.

16
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.470
So we can do that here.

17
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.490
Think team equals equals equals.

18
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.640
We know it is light at the moment, right?

19
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.910
So if it is light, we can use this ternary operator.

20
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.650
If it is light, we do something, otherwise we do something.

21
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:04.100
All right.

22
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.140
So I'm sure you familiar with the syntax.

23
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.740
This is it.

24
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.490
Upward.

25
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.180
So if it is true, the code here will execute.

26
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.160
Otherwise, code here will execute.

27
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:14.050
Okay.

28
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.070
So if it is like this, what do we want to do?

29
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:27.650
If it is like we want to show this this item, this emoji, so that they can click here to make dark

30
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.600
because they're already using light, right?

31
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.840
So they can click here to make it dark if it is already if it is not light.

32
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.630
So if it is light, we should that one.

33
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.010
Otherwise we should this one.

34
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.920
So if it is dark, we saw this one.

35
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.170
So when they click on this one, we make it light.

36
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.610
Light.

37
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:52.360
Okay.

38
00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.090
So now we're conditionally showing just one.

39
00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.650
Okay.

40
00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.900
So when they click here, we want something to happen.

41
00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:59.220
Right?

42
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.170
So let me just write that as what's on click.

43
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.700
So this is the event handler and click click event handler.

44
00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.960
So on click.

45
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.030
We can execute some function.

46
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.120
Okay.

47
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.160
So we could use a function name and put that function here.

48
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.110
Or sometimes you can just write everything in line if it is not going to be too long.

49
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.090
So let's just write in line here.

50
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.370
So on plate we can use arrow function.

51
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:34.300
So in a situation like this, arrow function is really helpful because it has very little syntax to

52
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.560
it.

53
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.650
So unclear.

54
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:42.360
What do you want to do if it is if the team is called to light and if user clicks and this one that

55
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.830
you want to change this to dark.

56
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.250
Right.

57
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:53.460
So, Cynthia, by the way, if you are wondering how I'm getting all these nice little autocomplete,

58
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.740
that's because of this tab line.

59
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.270
It's incredible.

60
00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:58.440
Yeah.

61
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.510
Artificial intelligence based called support.

62
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.960
Okay.

63
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.020
So you can try this in.

64
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.080
So from the.

65
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.370
The marketplace to search for tablet and then to insert this one.

66
00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.480
It's really helpful.

67
00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:16.220
All right.

68
00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.050
So on click.

69
00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.770
You want to change the theme to Dark.

70
00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.580
And if you remember previously, we have also been tracking the local stories.

71
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.880
Right.

72
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.670
So when you tell, you also want to save that value in the local stories so that next time user comes

73
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.540
here, he you didn't have to keep switching.

74
00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.230
We remember as an application, we remember his preference.

75
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:40.670
That would be really nice.

76
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.330
All right.

77
00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:52.610
So local stories, dot said item by the name of theme and the value is going to be done right.

78
00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.420
So this is what we want to happen on click now.

79
00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:59.690
Same thing here.

80
00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:08.660
We can add similar one click so we can copy that and click function that we just wrote based here.

81
00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:15.520
And just a small change we have to make here now this time we want to turn this to light, right?

82
00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.310
So turn this to night and send him light.

83
00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.890
It's beautiful.

84
00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.610
Now you can see here if current theme is light, we saw this icon.

85
00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.000
When they click, it will set the value to dark.

86
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.160
Otherwise it will see the very light.

87
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.420
Okay.

88
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.440
So that is great.

89
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.390
Now at the moment you can see when you click it, tins is now.

90
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.020
So in a click in it is a duck, otherwise it's light.

91
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:53.050
However, obviously we don't see any change at the moment because we still haven't worked out on the

92
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.560
styling.

93
00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.470
But you can see functionality is there.

94
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.880
It's just a one click or.

95
00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.510
Beautiful.

96
00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.670
All right.

97
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.030
So.

98
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.080
Finally, what we want to do is we want to have two different things.

99
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.030
One is a light theme and one is dark theme.

100
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:17.040
We are going to put those cases in separate files and based on whatever value we have in the context,

101
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.270
light and dark, we can to load separate thesis files.

102
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:22.020
All right.

103
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.430
So for that, obviously, we need the heads demon heads six, right?

104
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.440
So I'm sure you know this one.

105
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:34.470
So the thesis link you put in the head six, right?

106
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:44.010
So for that we can import head component from next as well as head from and next head.

107
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:53.370
So this is a component that we can import from next year and that will allow you to write something

108
00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.590
in the hair section of the application.

109
00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:56.650
All right.

110
00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:00.450
So here you want to put that head?

111
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:02.490
Yeah.

112
00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:10.530
And basically why we are using head here is because we want to use the link to load this thesis.

113
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:11.000
All right.

114
00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.820
So Link.

115
00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.320
I really am really attempting to this hour to complete this one.

116
00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:21.630
But I will just start.

117
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:26.300
Okay.

118
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.170
Two heads first.

119
00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:39.090
Style set and then heads after link releasing styles.

120
00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.560
It true.

121
00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:42.630
So we have to give the reference.

122
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.360
Where do you want to load the file from?

123
00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:52.830
Now, this is the interesting part because based on what we have in the context, think that one I want

124
00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:56.760
to load here so you know whether it's late or dark.

125
00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:02.660
Now we don't have that necessarily anyway, which we are going to quit very soon, but for the moment

126
00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:06.450
it just right here and then we will worry about that.

127
00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:07.020
All right.

128
00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.070
So he hates Riff.

129
00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:17.400
Whenever you need to put some JavaScript code here, we can use the codebase and we can use back ticks.

130
00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:25.440
Now, if you need to back ticks, back ticks are in your keyboard on the top left, just under the skip

131
00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:25.890
key.

132
00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:28.130
All right, so this is not ports.

133
00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:29.520
This is back ticks.

134
00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:35.410
So here I want to dynamically load different pieces.

135
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:44.760
So I'm going to put them here in this thesis folder, which I'm going to create here CCIS and then to

136
00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:49.170
embed the variable, I can use the dollar sign calling this.

137
00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:54.720
You can use the syntax in of text to put any variables here.

138
00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:59.280
So the variable I want to use is whatever we have in the context.

139
00:07:59.340 --> 00:07:59.590
Right.

140
00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:01.800
So it could be light or it could be dark.

141
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:04.770
Dot C is this.

142
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:06.960
Beautiful.

143
00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:10.410
So you see, this practice is really helpful.

144
00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.570
This is also known as template strength.

145
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:20.220
So you can see you can just mix the quantity input variables and you can use some regular script as

146
00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:25.730
a ruler strings to make things dynamic, I guess.

147
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:27.690
So whenever you click, it will tense.

148
00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:29.220
All right.

149
00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:33.780
So it will change and it will try to load a different cases for it.

150
00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:40.770
Now, at the moment we don't have light docs here since we don't have the thesis polarizer, so which

151
00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:44.280
we're going to cover version probably in the next lesson.

152
00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:50.910
But for the moment, let me show you how it's going to be possible and then go to app.

153
00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:56.700
I told you that and isn't concerned with two different things, light and dark.

154
00:08:58.290 --> 00:08:58.650
Okay.

155
00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:00.360
So at the moment we using light.

156
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.740
This is the main mode for now.

157
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:10.080
If you wanted to use dark in this comment about import and this.

158
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:22.100
Sense that when I think of Robert import let me take the documentation for the dark.

159
00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:36.720
For the dark theme we have, we can import.

160
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:46.620
Let me just.

161
00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:47.450
Come on.

162
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:51.000
If dark goodness knows that word.

163
00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:59.230
Enter Dr. Seuss.

164
00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:00.220
That must be the.

165
00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:03.150
Okay.

166
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:07.580
So that's the one and less and dirty Dr. Seuss.

167
00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:08.820
LEMON Try that.

168
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:10.530
Come here.

169
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:16.540
This is just entered uses for the duck and don't dock.

170
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.060
Don't see.

171
00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:17.490
It's just.

172
00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:18.710
All right.

173
00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:22.730
So if I use that, give a reload.

174
00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:33.260
You can see we have the dark thing and you can see in the local stories.

175
00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.660
Also, we have the theme.

176
00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:46.070
Let me just see what was there said theme is not different in context theme line.

177
00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:50.870
Then I can take that context.

178
00:10:51.260 --> 00:11:01.250
Theme line ten said Oh, so you can see here I made a typo here theme and basic thing.

179
00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:07.850
So you can see really the actual error message is quite helpful.

180
00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:09.140
Okay.

181
00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:14.790
So you can see here now we're using the DART theme system.

182
00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:16.130
So that's.

183
00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:20.960
You must have noticed that at earlier.

184
00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:23.980
That's quite silly.

185
00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:25.370
Hour.

186
00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:26.560
So we got that.

187
00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:27.700
Let's come here.

188
00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:35.320
Now, you can see here we have the dark theme because we changed.

189
00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.010
We could use the different theses.

190
00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:45.160
You can see it's a dark theme that also comes with and is then by default, beautiful.

191
00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:46.630
All right.

192
00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:53.530
So since we have these two different style, style suits, we're going to put them here in a folder

193
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:57.820
and dynamically lower based on the user's preference here.

194
00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:59.230
I guess that's the message.

195
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.410
That's how we're going to implement light theme and dark theme.

196
00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:04.870
You too.

197
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:07.300
And you clearly see the weather changes here.

198
00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.530
Light, dark.

199
00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:14.920
Instead of just tuning here, we're going to load a different science it from the CCS folder here.

200
00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:17.020
So we're going to work on that in the next lecture.
