1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:06,930
All right, so let's create the endpoint in the back end so that we can get on the users and then we

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,710
going to make a request from here using use effect.

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:11,220
All right.

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,150
So let's go to server routes of.

5
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,200
Let's create a new.

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:34,280
Quit using it, assuming that Rona don't get users.

7
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:50,080
Require a signing then is added to this throughout will be only for added to the admin and then we can

8
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,040
call it uses.

9
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:52,870
Okay.

10
00:00:53,170 --> 00:01:00,410
So it's go this uses control function uses Google controls auth.

11
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,460
It's come all the way down.

12
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:03,910
It's right here.

13
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,850
So we have this control function, really.

14
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,570
So what we want to do here is we want to query the database of the users, right?

15
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,120
That is straightforward.

16
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,920
We use a user model that will give us all the users.

17
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:45,390
What do we want to do here is we don't want to select the users password or secret the reset code,

18
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,290
those properties.

19
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:47,550
We don't want to sleep, right?

20
00:01:47,970 --> 00:02:00,510
So what we can do is we can use dot select and we can deselect so into the string minus password, minus

21
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,370
secret note communist.

22
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:06,000
All right, so this the names that you want.

23
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,970
So if you don't choose minus, that will be selected.

24
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,980
But in our case we want to disallow it.

25
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,890
So minus secret and then minus the reset code.

26
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,430
That's why we find all the users dislike these properties.

27
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:22,910
And then.

28
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,200
Jason Yes.

29
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,420
Let's give it a different name because these there might be conflicts or expression.

30
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:35,180
Oh, oh.

31
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:37,070
All right.

32
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:41,210
So this will give us all the uses, and it's cool to our route.

33
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:50,160
And I sort of it's good to have the index and how tactful I mean use this index and then here, let's

34
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,460
try using use 15.

35
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,350
Secure its use.

36
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,300
It's called a function, let's call it load uses.

37
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:14,300
And then we're going to execute that in huge effect.

38
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:14,870
All right.

39
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:17,920
A load here.

40
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:26,480
Now, this road requires the user to be admin, so that means we need to make sure we have the authenticate

41
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,230
to user and that the user's token is sent.

42
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:37,250
So you want to add the US in the dependency, also the token.

43
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:42,710
Sometimes immediately you may not have access to the context.

44
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,300
So at that time, if you make a request, you may not get any data or you may get some error.

45
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:56,540
So we want to make sure we have the token before we send a request to if of token, if we have the token

46
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,510
in the state only then send this request.

47
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,950
So let's work this function on load users.

48
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:12,260
Async request response.

49
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:34,470
So here we want to do and we want to use the excuse cons dollar act is still a great excuse to get make

50
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,030
a gift request to use this.

51
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:43,650
That should give us the uses we put in, put them in the states it uses.

52
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,820
That can be done.

53
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,680
All right, so now we should have got all the uses.

54
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,640
Let's have a look.

55
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,910
You can see we have the users total count 12.

56
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,480
Beautiful.

57
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:56,640
That's great.

58
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,030
Now let's come here and try to render.

59
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,480
The list of uses.

60
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,870
Now, let me also write one on the phones.

61
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,660
And just quickly, because we're going to implement, edit and delete.

62
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:09,980
Okay.

63
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:10,790
So let me read this.

64
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:17,180
Did Fox open up handedly try cats air?

65
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,190
Control of the air.

66
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:22,880
So what are we going to do?

67
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:23,840
We need to try

68
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,300
to come back to this function.

69
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,240
We can drive here if.

70
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:41,430
We should be receiving the user and then we can take this word for this transaction.

71
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,270
Let's just render the list of users, then we'll.

72
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,140
What about this one.

73
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:51,560
So we got the heading.

74
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,390
Yeah, it's.

75
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,360
And then our users looks like we don't need this.

76
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,500
Maybe we can have a line break.

77
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,740
And here we want to list all the users.

78
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,530
So we have the list component from end.

79
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,960
So let's use that to render the list of users.

80
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,340
So list.

81
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:26,990
It requires the to lay out what original wording we are using a horizontal data source that's uses in

82
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:33,680
the state the array of uses as the data source and render item that we were going to render.

83
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:34,850
That is.

84
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:36,260
Yeah.

85
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:37,970
So we get each user.

86
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:40,490
Granger.

87
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,420
We can use list item.

88
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,650
So here inside list item.

89
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:03,820
We can.

90
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,540
So it's you.

91
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,670
So we know we have to decide.

92
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:09,640
What are the properties you want to display for each user?

93
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,840
We want obviously to edit into the icons.

94
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,120
We want to show the user name.

95
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,520
So let me use list.

96
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:23,050
I had a mirror here I can sort of name.

97
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:29,760
So title that's going to be item user.

98
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,100
It's called user.

99
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,210
List item.

100
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,480
So that closes here.

101
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:52,260
Brendan Ryan So we're using one quarter this year.

102
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,050
And to you, we have got to use this to.

103
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,250
Perfect.

104
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,080
Looks like we have a break from camp there.

105
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,140
Looks like we don't actually need even angry.

106
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:08,790
Okay.

107
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:09,500
That looks good.

108
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,720
I guess we got the name of fuses.

109
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,700
Let's work on the other properties.

110
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:23,840
So here you can see we want to show the avatar with the this first character of the name, email, the

111
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,440
role, how many posts they have and then do.

112
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,070
All right.

113
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,000
So let's walk them that.

114
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,800
So you list item list.

115
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:39,230
So the editor did it.

116
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:39,890
I can tweet.

117
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:42,440
Is we going to just put them here?

118
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:52,370
They said that would be X and it seemed to be a way to here we can have array of x and so we wouldn't

119
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,050
have to edit and delete.

120
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:55,460
So in this array.

121
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:03,080
Let's go right at it so we can put it in a linked component.

122
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:10,380
So when they click through, take them to a different base where they will be able to edit these increases

123
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,200
to limit cookies to the finished ones.

124
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:19,640
So you can see when you click, we take them to a separate place where we can you can see we have the

125
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,890
admin uses the user ID is the.

126
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:29,360
And then this in the writing we send request back and get that user pre-populated in the phone so that

127
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:30,710
we can edit.

128
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:31,910
That's it.

129
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:32,530
That's for edit.

130
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,340
Then it will be straightforward.

131
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,290
You can see it is gone.

132
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:36,660
Delete.

133
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,790
All right, so let's come back here.

134
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,830
It's use link.

135
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,300
To Interlink, we use anchor tag.

136
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,960
And here we call it got it.

137
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,700
To link heads for history.

138
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:06,200
If it's going to be let's use back to less advanced less uses less user aid.

139
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:06,680
Right.

140
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,450
So that could be huge.

141
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:09,740
I'm just quite.

142
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:22,150
So that's for edit now comma because we are in the into the array so comma and then another value that

143
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,460
to be for delete.

144
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,080
For Dillard.

145
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,430
We don't need link.

146
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,890
So we can just use an attack like that.

147
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,340
Can't do it.

148
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:35,370
And to do it, we're going to execute a function.

149
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,200
So on click.

150
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:48,490
So we can execute a function which we already wrote here and then delete.

151
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,690
And we want to pass the user as an argument.

152
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,010
So give the user.

153
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,450
Anchor stay on click.

154
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:10,570
So we have obviously we've got one expert caught Bruce thank you.

155
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:18,840
So editing dude we have to when dude is clicked, we give this user object as an argument to this function

156
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,240
so we can access that user.

157
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:29,340
And then for the moment, I think we have to quit the delete to use endpoint in the backend.

158
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,470
Let's wait for that for the moment.

159
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:37,710
We can just try it if the user don't underscore it.

160
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:43,380
Equals equals equals of Dart's user to underscore.

161
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:55,420
Then I learned you can not do need to yourself and return.

162
00:11:59,380 --> 00:11:59,810
All right.

163
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:08,180
So we're not going to allow the user to dilute themselves because usually editing required deleting

164
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:12,530
a user will have some consequences because the user may have created some posts.

165
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:12,860
Yeah.

166
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,290
So the posts posted by a user will not be there.

167
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,720
So there are consequences.

168
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,080
It shouldn't break the application because we can.

169
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:34,300
If the user the post posted by user is not there, then we just know I will assume the name is false.

170
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:35,120
That's about right.

171
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:40,520
But defending a user is not something we actually do in real life.

172
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:47,720
Maybe we hired the visibility to, you know, unpublished or something like that, but usually we don't

173
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,470
delete the user.

174
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:53,800
But as an admin you can delete, but we don't allow them to delete themself.

175
00:12:55,130 --> 00:13:04,070
So if the user I.D., the user that they're trying to delete is the currently log to use it I that same

176
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:10,490
then we should dismisses otherwise we can to make a request back and we will come back to this bit later.

177
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:11,690
All right.

178
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,080
So let's give it a try as well.

179
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,030
Let's see.

180
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,590
You can do it yourself.

181
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:15,890
Okay.

182
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:23,050
Edit If we click, we will be taken to a different base, which doesn't exist at the moment.

183
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:23,990
That is also fine.

184
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,400
Let's just continue here.

185
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,770
Let's make it look like this.

186
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:34,040
So we show the avatar email roll and the number of host and then we're going to move on.

187
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,060
Editor and delete.

188
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:40,990
So we got that access.

189
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:47,200
We got to use the name next one to be for the use there.

190
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,280
Also the avatar.

191
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:52,840
So avatar source.

192
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:55,660
So the source is going to be.

193
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:00,210
If the user have images so we can show that image.

194
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,880
Otherwise, we just take the first character.

195
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:04,360
From the neck.

196
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:05,230
All right.

197
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:11,500
So for the profile, we'll be working on the profile six and later.

198
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:15,830
So when the when we walk in the profile, they will be able to upload the image.

199
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,460
So at that time, we can show the image.

200
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,140
But for the moment, let's just.

201
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:27,270
So the the character and it's a source user.

202
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,460
What does he most want?

203
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,230
Dirty URL.

204
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,460
So if the user has the image then we will try to access the URL from the.

205
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:42,410
Okay.

206
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:43,650
Now.

207
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:47,380
If not, that's fine.

208
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,340
What are you going to do?

209
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,100
Is he going to do so beautifully?

210
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:56,020
So you just don't make.

211
00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:00,270
Can we just grab the first gauge using this syntax?

212
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,090
You know, you can see we have the easiest name as well.

213
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:06,840
Beautiful.

214
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,830
Our next one, the username we're showing.

215
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:20,450
I think we need a bit of a gap here, so let's use some style style margin lifters.

216
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:22,920
This used ten.

217
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,870
I guess that's that's better.

218
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,120
So that's done.

219
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,910
Next one, we want to show you this enlargement.

220
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,600
So after the mirror, let to use.

221
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:38,210
List.

222
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,830
Dot, item, dot.

223
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:42,960
Mr..

224
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:50,670
And here we want to show the e-mail.

225
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:56,730
So the description I can use user email.

226
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,410
Again, we use the margin.

227
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:08,120
And it's actually to work literally cut loose.

228
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:11,830
Yeah, it's just an amazing lift.

229
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,820
I think what we need here is we need to it somehow.

230
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,120
It's.

231
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,750
It's all consistent.

232
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:34,890
I think what we need here is the column with the span of full width that's available 24.

233
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,050
All right, that's fair enough.

234
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:38,670
Beautiful.

235
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:42,440
The entire island is looking pretty close to the sun.

236
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:42,800
Right.

237
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,470
So you got the name, email

238
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,090
and the delete.

239
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,180
Role in the number of posts.

240
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,530
Those two things have left.
