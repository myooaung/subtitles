1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:00,810
All right.

2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:05,670
So now we want to secure the space for the user with the role of admin, right?

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:11,640
So for that, we can do something in the layout.

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,730
So if you remember, we have the layout.

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,730
At the moment we just have the admin layout, but later we will have all the layouts for offline and

6
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:21,780
subscribe as well.

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,190
So admin layout.

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:29,460
As you can see here, admin layout has this admin navigation which is also here.

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,840
And so all the navigation menu we see on the side, this is the admin nav component.

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:45,270
So that that nav component is here, it just the navigation and that that is also been imported in the

11
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,120
layout, the admin layout, right.

12
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:56,670
So admin layout has been used on all the admin pages and the content is received as children and that

13
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:57,630
is rendered here.

14
00:00:59,170 --> 00:00:59,690
Right here.

15
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,270
So this is the children props.

16
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:10,780
So that means any base that will be accessed by admin is going to use this layout.

17
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:11,430
Right.

18
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:18,370
So we can do some kind of a take in this component and that will be applied to all the admin bases because

19
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,050
all the admin bays here, this layout.

20
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,760
Just a quick, quick review.

21
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,260
If you go to pages admin, we have a couple of pages here.

22
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:35,380
So if you go to the index, you can see we are using the admin layout and inside we have this content

23
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:39,280
which is received as is children props and rendered.

24
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,950
Here are two admin indexes using the admin layout post.

25
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:49,810
Also using this layout categories also.

26
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:57,090
Using the layout so as you can tier if you apply something in this layout that will be applied on all

27
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,820
those pages that are using this layout.

28
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,430
So that means we can do some kind of a trick here.

29
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,040
For the user.

30
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:12,690
And if the user has the role of admin, we can we can allow the we can just go ahead with this written,

31
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:16,460
otherwise we can redirect the user to some other bits.

32
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,800
Right, so we can pull from the take here.

33
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:28,970
Now this is just going to be this is not the best solution, not the best not the most secure solution.

34
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,440
So I will see you in the next lecture.

35
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:37,190
The most my preferred solution, which is making request to back in and get the response from the back

36
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,300
end that will be fully secured.

37
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:49,400
But this is another quick and easy way of securing the routes based on the value we have in the local

38
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,060
stories.

39
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:51,510
Okay.

40
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:57,410
So if you remember, we have the author in the local stories, right?

41
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:04,250
So that value we have in the local stories and also in the context.

42
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,410
So we can take for this value.

43
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:17,150
So if this user zone that we have in saved in the local stories and also in the context, if that user

44
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:26,270
has the role of admin, then maybe we can continue this one can go ahead with this region, otherwise

45
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,260
maybe do some kind of a redirect.

46
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,320
So that is a quick and easy solution.

47
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:36,920
But like I said, this is not the most secure because anyone can come here and edit the value.

48
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:43,490
So you can go to the console and run the query.

49
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:55,610
Local stories don't get item doors and use decent pass to change it as I was to change it to JavaScript

50
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,840
object from decent data.

51
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,500
And then you can just object the value to that way.

52
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:06,200
You could play around with the value and menu retains the value in the local stories.

53
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,810
So that will not be the most secure way.

54
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,790
So let's give it a try anyways.

55
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:11,810
And then we're going to.

56
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,050
Take a different solution by making requests to back in.

57
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:17,500
All right.

58
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:23,440
So to give it a try first, let's access the earth from context.

59
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:24,820
So import

60
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,070
all context from.

61
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:35,270
We go one step, two step context.

62
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,860
Oh, all right.

63
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:44,570
To use this one, obviously, we need to use context to react to import.

64
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,550
Here's context from React.

65
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,700
We have the context as well.

66
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:06,150
So here we can take we can access the context and set us from.

67
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,850
The Earth context, and we give that as an argument to use context.

68
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,860
We get these values right.

69
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:20,150
By the way, if you're wondering how I'm getting all these autocomplete, that's because of the type

70
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,080
tab line.

71
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:28,520
Now, you see, you can always I think I've shown you before as well in still extensive search for tab

72
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:28,820
line.

73
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,140
It is absolutely amazing.

74
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:41,010
Plugin it is tab nine and tab and I think -- nine.

75
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:44,870
So this is AI powered autocomplete for I'm Screwed.

76
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,410
It's absolutely amazing.

77
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:55,640
All right, so we access the US now, then we can use the use context.

78
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:02,000
So use effect that will run when the component mounts.

79
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:06,620
So as soon as the component mounts, we want to take if.

80
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,300
This user has the role of admin.

81
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,730
That's a huge effect.

82
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,980
It takes function as an argument.

83
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,520
Second argument, the dependency area.

84
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,360
We leave it empty.

85
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,540
We could use us.

86
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:35,220
So whenever the value of fairly invested tens tenses, we want to run this as well.

87
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:40,020
So not only when the component mounts, but also when the value changes in the context.

88
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:48,960
I guess so here we want to take if we have the fourth object in the context.

89
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:58,090
And then if the author user and we also want to take for the arts user role.

90
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:02,270
A consequence equals add me.

91
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,340
Actually it's a remote event.

92
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:11,490
So if all its user control is not equal to admin.

93
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:17,880
So if user is not admin, then redirect them to some other bits.

94
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:26,220
Maybe redirect to homepage utopia on a redirect to sign in because the user might be logged in user

95
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,740
but not the admin user.

96
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,340
Right.

97
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,020
No.

98
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,320
Actually, we are going to use header if we're going to use the.

99
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:42,650
You used hook I guess let's import use of from an extra from.

100
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,010
And then we're going to use this.

101
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:46,530
I guess.

102
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,080
Hopefully I'm not going too fast.

103
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:55,680
Sometimes I use this autocomplete, so I recommend you to install that blog plug in tab nine instead

104
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,460
of using that one.

105
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,550
But otherwise, I think I'm not going too fast.

106
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:03,250
All right, so let's use that.

107
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,030
Fox controller, it could use user.

108
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:16,760
Ah, we use that hook and then we can use this to redraw the user.

109
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,900
All right, so here are the dot posts.

110
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:26,030
We want to push the user to home base if it is not admin.

111
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:27,540
Okay.

112
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:32,400
So with this take let's see how this works.

113
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:33,900
Okay.

114
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,790
So at the moment we have the user.

115
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:42,720
This is not admin user, but let's say he tries to manually access the admin position, whatever.

116
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:46,620
Previously he could, but now he can't.

117
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:47,790
You can see you.

118
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,560
He has been redirected.

119
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:55,020
Now you might see the pace for brief second millisecond.

120
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:56,970
We can fix that as well.

121
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:03,120
Um, let me just it's it's really hard to notice, but you may see.

122
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,740
The admin desperate for brief milliseconds in before we get redirected.

123
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:10,380
Ah.

124
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,630
So we're going to fix that as.
