1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,450
All right.

2
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,120
So we have the list of users now.

3
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,920
Next, we're going to work on the edit and delete.

4
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,150
So let's work on the delete first, then we'll move on to edit.

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:15,960
So for now, for delete, we need to go to our backing group, the endpoint to do the user.

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,590
So let me just close everything.

7
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,030
Go to.

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,460
So I wrote.

9
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:35,840
Also as crude and delayed trucks brought in dirt too late to deliver, the user began to make a request

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,460
to use it less.

11
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,910
We can send the IED.

12
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:43,850
We can call it users, Lance.

13
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:53,880
Call I.D. or let's call to use I.D. just to make things a bit more easier to understand.

14
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,300
So that's the endpoint.

15
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:01,610
Obviously, the question is needed and it should be admin.

16
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,650
Only admin should be able to deliver the user.

17
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,310
All right.

18
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:05,120
So did it.

19
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:05,510
User.

20
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:09,320
Let's create that function and import.

21
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:09,670
Yeah.

22
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,490
Screwed the controller off and it.

23
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,540
Just read that here.

24
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:32,210
Export controls delete user equals two async request response try.

25
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,670
Get in there.

26
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:39,850
Frontal lobe.

27
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:48,190
So here we're going to try to find the user subconscious and its structure.

28
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,380
Actually, it's not really important

29
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,590
concepts.

30
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,760
Actually it's destructive just to make things easier.

31
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,420
So we call it user I.D..

32
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:03,760
All right.

33
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,840
So let's let's now let's get to it.

34
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:12,490
So user I.D., we distracted from request forums and then.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,830
We can take if the user I.D. that we are getting in the request for EMS, if that matches with the currently

36
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:22,670
logged in user.

37
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,210
Then.

38
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,210
We don't want.

39
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:32,290
To execute that because we don't want the user to do it themselves.

40
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:33,730
All right.

41
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:39,370
So if, by the way, you can already see.

42
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,860
But it's only for the admin.

43
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,770
I guess this service take is already there.

44
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,690
But despite having that, we also want to make sure that people are moderating themselves, including

45
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,200
including admin.

46
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,760
Sometimes you might get emotional.

47
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,500
They want to do it himself.

48
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,030
We don't want that.

49
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:12,300
I guess if user I.D. equals equals equals request to user and to underscore I.D., then we immediately

50
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:12,980
return it.

51
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:21,660
We don't want any code to execute, otherwise we can just find the user and delete.

52
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:30,570
So user equals two of each user find biden delete that started that ready and do it and then response

53
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,210
to this and use delete the user.

54
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,980
We can send this in response.

55
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,620
That's all we need to delete the user to get the root we get the controller.

56
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,160
Let's move on to our end.

57
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,280
And we already wrote the.

58
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,630
Function.

59
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,750
So admin uses index.

60
00:03:53,730 --> 00:04:00,810
We have to delete this text on click we execute handle delete which is right here.

61
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,800
Handle Delete.

62
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,570
If they don't do them self, we stop them from doing that.

63
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:09,740
Okay.

64
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:14,180
Otherwise, try.

65
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:18,530
Getting into.

66
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,070
So here what we can do is we can make requests to back in.

67
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,850
So cast data equals to old excuse to delete.

68
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:40,260
We make a delete request to less users just to use it less uses less the user ID which is here user.

69
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:45,000
We getting as a program from that?

70
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:51,380
And a text from you would give the user as a carrier.

71
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,870
So we use that the time we send to use it and then.

72
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,370
We're not actually sending any error messages.

73
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,500
I guess that's a bit so we can.

74
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,900
So to start.

75
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,100
To start.

76
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,990
Success.

77
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,240
Even though it's a success.

78
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:26,180
I want to show in the red red color because it's it's a deleted message.

79
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,980
So I want to use that toaster better.

80
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:36,110
And we just have called the misses user deleted.

81
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:40,750
Okay.

82
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:46,620
Now, once the user is deleted, what we need to do is we want to immediately update this list.

83
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,120
We want to immediately remove that to use it from the list.

84
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:50,630
All right.

85
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:51,800
So.

86
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,970
We can use it.

87
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:03,560
Uses so we have a list of uses a re-enlisted said to use this previous.

88
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:05,840
So what are you going to do?

89
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,900
Is we going to return previous list of uses and we're going to apply filter.

90
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:18,330
Looking to apply filter filter fonts and runs on each of these users.

91
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:29,100
So each user we checking for the user ID if that doesn't met with these just deleted you decide then

92
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,600
that list we want to.

93
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:35,190
Extract and sit in this state.

94
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:46,650
Using the printer photo, we filter out the due to user input, put the rest of the users back to the

95
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:50,280
state and that's it.

96
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,910
So actually, let's put this to Mrs. after this, because this is more important.

97
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:00,750
No data.

98
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:06,820
We could use data today since we are sending the user ID of user object from the backend.

99
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,620
All you can is continue using.

100
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,790
This doesn't really matter.

101
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,570
All right, so let's give it a try.

102
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,220
So let me just try some random music around seven.

103
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:18,850
Delete.

104
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,260
You can see that's gone.

105
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,310
Beautiful.

106
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,690
All you just maybe you want to if you want.

107
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,310
Against a number of you decide.

108
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:26,480
Hmm.

109
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,850
So let's cool all uses.

110
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:38,850
Going just for the list of number of uses you just want.

111
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,440
Don't let.

112
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,690
So we've got 11 years at the moment.

113
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,160
Limit delete this, Ryan.

114
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,640
Six.

115
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,180
We have ten left.

116
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,010
Beautiful.

117
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,090
All right.

118
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,710
So the admin has the list of uses we did on that.

119
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,150
We implemented Jasmine.

120
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:01,140
Now, moving on, we came to implement edit for edit.

121
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:07,980
We're going to have we going to take the user to a separate page, which is going to look similar to

122
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,620
what we had before doing the.

123
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:21,600
Adding when admin created a new user using this form the exact form we need so we use the same exact

124
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:21,960
form.

125
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,510
Pre-populated is the updating.

126
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:31,610
Use this information and then make some changes and hit submit to update the user as well.

127
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:32,970
So that's next.
