00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:00.750
All right.

2
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.690
So we can show the numbers here for the admin.

3
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.760
Now, the next thing I want to do is.

4
00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:17.650
So the categories and the latest posts when someone is visiting one of our blog posts, for example,

5
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.210
here we have the list, a blog post.

6
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:26.950
If someone visit our blog post we are showing you can see on the right segment we're showing the categories

7
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.770
or the categories we have and the recent post sort of six latest post.

8
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.430
All right.

9
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.560
So let's implement this in know.

10
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.440
Project.

11
00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.160
So at the moment, if you go visit the site, visit a post.

12
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.650
We don't have anything on the sidebar.

13
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.530
It's just we have the dummy text.

14
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.230
So let's use this space to show the categories and recent books.

15
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.460
Now, the good thing about this one is we didn't have to create any new out in the back end.

16
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.140
We already have a route that gives us all the categories and for the posts.

17
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.470
When you visit the post base, you get six post by default, right on.

18
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.700
Unless you click load more, you get six by default.

19
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.500
So those six are the latest ones.

20
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.670
So we can just display them on the same messages.

21
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.190
All right.

22
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.550
So let's see how we can use that.

23
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.060
And later, what I'm going to do is you can see here in this finished product, we are showing the categories

24
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.460
in the latest post and the exact same information I will be showing on the homepage as well.

25
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.220
Here you can see I'm showing the latest posts and I'm showing the categories list.

26
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:50.300
So I'm thinking of a way so that I can reuse the code whenever I want.

27
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:57.500
So this time I'm going to use hooks because I'm going to use hooks to get all the categories and then

28
00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.350
the post so that I can easily bring them.

29
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.460
And so these categories in post wherever I want.

30
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.930
Either it's the home base.

31
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.870
Either it's the single post office.

32
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.290
It really is.

33
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.200
And so let's see how we can use hooks.

34
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.640
Custom hooks, build your own custom hooks to do certain parts.

35
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.700
So that means we start from here intact.

36
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:32.230
Planful I'm going to create a folder called Box Inside here.

37
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.830
I'm going to call it to use use category.

38
00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:41.840
They're just.

39
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.090
So hooks when you want to create a custom looks basically it's going to be the same way you've been

40
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.770
writing the state and use effect.

41
00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.180
Whatever code you're writing in your components is going to be same.

42
00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:07.920
It will not have the written block, for example, take you to a, let's say, good admin index.

43
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.760
All right.

44
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.740
So here, if you want to make a custom hook here, you could take this code and make a custom hook.

45
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.760
So that hook will have distinct some functionalities here.

46
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.200
And then you will return the numbers and set numbers.

47
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.520
That would be a hook.

48
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:30.240
So instead of returning the content like this, you would return the numbers and set numbers and that

49
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.040
you could use as a customer.

50
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.750
I guess that's yeah, that's how it works.

51
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:47.820
So here use category and it's import some hooks, use state use you create and react.

52
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:58.380
And then we import excuse from X use and then we write out who wants to use category equals to.

53
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:08.260
So here the first thing we want to have a state const carry you set.

54
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:19.110
Can I give you this to use state the MTA by default, and then we try to use the effect that will fit

55
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.900
all the categories from our banking.

56
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:32.580
So here comes get category so we can drag this function inside here.

57
00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:33.510
You can put it outside.

58
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.060
But if you like it, just leave it interred here.

59
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:38.400
So here.

60
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.860
Let's try.

61
00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:51.540
Zero one.

62
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:52.980
Do you want to use excuse

63
00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:57.540
or wait?

64
00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:58.560
Excuse.

65
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.460
Don't forget we make a get request to get all the categories

66
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.770
for my backing and then we put in listed said categories data.

67
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.130
Now at this point we have the categories and said categories.

68
00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.800
Now, since this is a custom look, we don't have to have written block to display the content.

69
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.580
We just want to return this value.

70
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:24.280
All right.

71
00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.890
So here it can return.

72
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:33.360
Categories.

73
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.970
We don't even need to get set categories.

74
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.080
We just need to return categories nicely.

75
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.330
Now let's make sure we execute this one.

76
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:43.680
Otherwise nothing will happen.

77
00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.320
Better execute this function so that it runs.

78
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:55.620
Populate the state and then the categories from the state we are we return to.

79
00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.060
This is our custom hook that will give us all the categories.

80
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.050
Now we can use this.

81
00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:03.120
Let's try.

82
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.690
Using it in a single post.

83
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:07.240
Right here.

84
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.980
So here, let's go to Baz's.

85
00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:22.780
Post slow and let me import that import use.

86
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.100
Category from.

87
00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.820
Hooks use category.

88
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:34.750
And then we want to.

89
00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:37.250
Use that.

90
00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:45.180
So let me right here so we can get the categories from the whoop weren't so we return that so that means

91
00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.520
we can get the categories from use category hoop.

92
00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.410
And let's have a look at this.

93
00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:57.330
So down here on the side where instead of having this dummy content, let me just use three

94
00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:04.200
versions being five categories.

95
00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:06.540
All right.

96
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:08.220
Now let's see.

97
00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:10.290
Use category.

98
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.400
It's not a function.

99
00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.960
I think we named it differently use category.

100
00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:30.530
Okay.

101
00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.880
We actually look forward to expert.

102
00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:47.910
We export use category now and then we import here.

103
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:49.230
Should be good.

104
00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:55.720
Okay.

105
00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:58.320
Now, you can see we have a list of categories.

106
00:07:58.330 --> 00:07:58.740
Beautiful.

107
00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:05.980
Now we can, as you can see, these hooks you can input in any place to show the list of categories.

108
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.610
So let's try to render that here instead of the decent train for.

109
00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.150
So here, let me use the divider.

110
00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:27.700
So that's important.

111
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:31.220
And go back down.

112
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:33.020
Yeah.

113
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:37.180
Divider.

114
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:41.300
And here I want to write let's write categories.

115
00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:46.400
And then we show the list of categories.

116
00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:53.120
So categories, dirt map the map to all the categories.

117
00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:55.780
It's called see.

118
00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.630
And then we rendered them.

119
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:03.320
So we can use a link component.

120
00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:05.840
So we make these categories clickable.

121
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:08.180
Because what I will do.

122
00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:09.830
Let me show you the finished product.

123
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.710
So I will also make this clickable.

124
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:17.420
So in the link we fit all the post that belongs to that category.

125
00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:23.480
Now you can see this category doesn't have any post, but if any post has this category, we will show

126
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:24.500
folks who will react.

127
00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:26.810
Now react category has this post.

128
00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:31.480
So this post you can see it has the category of freaks.

129
00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:39.260
Now, if you go to the note root carrier, this one has to post a work of this post here, the category

130
00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:39.890
of note.

131
00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:42.740
So we'll make this clickable as well.

132
00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.470
So for that, we can use link.

133
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:49.470
And then heads were.

134
00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:56.840
So the history, it's going to be less category less.

135
00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:59.390
We're going to use the categories slow.

136
00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:03.570
So obviously dispute doesn't exist at the moment, but we know that this very simple.

137
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.720
And here we can.

138
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:10.710
So the category name, let's use a button for this one.

139
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:11.760
So that looks good.

140
00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:14.640
So the character names in button.

141
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:17.040
So button.

142
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:26.250
And we give it a name, see different names, category, name and then button.

143
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:32.330
Just so that they don't they're not joined with each other.

144
00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.730
We can apply some margin margin too.

145
00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:41.570
And then since we're using met, each item should have a unique key.

146
00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:42.570
So this link.

147
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:45.610
Can have the unique.

148
00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:52.600
Key we can use category.

149
00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:56.600
All right, let's have a look.

150
00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:58.970
Button to import.

151
00:10:58.970 --> 00:10:59.360
Button.

152
00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:07.210
Okay.

153
00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:11.420
You can see now we have only four categories and they're displayed here.

154
00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:15.630
Now, if I click, we can visit that place, but that doesn't exist.

155
00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:16.490
We'll come back to that.

156
00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:20.360
But otherwise you can see we are showing the list of categories.

157
00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:21.010
Beautiful.

158
00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:25.490
Now let's create a similar hook to serve the post as well.
