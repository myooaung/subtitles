00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.140
All right.

2
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.820
So we have this full with images.

3
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.450
The next thing I want to work on is the the numbers.

4
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.060
Just like you can see in our finished project, we show the numbers, how many posts we have, categories

5
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:19.530
come to news and this information is something we are already showing in the admin.

6
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:20.040
Desperate.

7
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.360
So we have this one.

8
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.220
So we want to do that.

9
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.160
We want to use the same code and display this in our home base as well here.

10
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.770
Now instead of copy pasting the code, we can just try to reuse that.

11
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.750
So let's see what we can do that.

12
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.840
So let's go to bases admin.

13
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.770
Index.

14
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.160
So here, basically we need to get the numbers right.

15
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:54.700
So that's all we need because here we can import the render progress component that we created that

16
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.900
will show the numbers.

17
00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.700
So if I click here, you can see this is the the component so we can reuse this.

18
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.450
No problem there.

19
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:10.510
But to get the numbers, we can either copy the score, put in the home base, and that will give us

20
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.200
all the numbers.

21
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.280
And then we can just import this component and show it like this one.

22
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:23.560
Oh, if you don't want to just copy and maybe try to use it as a hook, you can do that as well.

23
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.440
So let's let's try to use it as a hook.

24
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:33.100
I guess we have already done that for categories in this post earlier, so we can do something similar

25
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.590
for these numbers.

26
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.560
All right.

27
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:37.120
Let me.

28
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.440
Good hooks for them.

29
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.840
Let me just copy one existing hook just to make things a bit easier.

30
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.640
Copy that.

31
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.580
Create a new file.

32
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.350
Let current users

33
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:51.810
use numbers.

34
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.010
That is the best here.

35
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.620
First, I want to change the name command f.

36
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:05.600
Command V tends to use numbers, find and replace.

37
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.820
So we change the component name and here in the state and use effect.

38
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.340
We actually want to copy this.

39
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:22.790
Cook So we have this function that is used in use effect in the state so we can cut all that, got all

40
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.920
that and put here.

41
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.990
And I sort of took this out of that beautiful tool.

42
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.060
We got the numbers in the state.

43
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.510
We have the function that runs in give us the number.

44
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.510
So here we can return numbers.

45
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.800
But now we can easily import this, use numbers two and give the numbers.

46
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.700
So let's do that.

47
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.670
So let me save this.

48
00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:52.330
Go here.

49
00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.820
And now we got this could actually save.

50
00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:57.910
Obviously, we get the error.

51
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.880
Then just sign in.

52
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.010
You can see we get the error but that's an easy fix that's import

53
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.000
huge numbers from.

54
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.730
Hoax.

55
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.850
Sort of hoax.

56
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.860
Let's use numbers.

57
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.760
Let's remove the excuse we're not using here.

58
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.740
Let's import the hoax.

59
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.780
You defected and did that.

60
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:43.380
So you use numbers here let me just destruction numbers that to be returned from this who

61
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:53.460
use those beautiful now we get the numbers so everything should work like before.

62
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.420
Ask you to try.

63
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.490
And you can see here we have the numbers.

64
00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.210
Beautiful.

65
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.810
That means we can import that hook and.

66
00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.870
Display the numbers in the home as well.

67
00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.380
All right.

68
00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.890
So let me close on the devs.

69
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.660
Let me open basis index.

70
00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.740
So that's a home and let me open them on the side by side just so that it's a bit easier.

71
00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.570
So this is the admin.

72
00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.010
So that's what this is the homepage.

73
00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.050
So on the homepage we want to show the numbers so we can use this.

74
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.700
Important.

75
00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.160
Now, since we are in the home base, I think we don't have to go and step down.

76
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.640
I think it just one force less.

77
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.440
Okay.

78
00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.910
And then execute this.

79
00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:49.190
So.

80
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.610
Matthew Wiener using the context so far, but let's leave it.

81
00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.140
If we use it a bit later, I'll do it.

82
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.100
You can delete this one.

83
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.100
So we've got the numbers now to show the numbers.

84
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.830
We can import this rendered from this component as well.

85
00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:10.640
So we are.

86
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:17.440
Do we just need to go and step into this full range of progress and then.

87
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.050
We should be able to show them now.

88
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.650
This time I want to show them all in one draw.

89
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.870
So let me just copy this first row.

90
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:29.800
And just put it down here.

91
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.920
So post a comment and then another.

92
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.710
We have four categories and uses.

93
00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.390
Now, I'm not going to copy the column.

94
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.250
I'm just going to copy this.

95
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.340
I'm sorry.

96
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.690
I'm not going to cover the role, but just call.

97
00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.060
I guess it was copy on that.

98
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:58.090
So we all have to column into this rule one column for post, one for comments.

99
00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.830
And now we based on the.

100
00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:02.570
Four categories and use.

101
00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.920
It's the only thing we want to change here is change the spin.

102
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.060
Make it six or six times these four random progress.

103
00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:14.970
They will all fit in a row.

104
00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:17.130
Now, if you come here.

105
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.750
So on the desk where we have issues.

106
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.290
Can't resolve.

107
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:29.670
Okay, so let's see.

108
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.110
Use numbers.

109
00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:39.490
Use numbers.

110
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.590
We export huge numbers.

111
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.330
We return.

112
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.450
Thank you, sir.

113
00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.140
It looks good.

114
00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:58.930
So we are here one step or two step.

115
00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:00.510
Who?

116
00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:18.790
Okay.

117
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:26.830
So this one, this one I'm getting from the home base, the index, I guess that's again, nothing wrong

118
00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.240
with the admin.

119
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:30.670
Actually, we already saw it worked.

120
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:32.680
I so this is the homepage.

121
00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.830
So we looks like we have imported the wrong way.

122
00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:36.640
Let's see.

123
00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:39.070
User numbers from.

124
00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:40.240
So we need

125
00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:43.930
to go.

126
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.010
Okay.

127
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.210
So we are instead paid this.

128
00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:48.250
Of course we had to go and step up, I guess.

129
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:50.550
So remember double digits.

130
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:52.040
Okay.

131
00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:54.740
Let's go to home.

132
00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:58.150
Rose is not here.

133
00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:01.930
So let's make sure we have the raw import raw

134
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:09.580
and then call from and.

135
00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:17.670
Beautiful.

136
00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:23.010
We got the numbers, but you can see we don't want it to be like that.

137
00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:25.140
We want them to all be in one line.

138
00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:26.700
And that's an easy fix.

139
00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:35.100
All you have to do, it's in this form spend six, 12 to 6 so that six, six and over six.

140
00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.600
And then the last one all together.

141
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.740
Six times for that.

142
00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:40.370
20 for.

143
00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:42.530
Beautiful.

144
00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:46.140
Let's make sure we have some.

145
00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:47.510
Get on top.

146
00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:48.080
Right.

147
00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:54.610
So for.

148
00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:59.270
Style Mars and top.

149
00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:04.230
Let me just give you the value of 50.

150
00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:07.930
Academics.

151
00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:13.540
Maybe for.

152
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:16.460
Awesome.
