1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,620
All right.

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,410
So let's explore the dashboard of this application as well.

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:10,500
Of course, there are too many features here, so I might forget to throw quite a lot of them.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,240
But let's go to the overview.

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:21,750
So here, feel free to visit Monster dot com and then log in as admin so that you can check out the

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,820
application where while we are building this application from scratch and I think that will really help

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:33,060
you because sometimes even when I'm trying to explain, it might be difficult for you to understand

8
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:38,970
because, you know, it's so much better when you can see it visually.

9
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:45,780
That way you can actually come and get the the overview of the application.

10
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,850
For example, when we set up the basic project, we will work on the sign in.

11
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:56,970
It's had a basis, so it's easier for you to come and visit to the base, have a look at it, how the

12
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,760
form items, icons, placeholder.

13
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,740
Everything has been built here.

14
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,190
So based on that, when we are recording, it makes perfect sense.

15
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,980
You know what we are doing, right?

16
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:15,690
So that I think will greatly help you to go through the application and the learning process will be

17
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:17,070
so straightforward.

18
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:24,090
All right, so let's try a log in as an admin and have a look at the desperate.

19
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,520
Now, you can see here, absolutely amazing.

20
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,440
Desperate similar to WordPress.

21
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:30,150
All right.

22
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,700
So admin has all these options.

23
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,320
Now, if you log in as author, author will have some less options.

24
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,290
And for subscribers they will be very few options.

25
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:45,390
For example, they can leave a comment, manage the comment, and that's pretty much it.

26
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,780
But for admin, we have a lot of these options here.

27
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:49,380
All right.

28
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:53,670
So you can see it's a collapsible, absolutely beautiful saver.

29
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:59,370
And if you are using it in a small browser, it will automatically collapse as well.

30
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:01,360
All right.

31
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:08,170
So this is the decimal we're showing the total number of posts and categories we have in our application

32
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,540
and the pit posts.

33
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,220
We have all this post.

34
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,350
So we have total 11 post.

35
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:14,950
At the moment.

36
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:22,780
When you have more post, you will be able to describe the name of the title and then you can filter

37
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:22,920
out.

38
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:29,200
For example, if I want to search the post with the title of boot camp, again, just search boot camp

39
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,820
and you can see it filters out.

40
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,650
So that will be much easier when you have too many posts later.

41
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:41,710
You can put a new post from here, you can click here, you can edit or delete.

42
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:50,500
The post has also moved edit as it's called here and this is absolutely amazing.

43
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:59,770
Text Editor Amazing because as you can see here, when I double click, it gives you this option to

44
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:10,750
format it could see you can embed link, you can even for faster writing in this use less and then type

45
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:17,050
something in for example if you want to type his his too and then you can just hit enter and write.

46
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,560
This is second page.

47
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,940
So you can do that.

48
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:26,200
You can quickly type for example, let's say you want to write them.

49
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,500
Just tap two and then it comes up here.

50
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,000
All right.

51
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,050
B and C I.D..

52
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,000
Name?

53
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,150
Email to things are so much easier.

54
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,210
Now there are so many options here.

55
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,680
As you can see, we have the heading.

56
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,720
We have a to do list order.

57
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:01,110
In order to list codes table, you can put code block and divider images.

58
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:07,110
You can emit images, links, and you even have this nice little notification bar said to have.

59
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,080
Make it right.

60
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,910
Make sure to

61
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,270
check out our post space facts and you can create something like that.

62
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,830
You can choose different type.

63
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:26,530
All right.

64
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,940
Now, if you hit save of debt, obviously a ton of debt.

65
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,200
We can try that later.

66
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,670
Now, you can see we have the categories and they're showing up here.

67
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,930
You can see the preview while you're writing this at the blog post.

68
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,780
You can have a look at the preview images.

69
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,250
You can change the image.

70
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:46,650
All right.

71
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:49,800
So this is an absolutely beautiful feature of this application as well.

72
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:57,120
So you can observe one image on multiple images and you have access to the application's media library

73
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,550
as well.

74
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,700
So its image has been uploaded.

75
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:04,090
They are available here, just like in a word, resumes.

76
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:09,150
So if you want, you can just choose issue and send the images.

77
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,030
Let's change that to this one.

78
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,080
Click here.

79
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:22,350
You can see this electric in preview category is really you can delete, you can have a SEO, you can

80
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:22,980
just type.

81
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,970
And it comes up here, which sounds absolutely beautiful.

82
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,090
And if I hit update.

83
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,720
All right, it has been updated.

84
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,590
Let's have a look.

85
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:36,570
That's the window.

86
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,290
You can see the image has been said.

87
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:39,970
And.

88
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,400
We have this other box as well.

89
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:44,450
All right.

90
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,250
And you can leave a comment as well.

91
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,510
This is incredible.

92
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:54,110
All right.

93
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:55,490
Absolutely beautiful.

94
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,050
Let's go back.

95
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,870
Let's continue to explosive.

96
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:03,050
That's how he can edit posts.

97
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:03,950
He can delete post.

98
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,770
You can fill the post, you can create a new post.

99
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:07,730
You can go from here.

100
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:10,430
You can go from here, create a new post.

101
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,470
So why don't we give it a try?

102
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,650
Creating a new post and let me go to my.

103
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,070
One of my calls so that I can copy some content.

104
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,280
Ryan Dingell.

105
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:30,630
All right.

106
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,100
So let me take out one.

107
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,510
My course, for example, let's see this one graphic you.

108
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:41,320
I guess so you can type the title.

109
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,900
Let's put title to this post and we're going to write some of the hint something here.

110
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,970
Now, obviously, you can write a list.

111
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,120
I'll give you to do it as well.

112
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:54,280
It's pretty cool.

113
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,250
I guess you can do something like that as well.

114
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:02,380
Now, obviously you can write a list.

115
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,520
One, two, like that.

116
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:14,000
Now, sometimes you might be copying text from other websites from Microsoft Word.

117
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,250
So it gets really easy here.

118
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:20,090
For example, you can see this is the list item here and I have a copy here.

119
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:24,190
It will detect the list item and it will auto format.

120
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:28,700
He absolutely amazed right now.

121
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,670
Let's leave it for now.

122
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,280
Let's upload.

123
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,290
Let's put some categories.

124
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:47,250
Let's see if I want to use a React craft, you know.

125
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,280
So you can easily source and choose the categories featured images.

126
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,120
I can upload.

127
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,580
The new images I can choose the existing one.

128
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,260
Let me to the existing one here.

129
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:01,430
I previously uploaded a few tools that I could.

130
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,820
Beautiful knowledge spot this.

131
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:07,340
Great.

132
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,230
Now, this post has been published.

133
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,760
We can have a look at that bit later.

134
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:15,360
So that's absolutely amazing part of this application.

135
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,960
Then post management, blog post the categories here.

136
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,290
As an admin, you will be able to put new categories.

137
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:26,960
You can update, delete, they are here and media, arts and media.

138
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:33,680
You can add a new image while you can go to the library, check out all the images that we have.

139
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,030
You can delete if you want to.

140
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,770
You can click on drag.

141
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:41,000
It gets a multiple upload, it will, it supports multiple upload.

142
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,020
You can click the drag.

143
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,960
We have the comment section so you can see all the comments

144
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,350
in the site.

145
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:56,980
And if you think some comments are not appropriate, you can just delete it.

146
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:03,320
You can view it will take you to that post where the comment has been posted.

147
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:03,860
All right.

148
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,740
So that's pretty cool.

149
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,820
That's okay.

150
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,790
So you can filter the comments as well here.

151
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:15,140
And then you have the user management section where you are able to create a new user.

152
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:16,010
All right.

153
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:19,280
So you can see this is your self or the user.

154
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,440
So you can edit, you can delete as well.

155
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:27,860
You can edit and make them give them a different URL, fake them, do this admin.

156
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,700
You can change that to something else as well.

157
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,560
I guess you can put some information there.

158
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:38,930
You can create a user or you can upgrade the existing user, you can delete them.

159
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:41,690
So you have full control over the user management here.

160
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:52,420
So if you add a new user, you put in an email, you can use this auto generated password or even just

161
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,770
enter your password manually.

162
00:09:55,430 --> 00:10:01,070
You can give them the rule and you can build this set of the same books.

163
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:08,630
If you do and submit, then this new user will receive an email about the account.

164
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:13,940
So this new user will receive the email and email password so that they can log in to that.

165
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:17,660
Because I guess if everything works, the email will be sent as well.

166
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:18,800
It's pretty cool.

167
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:20,990
Now profile.

168
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:27,230
So user, the admin here will be able to update his profile him to his profile images.

169
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,970
And we also have this customize feature.

170
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:35,390
So again, see this is the image that is being used in the frontend.

171
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,750
So let me go to Monster.com.

172
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,360
So this is the images we have.

173
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,620
All right.

174
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:49,580
So if you want to, you can change here so you can control the home based how it looks from within your

175
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:49,940
desk.

176
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,050
How good is that?

177
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,240
Now, let me change that from one step to just more inclusive.

178
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:01,100
Come back here, give refresh and you can see that inside.

179
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:06,470
Now you want to use let me be a different one.

180
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,960
Maybe try this one.

181
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:10,990
Okay.

182
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:21,530
Let's itself come here and give a reference and you can see we have a brand new image is absolutely

183
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,070
beautiful.

184
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,430
Now let me put it back the way it was.

185
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:30,850
Okay.

186
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:35,280
So this is a basic overview of how the admin despot looks like.

187
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:40,750
Now you can try with the subscriber and author as well.

188
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:44,240
So if you only log in a subscriber, they will have bit less features.

189
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,400
So obviously you can just copy from me as well.

190
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:54,210
Now you see it also has bit less options.

191
00:11:54,210 --> 00:12:01,050
They can create post minis the uploads but that's net.

192
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:06,060
So now as a subscriber they will be able to just leave the comment.

193
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,610
Not not much I guess if you copy.

194
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,960
And there's the password here.

195
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:18,710
So subscribers will have very limited hours and obviously.

196
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:20,630
All right.

197
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:26,600
So this is a production ready, complete content management system.

198
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:31,010
Here's your monster, which you will be building in this course.
