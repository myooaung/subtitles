1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:00,990
All right.

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,180
So we have the comment from that here.

3
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:10,170
So let's clear the state for comment and we can put put that in our post slug.

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:18,630
See him, let's add a step for comments.

5
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:25,930
So we need to have comments started as well.

6
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,480
So later the Post will have more than one comments.

7
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:29,810
All right.

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,740
So to put all those comments, we will need this state comment.

9
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:41,780
And while we are creating a new comment right here, whenever we creating a new comment to put that

10
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:47,120
user input for recruiting comment, we can have a comment, his comments.

11
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,100
So that's a single comment.

12
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,060
And this is plural to put all the comments.

13
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,050
You all right.

14
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,530
So comment, comment and

15
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:00,830
loading.

16
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,600
Comments loading.

17
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,720
We give the default value of false.

18
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:19,160
No.

19
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,680
We need a function to submit the comment.

20
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,090
So it's called comment as a contest post.

21
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,670
It's called handle submit.

22
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,280
Let's make it async.

23
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,370
So we tried to make a request to our backend.

24
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,400
Let's make sure we have x use.

25
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:05,480
Then here we make a post request

26
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:19,220
excuse don't post and we are sending making requests to comments less comment or comment.

27
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:24,080
I think it's comment we need to send the post 80.

28
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:24,440
Right.

29
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,570
So we have the single post.

30
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:29,720
We have the post so we can grab that idea from this post.

31
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,920
Don't underscore it.

32
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,040
So that's the URL.

33
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,270
And second argument is the content, right.

34
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,800
So we can send.

35
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:41,960
The comment.

36
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,340
Comment.

37
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:49,810
I can.

38
00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:01,270
Let me make sure I'm accessing this correctly because I think I used content instead sort of comments

39
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:06,730
that in me quickly go to our server controllers post.

40
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,760
Content.

41
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,530
No, we're not creating content.

42
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,820
We're getting comment.

43
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,130
We're getting the comment in the request body.

44
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:20,600
All right.

45
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:26,840
So that means, I guarantee you the same name list that's calling new content.

46
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,890
And then we send this as a response.

47
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:39,390
I guess if we get the comment in the request body and then when you want to say a new comment, you

48
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:47,190
need the content that that content would be in our case, comment, request body comment would be the

49
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:55,260
content to make the sense and come back to our slug here.

50
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:02,580
I guess we send this comment in there, of course, Marty, and then we get the response data.

51
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,730
You can console.log if you want to.

52
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:13,440
And then once you get that newly created comment, we need to push that to the existing list of comments.

53
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,340
Who are we?

54
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:14,820
Right.

55
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,200
So said comment.

56
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,010
Existing comments can stay there.

57
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:26,220
And then we put that post that this newly created comment.

58
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:35,040
Now, if you want to put it in the front, I think that's definitely you want to put before the rest

59
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,790
of the comments.

60
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:39,810
I said that we will you'll be able to update the additional comments.

61
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,250
Then said Comment empty.

62
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:50,880
Once the comment has been successfully created, you want to empty the value from the step.

63
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:52,830
Then

64
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,150
you cancel the total messes.

65
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:06,530
Comment posted successfully.

66
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:12,160
Like you said at this point, he understood the certain loading to France.

67
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,520
So that means when we started, we could send it to Drew.

68
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:24,310
When we get the recipient who sent it to France and if there's an error that then also we said defaults.

69
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:29,620
So that's a hands on function we can use to boost the economy.

70
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,970
So let's make sure we pass these as props to comment form.

71
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:38,380
So comment the loading and handle summit.

72
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,150
We can pass them as props.

73
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:44,720
So you.

74
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,380
Comment.

75
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,920
And also Mitt.

76
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:01,690
And loading.

77
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,400
All right.

78
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,270
Now, there's one more thing we need here, and that is.

79
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,820
Making sure this is visible and for the long term user.

80
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,630
But actually we have the context here so we can do that.

81
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:29,510
Great comment from the input excuse.

82
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:30,050
Okay.

83
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,610
Looks like we only had one.

84
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:33,620
Okay.

85
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,600
So on had one or two it.

86
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,590
You state to have.

87
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,760
Let's make sure we have.

88
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,130
All right.

89
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,570
So we didn't see anything at the moment, obviously, but.

90
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,940
We soon have.

91
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,790
Now we can always put some.

92
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,990
This industry first.

93
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:19,620
So first let's make sure we receive them first comment and and submit and then loading.

94
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:22,670
I can just.

95
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,350
Just for how?

96
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:34,410
Just so that we can view while we are developing let's do some street fight.

97
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,170
The comment.

98
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:47,950
We remove this layer, I guess, at the moment, and there's nothing there.

99
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:49,790
Okay.

100
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,430
So it's not operating the state.

101
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:57,670
That's because we don't have the the said comment, comment, all that here.

102
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,780
So we need to have that.

103
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:03,940
So let's make sure we have in fact, we need the set comment as well.

104
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:06,640
So let's go to this parent component.

105
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:18,720
So yeah, let's make sure we set comment as well so that we can.

106
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,140
Said common in the state.

107
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,140
I'm sorry.

108
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:23,430
Yeah.

109
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,210
Common sense comment.

110
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:29,190
All right.

111
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:37,500
So here now a Texas area value is going to be coming in on terms.

112
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,050
We get the event.

113
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:54,820
So until we get the event we use at a function set on Monday in the state with the very event don't

114
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,010
target don't value.

115
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:01,740
All right.

116
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,760
That's right.

117
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,170
That's right.

118
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,580
So we have that now.

119
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,240
We can try

120
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:10,660
AT&amp;T.

121
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,060
Now we are able to complete this state.

122
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:21,670
If we don't have the logged in user, then we don't want this form to be.

123
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,280
This wouldn't be able to type it in here.

124
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:24,760
Right.

125
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,840
So let me just open in a new window controls it.

126
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:37,450
You you can just do it from view and file new incognito window.

127
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,810
So you open that and go to localhost.

128
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,500
We visit one of the posts.

129
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:03,400
I can tell you, even when we don't have the London news, are they still able to enter something here?

130
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,110
So that's not something we want.

131
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:12,790
So what we can do here is we can disable this disabled.

132
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:18,010
And if I put true here, you can see it's disabled.

133
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,000
And I want that to be true only if we don't have the long term user.

134
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:31,390
So we can take our direct user and we have the authenticated user.

135
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,190
And that is not.

136
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:33,580
No.

137
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,650
That means we have to use it.

138
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,160
Right.

139
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:49,640
And we can have additional take off token is also that token is not didn't make it.

140
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:55,700
So if if token is not empty if we if the user is not not that means we have the logged in user.

141
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,250
Disabled.

142
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,690
It will be disabled when the user is not and when the token is empty.

143
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,260
Okay.

144
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:10,920
So off.

145
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,410
So we have the context.

146
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,370
We have an actual use.

147
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,320
That's an issue that.

148
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:23,280
Don't pass that off.

149
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,510
Use context.

150
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,030
Context.

151
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,370
Okay now you see we don't have the logged near the to disable.

152
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,130
However, here we have the logged in user.

153
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,540
So it is entertainment.

154
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:49,820
All right, so that's good.

155
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,070
Next one, we can work.

156
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:55,120
Actually, we can send the max as you.

157
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:04,930
In our back end, we have said the cactus to 2200, 200.

158
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:07,510
So we continue to send the max length.

159
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:11,980
For example, if we want it to be a length, no more than 200, then you can do that.

160
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,810
And with that, let me just try and copy this.

161
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:24,520
Now, you can see I cannot type anymore because it is 200 characters.

162
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:33,640
I said that's one way of putting some kind of edit is near to max length and then let's work on the

163
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,290
button as well.

164
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:37,150
So when the button is clicked, we want to submit this form.

165
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:45,730
So we want to execute the handle, submit fast and then button when it's a loading we want to show disabled

166
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,150
loading and so the loading indicator.

167
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,320
So we can use that.

168
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,540
On a page.

169
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,070
Handle Summit.

170
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,430
All right, beautiful.

171
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,950
So this is a common form.

172
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:07,590
Now, let's try

173
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:14,580
to submit the commandant and see what we get.

174
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:20,610
So in the parent compound where we are using this comment from, you can see.

175
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,830
We have the comment from in the when we submit the form, we are sending the post idea as well.

176
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,570
We have the comment as well.

177
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:38,110
So it should be good to let me open, inspect and let's try.

178
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,980
First comment.

179
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,860
Have a look at the network to hit post.

180
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,900
Okay comment says the post 80.

181
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,390
Payload.

182
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:07,890
So I guess we send the comment as a payload response.

183
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,780
As a response, we got the response.

184
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:16,320
You can see the auto auto generated I.D. content created dead posted by this user.

185
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:17,910
Beautiful.

186
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:20,350
Post.

187
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:26,400
Most ideas should be here for state.

188
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,740
I suppose you.

189
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,300
Both sides have beautiful.

190
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,210
Let's make sure we remove this dysentery fight.

191
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:49,780
So this is good.

192
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:53,530
We have been able to create a post, but there are a few things we need to fix.

193
00:14:54,730 --> 00:15:01,160
For example, you can see when we get the response, we don't get the now the post by users hold the

194
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:07,920
information, we just have the I.D. so we need to use the populate when we create a new command comment

195
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:14,080
and we need to populate the user's entire information and then.

196
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,140
We need to get all the comments off the post as well.

197
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:25,630
So you can see, you know, when we are showing the Post, the Post doesn't have any comments.

198
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:26,340
All right.

199
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:31,710
So the existing comments also we need to have so that when the new one is created all together, we

200
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,230
can render all of them here.

201
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,250
So let's work on that in the following.
