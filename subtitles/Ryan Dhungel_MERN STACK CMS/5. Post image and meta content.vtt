00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:06.920
Are we going to display this single post similar to how it looks?

2
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.930
So we have to show the date time.

3
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.090
We saw the number of comments which we don't have yet to add.

4
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.010
The comments feature as a bit later and the artist name we show the title.

5
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.690
We will show the Facebook linked in all the social media here we did silly.

6
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.790
We later we have the content.

7
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.600
We saw the rich text content.

8
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.630
You also will see the comments below.

9
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.230
So that's that's what's going to work.

10
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.630
So for this date formatting, we're going to use a library called Details.

11
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.280
So let's quickly into that.

12
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.450
So here the stuff that's in so.

13
00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.100
This is.

14
00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:03.060
I would just start the server again and then so we could do the slope issue.

15
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.700
So first let's import.

16
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.800
Dadaists from disease.

17
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:22.160
We also need to make sure we have that editor, the editor risk text editor we used when we were creating

18
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.250
the the post.

19
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.630
Right.

20
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.500
So we need to have the same editor to share the content as well.

21
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.140
So imports

22
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:34.520
editor from.

23
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.870
Rich MacDonald, editor.

24
00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:48.280
The next one we have the health sector and so on, the health sector and let so some dynamic content

25
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.140
so we can sort of push total.

26
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.080
And for the matter description we can.

27
00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.220
So the description of the post we just have to shorten the length.

28
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:15.470
So for the description we use post DART content that supports the content, but the content will be

29
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.160
quite long and we just need the 160 characters here.

30
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.990
So post content.

31
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.900
Substring.

32
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.210
We can use the substring function.

33
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.460
So this function will take two arguments to the starting point.

34
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:37.400
We start from the very beginning, the two index, and then we want to create 160 characters.

35
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.240
I guess that's how we can shorten the content this quickly.

36
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.990
Have a look at that.

37
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.260
Let's go to view source and you can already see we have the.

38
00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.600
So we have the title last post from Ryan to this, the title and then the description.

39
00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.570
I guess the description looks a little bit a little bit different.

40
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.290
That's because it's written in markdown format, right?

41
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.960
So it looks a a different what you can see we have the actual content here.

42
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:18.070
All right.

43
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:24.730
So let's continue here.

44
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.350
So we have the rule.

45
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.480
We have the column 16 and then column eight.

46
00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.740
So let's remove these two since three five.

47
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.120
So here we want to do is we want to use car again.

48
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.150
So car.

49
00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.580
And then this time we not going to use use matter.

50
00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:50.660
We can just put.

51
00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.020
So the content differently.

52
00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.910
So first, let's look on the cover.

53
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:06.460
An intimidating let's just start with the Post statement so we can show the title.

54
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.240
We can show that in one.

55
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.270
Post title and for the card we can use cover images.

56
00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:29.360
So all we can do is this time we're just going to use regular Mr. Imus.

57
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:37.980
So we're going to give the source, and that would be post dot featured inmates.

58
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.420
If we have the feature in Ms., then we want to access the URL.

59
00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.120
Otherwise we can send the default images.

60
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:50.720
That is less images, less default thought to be.

61
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.750
I guess we saw the default images.

62
00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:05.060
If if the image is not there, let's give this false thing isn't supposed.

63
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:08.220
Let's have a look.

64
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:09.210
Beautiful.

65
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:16.050
Now, you see, here we have the post, we have the title, we have the images in.

66
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.180
Check out the finished version.

67
00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.040
Okay, so that.

68
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.760
That looks good.

69
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.440
You may notice it's, like I said, a little bit different.

70
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.610
I think I used the endings instead.

71
00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:30.210
Instead, crafty.

72
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:37.310
So if you want, it looks a little different level, but it looks pretty, pretty good to me.

73
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:44.700
But if you want to use the typography from and design so you can do that, let me just to show people

74
00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.780
graphic.

75
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.660
I guess you can show the history a little differently.

76
00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:01.380
You can bring in the type of graphene destructive title and use the title like that.

77
00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.780
I guess if you want to try this, let's try it.

78
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:17.690
So let's import this Ripley saboteur we don't need that type of graphic fonts title from.

79
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.030
Photography and let's use the title instead of page one.

80
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.010
Looks a little different.

81
00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:31.360
All right.

82
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.230
So we got the image.

83
00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.980
We got the title.

84
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.710
Let's try another one without images.

85
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.560
I guess that's how it looks.

86
00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.070
Beautiful.

87
00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.790
So let's saw the information.

88
00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:49.060
So we want to show the media information about the post.

89
00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:56.590
Something like this one created that user name and comment, which we will have bit later.

90
00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.500
So we have the basis for that.

91
00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:06.430
So the title after the title, let me use paragraph dag here.

92
00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.530
Let's give this a class name of.

93
00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:10.920
What's next?

94
00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:12.660
I think we're not using that.

95
00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:16.650
It's a sleeping bag that, um.

96
00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.330
So what we want to do here is first we want to sew the date, right?

97
00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:29.550
So date is, so is first have the created date and updated it.

98
00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:30.360
Right.

99
00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:42.900
So by default so we can use this start created and date and we can use this dot format or function with

100
00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.030
the digits or format.

101
00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:46.200
We can choose the format.

102
00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:56.220
So we want to show the month day like celebrity so that from so we have the month month with the month

103
00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:57.750
name like that from

104
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:01.290
the day.

105
00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:07.530
And then the the year and then the time and then the Olympics, all that.

106
00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:17.700
If you want to show like that, you can use month and long format day sort of format coma here in full

107
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:19.590
for of full format.

108
00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:26.820
And then it's our minute and then AMPM.

109
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:28.540
Okay.

110
00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:30.160
If you have a look.

111
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:33.210
That's how it looks.

112
00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:41.520
Now, if I didn't use that and just use two characters, two characters, you'll notice it looks a little

113
00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:41.880
different.

114
00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:47.490
It just shows the the month doesn't right than a month months I guess, in that tone.

115
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:51.450
So let's just under that let's leave it like that.

116
00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.670
So that's for the date.

117
00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:58.490
So the date I want to have a slice and then I comments.

118
00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:03.530
So let me just use zero comments for now.

119
00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:11.840
We will obviously have the dynamic value later when we add the common feature and then we want to show

120
00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.550
the users the name.

121
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:14.030
Right.

122
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:20.440
So zero comments, we actually have to serve the categories as well.

123
00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:24.260
We have just for the categories now, calories can be more than one.

124
00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.270
So we have to map through the categories.

125
00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:26.900
Okay.

126
00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:30.620
So it's less in.

127
00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:42.470
It's going to be a bit tricky in we have to map through the categories suppose to what dots categories

128
00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:51.230
don't map to map to its categories then just call it see and we return.

129
00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:56.190
There is category.

130
00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.820
They have to be clickable as well.

131
00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:58.300
All right.

132
00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:05.410
So let's use spend day because later we will be seeing all the post based on the categories when people

133
00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:06.340
click in the category.

134
00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:09.220
We saw all the posts that belongs to that category.

135
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:13.390
Okay, so we're going to make them clickable.

136
00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:17.080
So spam, so is item.

137
00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:20.650
We give the key that can be category on the screen.

138
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:28.510
And then here, if it's going to be clickable, then obviously we need to link component

139
00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:33.460
inside link and could tag.

140
00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:44.140
Let me just say this footer you can see so far, so this is what we have date comments in now all this

141
00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:50.200
we do to map through all the categories and then we want to make them clickable.

142
00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.930
So we using the link 88.

143
00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:58.470
The end of day held true.

144
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:03.380
So the category piece we obviously don't have yet to include later.

145
00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:08.110
So let's just call it category stress on the slot.

146
00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:08.530
Right.

147
00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:11.410
So category to a slot.

148
00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:15.340
So we'll read this page later.

149
00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:19.060
So all the post belongs belonging to this category.

150
00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.540
So here on the anchor down, we want to show the name.

151
00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.470
Category name.

152
00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:25.890
So we move to this category.

153
00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:28.180
So the category name and it is clickable.

154
00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:30.960
All right.

155
00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:31.990
So that's.

156
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:37.680
What we have here in React and Notice.

157
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:42.770
So this post belongs to these two carriers, so we want to have a bit of a space there.

158
00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:45.750
Oh.

159
00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:47.840
So that category in name.

160
00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.740
I think we can just have the special.

161
00:11:59.120 --> 00:11:59.540
Nice.

162
00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:01.940
Beautiful.

163
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.990
Next, let's show the actual content of the post.

164
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:07.820
For that, we have the editor.

165
00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:12.500
So after this beauty and the news editor.

166
00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.750
So Ed, the default value.

167
00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:26.400
It's a different world that's going to be post on content.

168
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.590
I guess that's going to be the value.

169
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.440
We may have to change.

170
00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.870
We may need to access that theme as well.

171
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:46.930
As you can see here, the theme, if we're using the dark theme, then we have to tend to go back.

172
00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:53.300
So let's fix this color.

173
00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:58.700
So based on the theme or whatever, we're using this, we need to change this editor's color.

174
00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:03.260
So for that, we can import the theme context.

175
00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:19.550
The context theme is to make sure we have use context.

176
00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:30.830
And then to start using veterans first, let's make sure we have themes.

177
00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:40.200
All right, I want a theme.

178
00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.140
We can change its value.

179
00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:45.840
So it's our theme.

180
00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.460
Outside stuff a dog.

181
00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:56.150
It's going to be true or false.

182
00:13:56.150 --> 00:14:01.070
So we take team equals, equals equals.

183
00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:09.740
If the team is currently light the reset to turn to false.

184
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:10.820
Otherwise true.

185
00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.110
So if it's like dark would default on be true.

186
00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:16.850
Okay.

187
00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:17.960
So now that works.

188
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:20.690
Okay.

189
00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.770
So it's a loaded slide on its docket stuff.
