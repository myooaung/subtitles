1
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:00.900
All right.

2
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.030
So this is where we left off last time.

3
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:11.030
We have this rich text editor and it's working.

4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:20.700
We have the value that you use it in interests, for example, to hedge one line so you can to we get

5
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.560
the the markdown.

6
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:23.160
All right.

7
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.280
So it will be rendered as as has Tim.

8
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.780
So we got the content.

9
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:34.980
Now next thing we want to have here to create a post is the title, right?

10
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:43.830
So we want to add post title and then here we write the content and then we need to have one dropdown

11
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.060
where we have to show all the categories that we have in our database.

12
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:56.760
So we have to fit all the categories and so them as a dropdown, often a multiple select because they

13
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.970
might want to select more than one category for each post.

14
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.130
So we need to fill the categories as well.

15
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.870
And then finally we're going to implement the featured image features for each post can have a main

16
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.970
image which we can show

17
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.450
as a full width image when we show each post.

18
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.610
And then not only that, we will also be able to embed the images.

19
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.550
So for example, when you're writing an article, you might have to insert many small photos to

20
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.630
go along with your content.

21
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:42.570
So at the moment we don't have the image option, but we need to add a function that will give us this

22
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.890
image option and then basically that function have to upload the images to some our back in server and

23
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:57.660
in return we get the URL and we send that here along with the post that we post can have images along

24
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.100
with the main featured images which we will upload individually.

25
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.520
All right.

26
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.140
So it's going to be pretty awesome.

27
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.970
So let's work on the next option that is showing the title are showing the input field for the first

28
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.270
time.

29
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.500
All right.

30
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.540
So this is a component new post we have in the state content.

31
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.700
Let's add one more.

32
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:28.320
Let's call it title said title equals to use state and by default it's empty.

33
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.010
So for the title, what you're going to do is

34
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:43.500
we going to use the input field, the input component from and we import that and then we put that.

35
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.880
Here.

36
00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.470
There's underneath this.

37
00:02:51.970 --> 00:03:02.950
So this input on change on user type something and we get that event and we can sit in the state.

38
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.790
All right.

39
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.970
Now, what are we going to do is we're not just going to save in the state, but we also need to save

40
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.260
it in the local sewers.

41
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.910
The reason for that is in case the basic kids reload images quickly.

42
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.450
So this is first.

43
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.790
So for example, users typing something in.

44
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.220
Now, when you creating a real post, you may spend so many hours to write a very long post.

45
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:34.720
Now how unfortunate it will be if you somehow close the window, reload the base of some.

46
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.000
Somehow the biscuits reload and if you lose all the content, that would be terrible, right?

47
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.220
So that that's right.

48
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.390
At the moment, if we refresh, I think we have already served it in the local stores.

49
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:47.050
Yes.

50
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.330
You can see here we have saved in the local stores.

51
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.670
We're not actually getting from the local stores, but since it is saved.

52
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.180
Oh, and let me see.

53
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.220
Actually, looks like it's saving.

54
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.570
Let me do it.

55
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:09.280
So what are we going to do with the title and the content we can save in the local stores as well until

56
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.130
we successfully export this and saving the database?

57
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.790
So until then, we're going to save you that way.

58
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.330
If the bins get reloaded, we don't lose any data.

59
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.580
Now, I'll come back to that.

60
00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:26.230
Let me just to work on this one to handle input we in the event.

61
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:32.080
So we're using arrow function here and we're not just going to update this tool, we are also going

62
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.630
to save it in the local service.

63
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.340
So let me use this colleague brace in that here.

64
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.630
Let me use the return.

65
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.160
No, actually, we don't need it.

66
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.600
Cure.

67
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.630
We can just run this code said total event target value.

68
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.920
All right.

69
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.440
And we also wanted to save it in the local storage.

70
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.430
So local stories that said item.

71
00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:02.610
Now this one, let's call it post title just so that it is clear.

72
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.260
It's so confusing.

73
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:10.350
So we save it by the key post title and the value is going to be whatever that is.

74
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:18.300
So this way later we can retrieve this from the local stories if for some reason Biscuits Reloaded or

75
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.080
something like that.

76
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.420
All right, so that's that.

77
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.440
I can give a placeholder to this one as well.

78
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:37.760
And it's a give you give you a post of time.

79
00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:38.990
All right.

80
00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.420
So value on change.

81
00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.090
We've got that next one.

82
00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:52.190
We want to if you want to control the size, you can see this default size.

83
00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:55.070
But if you want to make it big, you have the option.

84
00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:04.190
In InDesign, there is this property called size that you can use in your input component to size.

85
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.290
So it takes a string.

86
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.940
So let's use notice that makes it look slightly bigger.

87
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:13.760
All right.

88
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.930
And then looks like it's all good.

89
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:17.960
Let me just go.

90
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.390
Okay, so that looks good.

91
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.920
If you want to, you can have a bit of a gap there.

92
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.810
So underneath input, you're going to have a line break.

93
00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.520
You may need more than one Lindberg.

94
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.350
Okay then was good.

95
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.990
So that's what the title does for description.

96
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:43.280
Um.

97
00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:44.630
First.

98
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:45.920
First.

99
00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:50.610
Content.

100
00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:51.630
That's.

101
00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:02.320
Posted LeConte as soon as a Typekit to post title by Ryan.

102
00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.250
So as you can see, it is saved here.

103
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:11.710
Now let me turn to the content actually content in there

104
00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.430
that you don't see.

105
00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.490
So let's go Ed on iTunes.

106
00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:18.790
All right.

107
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:22.590
So we are only saving the step.

108
00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:24.220
So let's do the same thing here.

109
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:27.100
Got his card address.

110
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:33.820
And then we're going to have one more line of code that to that will save a lot of stories.

111
00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:38.140
So we're going to call it first content.

112
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:47.060
And the vet is going to see that this time it's going to be the and we execute that.

113
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:48.830
All right.

114
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:53.660
So this way we serve at the same time in the local stories.

115
00:07:53.870 --> 00:08:01.610
Now, if you find it a bit confusing, we have so many things here that probably because I was building

116
00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:04.340
another application and running on the same local host.

117
00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.020
So let me just quickly move on that note.

118
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.510
Let's start from scratch.

119
00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:10.220
All right.

120
00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:16.970
So you can see that's the title and this is the post content.

121
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:21.980
Also, as you can see, we have it saved my favorite phrase.

122
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:25.190
We don't see that.

123
00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:30.680
But luckily, we still have that in the local stories.

124
00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.400
So we can grab it from here and put in the state.

125
00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:49.180
So we can use a function to grab this value from the local stores and populate the state.

126
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:55.360
Now for some reason, sign in to looks like we have to sign in again to let's do that.

127
00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:57.850
So as you can see, things like this can happen.

128
00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:02.140
So that's why we have to sue in the local stores.

129
00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:03.910
So luckily you can see all this.

130
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:09.070
I deleted the off from local stores and that's how we got that issue.

131
00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:12.370
So you can see and that's the benefit.

132
00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:18.110
If something goes wrong, we'll still be able to grab this from local search a little.

133
00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:18.850
We can do that.

134
00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:25.750
So for that, one thing we can do is we can go and try to populate here.

135
00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:29.950
So we can put that on top outside of this component.

136
00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:40.180
Or actually we can even put in take the content component, but put on top to load from local stores.

137
00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:44.630
All right, so let's write a function.

138
00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.870
Let's call it saved title.

139
00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.030
It goes through our function.

140
00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:56.800
So what it will do first is to take you first, start browsing.

141
00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:02.360
We'll make sure we don't get any errors for trying to access the event from global.

142
00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:02.720
So.

143
00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:08.420
So if we take, if we're in the clone set environment, we're going to grab

144
00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:18.810
again we take it if the local store is get item by the name of post title.

145
00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:22.130
So if we have that then we would like to grab that.

146
00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:23.080
Right.

147
00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:28.040
So return local stores, get item postcode.

148
00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:39.800
Now, of course, we need to pass this fairly so we can wrap this and use the decent boss function to

149
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.480
basically do pass function.

150
00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.860
We are passing this entire value as an argument, right?

151
00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:53.060
So this will this function will return the Jason the JavaScript object.

152
00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:56.480
With poor style.

153
00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:59.540
So whatever is there, the poor state of the valley we will get.

154
00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:03.920
And that is very easy to use in our application because we have good, decent bars.

155
00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:12.310
Okay, now let's copy this and do the similar thing for getting the post content.

156
00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.930
Just saved content.

157
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:25.280
I guess we take for the post content and if it is that, we want to get that post content.

158
00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:27.080
All right.

159
00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:32.930
Now, when you execute this function, that will give you that will return you these values.

160
00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:39.550
So we can use these functions as the default value to our states.

161
00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:44.420
So for the token same title, execute that and for content.

162
00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:49.880
Served content execute their.

163
00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:55.460
All right, now let's go have a look here.

164
00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:57.110
Okay.

165
00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:59.030
So I realized what I did wrong.

166
00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.920
So we have this issue.

167
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:08.780
I think that's because when I'm getting the value, I'm using decent pass, which is correct.

168
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:12.430
But when I was saving I didn't use decent string ify.

169
00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:19.190
I think that is the problem because we have to save as this decent data here and you can see it's just

170
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:20.630
plain string here.

171
00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:23.040
So let me fix that.

172
00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:25.250
So let me go here on turns.

173
00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:32.290
When I'm saving in the long stores, this will let me use decent string.

174
00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:32.630
Fine.

175
00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:38.090
So let me grab this and use intuition.

176
00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:40.250
Dog string.

177
00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:40.610
Fine.

178
00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.800
And the string function.

179
00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:50.370
We are passing this value so that will convert it to Jason and saving the local stores.

180
00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:54.380
So that's for the title for the content.

181
00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:55.230
Content.

182
00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:58.040
So content we use this machine for that.

183
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:59.530
Well enough.

184
00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:02.870
This is just for democracy imo that.

185
00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:10.960
So when I'm saving this, also this and storing it.

186
00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:13.300
All right.

187
00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:18.960
So we save the distance between fine and then we retrieve using decent password.

188
00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:23.590
Now it's a it's a book that had me remove the post title.

189
00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:29.900
Post time.

190
00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:31.520
Oh, yes.

191
00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:32.460
Everything is gone.

192
00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:33.960
So if we sign up again.

193
00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:46.080
It's good.

194
00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.100
A new post.

195
00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:48.950
Let's try a new one.

196
00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.820
This is my first.

197
00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:59.690
This is my first post content.

198
00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:03.650
Okay.

199
00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:07.610
So now you can see you have the string here.

200
00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:08.840
That's the key.

201
00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.130
And that's the string.

202
00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:12.030
So looks like this is the right format.

203
00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:18.080
Let's add it first and make sure that it is there and we don't lose.

204
00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:19.880
Okay, so don't lose.

205
00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.950
The content is not.

206
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.170
Now, I think this is due to this component.

207
00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.180
So let me come here.

208
00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:34.760
So this component, it doesn't render.

209
00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:40.560
Oh, kids, we used only ten, but we didn't use the value.

210
00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:46.080
So on this one, I think we can use something called default value.

211
00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:47.830
All right.

212
00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:51.030
So when we use default value

213
00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:54.480
content.

214
00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:02.770
All right, so let's try give her a refresh.

215
00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:11.700
And you can see now we have the value and you can continue adding or delete whatever.

216
00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:13.680
Beautiful.

217
00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:17.720
Awesome.

218
00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:21.560
Okay, so this is great.

219
00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:22.260
Mouse.

220
00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:26.840
For some reason, Biscuits reloaded a user come back after five days.

221
00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:27.500
Doesn't matter.

222
00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:30.260
His post is still there.

223
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:34.550
We didn't say in the database, but it's still saved in the level.

224
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.880
Sorry.

225
00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:41.210
So you can always come back and continue until he click on the publish button.

226
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:48.590
We will keep it in the local stories, but when he published then obviously we will save it in the database

227
00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:50.390
and we can remove from him.
