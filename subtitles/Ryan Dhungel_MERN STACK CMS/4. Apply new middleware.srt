1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:08,410
So we created few mirrors here can create read, can undo delete and can delete media.

2
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:13,740
So let's apply this minimalist goal to post rounds.

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,270
And here.

4
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,680
Immediately where's its imports

5
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:39,350
so we want to import can create read malware, can update, delete post malware and then can delete

6
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:40,940
media anywhere.

7
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:47,660
Again, you may want to copy the name is from here just to avoid any typos.

8
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,090
All right.

9
00:00:50,090 --> 00:01:00,200
So we are still going to use it is admin for few routes, but for most of these routes for post and

10
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,440
media, we are going to use these routes.

11
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:04,040
All right.

12
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,420
So let's come down here.

13
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,580
So the first one is for uploading images.

14
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,200
So for uploading images should be.

15
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:18,000
For.

16
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,600
I guess I'm learning in me.

17
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,800
I think we should all of that.

18
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:29,580
Also to also applaud because you know that he will be creating posts.

19
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:39,880
Obviously he need images so let's send this to let's remove this malware and replace with can create

20
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:48,370
read it and create update create upload images right.

21
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:55,120
So replace is admin with can create these that's first row, second root.

22
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,580
Upload images file.

23
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:05,820
That's.

24
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,790
That's for.

25
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:17,360
The image that goes in the content of the post and this is the actual the featured image I guess of

26
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,390
this one also for both had been altered.

27
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:26,330
So to replace that we can create read for creating post against.

28
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,330
Can't quit read.

29
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,300
It's for everyone.

30
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:30,950
Oh.

31
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,880
Deleting now this one delete will be.

32
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,590
Oh, and this one is can.

33
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:44,060
I did delete post.

34
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:55,390
I should replace that with an updated post it will take for the boosted by ID and the logged in.

35
00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:02,950
He decided to make sure he can delete only his post, not everyone else's, except if he's adamant so

36
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,600
he cannot deleted it.

37
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,140
Post.

38
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:10,000
Same here and media.

39
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,480
Rather to get.

40
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:21,680
I want to get media is I mean this will soon be a tweet read

41
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:31,970
and delete this delete this amount can delete media.

42
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:37,890
All right.

43
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:40,470
No.

44
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,410
Let's go and quickly have a look.

45
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,460
Previously, this user couldn't access the featured images.

46
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,870
All right, so now let's try.

47
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,660
Leaving just few reload.

48
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:06,750
Now you can see here this officer is able to access media library because obviously we have the middleware.

49
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:15,420
We have removed the A-Z middleware and we have replaced with nuance also, so to speak, this one.

50
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:26,810
All right, so let's try creating a post, and I'm pretty sure it works.

51
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,540
Let's open inspect.

52
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:33,860
But please.

53
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,950
Bush created successfully.

54
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,080
So we didn't have the.

55
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:53,730
For some reason we were redirected to home base, probably because we don't have the outposts for awesome.

56
00:04:54,570 --> 00:05:01,830
Oh, actually what happened is when we created a post, we tried to redirect to probably less admin

57
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:12,330
and since this is also how this user was redirected to home base so that it's an easy fix to let's go

58
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:19,250
to our front end now you can see new post component has been used for both admin and other, but after

59
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:23,370
creating the post we want to redirect then different base.

60
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,860
If it is admin will go to class admin.

61
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,170
If it is over, we go to slash.

62
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:28,830
All right.

63
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,470
So it's going to have an.

64
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:38,280
Let's look at the handle submit handle populace.

65
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,310
Around 2% means less post.

66
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,070
So this has to be dynamic.

67
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:49,130
So this is something maybe we can pass as props.

68
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,230
From here.

69
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:51,980
Right.

70
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:06,230
So this new post component let's pass a value based equals to the value author.

71
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,410
So this is used in the author based space.

72
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:10,820
Author.

73
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:12,830
And.

74
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,940
This is also used in admin posts, but we didn't have to make any changes there.

75
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:26,100
So just here we passed this prop base equals to awesome.

76
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:32,550
And then let's go to this component, new post component and here it's going to relate to receive that.

77
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,200
So this structure

78
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:37,860
is all right.

79
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,550
So the value is coming from there as author.

80
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:45,300
But what you want to do is by default you want to give some different value.

81
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,790
So let's say default value is admin.

82
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,770
So by default the base will always be this string admin.

83
00:06:53,340 --> 00:07:03,480
But if we receive some value like this one, then obviously this will be used against a base we sending

84
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,620
off to.

85
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,900
By default it'll be admin, but if we receive authored then that will be used.

86
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:17,010
So let's use this value down here on the root house.

87
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:25,980
So instead of targeting the admin, we can use that variable base like let solution just put it back

88
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,390
ticks.

89
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,930
Malibu tends to

90
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,230
bass.

91
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:39,480
So by default bass is equals to admin.

92
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:40,840
That's the default value.

93
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:44,860
So it will be less admin, less boost by default.

94
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:51,790
But whenever this component is used in auto layout, the base will be awesome.

95
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,660
So in that case it will render it to authors less posts.

96
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,940
Okay, so let's try it.

97
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,070
Let's try creating one more.

98
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:16,400
Also optional often gets

99
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,000
redirected.

100
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:34,400
All right, let's.

101
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,350
It's fabulous.

102
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:41,830
And this time.

103
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:46,750
You can see I'm redirected to less offers, less post.

104
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:51,690
So I listed this phase doesn't exist, but at the moment you can see it's working perfectly with.

105
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,150
We were not redirected to home base like before.

106
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,170
Awesome.
