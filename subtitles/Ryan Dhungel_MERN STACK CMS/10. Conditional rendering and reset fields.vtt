WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:07.560
So we have the sign out link, which we can show to the user if the user's logged in to this for the

2
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.310
logged in user.

3
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.540
And this admin desk for this link is also for the logged in youth.

4
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:22.780
So these two links, the admin and the signer can be we can put in a block, so let's cut and put instead

5
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.510
of fragment.

6
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.490
So you can see we have two blocks this block sign out and the admin we can show this for the logged

7
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:38.200
in user and this is for not log to new sign up and same links.

8
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.490
All right.

9
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:46.560
So now we can use the oath from the context which we already have here and we take for the user.

10
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.400
So if the user is not by default, it is known if we don't have to logged new.

11
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.260
So if it is not, then we want to show the sign of intent.

12
00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:09.550
But if it is not known, then we saw this a let me just grab inside calling this, all right.

13
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:18.120
And then we tick off and all start user equals equals equals not.

14
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.380
All right.

15
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.090
So that means.

16
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.490
And then we can just put it in a bracket.

17
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.370
By the way, if you have the PTA plug in, it will order for medical.

18
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.050
So you can tell you if we have got an autism.

19
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.800
Then if the art user equals sequence equals non end.

20
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.800
I missed the end paren.

21
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:56.620
I guess it should be like this if we have the art of user and art, user equals equals circles not we

22
00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.490
don't have the user.

23
00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.480
In that case we saw this kind of in ten scheme to try.

24
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.480
So let's try logging.

25
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.770
So once you log in, it will not be not user will not be known.

26
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.170
And that time we should see this one.

27
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.100
Let's see how they're doing.

28
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.760
Fine.

29
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.770
And in of.

30
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.910
You can see here once we logged in, user is not known.

31
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.940
It has the value.

32
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.500
So those links don't show up here.

33
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:28.370
Nice.

34
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.410
All right.

35
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:37.970
Now that there is a certain if you don't like to use this and all the time, because some things can

36
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.460
get quite long, they're the easiest index, which is something like this.

37
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.210
Oh, what.

38
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.150
Don't use it.

39
00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.510
I a this is also a sim equivalent to what we had before.

40
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.390
So if we have the US then question but only then we try to access the user.

41
00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.850
Because by default when the application loads for the very first time that the component is ready,

42
00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:08.720
that then we may not have the context of our level already, it might take a few milliseconds.

43
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:09.170
Right.

44
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.680
So to avoid the error, we can take like this.

45
00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.490
If we have the US, then we access the user and then we compare.

46
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.710
If it is normal, then we saw this.

47
00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:21.290
It works.

48
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.830
That's good.

49
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.360
Now, let's do something similar for this one as well.

50
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.690
Let me just wrap.

51
00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.450
So this one we take off.

52
00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:32.750
What don't you use?

53
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:34.570
Not equal signature.

54
00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:35.420
Not this time.

55
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.490
Before it was.

56
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.680
And let me make sure I wrap it in the parentheses.

57
00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.870
Sorry.

58
00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.080
Yeah, but I missed the end.

59
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.160
And if you have the 3D plugin here to learn the format.

60
00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.320
Now you said this time previously, I think if it is not this time, take me.

61
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.310
If it is not not.

62
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.190
If it is not, not it.

63
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.170
If we have to use it, then we should.

64
00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.900
I you can see we have the users who we have seen this turn out in desperate need.

65
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.910
If you sign up, then you saw the sign up inside.

66
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.990
Beautiful.

67
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.030
So that's how we do conditional rendering.

68
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.070
Now we just need to fix these.

69
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.170
We need to align them properly so that we can use some class names here.

70
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:41.410
I think we can use margin lift order class sizes so we can put that here in this sub menu.

71
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:52.020
Actually it's not so many, it's the menu item, so we can try putting it on the first link.

72
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.720
Sign up so we can put that.

73
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.030
Let's play right here.

74
00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.780
Start

75
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.680
Amazon Left

76
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.800
Auto.

77
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.510
You see, we applied that thesis to the menu item.

78
00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.860
Let's have a look.

79
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.780
Right.

80
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.160
So that that works.

81
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.700
We have the sign up and sign in aligned to the right and beautiful.

82
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.710
And let's do something similar

83
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.820
for the user.

84
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:31.000
So we should put sign out probably at the end.

85
00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.570
So let me just put that plus name on this one.

86
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.580
Menu item, group sub menu, that is.

87
00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.150
I said you just put here.

88
00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.890
Martin left.

89
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:44.380
Okay.

90
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.760
So you told him Mozilla left.

91
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.630
All is under here.

92
00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:52.450
All we need to do is just move this got put it after this one.

93
00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:57.780
All right, let's try.

94
00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.060
Okay, so I'm signing.

95
00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.930
Let's sign in.

96
00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.200
This time it's going to be full.

97
00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:05.760
This takes.

98
00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.300
And because will we sign in and sign out?

99
00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:10.030
Quite a lot.

100
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.670
So let me just go to sign.

101
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:12.940
Okay.

102
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:19.720
So this is a good opportunity to show you since we're using this and isn't from component.

103
00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.660
We didn't even have to have our own state.

104
00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:23.650
Right.

105
00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.270
So how do you actually put the initial value here?

106
00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.190
So that is something I can sue.

107
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.710
That is initial states.

108
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.660
We can put that here in a set of values.

109
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:54.090
Email Ryan and G-mail dot com and password.

110
00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:02.200
This is something you can do if you want to pre-filled your components.

111
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:03.800
Okay.

112
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.160
Actually, it's not a lot.

113
00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:11.790
I can see it's working.

114
00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:15.950
But, Basil, you don't see realistically.

115
00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:16.670
All right.

116
00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:20.070
Beautiful.

117
00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.110
So that way, when we're developing it, it's nice and easy to

118
00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:29.970
use the sign in quickly.

119
00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:32.820
And you can see when you send me, you see the desperate issues.

120
00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:34.380
Sign up, beautiful.

121
00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:41.640
Now I want to take this opportunity to show you one more thing, and that is, how do you remove the

122
00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:42.750
initial values?

123
00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:48.690
At the moment, it's not important because when we sign in, we redo it the user.

124
00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.060
So we don't have to worry about empty the fields.

125
00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:58.170
But in some situations you may want to know how to do that using and isn't from component, right?

126
00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:09.690
So that is something you can do using the form ref and that is something sometimes if we need to get

127
00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:14.460
deep into some some of these components, you know, let's take out the documentation so it's good to

128
00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:19.480
form and the digital information you will find.

129
00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:23.220
What are the props you can use, things like that.

130
00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.140
You can always come down to the very end.

131
00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:30.000
It may make it makes it easier to it.

132
00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:34.260
And you can see the initial values.

133
00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:41.550
This that's how we could use you could use an object, oh, we can reset using this form.

134
00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:45.390
So let me show you some of the examples this should have.

135
00:08:51.930 --> 00:09:02.730
From the reset that they've gone and reset and you see some it reset that empties.

136
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.860
So let's see how this is working.

137
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:05.820
So let's come here.

138
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:16.560
So they have the farm component and this one has this farm property they have used.

139
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:26.100
And that farm is you can see using this used farm hook to access this farm property and then farm state

140
00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.410
and then you use that.

141
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:35.310
And that gives us this function called reset field to use that to reset the the fields, make it to

142
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:35.670
empty.

143
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:36.030
All right.

144
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:39.990
So let's see how we can use that to use this hook.

145
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.050
It's gone here.

146
00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.300
And to give it a try.

147
00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:52.970
Let's not redirect the user in just so that we can see this is just for this extra.

148
00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:56.570
But you may find it very useful in some situations.

149
00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:05.180
So from first to you go to the form and then this queues from form.

150
00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:11.030
Now it is this form is coming from that is coming from the hook, which we can just put here that we

151
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:11.690
just copied.

152
00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:12.110
All right.

153
00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:19.010
So far we destructor from from this fun component, and that gives us this useful function.

154
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:23.720
All right, so that phone we're using right here.

155
00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:29.960
Now we can use this phone instead of from the post.

156
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:33.710
Let's use from that reset fields.

157
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:42.320
I guess if you do this when the logging is successful, instead of redirecting the user, we leave them

158
00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.070
on the same page.

159
00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:47.330
We just empty the fields so they are ready to be filled again.

160
00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:58.820
Said This is something you may have to do in some situations, so we have the initial values.

161
00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:08.220
So let's try a little logging successfully logged in and the initial values to hit there.

162
00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:12.690
That's still there because I hardcoded this one to let me remember that.

163
00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:15.950
Let me just comment that on.

164
00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:22.520
Because if it is hardcoded, I think it's always stated.

165
00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:24.890
But if not.

166
00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:34.540
In a situation like this where you use a fill out log and then you want to empty the phone.

167
00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:40.810
So in that case, you can see successfully sign in that those values are gone.

168
00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:51.400
Now, if we didn't have that good, if we didn't have this one citizen in this common that this is just

169
00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:52.270
a demonstration.

170
00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:52.850
All right.

171
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:56.080
So let's try Ryan and Jim and go, Glenn.

172
00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:02.160
He can be successful, but it stays there.

173
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:07.280
So in a situation like that where you want to keep the user in the same place.

174
00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:10.310
What do you want to reset the phone values then?

175
00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.740
This is how you can do it.

176
00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:14.480
Reset fruit for that to use.

177
00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:19.520
Obviously, you have to put the phone and that phone comes from here.

178
00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:20.590
Okay.

179
00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:21.500
So that's extra.

180
00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.710
Let me just comment that I'll leave it.

181
00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:26.100
I'm just going to comment them.

182
00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:26.570
Right.

183
00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:33.140
So if you need, you can always look back to this code and implement that.

184
00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:40.130
So at the moment I'm just coming out here, here and here.

185
00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:49.100
I guess it should work the way it was working before and like how I was doing it then.

186
00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:55.640
Just put these different values so that it's nice and easy for us to log in each and every time we have

187
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:57.050
to see this phone.

188
00:12:58.100 --> 00:12:58.520
Beautiful.
