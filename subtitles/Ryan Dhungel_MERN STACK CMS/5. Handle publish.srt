1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,810
All right, now let's work on that button.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:08,430
So we want to show that button underneath the categories.

3
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,330
One of the characters we could that preview button.

4
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,380
Let me just copy that.

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,760
And put it underneath this select.

6
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,570
So this button.

7
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:37,820
I will execute suited me use type primary and on click we can execute a function.

8
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,260
Let's call it handle.

9
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:48,900
And Summit helicopters and turns the port name to focus.

10
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,350
Okay, so let's create this function.

11
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:00,390
Let's put it right in the top of region const and of this async.

12
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:08,350
I'm guessing that Barton looks like that.

13
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:08,930
Beautiful.

14
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:15,080
Okay, so here, what you want to do is we want to make a request to beg, and we don't have the root

15
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,250
and control function, and we don't even have to push the schema.

16
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,660
But that's all easy.

17
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:22,010
We have already done.

18
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,060
The difficult part of that is authentication.

19
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,770
Now, everything that's going to be pretty straightforward.

20
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,080
It's not easy, but it will be straightforward.

21
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:31,760
Accounts error.

22
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:36,740
Control of the air.

23
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,690
Obviously, we control the dust notification rules.

24
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:47,900
And it's true that dust and let's suppose we fail and try again.

25
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,160
Let's make sure we have the toasts important.

26
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,040
We are not toast, so we import toast.

27
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,830
And it's school bag.

28
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:11,620
So in this function, what we want to do is we want to make a request.

29
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:20,360
Using Axios 90 seconds data equals two point excuse to post.

30
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,600
We make a post request to the endpoint.

31
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,470
To create a post we can call it.

32
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,590
Let's call it just create post.

33
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:31,250
Okay.

34
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,460
And then that's the first I went to this post function.

35
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,960
Second argument is the actual download that we have to post, right?

36
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:44,470
So in this case we want to send the title content and categories.

37
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:45,740
Beautiful.

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,790
I guess the lesson that we're sending now and we will be sending the error message.

39
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:55,620
So this is a generic error, but we want to show the agony.

40
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,180
So send the actual error to use it.

41
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:58,570
All right.

42
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:05,020
So if something if the title is empty, if there is no content in the body or if there is no category,

43
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,430
things like that, we can sin.

44
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:12,430
So we can only take for the date of that error because even though that error will you sending as a

45
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,500
response decent data.

46
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,250
Right.

47
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,950
So we have to take if data error dorst error dotted an error.

48
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:25,460
Again.

49
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:40,350
Let's just use this operative, because sometimes you might get an error saying that error cannot be

50
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:46,140
accessed from undefined because if the data is not there and we try to access error, then you might

51
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:50,430
get some weird error message.

52
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,630
So let's take that.

53
00:03:52,470 --> 00:04:00,150
Otherwise I think otherwise what we can do is we can set the dose notification and then once we saw

54
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:07,110
that push notification, we can empty the fields in listed the total set empty content to empty our

55
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,600
categories again and to be empty every.

56
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:16,910
All right, so we do that and we also want to make sure that we empty them from the local stories.

57
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:17,180
Right.

58
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,330
So that's also important.

59
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:24,520
Now if you are redirecting the user to another base, for example.

60
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,190
This is the bush create base.

61
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:35,020
So once the admin create the post, if you want to redirect him to all the posts here in this place,

62
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:42,100
then in that case he doesn't actually have to empty leave out empty because he can just open that.

63
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,440
And in our case, that's what we're going to do.

64
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,800
We're going to redirect them to the all post office.

65
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:48,180
All right.

66
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:51,280
So I'm not going to use this.

67
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:59,590
Instead, I'm going to remove the title and content from local stories because if remember, we have

68
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,660
been we have been saving this in the local stories.

69
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:07,900
So if it is successfully saved in the database, then obviously we don't have to keep it in the local

70
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,350
storage.

71
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,970
So so we can remove.

72
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:10,450
Right.

73
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:11,230
So.

74
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:20,940
Local stories don't remove item by the name or title, and then local stories as a move item by the

75
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,680
name of post content.

76
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:23,820
All right.

77
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:30,770
Letting everybody vote and being the state, local state here, because we're going to redirect

78
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:38,720
redirect so that redirect and is now function like that.

79
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,720
Rather don't post.

80
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,760
We will post them to admins class posts.

81
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,110
It's.

82
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,130
Okay.

83
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,610
Now let me comment them for the moment.

84
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:05,250
At the moment until we I can confirm that everything has been successfully in the back council.

85
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,000
Long

86
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:09,570
post.

87
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,520
We postponed this.

88
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,990
Response, I guess.

89
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:21,240
Let me have a look at the response before I do anything here, Donna.

90
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:28,980
Now, since we're using robbery, let's make sure we have the aurora, okay?

91
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,820
So we don't have.

92
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:35,730
And sometimes Vsco tries to automatically import and you can see it is importing from the server which

93
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:36,430
is not for.

94
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:40,440
So sometimes you might get some weird errors because of things like this one.

95
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,880
And same with the reader.

96
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:48,150
If I by mistake or trade raven it tried to import from somewhere.

97
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:56,610
Like you said it's in the wild that import use the Aurora hook from next.

98
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:58,530
Then we're going to use that

99
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,710
from Strada to use and run.

100
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,240
We just execute that.

101
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:14,910
That gives us this freedom and we can use to push to redirect the user.

102
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:20,430
I could have common them out for now, just one to have a at the console.

103
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,070
Now, of course we don't even have this end point.

104
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:29,160
So our next task is to go to the back and create the root, create the control function.

105
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:35,220
And before we do anything in the controller function, we have to make sure we have the push the schema

106
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:35,610
as well.

107
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:36,270
All right.

108
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,730
So we'll be doing that in the next.

109
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,080
Let me just make sure.

110
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:43,980
So far so good.

111
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,040
Here, use wrong.

112
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,610
That's a bit weird.

113
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,660
Oh, kiss and mix this.

114
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:54,950
Right.

115
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:55,890
That's me.

116
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:03,710
Okay.

117
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:04,580
Perfect.
