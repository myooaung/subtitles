1
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:01.080
All right.

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.290
So let's go ahead and create the author layout.

3
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.320
So we're going to start with the NEF first.

4
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.940
So we need the navigation.

5
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.800
Do so on the side, right, like this one.

6
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.160
So you can see here we have the admin nav.

7
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:22.470
Now a lot of these links, navigation links we can reuse, for example, post media is pretty much we

8
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.760
can use for off as well.

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.890
The only things we're not going to make the auto available is the is the users.

10
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.630
Actually just the users in the comments are too lazy to be able to work on this one.

11
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.640
Media Post will be available off as well.

12
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.970
So let's copy this cool admin that could a new find.

13
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:59.280
Let's call it out for now and this question tends to often open nav.

14
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:11.720
And all the things he has so often that I guess let's go through the navigation menu.

15
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.280
So we have the dashboard.

16
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.480
It takes the user to add new drug night routines to awesome.

17
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.190
You.

18
00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.810
Ten.

19
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.190
That offer is still intact.

20
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.560
So the same name desk will like this one.

21
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.980
Same name, but it will take to a different base.

22
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:48.190
The Post, we saw that the posts we take to all those posts, we have to create all these spaces one

23
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.550
by one.

24
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.100
This one will be sent to the post office.

25
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.760
Less post.

26
00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.690
You can see the name will be sent in just the links with since it is meant to offer

27
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.310
to create a new post, which is that here we change.

28
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.980
He could do fine and replace as well.

29
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:35.870
Also, so post and categories will be available for author as well as admin to all of that comment.

30
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.260
We still have to work to use the six and we will not be for.

31
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.520
So let me just remove.

32
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.770
Profile profiles can be used for.

33
00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.630
Obviously for our fans, what would we have to change this admin profile?

34
00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.130
We haven't worked on it yet.

35
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.970
We'll work.

36
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.930
Pretty sure we have two of them this time.

37
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.310
Yes, we have more.

38
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.360
I guess we'll come back to that.

39
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.310
And customisation option will be only for the admin.

40
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.020
So that.

41
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.470
Awesome.

42
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:29.340
So we just removed from link some links from here, some navigation menus, and then we changed all

43
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.880
that out from admin to awesome.

44
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.810
So that's awesome that now we can use this nav in the layout.

45
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.670
So let's go ahead, clear the layout as well.

46
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.620
So we have the admin layout.

47
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.700
We can just copy that.

48
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.560
Copy that.

49
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.750
Create a new file of.

50
00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:54.530
Layout is based here since the name of the layout.

51
00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.470
It's going to change the name of the layout.

52
00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:07.430
Now here, only a few changes will require, for example, the NAV with no way to input off and no write

53
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.170
off.

54
00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.190
And now from.

55
00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.110
Nev, Arthur and Nev.

56
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.380
So we import the navigation then.

57
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.690
We have two things the function.

58
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.630
Get current admin bulletins to get current offer, which is right here.

59
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.700
Get current lists in the.

60
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:43.210
And the only thing we need to change is change the endpoint from current admin to current.

61
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:53.320
What you saw in the few few videos earlier, we created this route which will take if the user has the

62
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.100
role of awesome.

63
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.550
If it has, then we give the response.

64
00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:58.500
Okay, true.

65
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.000
Otherwise we get the error response.

66
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.360
All right.

67
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.690
So if we've got the error, we redirect them to home page.

68
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:13.240
Otherwise they can access whatever component we're trying to search whatever base which will be received

69
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.320
at that process.

70
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:16.780
I guess that looks good.

71
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.270
Now, one more thing we have to do here.

72
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:24.280
That is the the now to know.

73
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:26.710
So when we return.

74
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:36.390
We saw the name on the sidebar and then the content.

75
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.380
Okay, so we got author navigation auto layout as well.

76
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.630
Now let's go ahead, create a base using the author layout and let's see how this works.

77
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:58.830
Actually, it's one more thing here, and that is if the user is also when they click here, we should

78
00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.530
take them to the author base.

79
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.830
Right?

80
00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:07.440
So we have to take in our navigation, take for the root.

81
00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:09.090
So let's.

82
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:12.200
Um.

83
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.940
Let's go to.

84
00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.660
Now.

85
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:26.840
DUBNER So here we have the decimal.

86
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.880
It has the rule based link.

87
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.500
I think we already did before.

88
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:32.560
Oh, that's good.

89
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:33.320
We already did.

90
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:38.260
So if the users through is admin, we return to admin otherwise of Okta.

91
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:38.790
That's good.

92
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.280
We'll have that too.

93
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.400
Let's give it a try to decipher the layout by using it.

94
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:49.610
Let's create a new base here, not a scrutiny folder.

95
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:51.350
Awesome.

96
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:57.050
And yeah, as you can see, admin has the posts and carry goodies.

97
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:05.320
So although we like to have the post in categories, functions, even a media answer.

98
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.680
Let's create 1/1 indicator to use.

99
00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:18.180
And here, let me just copy the call from admin index again just to make this a bit easier.

100
00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:25.110
You can see it's basically just a layer we have to copy close go to offer index based here.

101
00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.210
Change the name from admin to awesome.

102
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.650
And I mean to the.

103
00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:44.530
We introduce you to the essential additional event images in the layout admin layout.

104
00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:45.880
Let's change this to.

105
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:56.570
Often they aren't.

106
00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.680
This is also a phase.

107
00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:03.650
So it's.

108
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.180
Why do we have that?

109
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:16.630
Admin layout.

110
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:20.410
Is that also learnt from.

111
00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:27.590
Okay.

112
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:32.270
So we offer layout, we wrap this content using that layout.

113
00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.040
Let's see how this works.

114
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:37.500
So this user is added.

115
00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:43.430
So we take them to this and industrialists fan out and let's.

116
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:48.630
We have to try manually making one user answer.

117
00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:54.690
At the moment I actually know that slogan has admitted this uses admin.

118
00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:54.950
Right?

119
00:08:58.210 --> 00:08:58.630
Okay.

120
00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:05.910
Actually, we still don't have the functionality where admin can update the user writes admin can create

121
00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.600
a user and give the role.

122
00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:09.060
Awesome.

123
00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:09.730
Right.

124
00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:13.180
So yeah, I didn't include a user.

125
00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:14.260
Give the role of author.

126
00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:20.730
However, once the user is created, we cannot edit because we don't have the list of you just shared.

127
00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.690
That is something next.

128
00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:28.990
We'll obviously implement that, but at the moment, let me just quit on the user.

129
00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:31.250
Um.

130
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:32.180
I enough.

131
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:44.010
It's not a vanity mill.

132
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:45.210
I'm just going to use it.

133
00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:46.200
Yeah.

134
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:56.670
So Pastor, I'm just going to sing Blockbuster, make him offer.

135
00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:57.540
This is important.

136
00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:02.940
Make the user account and create this new user so that we can log in as the author and see how this

137
00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.590
works and this assignment.

138
00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:06.360
Okay.

139
00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:13.290
User created successfully so this user can log in with the password.

140
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:18.330
Set out its log in and also.

141
00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:22.350
Beautiful.

142
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:25.650
Now you can see here now we are logged in as author.

143
00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:32.640
This user has the role of author and the author has this dashboard which looks similar, but there are

144
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.670
few options available for other.

145
00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:36.980
All right.

146
00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.350
Two beautiful antique.

147
00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.360
We are redirected to author based.

148
00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:45.040
Now we're going to

149
00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.930
implement all this feature for as.

150
00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:58.660
Now it's going to be very easy because you already saw we have already moved the add new core all the

151
00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:05.450
core from that was used to create a new post or add new.

152
00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:11.950
At the moment we don't have the base for answer, but it's it's really easy because if you go have a

153
00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:22.750
look at spaces admin posts new you can see you just need to create, use the other layout and use this

154
00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:25.960
component which will enable you to create a new post.

155
00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.520
It's pretty straightforward.

156
00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:33.880
Okay, so some components might need a bit of for extra work, but otherwise it's not going to be massively

157
00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:41.920
to do much work because we're going to reuse a lot of those existing code and make things easier like

158
00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.700
this to implement everything.

159
00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:49.120
Because all this we have already done except comments and profile.
