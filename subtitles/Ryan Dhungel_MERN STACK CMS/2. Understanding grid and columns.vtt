00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:00.580
Okay.

2
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:07.620
So now we're going to create this sign of form using the and designed to form component.

3
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.580
And if you have a look at the finished product, let's have a look.

4
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.640
So it's basically it's a British standard from the one you saw here as an example.

5
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:26.490
So when we are building this form, we will also learn how to use the rows and columns to create a responsive

6
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.060
layout.

7
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.080
All right,

8
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.700
so let's have it good in our code editor.

9
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.180
It's good to sign up in here.

10
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:49.230
First thing you want to import some components from and so that we have this grid system, right?

11
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.640
So we need to send to the content center to the form right in the middle of the page.

12
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.360
We want to have some space on both side.

13
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:05.010
So to create such layout, if you've got if you know how to use bootstrap, you may know you know the

14
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:05.520
columns.

15
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.710
Andrew So we're going to use the similar concept.

16
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.420
However, with and design it has the growing default column grid.

17
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.420
I say in bootstrap we usually have 12 column grid with and it has 24 column to it.

18
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:19.890
Let me quickly show you that.

19
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.100
It's quite important we'd.

20
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.690
And as you can see, it's taking full with you.

21
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.330
It's taking the focal hemisphere its entire role.

22
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.770
And then you have the columns.

23
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.770
You can see it's a colon will take the full width column, 12 and 12 altogether.

24
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.670
It becomes 24, 24 column.

25
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.930
So eight, eight through the 24 or you can use six for the 24.

26
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.360
So it's 24 column crude.

27
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.920
All right.

28
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.230
So we're going to use you can take out some examples of columns in rows.

29
00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.350
And basically we use the rows into rows.

30
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.100
We have column depending on how many column you want everyone to fill with column.

31
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.180
Then you use this one, spend 24.

32
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.260
Now if you want half up, then you do span 12 and you have the two columns slender.

33
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:16.660
So you have three.

34
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.450
You have four.

35
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.470
This is the example.

36
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:19.100
All right.

37
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.250
So we're going to use the column in rows to create the grid.

38
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.110
Since coming to our base.

39
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.850
It's come here and it's input.

40
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:36.270
Column and rose row form and.

41
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.620
So once you had Mitt, let's replace this deep with through.

42
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.190
So we will have room.

43
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.830
INTERVIEWER We will have color.

44
00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.430
All right.

45
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.710
So I want to center this phone in the middle of the base.

46
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:56.290
So, caller.

47
00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.400
We have a column here.

48
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:12.050
Let me just provide a sign up, by the way, and then come through the typography as well.

49
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.470
So for general use, we can discontinue using heads.

50
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.930
One has to up to head six paragraph.

51
00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:18.590
We can do that.

52
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.370
But I will show you later some time how to use the typography from the end design as well.

53
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.030
It's pretty cool.

54
00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.360
All right, so we got this heading.

55
00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.610
It's called 24.

56
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.080
So if you come have a look, you don't see any changes staying the full width.

57
00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.050
Now let's try attending that.

58
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.190
So let's change that.

59
00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:51.740
Do let's use eight columns times three, so column span eight and then offset offset eight.

60
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.650
So both side we would have offset eight in it.

61
00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.040
So that 16 gone and in the middle we'll have eight.

62
00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:06.590
So but altogether it would be 24 would say it at eight, that's 16 and in the centre eight total 20.

63
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.380
The food coming here.

64
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:16.520
You see, you notice that we have the column hit on the right, so left and another on the right and

65
00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.110
then you have the content in the middle?

66
00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.400
I guess so.

67
00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:21.200
That's good.

68
00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:23.360
We've got the layout now.

69
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.530
So we got a sign up.

70
00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.650
Maybe we want to have some padding on top.

71
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:33.480
Yeah, let's have some.

72
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.210
Style padding top.

73
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.150
Let's say hundred things.

74
00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.980
We want to have fun here.

75
00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:57.710
For that, we're going to use the end designs from example in the scoop back again from.
