1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,050
Also a good disputable form on submit.

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:05,940
You can see this form.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,990
You need to make sure you have this content on submit.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,940
We have the so unfinished.

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,200
We have the unfinished function.

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,660
We can call it anything else we like, but let's continue using this one on the finish.

7
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,350
So I'm finishing in here.

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,080
X is all the values that the user entered in this form using values.

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,660
So let's have a look at this from the let's see what we get.

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:45,620
So Ryan emailed Ryan and then we start getting some misses.

11
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,460
If I hit submit, I get name, email and miss it.

12
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:50,090
Beautiful.

13
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,780
So this information we want to send to the back end so that we can.

14
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,880
So we can send an email.

15
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:56,840
Right, beautiful.

16
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,100
So what we can do here is we can make a request.

17
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:07,310
We don't have the routing controller yet, but let's write it here and then we can go and work on this,

18
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,930
you know, make.

19
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:11,570
So I'm finished.

20
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:16,190
What I want to do is first the shoes dry.

21
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:18,800
We don't have dry.

22
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:33,540
Let's make a request using excuse that to use a good stoop and wait excuse to get so it gets pushed.

23
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:38,290
We're sending this information, this context.

24
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:40,720
We have to create this endpoint called contact.

25
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:47,380
And here we are giving the values or whatever we got from the phone that values re sending that could

26
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,120
be name email and Mrs..

27
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:57,730
All right and then we have to apply some validation as and say if not added error if we receive any

28
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:04,150
kind of error message we can show that those dots and Donna.

29
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:15,310
And otherwise, if there was not issues, then we can show the success message to success successfully.

30
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,170
Let's call it.

31
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,000
Your message has been sent.

32
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:27,210
Okay.

33
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:35,520
And then we want to reset the field says so in the form has been submitted all this information and

34
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,320
you don't want to just leave them there.

35
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,660
So you want to clear them.

36
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:45,700
So for that, we can use a form for that to work.

37
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,900
Of course, you need to have this this important file.

38
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,370
And this from where does it come from?

39
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:56,050
This comes from the hook called use.

40
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,360
So let's use that as well.

41
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:09,700
Context distracts from the array from equals to from component don't use from.

42
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:16,420
So this is how you access the fun in and event form you give that value.

43
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:16,960
Yeah.

44
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:17,710
From.

45
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,400
So from.

46
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:24,720
Okay.

47
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,080
That way you'll be able to access the form.

48
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,200
And then we have that.

49
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,530
And then we can use the reset fields to reset all the the fields of this.

50
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,150
That's fulfilling.

51
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:44,580
Now let's work on the loading as well.

52
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,890
So when the function executes first thing we do set lowering to true.

53
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,400
If we get an error such loading to false.

54
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:04,320
If we get the success message that also set loading to false because there's no point showing loading

55
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:04,770
anymore.

56
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:10,500
If we get the errors that set learned to false which were other to happen.

57
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:11,130
Beautiful.

58
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:16,590
So I think that's all we need to hear now.

59
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,080
At the moment if you try our mistake don't want.

60
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,620
We get the error messages.

61
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,240
Let's change that error, Mrs..

62
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,950
Give me a felt tray.

63
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:43,510
All right.

64
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,200
So.

65
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:49,300
Now let's have a look at the network dev contact headers.

66
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,700
We're making requests.

67
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:51,850
Less contact.

68
00:04:53,260 --> 00:05:00,160
We sending the payload of email messages and name stats for food later, trying to access this in the

69
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,860
backend so that we can send an email.
