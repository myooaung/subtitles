1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:00,870
All right.

2
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:07,950
So the next thing we want to implement here is add the social sphere feature.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:13,680
So we have the post and let me take you to the finished version.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:22,590
So if it's good post, so if you visit any site, you see that we have the options to share on social

5
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:23,160
networks.

6
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:34,140
For example, if I click on Facebook, that will grab this link and share on Facebook, I know you can

7
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:34,530
see here.

8
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:48,930
So for that, what we can do is we can use this package from NPM and boom let's search for react there

9
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:49,410
shows.

10
00:00:59,020 --> 00:00:59,410
Answer.

11
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:00,790
This is the one of you to use.

12
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,050
Check out the demo.

13
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,130
I guess that's the term.

14
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,600
All right, so let's insert this one.

15
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,910
In our current project.

16
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,440
Let's run this.

17
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,340
And while it's happening, that's cool.

18
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,910
So we want to show those social sphere options in our base.

19
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:47,700
We were showing the single poster good places post slow and we want to show them and let's show them

20
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,280
just under the heading.

21
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,990
So we have the heading matter content and here we can sort.

22
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,540
Thanks to right here.

23
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,600
So let's go.

24
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,440
So we have the written block.

25
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:10,670
We have the the heading, we have the meta information, we have the content just before the content.

26
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:11,870
We can do so here.

27
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:17,450
Okay.

28
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,210
Let's import

29
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,850
import here.

30
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,630
So?

31
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:28,820
So from the act, sir.

32
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:29,370
So soon.

33
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:36,060
And it's come down here.

34
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:53,860
So here we want to let screw to do a screw to div let's have a bit of a margin on top margin top if

35
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,060
you have a big gap.

36
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:56,420
I guess.

37
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:03,380
So let me just and during a piece of this how I did it earlier turn a big sell and margin bottom.

38
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,230
15.

39
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,110
We can only change these venues.

40
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:13,090
Let's see how this looks so here, says Shorten.

41
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:17,150
Do we want to use this in here?

42
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,340
The first thing we want to do is give the URL.

43
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:24,290
So when you want to sit on any of the social networks, we have to give them the URL.

44
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:28,400
Now the yellow should be the current URL, right?

45
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:32,000
So at the moment when we try to share local host, obviously it doesn't work.

46
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:39,020
Because localhost runs in our computer locally, it's not on the Internet, it's not available on the

47
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:39,320
web.

48
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:46,070
But it's later when you deploy this application and have a real domain, then obviously you can share

49
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:46,270
this.

50
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:46,970
Okay.

51
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,380
Otherwise, at the moment, if you said obviously people want the big they don't get anywhere.

52
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:56,090
So we need to grab the quarantine URL, right?

53
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:02,130
So we can do that using window that looks and it has to work.

54
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:07,310
Now before we try to access that, let's make sure we are in the client environment since we're using

55
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:10,610
Nexis so we can take processed start.

56
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,920
Brazil and.

57
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:25,070
Persistent rise and windowed dark location, dark highchair.

58
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,930
I said that will give us the current year.

59
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:39,210
Next one is so-so types, so we can choose on what platforms you want to share.

60
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,740
So for example, if you want on Facebook, you can just leave Facebook.

61
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,000
You can just leave it like that.

62
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:53,160
But we want to share other platforms like Twitter already and LinkedIn.

63
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:58,040
All right.

64
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,830
So that's social types and that is all we need.

65
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,880
We just need the euro.

66
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:07,350
And so sometimes if you come here, let's run the south.

67
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:19,390
And we may need to adjust some styling the height and width, but otherwise should work.

68
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:28,900
Okay.

69
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,770
So we have modern, not found causes.

70
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,250
Let's make sure we improve the right way.

71
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,380
First result from React shows.

72
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,580
I could not find a declaration.

73
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,690
Five Amodu.

74
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,630
Kind of friend of mine.

75
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:03,770
You.

76
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,240
Not sure why it's happening.

77
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,240
Maybe we have to into causes to try to ensure that.

78
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:40,990
Beautiful.

79
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:49,000
You can see we have the icons now since we're using the dark theme.

80
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,490
Because they have this by default.

81
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,370
And so we should change that.

82
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:03,160
But otherwise you can see you can copy the current euro beautiful code refactoring editor to this the

83
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:03,620
slow.

84
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,870
If you visit another post.

85
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,070
Let's try this one.

86
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,440
You can see the other changes.

87
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,360
So that's perfect.

88
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,990
We can copy and here or we can just click here and there.

89
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:26,780
Right now, it doesn't work at the moment because the local hosts you can't use.

90
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:34,850
So we getting the invalid here but when you have the real domain in proximity to block no we don't want

91
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,470
to show this field.

92
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:36,940
Right.

93
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:42,320
So if you want to include maybe Aston Martin and top two, you can leave it like this.

94
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,240
But I want to just so that I can type.

95
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,740
Don't worry about all this.

96
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,420
So let me a right.

97
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,200
I'm saying you.

98
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:04,750
That worm is here and it's at a at some style.

99
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,400
So style.

100
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:10,550
Height.

101
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:14,140
Let's set it to 100 pixel.

102
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,750
We don't want the all the heights of this city.

103
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,490
200 overflow

104
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:25,180
hidden in background.

105
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:26,990
No.

106
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,230
All right.

107
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,550
Let's have a look.

108
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,160
You can see background is none.

109
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,690
How do we set it to online and offline?

110
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:43,920
So we have this beautiful social seer icons.

111
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,370
Beautiful.
