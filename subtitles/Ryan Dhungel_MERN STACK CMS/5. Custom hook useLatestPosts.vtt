00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.570
All right.

2
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.520
So just like we created the custom hook to get on the categories, let's create another one to get the

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.090
posts.

4
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.460
All right, so here, Hooks, let's create a new file.

5
00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.600
It's called Use Latest Posts.

6
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.320
Don't notice.

7
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:18.360
Okay.

8
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.750
Now, to make things easier, faster.

9
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.860
Let's copy this call.

10
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.120
Come back here.

11
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:30.540
Based here to the name from use latest posts.

12
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.840
Change the name here to the state to post.

13
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.740
Sit.

14
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.440
Posts get posted, let's call it.

15
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.580
So we make a request to stress posts.

16
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.750
That's what we need to give the best number.

17
00:00:53.110 --> 00:01:00.340
We give one and said Post, no post data.

18
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.210
We put all our posts in our state and then we return.

19
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.990
First, let's make sure we execute this function and then we return post Mosul.

20
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.270
All right, now let's try using this hook again into the same file.

21
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.040
Previously we used for use category post long let's import

22
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.440
use.

23
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.670
Okay.

24
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.680
Used posts.

25
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.080
So use latest posts from hooks.

26
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.760
Use latest posts.

27
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.870
All right, now let's execute this with.

28
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.580
Latest posts across the U.S.

29
00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.950
Ladies first.

30
00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:04.160
We execute this food that will give us the new disperse and we can show the ladies first here.

31
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.310
So let's come all the way down after the category.

32
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.430
Let's have the divider again.

33
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.310
And then here we can show the ladies post.

34
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.460
All right, so ladies first met.

35
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.290
We've met through its post.

36
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.520
And we use Linc again.

37
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:42.020
To link his career so that should take a stick the users to the single post you so that to discuss posts

38
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.070
this post don't slant.

39
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.380
All right.

40
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.060
And then here we write the Bush name Bush Don't title.

41
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.320
And since we're using the map, we want to use the key.

42
00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.820
Posted on this great beauty.

43
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.800
All right.

44
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.400
Let's have a look.

45
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.010
Latest posts.

46
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.460
Let's go on top.

47
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.630
So when we executed that hook, we called it latest posts.

48
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.050
Let's go to the hook.

49
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.740
Okay.

50
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.670
So we call it post.

51
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.110
Let's call it latest post.

52
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.390
This is to prevent the naming conflict later.

53
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.820
So latest posts, swift latest posts.

54
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.320
And then we had written latest posts.

55
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.560
That means we have to change as well.

56
00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.350
Said said.

57
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.460
Latest posts.

58
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.420
Okay.

59
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.670
It's trial.

60
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.230
You can see we have the latest force now.

61
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.040
We have these five posts.

62
00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.160
So looks like.

63
00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.980
Looks.

64
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.710
Looks a bit weird.

65
00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:07.480
Okay, so that's one.

66
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.080
That's another.

67
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.310
Obviously, there's no land.

68
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.110
Let's make sure there's a line break.

69
00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:30.830
First of all it's in the name and we haven't invented it just post and then in of and actually we can

70
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:31.510
leave and attack.

71
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.770
Let's give them put them in.

72
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.630
All right.

73
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.570
You can see now they are on the individual lines.

74
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.600
One, two, three, four, five, six, six.

75
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.560
Post we're showing.

76
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:49.000
Beautiful.

77
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.590
So they click, you click.

78
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.380
Then we land on their place.

79
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:55.000
Beautiful.
