1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:00.810
All right.

2
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.000
So we have got all the categories here.

3
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:10.170
So let's use a select component from NASA so that we can show the categories.

4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.410
Let me quickly show you the finished version.

5
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.390
So the monster.

6
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.990
I'm logged in as admin.

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:28.920
It's good to mood add new so you can see we have this of some categories and we show all the categories

8
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:29.550
available.

9
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:37.140
You can click select used in this type in the name node get entered and that select.

10
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.390
All right.

11
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.330
So we're going to implement this feature.

12
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.500
For that we use the select component from end.

13
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.860
All right.

14
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.220
So so we have the loaded categories.

15
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.660
We did that I'm using the use effect.

16
00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.130
So let's import select from and.

17
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:12.640
And then we came to just put that we can put here or we can put underneath.

18
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.130
So in this project, I pulled him.

19
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.710
So let's just go like this.

20
00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.790
Let's put it on the right side.

21
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.290
I.

22
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.830
So that is column six here.

23
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:38.480
So here I'm going to give it a heading has four categories and then we use this select.

24
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.960
Select.

25
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:55.800
So here what you can do is we going to show the options here so often is something you can destructor

26
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:56.660
from select.

27
00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.060
All right so students go on top

28
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:10.100
so we can do structure cost option from select.

29
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.290
This is something you could access here as select option.

30
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.420
You can do that, but this is a bit easier.

31
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.040
So let's use that.

32
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.740
I said we will saw the option.

33
00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.340
Now before we walk on after let's walk on the select.

34
00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:38.440
So select we want we want to allow the user to select only one item on multiple items.

35
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:45.580
So in our case, we want the multiple select to have more multiple.

36
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.570
All right.

37
00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.970
And then all are clear that we.

38
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.120
User will be able to clear the the items placeholder.

39
00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.360
You can see select categories we can put that.

40
00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.110
I'm going to use starting so then it takes the entire width.

41
00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.740
So with.

42
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.510
100%.

43
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:29.160
All right.

44
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.840
And then we're going to have the content handler.

45
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.220
So on content.

46
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.590
So what are you going to do here?

47
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.640
So whenever the value changes in the Senate, as the user pick any of these options, that value will

48
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.600
be received here.

49
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.710
All right.

50
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.000
So whatever category has been chosen, the value will be hit.

51
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.480
So when you get that value, you want to put that in the state.

52
00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.780
So we can use set categories and you just use a V.

53
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.620
The reason we have set exit categories here because we allow the user to select more than one category

54
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.600
when they're creating this push.

55
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.930
Right.

56
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.030
So whether they select one or more than one doesn't matter.

57
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:23.110
That will be pushed to the categories in the state.

58
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.330
So this is categories.

59
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.020
And what we're going to show in the option is loaded categories, right?

60
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:36.090
So loaded categories means all the categories we have in the market and whichever is selected that will

61
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:42.510
be available in the categories using this function, select set categories.

62
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.500
Okay.

63
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.850
So option, we want to store all the loaded categories as an option.

64
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.040
So let me actually record this one.

65
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.560
Let me use the map function map through all the loaded categories and show them as options.

66
00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.740
I guess to hear loaded categories.

67
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.300
Loaded categories, dark map to map through each of them.

68
00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.440
Okay.

69
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:15.220
So when we met through each categories, let's say let's call them item.

70
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:23.650
So we get each item in each item we want to render as the absolute right.

71
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.530
So here we use all.

72
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.780
Awesome.

73
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:37.920
So is item need a unique key and we can use that item to underscore it.

74
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.460
So each category will have decided.

75
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.930
So we use that as a key.

76
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.000
Looks like we're missing one parenthesis here.

77
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.570
So map.

78
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:50.190
That's the opening.

79
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.540
That's the arrow function.

80
00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:53.130
So we need one

81
00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:56.460
bracket here.

82
00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.490
Sorry.

83
00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:59.610
Bracket.

84
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.960
Closing bracket.

85
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:13.300
And here it looks like we have got one extra parenthesis in serve that we should have the current embrace

86
00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.880
of that and replaced with goldfish.

87
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.920
Okay, so we map through the loaded categories and we show each category.

88
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.650
We understood the name.

89
00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.560
So item dot name.

90
00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.080
Okay.

91
00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:30.460
Let's have a look.

92
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.570
All right.

93
00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.660
Now, you can see here we have the categories.

94
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:44.590
We can select all categories, remove the categories, we can clear the categories we can search.

95
00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:48.620
Now, when you do this, it doesn't actually work.

96
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.180
You're going to you see all the options when you click.

97
00:06:52.180 --> 00:07:02.140
But as soon as you type, for example, not you see it is not work and that's because it works and based

98
00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:02.790
on the key.

99
00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.880
So if you want that to be available, then you'd need to change this to

100
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:10.790
name.

101
00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.260
All right, let's try now.

102
00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.240
Note now you can see more.

103
00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.550
It works better.

104
00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.630
That's how it works out.

105
00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:35.200
Beautiful note two You saw how easy it is to so use this multiple select to using and isn't these components.
