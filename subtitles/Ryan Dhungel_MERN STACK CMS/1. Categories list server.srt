1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:01,050
All right.

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,580
So now we're going to.

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,910
I work on these categories feature.

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,540
So at the moment we can create a category but one security category.

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:15,750
We want to show the list of categories here and we want to allow the admin to update and delete as well.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,080
Right.

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,200
I guess so.

8
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,920
What are you going to do is let's try creating.

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,630
I think we have to fix a few more things.

10
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:24,810
You.

11
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,950
Let's see.

12
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,470
If I create.

13
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:31,700
Okay.

14
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,400
So of course category get squared is successful.

15
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,460
However, the value still remains there.

16
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,650
So we have to reset the value.

17
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,160
And since we're using and design.

18
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,950
Let's go to Mrs..

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,790
I mean, can you give us index?

20
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,640
So using the end is in a form.

21
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:01,780
So.

22
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,170
And that gives us this.

23
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:16,190
The from hook that we can use and then we will be able to reset the values of the firm.

24
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,790
And that is something we used in a assigning I think.

25
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:20,880
Let me just say.

26
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:25,460
Yeah.

27
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,960
We use 500 reset fields to reset all the values of the film.

28
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,910
So to use that, we have to put the phone.

29
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,770
In the end is in form.

30
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:41,950
And this form you get from the youth from Hook.

31
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,110
It is right here.

32
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,070
I guess it is.

33
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:47,970
Are we going to use.

34
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,100
So let's go ahead and trace it is.

35
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,380
You can copy this code.

36
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,930
Go to categories index.

37
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,720
So here since we're using any designs from.

38
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:04,420
Folks.

39
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:12,770
Let's put put it here so we can distract a phone from the end event phone use phone hook and then we.

40
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,260
Use this form in the actual form.

41
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:22,780
It's right here and finished form equals to form.

42
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:28,060
And then we can reset the values.

43
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,140
In our case, the input field.

44
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,740
It has.

45
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,500
The name.

46
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:39,520
Name.

47
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:40,330
Right.

48
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,220
So we want to empty this field.

49
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:48,270
So we can do that here in unfinished console.log.

50
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,630
Let's go over that.

51
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:53,620
Now we show the successful success message.

52
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,790
Set, loading, default.

53
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:55,330
And then.

54
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,300
From that, Reese, it feels.

55
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,190
And we want to reset the field name.

56
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:08,570
I that's the name.

57
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,040
Actually, it would have to be inside a tree like that.

58
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:22,520
So that way, if you have more than one fields in your farm, then you can just do like this.

59
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:32,900
Oh, you could just use the let me just quickly go to Sandy or you could just use the recent fields.

60
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:38,410
Phone, don't reset fields and that will reset everything.

61
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,750
We could actually use this one.

62
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,220
But let's try this as well.

63
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:48,650
So this will give you the ability to individually target the elements.

64
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:53,180
So feel form has many feels and you want to keep some an empty sum.

65
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,950
Then you can just do it like this.

66
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,450
So let's give it a try.

67
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,560
Let's try what we try now.

68
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,520
Electronic.

69
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,230
Mm hmm.

70
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,880
So this one actually didn't want.

71
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,260
From the tourists, it feels.

72
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:23,470
From equities to fund or use from.

73
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,560
Maybe we just need to reload the phase.

74
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:43,880
That's right.

75
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,240
Part.

76
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:48,460
Okay.

77
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:54,040
So it research since you mean stuff.

78
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:56,930
Okay.

79
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,230
So it works beautifully.

80
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,060
So we have been able to create categories.

81
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,340
I received this film.

82
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:07,560
Now let's go ahead and try to show the list of categories.

83
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,560
So for that, obviously we have to started out back in.

84
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:16,380
It's good to back end and create the endpoint that will give us all the categories.

85
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:20,340
So let's start from roots category.

86
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,150
Let's create a row with a method of get.

87
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,980
Categories then.

88
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,730
What do you call it?

89
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:34,900
Wait.

90
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,750
I like to use this card.

91
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:46,120
You know create rid of the delete so that naming convention to just call it read.

92
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:47,960
You.

93
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:52,350
So let's import this one from controllers category read.

94
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:54,510
Mm hmm.

95
00:05:54,790 --> 00:06:01,300
Actually, the read I thing think it's a good idea, because read is something we could use for getting

96
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,350
the single category.

97
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:07,960
So I think we just call it by the same name categories.

98
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:17,190
I guess it is good that this controller function and work on this category is function.

99
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:18,890
So here.

100
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,960
Export contest categories include to.

101
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:33,020
Async request response try gets error

102
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:36,170
control.

103
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:44,800
I get requests usually goes pretty well without, you know, you don't really have to worry on the air.

104
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:50,240
So even if it doesn't find anything in the database, it will just return improve.

105
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:51,790
All right.

106
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:58,780
So we can use the category model, use the find function, which will give you the entire collection

107
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,740
and you can sort by the created that data.

108
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:06,010
If you don't have this code, you will still get all your categories.

109
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:06,550
But.

110
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,240
The most recently created ones.

111
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:19,110
They will come at the end and the old one comes on the top and that is probably not something you want.

112
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:25,410
So you might want to see the latest ones on top so you can use the search and survey.

113
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,500
They created a date.

114
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:35,450
I guess that will give you the list of categories and you can send those categories to your reactor

115
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,590
application in the front.

116
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:37,130
Right.

117
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:38,480
So it's that simple.

118
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:39,980
Let's.

119
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,830
And this endpoint is something you can see.

120
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,780
This is public.

121
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,670
There is no request, signing or anything.

122
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,110
And this is something you can access from the browser directly as well.

123
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,110
Sorry I missed the.

124
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,820
Ah, let's fix that.

125
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,110
Okay.

126
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:00,360
So this routing and try it directly from browser as well.

127
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,250
So let's go.

128
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:03,250
Give it a try.

129
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:05,470
Nicholas.

130
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,240
Our server is running an 8000.

131
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:12,430
SLAs API, SLAs categories.

132
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:17,620
If you try that, you see we get all the categories that we have created so far.

133
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,720
One, two, three, four, five, six categories we have.

134
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:25,330
So you can see you can get the array of categories.

135
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,370
I guess this beautiful decent data for the categories we can.

136
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,030
Get in our front end.

137
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,890
We can make a request to this end point using.

138
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:46,730
You defect and we get all this and we can render the categories just like we did in our finished application.

139
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:47,630
We take them freely.

140
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,020
So you.

141
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,480
According to the categories.

142
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,410
So this is how we want to display.

143
00:08:54,410 --> 00:09:00,530
So all the categories will be here and then admin will be able to edit or delete.

144
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,580
I guess taken two immediately comes up here.

145
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,080
You can edit.

146
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:14,150
You can edit it or you can delete it.

147
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,830
So that's what we're trying to achieve.

148
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:19,270
So we have created the endpoint.

149
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:32,180
Now we have to make use of use effect hook to learn all those categories in our categories base for

150
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:32,720
the admin.

151
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,390
I mean, categories index.

152
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,280
So we can do that right here.
