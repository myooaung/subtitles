WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:08.790
All right, so let's work on the logout and then we're going to conditionally so these links and so

2
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.980
if it is logged in user we don't want to.

3
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.610
So then if it is logged Lisa, we want to show the logout so let's go to.

4
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.850
The navigation system is good.

5
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.310
NAV admin man.

6
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:40.610
And here after this news, if it let me write the log out function, it's called sign out.

7
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.850
Good could still.

8
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.850
So basically when we sign out, we don't have to make any request to our backend because all we need

9
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.570
to do is remove the token from the local stores and the context.

10
00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.490
We could did a video once they issued they will be valid until the expiry date.

11
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.930
Right.

12
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.980
So to sign out, we can't really do anything in the back end.

13
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.710
We just have to remove it from the local stores.

14
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.450
I guess.

15
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.000
Remove from local storage and remove.

16
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.950
You know, that was a comment to you.

17
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.030
Remove from local stories.

18
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.750
Remove from context.

19
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.800
And then if you would redirect.

20
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.790
Most likely you want to redirect to it all again.

21
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.890
All right.

22
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:48.740
So to remove from local stories, we use local stories to remove item and by the name of all.

23
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.660
So that's what we do.

24
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.760
That's nice and easy to remove.

25
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.400
From context, we need to access the context.

26
00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.540
So let's access the import of context from.

27
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.960
So you go one step, two step.

28
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.330
Context pause.

29
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.850
Simple to use context.

30
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.290
And then to use this where you can just here and.

31
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.340
Let me put it.

32
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.200
Trying to.

33
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.730
Context counts

34
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.310
includes to use context

35
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.230
and context.

36
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.040
All right.

37
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.250
Now we can use this all set up.

38
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.770
That is right here.

39
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.420
We use a set of.

40
00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.010
And we said to.

41
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:08.490
The user user, no token empties shrink.

42
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.670
All right.

43
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:15.970
So that I'm going to do to make it empty and then we can redirect Serota again.

44
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.600
We have to access that user order hook.

45
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.460
So let's do.

46
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:28.440
In Boulder, use the wrong room from next room.

47
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.250
Again, we can just execute that here and strongly.

48
00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.330
Could still use real.

49
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.120
And then.

50
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.770
We can use here a roller derby boost.

51
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.890
We want to push the user to love a sign that is right

52
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:59.640
now we just need to execute this function on click that will sign out the user, make everything empty

53
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.560
from context and local stories.

54
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.720
So let's put that.

55
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.410
But it's vital that.

56
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.010
Why do we have this sign in and.

57
00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:17.480
Oh.

58
00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:19.040
So we did.

59
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:20.520
We did a mistake here.

60
00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.660
We are working in admin nab instead.

61
00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.700
We should be working on the darknet.

62
00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.040
All right, so let me quickly fix this up.

63
00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.300
Let me hide this time.

64
00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.480
Let me just open these both files.

65
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:36.980
I have the side button.

66
00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.470
Split window here.

67
00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.090
I have the top now.

68
00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.880
And here I had been net.

69
00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.580
So let me just copy the code that we just write from here to here.

70
00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.290
All right.

71
00:04:51.290 --> 00:05:03.910
So first we used these in the context, in the real reason it's cut from the put it here we need to

72
00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.480
cut this use context took from that point of view.

73
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:15.160
Next one.

74
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.460
We don't need the context.

75
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:18.550
Not at the moment.

76
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.760
We may need that soon, but not at the moment.

77
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.020
So let's remove that from there and put it.

78
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.170
I guess we've got that context as well.

79
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.260
So we have the we have imported the context.

80
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.320
We have the role is contextual.

81
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:44.070
We have the context in this and the component, you know.

82
00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:48.320
This.

83
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.890
Okay.

84
00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.890
Let's make sure we got from that.

85
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.680
Put him.

86
00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:57.600
All right.

87
00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.020
And then finally we got this sign out function that they wrote.

88
00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:04.290
Put him.

89
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:06.950
Awesome.

90
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:08.060
Okay.

91
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:13.490
Now, let me just drive back here and continue working in the stock market.

92
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.780
We have.

93
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:20.180
But the there are we have got the context.

94
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:21.300
It's all here.

95
00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.710
We have the function as well.

96
00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:25.560
So we just need to execute this function.

97
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.490
I'll click, right?

98
00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:31.710
So let's go down here and let's see where we have the sign up in tone.

99
00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:32.910
And so here you can see.

100
00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.310
Let's add one more link here.

101
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:44.980
So this one did this.

102
00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.790
It's called sign out.

103
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.740
It's fine.

104
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.440
Right.

105
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:50.620
I can find out.

106
00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.970
And then we call it sign out.

107
00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:57.490
Heads.

108
00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:03.330
If we donate heads if actually we don't need links and it's remove that we just use.

109
00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:07.380
And so that's for certain.

110
00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:08.970
This one.

111
00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:09.340
One.

112
00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.170
Click, click.

113
00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:12.870
We want to execute a function to.

114
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.280
Let's use arrow fonts in here.

115
00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:16.260
Sign out.

116
00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:21.520
Let's make sure the there's no typo saying capital sign.

117
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.630
No, let's give it a try

118
00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:31.630
out context margin and not fine line 12.

119
00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:38.610
Let's see that is in top nav line 12.

120
00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:43.100
So we go.

121
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.500
One step, two step up.

122
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:48.290
Context.

123
00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:50.490
Okay.

124
00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:52.140
So I guess.

125
00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:53.490
And from here.

126
00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:56.190
Okay.

127
00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.170
So we're not inside necessarily.

128
00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:00.000
So we're not in ten every hour.

129
00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.370
So just one step.

130
00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.780
All right, so we got the sign out.

131
00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:14.910
Let's use a different.

132
00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.460
I can sign.

133
00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:21.840
Sign for sign out.

134
00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:22.410
We can.

135
00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:26.850
By the way, if you want to search quickly, you can.

136
00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:29.130
Allergies, command, kiss, heart conditions.

137
00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:32.850
And it means command, key and type icons.

138
00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:38.650
For sign up.

139
00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:40.390
We can use one

140
00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.910
to have the log out outline, so let's use that.

141
00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:56.560
EG it's best to lock out our client.

142
00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.030
Let's come back down here.

143
00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:06.650
And here many item icon we use.

144
00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:10.510
Look out.

145
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:18.760
I guess that's a sign out sign of sign in sign.

146
00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.100
And also, we may be able to use a different one

147
00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:26.350
slogan if you want.

148
00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:28.210
You can use that log in Outland.

149
00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:30.580
I think I'll just leave it like that.

150
00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:32.290
It's the users sign too.

151
00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:33.010
That looks good.

152
00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:36.110
So sign a sign in and the sign out.

153
00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:43.870
I know if I try sign out, this should be gone and this should be gone from the local store.

154
00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:45.600
So let's see how this works.

155
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.520
Sign up and it works.

156
00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:53.860
And here I've got all these are the things I can move that just to make things clear.

157
00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:57.370
You can see nothing in the local stories, nothing in the context.

158
00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:58.330
Awesome.

159
00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:00.280
Let's try one more time.

160
00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:00.730
Sign it.

161
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:07.890
All right.

162
00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:15.090
Now, if I can go go around different bases, my first sign out.

163
00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.100
It's got beautiful.

164
00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:24.460
One more thing we can do here, and that is conditionally showing these icons so if users signed in.

165
00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:28.690
We want to hide these links only show this one.

166
00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:35.200
But if users are not signed in then we should is too arrogant for them to link for.

167
00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:35.860
Not this one.

168
00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:37.000
Let's come here.

169
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:40.220
For that one.

170
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:42.290
So this one.

171
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:44.610
Sign up and sign in to this.

172
00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:46.220
Is this should be a one group.

173
00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:56.600
So let me cut and put in sign the fragment so that it would be easier to conditionally render and then

174
00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:57.680
sign out.

175
00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:58.280
We have here.
