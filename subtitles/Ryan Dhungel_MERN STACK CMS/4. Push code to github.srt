1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,790
Let's go ahead, create the Get Tibet story.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,940
And here you can see I have deployed only the backing.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,790
But you can do backing in front in both.

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:09,400
Get.

5
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:13,830
So that is one thing you can do in addition to this one.

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,330
This one I did only for backing.

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,920
But let's do it for both.

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,340
Back in.

9
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:17,910
Turned it.

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,350
So did.

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,780
So I have all these projects, so let me create a new repository.

12
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,300
Let me call this a Demi Eden me server.

13
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,180
And you can make it private.

14
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:41,740
You can make it private.

15
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,930
You pledge to recreate the monetary.

16
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:49,900
All right, so we just need to follow these commands to get in it.

17
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:55,540
We have to initialize our project with and get our local project here.

18
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,920
And that is it's open here.

19
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,130
You can see I'm inside subfolder and here I'm inside.

20
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,650
Client four So let's deploy server now.

21
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,420
So here, first thing I can do is get in it.

22
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:11,380
Thank you.

23
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,200
So now it is initialize with git repository.

24
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:19,870
Then let me just make it small so you can see here.

25
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,230
Next command is git and

26
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:30,220
get and everything get.

27
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:35,710
And indeed, to get started, let's have a look at the status.

28
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:36,980
All of them have been added.

29
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:41,090
Make a comment to give you give your comment a name.

30
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:47,180
It commits and it's ready to deploy.

31
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:49,750
And then.

32
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,300
Get runs, men.

33
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,900
Let's try that.

34
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:08,140
It's the command you have to to get remote and everything followed by the euro and then finally get

35
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:11,110
push DSU origin main.

36
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:16,610
Great.

37
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:27,770
Know, your code base must have been deployed from your local computer to GitHub and I'm pretty sure

38
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:30,380
you had the git ignore files.

39
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,640
I guess so.

40
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,140
Let me just double check.

41
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:41,960
Ian ve get ignore to make sure you have the git ignore file and there you should have these two folders,

42
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,220
this folder and this file.

43
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:47,630
You don't want to commit to GitHub because this file will contain sensitive information.

44
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:54,590
So I supposed to show you this one early before we make a commit, but I'm pretty sure you had this

45
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:54,740
one.

46
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:59,840
If not, maybe you want to go to the folder

47
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:07,010
folder here and you should be able to see the hidden files.

48
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:14,870
Maybe just tried to just delete this, did fine, and then go through the steps again.

49
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:21,680
So if you by mistake didn't have those this get ignore file, but otherwise everything is perfect.

50
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,450
Okay, so that's for certain.

51
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,850
It has been pushed to GitHub.

52
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:30,770
Let's give a reference in C and you can see, you know, code base here.

53
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,470
Beautiful too.

54
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:33,440
That's for server.

55
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,320
And now let's create one more for client.

56
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,470
If we go ahead, create another repo.

57
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,390
This one is for client.

58
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:46,040
Did me client make it private?

59
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,330
Create.

60
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,310
All right, now let's go through the same step.

61
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,640
This time we want to go inside clean fuel.

62
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:05,700
You can get in and get and get committees and

63
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,900
ready to deploy.

64
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:16,930
By the way, this is the same steps you'll follow next time when you make some changes to your project.

65
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:25,870
After you do get Ed, get comment and then get push to pursue changes to GitHub.

66
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,980
And then from this lesson, you will get pull to pull the changes.

67
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:32,740
All right.

68
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,650
So this is the first time, so we have to follow this one as well.

69
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,200
So let's try that.

70
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:50,080
Detriment and origin that euro jet pose and origin may.

71
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:55,700
Perfect.

72
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,230
No, give refresh.

73
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,900
We should have the fondant as well.

74
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,560
Beautiful.

75
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,410
All right, that's perfect.

76
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:07,160
Now, let's continue here and let's see what we have to do next.

77
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,330
So we have.

78
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:13,460
So we had the getting file that was also written here, which is good.

79
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:14,750
All right.

80
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,130
And then we.

81
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:20,720
In this tutorial, I used Bitbucket, but it works for both.

82
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:26,050
I guess that means we have our project in GitHub.

83
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,010
That's perfect.

84
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,110
Our next step is to install Node and NPM in this lesson.

85
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:32,420
Right.

86
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,370
So that is the next.
