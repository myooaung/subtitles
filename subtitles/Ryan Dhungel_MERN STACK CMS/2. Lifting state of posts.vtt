00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:01.080
All right.

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:08.730
So now we're going to lift our state from the component level to the application level using context.

3
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.080
So we're going to move the post and categories.

4
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.210
So in this section you'll learn quite a lot about context.

5
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:27.660
So if you previously did feel too comfortable with context, by the time we we are done with this context,

6
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.270
post context, you'll feel much better.

7
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.270
You will get very good understanding.

8
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.130
So let's go.

9
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.060
So what are you basically trying to do is create a context called post.

10
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:45.360
We will also put the categories there and then the in the admin section.

11
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.920
So we have the post and category.

12
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.910
So here we going to use the context as listed.

13
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.630
So instead of having them here, it will be the context.

14
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.970
It will be used context to pretty much it's going to be fairly similar.

15
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:08.310
One, we are to many differences, but we're going to move this to the context and then some of the

16
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.090
categories.

17
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.090
So categories you can see here, we will move this to the context overall.

18
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:16.060
All right.

19
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.330
So let's first create the context and then we'll come back and welcome this basis

20
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.420
context.

21
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.740
Let's create a new file and it's called Forced Nazis.

22
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.910
And just to save some time, we can copy

23
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.120
probably.

24
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.980
Yeah, you can.

25
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.300
We can copy a thing, but it's this information symbol.

26
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:50.810
It's not much scarier and it's coming in here in the post context, let's face that.

27
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.490
So we just make some changes.

28
00:01:52.490 --> 00:02:02.780
You see, in context, we change it to post context and to improve whenever we change it, to post for

29
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:03.200
a while.

30
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.280
And then we change our post.

31
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.240
Post.

32
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.580
All right.

33
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.280
So here we want to have in our state, we want to have post.

34
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.950
We want to call it post self post equals to use state.

35
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:33.060
And this time, in this context, we want to obviously have the array of posts.

36
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.630
All right.

37
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.130
So don't get confused.

38
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.680
We be using this name many times.

39
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.320
Post, post.

40
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:41.160
All right.

41
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.480
So it can get a bit confusing.

42
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.640
But this take it easy.

43
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.770
So this is a post context.

44
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:54.420
And in the context we would have the area post and also the array of categories, categories.

45
00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.620
And so that's our state.

46
00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.840
We will be able to update this state and we will be able to grab the value from this state.

47
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.940
All right.

48
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.860
And then we don't even need this one.

49
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:10.660
Nice and simple.

50
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.640
And here, when we pass the valley, we will be passing the post and to the post.

51
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.090
All right, so grab this area and replace this area with that one.

52
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:31.450
Okay, so we're passing the valley post and set post, and we render whichever component we receive

53
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:32.890
here to process.

54
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.200
So we don't even need to use effect.

55
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.150
So nice and simple.

56
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.610
So we have the post context.

57
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.050
Now, just to give it a try, just to make sure we are doing it right.

58
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:53.570
Well, let's go to the Bases Admin Index and it's fair to access that inside Post's Post Index.

59
00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.910
So let me import use context.

60
00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:07.800
So we need to use that actually before we can access there.

61
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.240
I think we have to go to produce and import that post context here, which we haven't done yet.

62
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.240
So let's do it first and then we can move on to.

63
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.440
I'm working the admin.

64
00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:27.710
It's so important post provider from context post.

65
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:34.490
So once you have the provider, we wrap this one ask provider.

66
00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:43.010
So let's collect these items and then use post provider.

67
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.700
And based this back again.

68
00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.820
So now you get to we have three context.

69
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.180
We have three provider theme off and post.

70
00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.580
Awesome.

71
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.720
So with this done, we can continue working in the admin post with.

72
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:12.360
So here we import use context and then we can import the post context.

73
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.050
From.

74
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.230
So he wants to have to step up.

75
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:25.120
Three.

76
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.040
Two components.

77
00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:28.930
Certain components.

78
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.490
Context post.

79
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.900
All right.

80
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:40.180
So to use context, we can use this to use contexts and the value is going to be post context.

81
00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:43.010
All right.

82
00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:54.170
So that will give us the value boost that will be singular, I suppose, and say, okay, just let's

83
00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.970
make sure we have it.

84
00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:55.250
Yeah.

85
00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:01.570
So we have the post and set post and within that we will be able to access the posts and categories.

86
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.310
Okay.

87
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.200
So we have the post and so post.

88
00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.540
You can change that.

89
00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:20.350
I guess you can change that to just sit pushed and this will push all the posts that you got from this

90
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.950
request.

91
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:25.210
So you will be now serving that post in the context.

92
00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.040
I wanted to mention it.

93
00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:34.420
So now instead of using the local CID, we are using the global stone to use in context and everything

94
00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.170
will continue to work as it is.

95
00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:41.500
So we can still we still have the data source, actually this one text.

96
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.980
Now you can see here and other sources post.

97
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:55.120
So you can do post dot posts to host the supplement.

98
00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.360
Just don't post dot posts.

99
00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:59.920
That's how we accessing web.

100
00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:02.170
All right.

101
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.150
So with this, it should work.

102
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:04.870
Let's come here.

103
00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.830
Themed context is not defined.

104
00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.510
Context post.

105
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:13.930
We wanted to change that.

106
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:18.830
Context post.

107
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:20.530
Maybe not as heralded.

108
00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:25.000
Okay.

109
00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:26.420
So we followed the terms.

110
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:36.730
Okay.

111
00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:37.920
So we have that.

112
00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:39.360
So here.

113
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:42.320
In the admin post.

114
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:43.460
So we did that.

115
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.390
Now to show the length until we have to do post dot posts.

116
00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:48.620
Don't leave now.

117
00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.570
If you don't like to do that, you can actually.

118
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:52.340
Let's undo it once.

119
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:53.570
Leave it like this.

120
00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:54.910
We will end this post.

121
00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:55.460
All right.

122
00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:59.750
What you can do is you can distribute this value from the post here.

123
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:10.210
Okay, so once we know we have the posts inside this post so we can post destructor and so that way

124
00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.050
you don't have to change any code down here.

125
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.070
All right, so let me just give it to you first.

126
00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:19.080
All right.

127
00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.430
Well done, kid.

128
00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:30.120
So before Slim comes along and, you know, for some context.

129
00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:42.430
We've got that undefined.

130
00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:44.020
Let's just try it post.

131
00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:47.430
Okay.

132
00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:51.230
So we have the post and to have the post.

133
00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.100
Posts from context.

134
00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:00.880
All right.

135
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.890
So I just realize we are using the post data.

136
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:11.100
Now, we can't actually do that because now the said post is a context for content and that can update

137
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:14.730
the post and categories both.

138
00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:16.950
So let me just quickly go there.

139
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:24.180
Now we can just use set post because now it has two properties post and category.

140
00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:26.040
So we have to go one step deeper.

141
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.160
So what are we going to do here is set post.

142
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:33.450
Let's use at a function here.

143
00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:34.470
It's a previous variable.

144
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:42.480
We have the return, we spread out the previous value of whatever we have, the categories, whatever

145
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:42.990
is that.

146
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:44.460
We don't want to do anything with that.

147
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:51.120
So we spread out and we just want to update the post post and that would be done.

148
00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:58.720
So this one has to be in it in the parentheses.

149
00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:00.910
Okay.

150
00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:06.370
So we're using the arrow function to previous for the we have the categories or any other thing we separate

151
00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:06.610
out.

152
00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:07.690
We don't do anything with that.

153
00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:12.880
We just want to upgrade the post with this value duh again.

154
00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:19.870
So with that we should have the post doc post this time.

155
00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:24.520
So let's try naming it on an event and post from context.

156
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:28.310
You're going to put some context.

157
00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:29.750
Let me just give a reference.

158
00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.400
So forced from context.

159
00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.350
We have the post and the categories.

160
00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:45.010
So you can see post is we have the seven items as posts, array and categories.

161
00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:47.500
We don't have anything at the moment.

162
00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:48.580
All right.

163
00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:49.540
So that's great.

164
00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:59.770
We have been successfully oh, now uplift our state from our component level to the global level using

165
00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:02.890
the context, a limited system event.

166
00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.950
So it distorts, of course from the post.

167
00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:14.950
And then we just we update that to using use effect and then we render we didn't make any change here

168
00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:17.050
because we already do structure this.

169
00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:19.510
So it just works like that.

170
00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:24.280
Now the next thing we want to do is go to categories.

171
00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:28.990
And in here in this index space, we want to do the same thing.

172
00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:34.600
So lift the step from here to the post context.
