1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:00.780
All right.

2
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.710
So we have created our very first base home bases here.

3
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:12.460
Now let's create one more base so that we have at least two base and then we're going to use end design

4
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:18.280
for styling because you can tell at the moment it's just plain, it doesn't have any sheer size.

5
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.560
So we're going to use and design scissors.

6
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.950
All right.

7
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.380
So let's create one with base inside.

8
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.770
Basically, let's create one more folder and let's call it.

9
00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.370
And so.

10
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.090
Pretty soon we'll have the admin section where they will be a despot, which will be quite a lot of.

11
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.660
One of the main feature of the application.

12
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:46.350
So we can just individually think about that section as well.

13
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.510
So basis admin, internet admin for let's create a new file called Index.

14
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.990
Now another thing you will notice that entire basis for its name is important.

15
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:07.530
So whatever rights name you give to your file stat is important because now when you create this admin

16
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.370
folder and inside here when you have the index file, that means you will be able to visit this space

17
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.510
by going to less admin two pages.

18
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.240
Think of pages as the root and anything inside breeze's folder.

19
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.150
If you create any files with that name, that name will be

20
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:30.540
available.

21
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.770
You will be able to use that name in the URL to access that base.

22
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.110
I guess that's one of the beauty of next there's no inside here admin index.

23
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.780
So here, let's write another function.

24
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:50.910
Another component function has been written here.

25
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:58.830
It's written in div and here let's also write H1 and let's say admin page.

26
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:08.030
And let's make sure we export default and RSA now have to pace.

27
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.930
What is admin?

28
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.770
What is just a homepage?

29
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.500
So just the home base.

30
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.060
We could just visit laguna's 3000 and access that.

31
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.430
Now to access this admin base, we have to follow this naming convention.

32
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.400
You can see here PC's admin.

33
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.820
So that means we have to do PS+ and.

34
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:41.100
And there we have had many this is an incident of recently happened that no.

35
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.890
Admin pays admin bit.

36
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.320
Why is that playing?

37
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.980
No.

38
00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.470
Adnan I think it was just translating fundamentally.

39
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.450
All right.

40
00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.600
So that's how we can access the bases like that.

41
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:18.110
Now, if you had another file instead and we effectively admin slayers blogs, then whatever you write

42
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:25.130
in that file would be able to you would be able to access like s less and less blogs.

43
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:31.340
Now, you said this the way you write the naming convention center places folder is extremely important

44
00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.820
because that will be treated as the you are in here as well.

45
00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.850
So we've got two bases now.

46
00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.760
Let's go ahead and try and design.

47
00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.490
So let's go to and design website.

48
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.320
Click here to get started.

49
00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.070
And down here we have this.

50
00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.520
Come on.

51
00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.410
So and beam and so and.

52
00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:59.980
We have to run that command.

53
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:02.950
Let me stop this, sir.

54
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.620
Control C to cancel so you don't end PM in.

55
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.540
So you can type all in.

56
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:11.680
So you can just type.

57
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.110
I just keep it simple.

58
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:24.520
And then I and D so and that's how you in sum and and let's also install the and then see as I can set

59
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.220
as well, which will be using quite a lot.

60
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.230
So let me search for I can click you.

61
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.700
Click here to view the icons.

62
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.510
And here they show you how to insulate, conserve.

63
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:46.170
So we have to run these environments to add and design icons.

64
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.560
Let me copy that face to space.

65
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.580
So this way we can run to packages and and and design icons.

66
00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.360
All right.

67
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:11.460
So this and desire and willing to input see this from the end design and that c assist should be applied

68
00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.870
for the entire application.

69
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.910
At the moment we have to pace.

70
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.040
Later we will have many.

71
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.700
All right.

72
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:25.800
So that assist somehow has to be available for all the pace, not just the space, not just this space.

73
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.370
Okay.

74
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:33.210
So for something like that, there is another piece you can create and that is called Underscore at

75
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:39.600
dirtiest that we don't see here at the moment, but that is used by next year behind the scene.

76
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.320
So it's time anything is rendered before that.

77
00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.540
And the app that is that would be rendered, I guess.

78
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:55.890
So anything you want to write there that will be available for the entire applications before the application

79
00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:00.090
is served to the users, the cold in that file will run.

80
00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:00.780
All right.

81
00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:07.560
So that means in that file we want to import the C assist so that C assist is applied for the entire

82
00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.210
application before users actually see any content from any other piece.

83
00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:13.980
All right.

84
00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.770
So it's come here.

85
00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:18.000
It's done.

86
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.080
Installation is done.

87
00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.610
So let me run the server again.

88
00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:27.450
I'm going to use I've been known to have kids go to the previous command and NPM run div and hit and.

89
00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:29.640
So the application is running.

90
00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.240
Now, what do you want to do is create that amateur display.

91
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.900
Now that file is quite important.

92
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.540
So let me quickly show you the document, decent as well.

93
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.500
You can go to Nexis and here in the south, but you can type underscore at.

94
00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:58.920
Not that one didn't just come here custom I guess to click on that one so you can read a bit more about

95
00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.100
this file to next.

96
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:04.290
This uses this app component to initialize basis.

97
00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.580
Before the pieces are rendered, they initialize.

98
00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:16.020
This component is used so you can override it and control the base initialization, which allows you

99
00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:24.700
to do some amazing things, like by assisting the layouts in the navigation state and a global C assist.

100
00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.460
So this is what we are trying to do.

101
00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:32.940
We want to add a global CCIS, so we want to import and design theses and put in this fight.

102
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:35.220
So this file you create like this one.

103
00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:44.220
So this you can see this custom app component you create like that so you can copy this could come here

104
00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:49.980
inside basis for recruiting new file underscore app dirties.

105
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:53.080
And then you just based here.

106
00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:54.940
So basically it's a function.

107
00:07:55.240 --> 00:08:03.850
It takes component and base props the properties as argument and it returns if there is any.

108
00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:04.840
All right.

109
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:11.860
So you want to make sure to use export default my app.

110
00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:13.210
All right.

111
00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:23.830
So anything you write in this component will be used to initialize the controller base initialization.

112
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:28.900
So I assume let's add global thesis on next.

113
00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:29.520
Sorry.

114
00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:33.890
And so you can import the thesis from and using this framework.

115
00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:40.210
So we use import community input and by default it will import from node modules.

116
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:46.830
So if you don't give a path like this, so from here, if you want to go one step, what you do like

117
00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:50.050
that, if you want to go one more step or you do like that.

118
00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:55.360
However, if you don't give the path, it will look straight into this full.

119
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:55.870
All right.

120
00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:59.050
So we want to use the end design here.

121
00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:04.530
And this, by the way, this is not recommended.

122
00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:07.060
You do not need to get inside this node.

123
00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:07.780
Much is full.

124
00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:12.250
But I'm just saying you just so that you know how I'm importing.

125
00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:12.760
Right.

126
00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.380
And dist.

127
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:17.890
And dirty.

128
00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:20.160
Is this the file I'm trying to import?

129
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:21.870
I guess.

130
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:25.020
However, you don't have to just take into this.

131
00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:26.280
What it's for.

132
00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:27.900
All right, so let's import.

133
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:34.620
And this dust and dirt.

134
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:35.360
See this?

135
00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:37.050
All right.

136
00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:40.720
So once we have the CDC's.

137
00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.490
Let me double take.

138
00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:45.970
Let me go to end.

139
00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:47.890
Getting started.

140
00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:48.790
Come down here.

141
00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.460
I want to make sure I have imported the right way.

142
00:09:54.590 --> 00:10:03.590
So import and dist and to lin copy then just to make sure we don't have any typos beautifully.

143
00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:08.210
It's an all right so we import the end assist put in this file.

144
00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:08.780
That's all.

145
00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:10.610
We didn't have to do anything extra here.

146
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.210
So we can give it a try.

147
00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:17.880
Now it's.

148
00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:18.360
Come here.

149
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:22.730
Have a look at our file.

150
00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.450
Let me just keep reload.

151
00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:28.750
And you noticed a slight change in the front.

152
00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:32.790
That's because now and since this has been already applied.

153
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:36.840
So you can see the overall since it's already there for good to home.

154
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:44.010
You can see the font looks a little different because the CCS is already working.

155
00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:51.270
Now in the next lecture, let's try using some simple component from end design and see how that is

156
00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:51.660
work.

157
00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:55.110
For example, you can see here that we used did Peter.

158
00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:00.990
In our case we can use something simple like maybe button.

159
00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.450
We can try that in the next few.
