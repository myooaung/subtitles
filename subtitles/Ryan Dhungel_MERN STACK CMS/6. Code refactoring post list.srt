1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:06,090
Let's continue with our code refactoring so there's more to do.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,630
So it's good to test.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,180
So we worked on the created new push.

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,330
Now let's work on the all posts.

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,950
So we're showing on the post here.

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,500
So what I want to do is this list of post.

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,780
I want to move to a different component.

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:22,290
All right.

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:31,260
So let's close this this post admin post index.

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,090
So we have the huge effect fitting of the post from the back end.

11
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,350
We have the edit and delete functions.

12
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:49,050
And then here we are returning the list of post to a list of posts we have using the list component

13
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:49,560
we're using.

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:58,940
And basically, we have the main button, we have the title which is here you have the bottom row,

15
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:02,250
the title, and then all this is a list of post.

16
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:02,970
All right.

17
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:09,570
So this list, I want to move to a separate component, which should be very easy.

18
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,320
So let's go inside components.

19
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,780
First, let's file let's call it post list.

20
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:22,530
All right.

21
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,330
So here, let's import list component.

22
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,930
Let's import link from the next link and then we write a component.

23
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,800
We return to list.

24
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:52,120
We return the list list.

25
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,120
It's going to be a self-closing component.

26
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,910
So we just leave it like this for the.

27
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:06,770
Okay.

28
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,850
So it's closed.

29
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,490
So here we will be receiving the props.

30
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,460
So the props will be at least a post.

31
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,000
So we leave it like that and we can also

32
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:31,550
receive a prompt to delete the posts to delete the post.

33
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,220
Actually it's called handle to Take.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,300
All right.

35
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,670
So basically we want to render out of the post.

36
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,950
So let's go to the index admin index.

37
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:47,120
We can actually copy this component to list all of it down here.

38
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:48,440
Okay.

39
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:59,490
So this list, let's cut from here and put here and replace this with whatever we copied.

40
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:06,680
So you can see this list item needs the data source, which is post and it's item we rendering.

41
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:13,970
We are showing these items edit and delete on edit.

42
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,430
We execute the handle, edit and on delete.

43
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,110
We execute, handle, delete.

44
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,760
So hand ended.

45
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:29,180
Let me just turn to for edit we are taking the user to a separate base.

46
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:29,510
Right.

47
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,770
So and to end.

48
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:33,740
Yeah.

49
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,180
So this is something we could use a link component.

50
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,350
Do it all in line.

51
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,200
Or we can use this function.

52
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,040
I can actually.

53
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,680
Let's use this.

54
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,940
It's not difficult.

55
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,480
It's easy.

56
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,380
So let's use it.

57
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,270
And it.

58
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:03,460
I guess we and getting them as props to these functions for delayed edit as well as we're getting on

59
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,590
the post and we just render here.

60
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,550
So we don't need to make any changes here often.

61
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:12,070
So let's make sure we export this component.

62
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,890
Export default posts?

63
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:17,410
Yes.

64
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:21,240
Okay.

65
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,200
So all we need to do now is import this one and use here.

66
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,540
So it's gone all the way down.

67
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:33,090
So previously we had the disk component, you know, we just saw this component.

68
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:39,630
Now we need to make sure we pass the process, post and to edit.

69
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,010
And then.

70
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,710
And then delete.

71
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:47,810
All right.

72
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:54,950
So now anytime you want to show the list of Bush friends and later, let's say for Arthur, we just

73
00:04:54,950 --> 00:05:01,370
have to import this component and give the post as props and these functions.

74
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:04,940
And that way we will be able to reuse this component.

75
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:07,410
All right.

76
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,650
So let's go and have a look.

77
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,180
Let's make sure everything is there.

78
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,120
Post list is not defined.

79
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,740
64.

80
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,760
Posts list.

81
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:30,290
I think we have an important book import posts list from.

82
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,140
Okay.

83
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:41,680
Great.

84
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:44,770
Refactored.

85
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,720
Here we refactored the list of posts.

86
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,550
They are here.

87
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:56,230
You can edit because we see using the same functionality we are passing them as props.

88
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,630
The same function is still working.

89
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,090
Right, so we just pass them as books.

90
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:08,170
So edit let's try to ring it.

91
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,430
I guess you can see it.

92
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,000
It works.

93
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,770
It will also work.

94
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,270
It's.

95
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:16,810
Try it.

96
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,050
So we have 10% now.

97
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,760
Now we have nine.

98
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,630
Beautiful.
