00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.200
All right.

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.280
So let's walk in the front end.

3
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.200
We want to create a comment component.

4
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:08.040
Right.

5
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.380
So we create a common component and we bring that in our single post view.

6
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.670
We put it right underneath here so that we use the skin, a live coin that sort of looks something like

7
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:20.970
this.

8
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:28.260
So we need a text filled text area where a user can enter the comments and we need a couple of functions

9
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.330
to send that to the backend.

10
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.530
We need a state to put this user input in the state, right?

11
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.720
So let's welcome that.

12
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.620
Let's put that in a component or components post.

13
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.970
Let's let's call it common scrutiny folder.

14
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.360
Comments and let's call it comment from.

15
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.130
Comment from Georges.

16
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:09.200
It's important to use context from our context.

17
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:16.000
So that's one step of two step context.

18
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.990
Of course, context.

19
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.140
Really helping me context us.

20
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.700
That's right.

21
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.590
We need our context because.

22
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.560
Oh, sorry.

23
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:34.850
This simply from.

24
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.790
Use context from react to incident instead of.

25
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.680
We should be important.

26
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.330
Ask the context and then we should import that from React.

27
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.200
Use context.

28
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.080
So the reason we need our context is to leave a comment.

29
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.450
The user must be logged in.

30
00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.720
Right.

31
00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.940
So think that we need this health context.

32
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:11.400
So we have the youth context of context we need some components from and that input and then Martin

33
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.780
from and and then we need a link.

34
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.520
Link.

35
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.500
Let's wait for this.

36
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.770
All right, now let's create a combine concert

37
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.130
coming from a concert and return.

38
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.180
So we want to return.

39
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.340
Let's use fragments.

40
00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.400
So here we want to return the input.

41
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:49.940
Text area.

42
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.500
Actually we can with end design, not just input.

43
00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:02.310
We can use the text area to input basically the one line input which we use in the log in from like

44
00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.390
for a name email.

45
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:10.890
But as you can see, this one now for entering the content, bit more content, we want to have a text

46
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.230
area which will be something like this.

47
00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:23.970
And so from that we we can do structure of text area from input content, text area.

48
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.090
From in between destructive that and then we can to use that here.

49
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.570
Let's not forget to ask for comment.

50
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.920
I asked you to build this comment from.

51
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.980
Let's use text in.

52
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.020
Text area.

53
00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.840
So here in the strict area, obviously we need a state, right?

54
00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.900
So we need that state.

55
00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:12.970
We can have here or we can put in the parent component so we can create a state for comment.

56
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.240
And the later we're going to have a list of comments as well.

57
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:22.720
So we can put all of that in the the page where we need the comment, which is here, the single post.

58
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.970
So we'll work on that first.

59
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:31.210
Let's just give it a placeholder just so that we can see that we're on the right track.

60
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:40.240
So let's have a placeholder here and let's create a button as a button.

61
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.300
Let's call it post post.

62
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:57.710
And for bottom line, let's keep both primary and let's leave it like this for now.

63
00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:03.150
Let's try to import it in our base and then see how this looks.

64
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.200
So coming.

65
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.890
Let's go to Baz's.

66
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:11.980
Post slug.

67
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.810
So this is where we want to show that comment from.

68
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.210
He said, that's a sidebar.

69
00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:20.860
That's the editor.

70
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.180
We have this covered.

71
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:23.800
Let's have a look.

72
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.000
So we have the card.

73
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:37.940
Everything is within the car, including the comment right after this content, so we can do something

74
00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:38.480
like that.

75
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.280
So that's the content in the editor and we can just.

76
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.280
So the comment from you also put that comment from let's make sure we import it.

77
00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:05.430
So that's components comments coming from.

78
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:09.940
Beautiful.

79
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:10.790
So we got that.

80
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:11.570
We got that.

81
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:17.150
We want to make it bigger and better for gap year sleds.

82
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.200
How are we going to do that?

83
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:23.780
Let's good coming from we're going to use the roads just like in regular festival text area.

84
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:28.790
We can use roads I think we can use for.

85
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.650
That's a good size.

86
00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:35.750
Beautiful margin.

87
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.440
But let's kick start

88
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.750
my thought for.

89
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:47.810
Nice.

90
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.220
Okay.

91
00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:57.090
We can have a bit of free reign brewing.

92
00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.050
Okay, that looks good.

93
00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:02.820
So we got the foam.

94
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.470
Let's continue working on this one.

95
00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:11.580
So we need a state so we can put that in our apparent component, which is pushed slope.
