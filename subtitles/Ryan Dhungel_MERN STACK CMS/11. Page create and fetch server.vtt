1
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:01.110
All right.

2
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:07.140
So let's go ahead with the endpoint in the back end so that we can see this in reason for the home base.

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:08.880
That's good, too.

4
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.090
So let's go to road website here.

5
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.010
I'm going to create another route relative dot post.

6
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.810
That would be home based.

7
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.270
So either have to be signed in and admit.

8
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:28.830
I guess.

9
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.830
Let me let's go to another outlet.

10
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:32.970
Cops are middleweights.

11
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:33.600
We need them.

12
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:45.500
So we need requested and is handed to these to be reversed with need and we are applying them here.

13
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.700
The question is admin and then the control function.

14
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.580
We can call it home based.

15
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.630
I guess that's home base.

16
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.980
Now, once we said this in the database, we also need to retrieve it.

17
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:05.240
Right?

18
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.990
So we also need to get this information.

19
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.750
So let's also write that same time.

20
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.030
So we pretty much will be done here.

21
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.670
We'll also be getting the home base, as we said, we should be able to receive the information.

22
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:30.140
And for that, again, the question is admin and let me call it get home base.

23
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.900
Home base and get home base.

24
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.240
Beautiful.

25
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.340
Let's go create these two controller functions in our website.

26
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.880
Controller.

27
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.480
And I actually forgot we have to create a website model as well because before we saved anything in

28
00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.680
the database, we need that.

29
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.960
Okay.

30
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:16.260
Concert export concerts won't be close to a song request response.

31
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.740
Try.

32
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.630
Cats and her control of the.

33
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.720
Okay.

34
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.530
So home base and with this one is get home base.

35
00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:40.840
Now, before we do anything here.

36
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.370
We.

37
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.890
I want to create the website model.

38
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.980
Because without that, we can't do anything.

39
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.770
Some model.

40
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.460
It's good a new front website or this.

41
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.390
And here we import mongoose.

42
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.220
We structure object I.D.

43
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.700
from.

44
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.570
Sorry.

45
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.220
Two men lose birth schema.

46
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.670
We need the object already when we are saving the image.

47
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:18.890
We just saved the I.D..

48
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.770
Right.

49
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:25.610
So we save as object I.D., then we can grab the images.

50
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.230
Full information about the images later.

51
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.450
So should be concerned.

52
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.240
Then let's create our model.

53
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:42.190
Comes with side schema equals to new mongoose schema.

54
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.030
So the base.

55
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.150
So the best time.

56
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.080
String.

57
00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.000
No kiss.

58
00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.420
True.

59
00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:02.350
Dream.

60
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:04.440
Requires.

61
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.490
They were.

62
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:15.040
Biz.

63
00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.390
Okay.

64
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.910
So that shouldn't be that perfect.

65
00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.930
So this schema will be used for it can be used for more than one bit.

66
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.660
It doesn't have to be just home base.

67
00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.700
So that's the reason we will have the place with the name.

68
00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.080
I guess it could be Homebase.

69
00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.220
It could be about peas.

70
00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.970
It could be anything.

71
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.690
Right.

72
00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.280
So that's why we have the base.

73
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.120
And then basically we just want the title in total.

74
00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.970
That's pretty it.

75
00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.460
But string.

76
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.870
Required to thank and then subtitle.

77
00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.240
Time string required to.

78
00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.500
And actually we need one more.

79
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.330
That is for food with immense.

80
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.550
Fun with him is.

81
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:19.810
This would be the type of object I.D. and the required object I.D. and then it will refer to to the

82
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:20.770
medium models.

83
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.340
Right.

84
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.390
So that's where we just hitting the 80 because it would refer to the media.

85
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.600
And that will give us all the information, including the viewer.

86
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:31.210
All right.

87
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.580
If you want, you can also use timestamps to timestamps.

88
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.110
That will give us the created and updated time by default.

89
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:55.690
Now we can expose default mongoose model website with capture interpret and that based on the website

90
00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:56.200
schema.

91
00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:56.830
Beautiful.

92
00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:06.610
All right, so we've got the scheme and we can start saving the information in the database, and it's.

93
00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.420
That looks good.

94
00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.650
Let's continue working the controls.

95
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.430
We have to import that first to this import.

96
00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.680
Model's website.

97
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:28.720
Okay.

98
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.650
So once you have that, we can continue working here on the home base.

99
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.710
First, all the data we'll be receiving in the request body.

100
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:49.510
First of all, we need to find base from request body because we don't want to send the same base multiple

101
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.840
times.

102
00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:50.020
Right.

103
00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:56.050
So if we have already created the home base for the first time, you don't want to keep creating the

104
00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:57.110
home base again and again.

105
00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:57.460
Right.

106
00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:01.570
So if if it hasn't been created yet, then you want to create.

107
00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.390
But if it has already been created, then you want to update it.

108
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.230
That way you don't have any duplicates.

109
00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.210
So that's why I always said schema, always have the space field.

110
00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.260
Okay, so we're going to take first, second space.

111
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.700
You can request money.

112
00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:22.060
So we will be receiving that base information.

113
00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:25.980
Create peace.

114
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:36.240
The title and description actually for this.

115
00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.590
So we're not getting the page at the moment.

116
00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:44.090
So we have to manually send because this customized pages for the home based.

117
00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:47.620
So that means when it is submitted we want to.

118
00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:54.690
Send the players in then so that we can do that here.

119
00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.440
Base and we can hardcoded the value clone.

120
00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:06.330
Now you can create another customized base for about another customized base for something else.

121
00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:07.410
You can do that.

122
00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:11.190
But this one especially, we are doing it for the home base.

123
00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:16.560
So that means I think it makes sense to just call it our base instead of home base.

124
00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:22.200
So let's make the sense, make the change and pass this hardcoded value as well.

125
00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:24.840
And then let's go back to our route.

126
00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:34.110
So since I have things that change here as well, just kind of got it off base and then to get when

127
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:39.720
to give the value so that could be home about anything, right?

128
00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.070
So that would be dynamic.

129
00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:44.070
All right.

130
00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:54.410
So base to create because here we will be getting the name of the beers in the request body, just like

131
00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:57.200
we send the base name.

132
00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:00.010
All right.

133
00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:03.230
And then whenever we want to get the base again, we send that name.

134
00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:09.680
And if it is home, we'll find that home base by querying the website model.

135
00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:10.730
All right.

136
00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:15.050
So with that, let's continue here, though.

137
00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:17.870
We will be resetting the base in the request body.

138
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:19.730
And we know this time is going to be home.

139
00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:21.680
So what are you going to do here?

140
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:24.950
First we tried to find if it already exists in the database.

141
00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:30.020
We need to know that the cost phone equals to a weight.

142
00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:38.600
We've said model use, find find one function.

143
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.480
So we are find based on the base, right?

144
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.160
We find mission face.

145
00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:47.390
And if we find that means we cannot create.

146
00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:50.660
We have to actually update that found one.

147
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:54.500
If found, then we will update.

148
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:57.500
Otherwise we would create.

149
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:06.400
Okay.

150
00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:13.000
So if found, what are you going to do in order to construct updated evidence to.

151
00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:16.060
Website.

152
00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.530
It's async.

153
00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:23.880
We've said don't find one an update.

154
00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:32.800
So we want to find based on the base and then whatever an update is the content that would be request

155
00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:33.330
but.

156
00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:40.930
Anything with sight.

157
00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:50.250
Sorry, but I think the police now get so frightened by the pace and object, the request, body, whatever.

158
00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:55.270
We got new thought out of them and we can give new.

159
00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:01.770
All right, so that's how we operate and then we can return response.

160
00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:07.380
Jason Update So any update we send that that is done.

161
00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:14.490
But if we didn't find that means we have to create I guess a consecrated equal to await if say create

162
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:19.830
based on the request variant, then we immediately serve like that then.

163
00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:24.990
A written response, Jason.

164
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:26.840
Create.

165
00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:28.760
Beautiful.

166
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:30.840
All right.

167
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:35.640
This we will be able to create a base now to get this base.

168
00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:43.110
You can see here in our route will be we will need to receive this argument draw wrote for Amsterdam

169
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.860
based name.

170
00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:45.630
In our case it will be home.

171
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:47.220
All right.

172
00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:49.530
So here to get that home.

173
00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:52.350
Let's not call it home.

174
00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:56.000
Let's just call it get biz because it could be any.

175
00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:02.110
I guess let's make the teens get Bay's.

176
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:03.670
Let's make the teens.

177
00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:08.480
Create.

178
00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:11.610
Like I said, it's called create peace and get busy.

179
00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.260
Make sure it's into Israel.

180
00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.060
Create space.

181
00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.700
Get this.

182
00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:20.910
Both.

183
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.310
Create Cribbs get his.

184
00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:35.840
And then we have the control functions that we have function for create base.

185
00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:40.200
And get peace.

186
00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.270
We going to right now so get peace.

187
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:47.400
We have to force destructive based from request params.

188
00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:52.410
And then we found we try to find a way to voice that, find one base in the base.

189
00:12:53.040 --> 00:13:01.920
And if we find we want to populate as well, we need to know the full width full with them is.

190
00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:03.760
Again.

191
00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:07.370
Then we send that found base as a response.

192
00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:09.590
All right, so this is it.

193
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:12.260
We should have no interest in the back end.

194
00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:14.240
Actually, we do.

195
00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:17.560
Okay.

196
00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.130
Response.

197
00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:20.080
That's the a of request.

198
00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:23.750
Linguists.

199
00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:28.900
Beautiful.

200
00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:32.470
So let's move to the front and one more time.

201
00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:34.480
And then here what we want to do.

202
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:37.810
I'm pretty sure we should be able to save.

203
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:39.130
We'll give that a try.

204
00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:43.150
And then we will also use use effect to get the base.
