1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,570
All right, so let's work in the front end.

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,130
Let's add that load more feature.

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,090
So here in the bases.

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:20,030
Pay this post to hear of first request, we continued make using the gift service approach so that our

5
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:23,600
building society rendered so we can leave it like that.

6
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:36,560
But when we get our post for the very first time, then we can put this post away in a variable in the

7
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:41,420
state, and then any new post that comes up.

8
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,750
Using that Lord moment, we just going to add to that state and render here.

9
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:51,040
So here.

10
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,110
First, let's create a state.

11
00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,090
So.

12
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:10,600
KONST Let's make sure we have some deep the hooks to use the state we're going to need in food to use

13
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:14,140
state and then use effect.

14
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:26,010
So yeah, grants, let's call it all posts because the post name is already used here.

15
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:33,540
So let's just all post and then set our posts in which to use state.

16
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,920
Here by the front.

17
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,940
We give this valley post which will be ready before the component even starts.

18
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:46,720
So this base will not be rendered unless this function runs.

19
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:51,070
So that means when we are ready to display anything, we would already have that.

20
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,270
So we can show that to you.

21
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,790
I'll post and then we're going to have the total as well.

22
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,220
So we're going to have the loading as well.

23
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:10,410
We can use that cost total set total, it goes to use state and we give the default value of two.

24
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,140
Now this total will be coming from the back end.

25
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,540
So how many posts we have in talking?

26
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,370
So we wrote that throughout our control function in the previous lecture.

27
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:28,050
That will give us the total total post that we have in the database to make a request to get this value

28
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,580
using you state.

29
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,630
So to use effect.

30
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:38,610
Okay, so we put that here and then if the total in the database, if that is higher than what we have

31
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,070
in the state, that means we can share the load more.

32
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:44,790
But I guess that's for total.

33
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,970
And then we are sending the base number on each request.

34
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:53,160
So we use Bayes, said Bayes are listed and we give the default value of one.

35
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:54,590
Okay.

36
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:58,540
So with all of that, let's use the music fit.

37
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,690
So first shrink is to me to give the total.

38
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:14,300
So you get it's quite gift token and we execute that function.

39
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,400
Let's put that function down here.

40
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,870
Wants to get totally.

41
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:20,270
Could we try.

42
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:35,110
So to get the total, let's make sure we have access.

43
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,310
Okay.

44
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,300
So we have.

45
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,340
So we get the data.

46
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:59,580
From excuse a sweet excuse to get to make a get request to post count definitely give us the data and

47
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:04,110
we use that data to put in the states using set total.

48
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,070
And that would be data.

49
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:13,470
They will not be processed because it will just give us the number because we use that.

50
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,320
The government can't function.

51
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,030
We used.

52
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:23,650
Oh, little miss.

53
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,210
So you think that's at the very end?

54
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,160
Yeah, it's a common document.

55
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,260
This gives us the exact number, too.

56
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,940
That's the one we had written.

57
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,690
Okay, said total data.

58
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:42,620
Now at this point we should have the total in the state.

59
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,800
You can even have a look quickly.

60
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:45,920
Let's try.

61
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,570
Let me just put it right here.

62
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,020
You can see we have total football.

63
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:00,630
So you can see that for.

64
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,280
That should be more than that total.

65
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:17,140
That should be 40, not four.

66
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,540
We made a request before and we support it.

67
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,880
So that must be one must be missing somewhere.

68
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:34,210
Let me just put it in a by the way, you know, you could be getting anything, so it's always good

69
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,440
to have independent control lol.

70
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,900
Toby Well, let's have a look at the console.

71
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,950
We got the total for him.

72
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,300
All right, so that's good.

73
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,980
So we got the total.

74
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,430
Next, we make a request.

75
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:02,390
I guess.

76
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:02,750
So.

77
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,150
We need to have the the button.

78
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,190
Actually, let's create a button here.

79
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,950
So we have this one rule.

80
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:14,800
Let's create another rule and enter this through.

81
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,380
We do have a button right in the center so we can use column.

82
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:24,410
Column columns span 12.

83
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:29,140
And then we use this style to center the text style.

84
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,610
Text a line.

85
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:34,900
Center.

86
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:38,330
Thank you.

87
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,520
So here we show the button.

88
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,400
Let's make sure we import button.

89
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,890
And we put that burden on him.

90
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,420
And we discarded loads more.

91
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:09,040
And then here on this bottom comb, we give the size loss to one last button type primary that will

92
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,570
give us that nice blue button.

93
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,320
Loading.

94
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,810
While it's loading, we want to set this to loading so it is disabled.

95
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,820
They can click and on clicks.

96
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:29,090
So this is the important one and click when it's clicked.

97
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:36,110
We want to execute a function that will make a request to back backend on the same yard but with a different

98
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:36,560
value.

99
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,240
All right, so on click.

100
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,340
We want to make that request.

101
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,990
Not to make that request.

102
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,700
We can just increase the pace in the state.

103
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:57,380
So whenever that Bayes value changes, we can execute a function in a use effect to use effect to,

104
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:01,910
you know, it runs whenever the dependent value changes here.

105
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,060
So what I'm going to do is we're going to use create another use effect and use this space as a dependency

106
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:08,300
here.

107
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:17,630
So in that bed tenders so one click on click when we change the value of base from 1 to 2 to the three

108
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:23,180
like that, whenever that tends, we want to execute a function that will load more post by making a

109
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:28,790
request to this end point with the whatever base number we have in the state.

110
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:29,450
All right.

111
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:36,680
So all we need to do here is increment the base state and so on, click.

112
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,790
We use our function here, set base.

113
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,360
So whatever base we already have with that plus one.

114
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,240
Okay.

115
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,580
So that's what we do.

116
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:54,070
On click, we increment the value of base in the state.

117
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,250
All right, so let's have a look.

118
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,070
So we've got that lawnmower button.

119
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,840
That is not sentence.

120
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,620
Let's see.

121
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,680
Start.

122
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:16,640
Okay.

123
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,310
So that's good.

124
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,710
Maybe we can have beautiful batting.

125
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:24,990
That's it.

126
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,930
Batting 10th.

127
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,990
It's a bit of a gap, maybe even 20.

128
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:39,510
Okay, so at the moment when we click, the base number increases.

129
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,020
So we want to create another user effect.

130
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,380
Let's put that you use effect.

131
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,790
And interdependence is going to be base.

132
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,420
So whenever the base changes, we make a request.

133
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:10,930
We make a request to load more posts so we can call that.

134
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:14,440
Let's call that load more.

135
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:23,550
We said that we need to read that function, so let's read that function here and load more.

136
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,210
So here first thing we do said learning to troop.

137
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:44,430
All right.

138
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:55,380
And then if we get in here, sit loading falls here what are you going to do is will make a request

139
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:04,290
using excuse that only give us the data so it excuse to get we make a get request to get on the post

140
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,580
slash post and we also sending the business right to that space.

141
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:12,330
That could be that would be too.

142
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,650
So by default is one.

143
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,010
But when the button is click, it would be true.

144
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,640
If they click again, then it'll be three.

145
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:26,220
So, all right, so that's the value we send and then we'll get the value we'll get on the post.

146
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:30,090
So what we want to do at that point is whatever we already have in the step.

147
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:31,080
So as you can see you.

148
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:38,210
The post that we get from this gets those same props from the very first request.

149
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:44,450
When the page loads we get, we get all this post that's already here that is already being rendered.

150
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,570
Now, in addition to that, we want to add more.

151
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:48,140
All right.

152
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,970
So we want to add more to this.

153
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,330
All posts, so said all posts.

154
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,250
So whatever we already have.

155
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:07,340
So this is the array, all posts, whatever we have, we spread out and then we add these new posts.

156
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:17,900
So we just spread the array a post again, spread the earlier post that we just got and just set the

157
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,000
values to set our posts.

158
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:20,570
All right.

159
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,790
So that will keep the previous ones and post the new ones.

160
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:27,470
Okay.

161
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:29,810
And then send loading to Fox.

162
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:30,800
We set it false.

163
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:33,190
All right, perfect.

164
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,790
So this is all we need to do.

165
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:44,270
We get the total count, and I click up the normal button, we increment the base.

166
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:51,950
So whenever the base increment, we execute this loading of false that will learn more posts and Morris

167
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,690
with the existing ones.

168
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,150
And now let's the all posts.

169
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,570
As you can see, we are.

170
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:05,330
We are not we are not returning that.

171
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:09,420
So instead of post, let's use all posts.

172
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,270
Let's send it.

173
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,340
Okay.

174
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,360
Let's hope.

175
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,720
So let me give a base load.

176
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:25,030
Okay.

177
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,650
So we're getting all the posts.

178
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:31,390
Okay.

179
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,940
So I noticed one small issue that is you can see we have the same force.

180
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:40,570
Same six force has been requested twice.

181
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:48,760
The reason for that is because of the use effect it runs with the component mod, it runs automatically

182
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,030
and then whenever this well it's in that time also orange.

183
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,620
So that means it already ran.

184
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,340
But we don't want to run this on the very first time, right?

185
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:01,240
So we want to run only when the base increments.

186
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:08,230
So what we can do is we can use this one if statements are if base equals sequence equals one, we don't

187
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:08,980
want to do anything.

188
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,320
So we just use written keyword.

189
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,670
So the code will just return here.

190
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,730
It will not execute any any court here.

191
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:22,270
So if base is one return, don't do it.

192
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,390
Because by default we have the base one.

193
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:32,440
So by default when the page loads don't do anything because that time we already have the post from

194
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,990
this function and that is here.

195
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,250
So we are rendering this one.

196
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:40,600
So on the very first time we did have to do this, so return.

197
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:47,920
But if the page is not one, that means when the button is clicked it becomes two and three and four.

198
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,770
So at those times we want to run.

199
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,650
Okay, so with this, let's come here.

200
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,140
So let's give a reload.

201
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,620
And you can see here we have six force or we have six force as expected.

202
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:06,590
Now, if I click here, we load another six.

203
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,920
Code refactoring.

204
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,420
Like it looks like this same.

205
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,710
And it's the same.

206
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:24,510
I mean, like you say, it's all learning simple.

207
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,400
So let's see how we can fix that.

208
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,050
Okay.

209
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:37,990
So I realized one typo we made in our controller and it's a request query.

210
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,510
We're not actually sending queries.

211
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:44,860
We are getting the parents who are limiting that to programs.

212
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,470
All right, so let's change that and give it a try.

213
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:57,030
I guess we could six post effective lord more.

214
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:01,260
Now this time we're getting the current post so they're not repeated again.

215
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,880
They're different.

216
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,200
Okay, so now that's all that's on the post we have.

217
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:12,120
We finished, we have some total foreign, but we still have this load mode button visible.

218
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,310
So let's fix this one.

219
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:21,690
So if all post, it's all posts that we have in the state.

220
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,820
If that is smaller, then the total that is coming from the database.

221
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:29,300
If that is true only then.

222
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:34,610
So the but now here what we can do.

223
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:39,590
We can just put in our entire row actually.

224
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:42,890
So let's cut and let's use here

225
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,300
all first.

226
00:16:55,030 --> 00:17:04,780
If all posts don't live, if they're all posts total we have is smaller than total.

227
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,730
Total we have in our database.

228
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:11,660
Then we want to show this row with the normal path.

229
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,210
All right, so here.

230
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,530
Is that cool?

231
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,250
Okay, so we aim for the bottom the entire row.

232
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:23,860
Only if the outpost is smaller than the total we have.

233
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:25,480
All right.

234
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:28,690
Now you can see it's immediately gone.

235
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,550
Let's try again one more time.

236
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:34,840
Okay.

237
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,130
We got six lot more.

238
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:38,590
We got more on the season.

239
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,820
That's altogether 12 and then load more for 40.

240
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,690
That's on the post 12 bearded.
