1
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:00.990
All right.

2
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.890
So we have the numbers, but we want them to look something like this.

3
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.890
For that, for you to use this progress component from it.

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.390
So instead of just writing them here, I want to put them in a separate component so that it's it's

5
00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.680
it's not a lot of code repeated.

6
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.040
It's time to show the post comments categories, you know, four times.

7
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.250
So let's put them in components.

8
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.090
Let's call it inside posts.

9
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.390
Let's call it the render.

10
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.800
And the progress starts in Syria.

11
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:49.650
First, let's import the progress from and then we import.

12
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.620
The debate is now this one we haven't actually installed.

13
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.100
So this one is to show the numbers since.

14
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:01.520
The condom.

15
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:03.150
18.

16
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.950
For that effect, we used another NPM library called React to.

17
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.130
We can't do this one.

18
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.150
And we have to come.

19
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.390
The sense of that.

20
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.990
All right.

21
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.520
Oh, that's quick.

22
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.170
Let's start now.

23
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:59.610
Let's import that import can do from react count and then it's input the main component from.

24
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.550
Next link.

25
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.080
So actually we don't need to import in all the other.

26
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.360
While the patient we can't remove from it.

27
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:10.220
Okay.

28
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.760
So here, let's run a function contest.

29
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.880
Render progress equal to.

30
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.640
So here we make it clear what we use link.

31
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.130
Interlink.

32
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.000
We need to have anchor decks, eh?

33
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.340
And then tied here, we want to show the progress.

34
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:37.410
Progress?

35
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.980
Time we can do the type we want to use sample.

36
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.100
Check out the documentation for if you want to, you know, take out all these options available.

37
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.950
So tight circle.

38
00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.390
Oh, stroke column.

39
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.820
You can use nice, beautiful, red, green, blue, all the nice colors.

40
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.260
But I'm just going to keep it simple.

41
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.100
I'm just going to just use black and white.

42
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.420
And I actually want to use a gradient color you can see to gradient color.

43
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.810
So I want black and white kind of a gradient color.

44
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.740
So you can take out the examples, for example, for gradient.

45
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.430
This is how you can apply structure gradient.

46
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:28.670
All right.

47
00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.130
So let's try to struggle

48
00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:34.640
0%.

49
00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.440
I think it might be much better if you just copy from here.

50
00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.610
Stroke on.

51
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.160
Let me just grab this from a script that.

52
00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.570
I replaced that.

53
00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:05.240
And it's a struggle starting from the zero that I'm going to use the score since it's six, and then

54
00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:13.490
you can have 0 to 100 or you can have three costs or another one you can have a different color at 50%.

55
00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:23.040
So 50% another color if if white, and then 100%, let's use one, one, one.

56
00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.920
All right.

57
00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:31.210
And then percent, 100 and then four.

58
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.430
How are you going to display we want to use the discount.

59
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:37.070
All right.

60
00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:44.870
So we need to receive the numbers as props and then we can use count two.

61
00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.830
So count to the number or whatever that is.

62
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.050
So if we have the 50 posts and then that will be the count.

63
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.530
So that will be the number.

64
00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.940
All right.

65
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.050
And speed.

66
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.200
We can choose the number.

67
00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.100
Multiply 100.

68
00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.580
All right.

69
00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.350
So that means we should be receiving this number as props.

70
00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.190
And then you can show the name as well.

71
00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.040
So you can see here, let me show you the finished example.

72
00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.950
We are showing the different names, right?

73
00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:28.820
Not on the number.

74
00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.110
We are showing the name as well.

75
00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:37.190
So we can also pass the props and use you name and then link to link.

76
00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.600
Let's give the default value of this has again.

77
00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.700
So if there's not a link passed as props, then we just use this default hash.

78
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.160
Otherwise we use the link.

79
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.970
All right.

80
00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:57.110
So we can pass these values to this function of this component when we're using it here.

81
00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:04.060
And to show the name, we can just use a paragraph.

82
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:16.170
And here we show the name and I want to make them all uppercase, so to case I can use that function.

83
00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:25.730
Now let's give a bit of a style and this one has a margin top 18.

84
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.030
So it has a bit of a margin on top corner.

85
00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.940
66.

86
00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.600
All right.

87
00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.070
Now let's explore.

88
00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:40.410
Ready to progress.

89
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:53.250
So let's import this component and use this to display the numbers here in the admin index and we pass

90
00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.740
these value number and name and link.

91
00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.130
Again, let's go to index.

92
00:06:59.130 --> 00:06:59.820
Let's import.

93
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.690
Components posts.

94
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:10.600
Range of progress.

95
00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.390
And then we use that.

96
00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.390
So instead of doing this, we now use that component.

97
00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:26.600
Now we need to pass the process number, and that would be number border post.

98
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:32.410
We can pass the name posts and the link.

99
00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:33.460
We can pass link.

100
00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:34.180
That would be.

101
00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:37.970
This one.

102
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.500
This ad means this post.

103
00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.270
All right, so let's see how this looks.

104
00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.030
Number is not defined.

105
00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:01.900
Range of progress to the numbers.

106
00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:03.130
Number.

107
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.110
Nothing was returned from Ranger.

108
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:27.450
Written statement is missing and been left.

109
00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:42.450
This.

110
00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:50.060
I'm pretty sure this is not from here, even though it looks like it is from the syringe of progress

111
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:51.780
we export.

112
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:55.260
Okay.

113
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.120
So I see what happened.

114
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.680
We use the curly breasts or when we use the cord, which we had to use the return keyword.

115
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.410
That's why we had that error.

116
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:17.130
Much of that.

117
00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:24.910
A riff experts who string in link but could only find.

118
00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:30.990
Oh, that is a true history.

119
00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:36.510
Uh, we using to link here, right?

120
00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:37.600
So we can link.

121
00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:41.920
Okay, so if a link is given, we use that.

122
00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.360
Otherwise, the default when.

123
00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:45.370
All right.

124
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:54.830
I'll give you a good, beautiful tandem count towards the top and zero.

125
00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:58.970
And then we have this beautiful the count.

126
00:09:59.520 --> 00:09:59.800
Right.

127
00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:02.330
So networks.

128
00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:11.000
Now if you didn't want to write treat and cure since we have just one block which link you could just

129
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:19.250
remove the curly brace and then you have to write written cure I guess to this reality it works.

130
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:21.840
Okay.

131
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:25.810
So now we can use this friend to progress as many times as we like.

132
00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:28.410
So we used here for post.

133
00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.550
Now we can use again.

134
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:30.750
So let's copy.

135
00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:33.970
Corporate is based here.

136
00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:38.130
So this one was four posts.

137
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:43.440
This one we use for what else we can do here.

138
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:45.630
Post comments.

139
00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:50.940
Next one, just copy.

140
00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.820
Actually, this is one drawer.

141
00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:54.180
Right.

142
00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:56.670
So we copy the entire row.

143
00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:08.040
And based again down here in this one will be four categories in this one for use.

144
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:10.560
All right.

145
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:14.300
So from the very top we have for the post no list since here.

146
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:18.340
This one we want to use for comment.

147
00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:29.260
And then we give the name comments, link admin comments and for the categories we called it numbers,

148
00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:38.710
numbers and categories categories in the admin plus categories.

149
00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:44.050
And the last one, use this for users.

150
00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:50.010
And means less use.

151
00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.350
All right, let's have a look.

152
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:57.760
Okay, so we got this beautiful statistics.

153
00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:58.960
Let's give you two.

154
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:01.150
Let's try to visit.

155
00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.920
You can see we have this country.

156
00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:03.910
Beautiful.

157
00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:08.580
Now on this interview.

158
00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:10.370
I think we don't really need that margin.

159
00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:15.300
I think I wrote audio for the first one for the post.

160
00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:18.760
Okay.

161
00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.630
I think we need to put maybe 100, maybe 50.

162
00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:32.740
Let me just copy all this command and find and replace that with mazel tov.

163
00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:34.270
But replace.

164
00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:35.980
Oh, save.

165
00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:38.170
And you see, that's where.

166
00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:41.170
Beautiful.
