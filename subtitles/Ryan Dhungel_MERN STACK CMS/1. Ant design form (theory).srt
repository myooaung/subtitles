1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,210
So we created this admin layout.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,330
So we have the admin navigation on the sidebar as well.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,370
So it looks something like this in the light theme and dark theme.

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:19,810
By the way, if you want to change this navigation color in the light theme, let me show you that prior

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:25,890
monster, the one finished project so you can see on light more.

6
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,210
It looks a bit different it's a it has the dark never used to.

7
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,830
If you want something like that you can.

8
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:32,520
Easy to do.

9
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,920
It's good to talk now.

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,450
And on the menu you can pass past.

11
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,000
Team Doc.

12
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,320
So if you use that, we get something like that.

13
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,960
So that looks on duck as well as light.

14
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,370
All right, so let's keep it like that.

15
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:58,610
And the next thing you can see, this content, it's right up to the very end.

16
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,060
So let's add a bit of padding.

17
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:00,530
And there.

18
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,620
So that's here in the admin layout.

19
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:10,360
So we have the content, we're showing the children props, which is this one.

20
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,550
So here, let's add some padding here.

21
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:13,540
So start.

22
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:21,530
Adding, let's say ten picks.

23
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:21,770
So.

24
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:25,240
Elizabeth.

25
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:25,880
That's fair.

26
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:28,580
All right.

27
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:35,210
So the next thing we want to do is start walking in the signing and sign up basis, because as you can

28
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:41,480
see, we have this admin desk world which should be restricted for the logged in user and the users

29
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:47,540
should have the role of admin so that we will have many different users with different rules.

30
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:54,980
So one is the type of admin, another is a type of author, and the others will be subscribers by default.

31
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,780
All right, so let's focus on implementing the authentication.

32
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,600
So first, let's create the pages here.

33
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,350
So let's create the sign up in time basis.

34
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,540
We need a log in from here.

35
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:16,460
Once we have the log in form and then we can get to the user input or whatever name, email, password

36
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:21,440
or whatever they enter, we can grab that, send it to our backend, and that's how we can implement

37
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,060
logging and registration system.

38
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:23,720
All right.

39
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,700
And for that, we're going to use the end is an go from component.

40
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:34,790
So if you visit and then go to components here, you can search for form.

41
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,960
And you can see the exemplar here now.

42
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:46,770
And dissent from component is a little bit special because it has its own state.

43
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:53,050
So you don't have to have your separate state here in your react component.

44
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:53,510
All right.

45
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:58,570
So if you're using a form component from Envision, it will have its own built in state.

46
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:06,610
So you can easily grab the user input and you don't have to worry about storing in a in your own state.

47
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,410
It will you'll have access to that straightaway.

48
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:11,740
All right.

49
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:20,320
However, obviously later, when as we progress through the course, there will be many different pieces,

50
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,510
many different components where we will be.

51
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:27,020
Having our custom state.

52
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:27,460
All right.

53
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:32,010
So we'll use the use state hook and have our own state.

54
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,030
So that is something we would obviously cover.

55
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:42,700
But for this logging and registration we can use, the end is ends file, which has the built in state

56
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,650
and it has some error handling.

57
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:49,190
Either the search summation is very easy to use, right?

58
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:53,800
So you continue to have this kind of a warning central password you can.

59
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:58,570
So in hide the password, they pretty much ready to go.

60
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,470
They're really good.

61
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:03,940
So we can find the one that is very much suitable for us.

62
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:08,800
Obviously, we could use this one as well, but there is one that is really good.

63
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:10,990
So if you come down.

64
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,960
So you can see I want to use something like this.

65
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,040
This is something we can use in logging into register basis.

66
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,360
Right.

67
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,590
So let's have a look at the code here.

68
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:30,770
As you can see, they have the form component and they have input components.

69
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,280
Button checkbox is for this one.

70
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:42,380
And then basically there is a function that will execute when the form is submitted.

71
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,000
So you can see it's a fun component.

72
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,100
And on fairness, this function gets executed.

73
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,990
So on this function we would write some code that will send this user data to our backend.

74
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,510
All right.

75
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:02,740
So you can see this is a file from inside, from a you need the input filter you use from item and use

76
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:08,770
the input I all this code, you don't have to write the rules and keep it really simple.

77
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,710
You just have the form item and the input field.

78
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,140
However, with these rules, you can easily issue these error messages, which is pretty cool.

79
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:17,610
All right.

80
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,350
So most likely you want to use them as well.

81
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,930
So they got the rules, some rules here.

82
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,930
Another input for password.

83
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,330
So that's for email password.

84
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,000
And we have the button here.

85
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,910
Some text link for the puzzle page.

86
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,270
We're going to have that as well.

87
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,580
We will have that full password feature as well.

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,530
And finally, the button say it's pretty straightforward.

89
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:47,140
It looks a little bit bit too much code.

90
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,700
That's because of the rules.

91
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:53,950
If you take the rules out, it's really simple to have fun with the form item and then we have input

92
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,430
elements.

93
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,060
All right.

94
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,500
So nothing to get confused here.

95
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,900
So let's copy this code.

96
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,600
Let's copy this code.

97
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,940
And we can use this in

98
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,190
here in our basis.

99
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,820
Now, before we actually use this one, let's fix one more thing here.

100
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,150
Let's use some icons here so that they look nice.

101
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,280
So let's go to the top now.

102
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,870
Let's bring in the.

103
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,580
I can that we can use that one is called.

104
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,750
I had previously used that one.

105
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,230
That's.

106
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:33,220
Hmm.

107
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,580
I think I have to search here.

108
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:36,930
It's open.

109
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,690
Another friend is an agent.

110
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,520
We will be using quite a lot of them.

111
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,080
I got.

112
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,180
So for user.

113
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,340
Use it and.

114
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:01,140
That's for registries and I think we can use this for registration too, adding we can use that for

115
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,120
extrusion and we're going to use this for logging.

116
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:08,520
All right, so let's use these two components, user add outline and user outlined.

117
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,310
It's important.

118
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:14,860
Use outlined.

119
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:21,490
And another one is user outlined.

120
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:29,300
By the way, you must have noticed that it is my coded editor's theme.

121
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,840
I like to keep changing.

122
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:39,140
I don't like to always use the same car, but hopefully you don't mind the way I change it.

123
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,330
Hopefully I will use this for some time.

124
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,290
It looks pretty cool.

125
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:43,940
I should only use this.

126
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,120
I'll show you that simple.

127
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,930
Let me just use this item first.

128
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,030
So sign up.

129
00:07:52,640 --> 00:08:00,080
So that one, let's replace that too with user and our client.

130
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:05,120
And on this one user outlined.

131
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,850
All right, so let's have a look.

132
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,920
Okay, so that's better.

133
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,820
That's for sign up.

134
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:13,600
That's for sign.

135
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:14,590
Beautiful.

136
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:23,270
And let me just show you the theme that I'm using if you're interested to use the same theme I want

137
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,070
to be.

138
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,190
And go to the color theme.

139
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:30,600
And you can see here, the one I'm currently using is called MCI.

140
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:39,180
Maureen And I say, if you want, if you're interested, just search, search for some name.

141
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:44,280
If you done, if it if it is not already installed, you click here and then right here.

142
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:50,760
So you can search MCI, the one I was using.

143
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,250
So in a naming and service.

144
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,080
And that will pop up.

145
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,230
Maureen and Art that runs.

146
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:11,420
It's not finding it will be as one or two using it.

147
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,550
Let me sit tight.

148
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:15,650
Okay.

149
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:18,890
So, you know, so you get to an end.

150
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:24,500
Sometimes it's a little bit slow, but you get all these different themes.

151
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:29,180
And then he can just use the up and down arrow keys to get a live preview.

152
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,460
These are pretty good.

153
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:37,540
I made actually some this I might use it with live it looks pretty nice.

154
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:41,750
All right.

155
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,510
Let me go back to the one I was using.

156
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:56,560
All right.

157
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:00,370
So we got so.

158
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,660
Bring my side were with command Swift E.

159
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:11,500
So let's work on the sign up component in the next election.
