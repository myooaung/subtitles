1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:00.840
All right.

2
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.580
So we have pretty much come to the end of this project.

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.950
You can see this project looks absolutely incredible.

4
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.820
Now, there's one more thing we can do at the two more things.

5
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:21.270
One is to work on this customisation so admin can change the the title subtitle and the image of the

6
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:21.810
homepage.

7
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.950
And this concept is something you can implement on many other pieces as well.

8
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.440
For example, you can customize post context, maybe some create create some new bases.

9
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.700
You can do that.

10
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:33.200
Right?

11
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.310
So this is a very powerful contributor.

12
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.950
I'm going to show you now and then after this.

13
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.810
We just have to deploy the application.

14
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:40.410
We're done.

15
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.770
And this is something you can use in your real world, use for your self, use for your clients.

16
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.700
Our use for freelance jobs in this is incredible project and I'm pretty sure you learned so much.

17
00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.120
So not only serious, you can build many different types of application after doing this course, I'm

18
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.660
pretty sure.

19
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.030
So now let's see what we're going to do next.

20
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.520
The next one is this admin feature.

21
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.220
They can customize the homepage so you can see you can customize homepage.

22
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.280
Now this is something you don't have to do.

23
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.940
You can just write customize because here not only homepage you can.

24
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.630
You can do a lot, lot more things.

25
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:36.940
So this one technically we did for home base, but you could extend this functionality to create multiple

26
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.330
other bases and control how they look from the dashboard.

27
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.320
All right.

28
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.590
So here you can see what we actually are doing here is we are approaching the images we can pick from

29
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.120
the library, upload a new one.

30
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.880
So we hope we choose the image.

31
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:59.080
We give it a title, we give it a subtitle, and then we create this information will be saved in the

32
00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.620
database.

33
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:10.370
And that means if we save this immense service in return as Homebase and seven the database, then whenever

34
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:18.710
you visit home base here, you can use that use effect to force the IMAS phase, the travel phase,

35
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.130
the subtitle, all this information and display here.

36
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.560
That's how this base becomes dynamic.

37
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.410
That's how you can control from the desperate.

38
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.510
Okay, so that's the concept.

39
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.600
So let's go ahead and work on this front.

40
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.120
So let's use the media.

41
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.940
Let's use the title and subtitle this button so that we have this content.

42
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.670
And then we can send it to the back end and we go in the back and create road and control a function

43
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:47.900
to save it in the database.

44
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.630
And then on the homepage we make a request to face the information.

45
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.670
And if the information is there based on that, we show this dynamic quantity.

46
00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.580
All right.

47
00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.190
So let's head over.

48
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.640
So here, components actually do not in total.

49
00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.920
Let's go to pieces and mean insert here.

50
00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.900
Let's create that new file.

51
00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.580
Customize.

52
00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:24.400
We don't have yet.

53
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.150
Let's create a one in ten Edwin Customized Jerseys.

54
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:32.180
And here.

55
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.070
Oh, actually, this one.

56
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.820
Yes, I created this by mistake or loosely means remove this one.

57
00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.190
I guess it's good business admin customers and here.

58
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.010
Let's start by importing some folks use state.

59
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.840
Indeed.

60
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.750
I think that's all we need for now is state.

61
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.620
From React.

62
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.680
Then let's import the columns in rows row column.

63
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:18.280
Input will be using input button and then image component we will be using to show the preview form.

64
00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.020
And then we need to show the media.

65
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.160
So we import media.

66
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:31.080
From.

67
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.240
So we go one step up, two step.

68
00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.850
Get into components.

69
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.610
Slice media.

70
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:46.510
Next one.

71
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:56.290
We need the context, media context so that we can access the selected media media context from.

72
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:00.400
Context.

73
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.800
Less media led me in to this one.

74
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.880
Let's not forget to import excuse.

75
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.020
And.

76
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.470
Toast.

77
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:27.700
Beautiful.

78
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.970
Now let's create our own concert.

79
00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.180
Customers still will return

80
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:42.710
and we explore.

81
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.870
Customize.

82
00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.470
Let's actually import the admin layout as well.

83
00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.400
We need to secure the space only for admin.

84
00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:01.910
One step to step off components, layout and bound.

85
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:03.080
Okay.

86
00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.830
So we're going to use that.

87
00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:08.100
I mean now.

88
00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:16.810
I mean, just read it and see how this looks so good.

89
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:17.460
Desperate.

90
00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.260
Click on the customize and we have that this beautiful.

91
00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:23.550
Okay.

92
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.000
So we can continue working here.

93
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:35.890
First thing we want is create a state and we also want to access the media context because when we are

94
00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.480
creating this, let me show you the finished only.

95
00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:44.170
You can see whenever, for example, let's say we want to create a home base, the elements for the

96
00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.620
home base, the full with images title subtitle.

97
00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:58.180
So in that case we need to access the library and we can just pick the image and that will be we will

98
00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:59.920
be able to see that as a preview here.

99
00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.740
So for that reason, we need context.

100
00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.570
So let's start for context.

101
00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:10.270
Context, media six media

102
00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.320
equals to use state.

103
00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:19.110
So not used to that will be used context.

104
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:24.200
Media context.

105
00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.300
Let's make sure import this one.

106
00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:32.550
Then State.

107
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:35.180
Konst.

108
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:36.550
Title

109
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:40.060
said title.

110
00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.150
So that is for the title.

111
00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.320
Next one is so title.

112
00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.440
I'm just going to make it a law, Case said.

113
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:51.260
Subtitle.

114
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:52.520
All right.

115
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:57.980
And then contest loading.

116
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:06.830
And the.

117
00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:12.730
So we will be using food with emits said food with.

118
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:23.150
All right, so that's all we need for the state.

119
00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:33.020
Now we need to create a form where we going to use the input so you can input the total done and then

120
00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:33.580
that form.

121
00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:40.670
Finally, we have to submit let's create this function as well from now and the handle save.

122
00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:47.890
I think we'll come back to this for solid.

123
00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:54.440
Now let's work on showing the front.

124
00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:00.920
First we need to lay out a road column.

125
00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:03.380
Column.

126
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.960
And 24.

127
00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:15.350
And here actually we can use divisors let's import divider from and.

128
00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.560
So we can use divider to show the.

129
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:25.050
Heading.

130
00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:36.700
So here in the divisor I'm going to have a heading

131
00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:46.280
customized home based for this is especially are we creating this from.

132
00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:47.520
To control the home base.

133
00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:54.640
So you had said full with emails title and

134
00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:57.880
subtitle.

135
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:02.310
Okay.

136
00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.410
So far, so good.

137
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:08.250
Now, let's continue working on this fabulous career for me.
