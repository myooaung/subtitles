1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:00.720
All right.

2
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.360
So we have the user update feature.

3
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.230
Now, this feature is something we need for other users as well.

4
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.550
So authors and subscribers, so in their log in they should be able to update.

5
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.130
So this displays we're basically going to show in the profile base.

6
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:17.640
All right.

7
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:26.340
So what are we going to do is we can move this to a different component, so then so that we can bring

8
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:34.470
it in and using the profile base as well as well as here on it.

9
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.010
Okay, so let's go.

10
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.430
So this is the base of the user.

11
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.200
Let me just copy all the code.

12
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.410
Sorry.

13
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.960
Copy all the code.

14
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.280
Go to components.

15
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.130
Create a new folder called User.

16
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.000
Create a new friend.

17
00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:04.520
Let's call it profile databases and best to do so.

18
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.610
Change this to profile update.

19
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.680
Profile update and we don't want to use the layout here.

20
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.590
So it's removed that it's coming back to come down to return the amount that.

21
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.580
And let's make sure we have the inputs correct.

22
00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.450
So we are here.

23
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.570
So we go one step, two step back to the root.

24
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.440
So components media.

25
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.230
So that is right here.

26
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:48.040
So one step up.

27
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.170
That's familiar for context, we just need to go to step up.

28
00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.410
Okay.

29
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.110
All right, so we have moved the code.

30
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:11.350
Now let's bring this component to our patient so we can give the admin layout.

31
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.870
And all this written block.

32
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:27.910
When we can keep the and be narrowed and do everything else and instead we can do so that component

33
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.660
to let's also remove this function.

34
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.390
Started all this.

35
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.950
We don't actually need to do more of that.

36
00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.680
That means we had to move all this.

37
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.560
You know all this and then just import that components.

38
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.160
Import profile.

39
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.060
Update from.

40
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:05.930
Components, the user profile update and we put that here.

41
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.520
Beautiful.

42
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:10.390
Let's have a look.

43
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.160
All users.

44
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.620
Edit.

45
00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.590
Wow.

46
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:19.220
That's good.

47
00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.350
It's for a different use.

48
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.870
Yeah.

49
00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.920
It's great.

50
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.920
No, this space is something you will want to show when they visit the profile as well.

51
00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.800
So basically it's same thing.

52
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.180
But since you have that menu item, let's do that.

53
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.940
So that didn't have to go to edit.

54
00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:47.970
And actually beside the admin are the users will not have the list of users to click on the editor.

55
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.390
So obviously we need to sort this somewhere.

56
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.870
So we can just put it in the profile.

57
00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.340
So that should be.

58
00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.930
Profile.

59
00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.360
Okay.

60
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.030
So we have to change the link.

61
00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.450
Based on the the used decimal.

62
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:16.310
So for admin profit, when we click with that, we take them to admins less user id.

63
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:21.370
We can give that a different name.

64
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.540
So let's copy this one.

65
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.420
We can call that admin.

66
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.950
The scrutiny turned into Scarlett.

67
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.840
And

68
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.570
we didn't really need to use the ad.

69
00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.530
We can call for friend, as you know.

70
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:52.220
But let's escort a lady in case we need to do something extra in future.

71
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:53.180
So it's got a name.

72
00:04:53.510 --> 00:05:02.450
We could call it profile as well, but let's call it and then paste that and change this to admin profile.

73
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.730
And in profile we saw this profile component.

74
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.660
So from here we go.

75
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.580
One step, two step.

76
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.460
All right, that's rock.

77
00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.480
And let's go to that admin.

78
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.200
Nev, Nev and Nev.

79
00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:39.580
Down to profile.

80
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.400
So it's going to be I mean, it's less user I.D..

81
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.590
So we don't have access to user ID here.

82
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.220
It can be the logged in user story.

83
00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:57.360
So we can use that.

84
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.520
Mm hmm.

85
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:09.420
I think it's better to use profiles and just use profile so much easier because we can pass data.

86
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.100
But since we're not using the IDs.

87
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:13.430
There's no point doing that.

88
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.670
So they just used profile and useless profile.

89
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.260
It's cool.

90
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.810
And it sends this name to.

91
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:24.060
Profile.

92
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.150
It's nice and easy.

93
00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.490
Splitting the desk world with the object user.

94
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:41.580
It still works.

95
00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:43.290
It works.

96
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.350
But if you go to the profile now, you see you have different.

97
00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:51.280
Baz is here.

98
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:53.920
We can still sort of savor.

99
00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.260
Administrative file.

100
00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:58.680
Okay.

101
00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:00.090
That's the issue.

102
00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:03.780
Okay.

103
00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:09.300
So when it is clicked, we don't actually have the user I.D..

104
00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:11.220
Okay, so it's my badge.

105
00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:11.610
Sorry.

106
00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.310
Let's go back in to do I.D..

107
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:17.190
So we have to do these things.

108
00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:20.610
Otherwise, you know, sometimes we have to try different solutions.

109
00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:22.920
Sometimes one might work, sometimes one.

110
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:24.620
The other solution works.

111
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.670
So in our case, we have to have the I.D..

112
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:29.480
Scooter admin nerve.

113
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:35.840
So, user I.D., we need to somehow get the user I.D..

114
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:38.990
No, it doesn't.

115
00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:42.550
We don't actually need to know the ID in advance.

116
00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:45.310
So what we can do is in React.

117
00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:52.960
We can pass the load.

118
00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:56.210
And you decided because this is the profile of the user.

119
00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:56.840
Right.

120
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.140
So Head reflects his colleague Bruce Betts.

121
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:04.940
Slice Edmonds less.

122
00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:09.000
I don't want to use the word dance.

123
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:09.910
I'm just glad.

124
00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.070
Okay.

125
00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:16.850
Copy that.

126
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:23.180
Let's do the same thing here and hope that some of that takes place that beautiful.

127
00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:25.170
Come here.

128
00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:27.660
Ryan.

129
00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:31.990
Oh, it is no different.

130
00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:34.150
We don't have the context here.

131
00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:35.350
Okay.

132
00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:39.610
We don't have let's bring that into use context.

133
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:58.820
So for one step or two step of context off and we use that here.

134
00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.590
So to use context.

135
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.000
All right, let's revisit the US.

136
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:34.050
Now, we may also need to fix one more thing here in our profile after that is sorry admin id so we

137
00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:34.830
should so.

138
00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:37.450
The sidebar.

139
00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:38.730
All right.

140
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:42.130
So that's that will be included in the list.

141
00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:43.250
All right.

142
00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:46.280
Let's go profile it.

143
00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.060
We don't see this sidebar here.

144
00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:53.830
Why do we not see the side of.

145
00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:02.600
Let's go to admin index admin layout.

146
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:11.480
Some desperate has their.

147
00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.480
The profiles should have that.

148
00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:21.740
By the way, I just noticed this.

149
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.960
It says that to update user profile, let's just call it.

150
00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:46.590
Okay.

151
00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.070
So I just discovered one thing.

152
00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:49.450
It's by mistake.

153
00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:53.170
So I imported the admin profile in x4 to the admin profile.

154
00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:59.530
So everything else, this didn't work because we import it and we export that.

155
00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.930
No, I never did that intentionally.

156
00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:06.360
We imported and just exported doing anything that also works.

157
00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.210
That's good to know.

158
00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:13.960
Anyways, let's make sure we export this one instead.

159
00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.620
Profile is not defined.

160
00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:28.360
Profile update.

161
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:39.240
We give a different name to whatever we imported, and that also works.

162
00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.870
So you can do it even when you do, mister, you learn quite a lot of things.

163
00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:44.730
Beautiful.

164
00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:47.580
So we got our new sidebar back.

165
00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.890
We have this upload, feature, upload.

166
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:54.010
Option.

167
00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:55.000
And here.

168
00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.210
Actually, if you read your the page, you don't actually see anything here.

169
00:11:58.990 --> 00:11:59.320
Okay.

170
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.280
I figure of the issue.

171
00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.720
If I reload, it doesn't work.

172
00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:09.640
And that's because here in the profile update we fixing the using reason but we have the outlook where

173
00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:14.680
did I read the this might not be available at the very second with the component mounts it might take

174
00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:16.210
a few milliseconds.

175
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:22.840
So when it's not available, obviously the idea wasn't sending it to the back and we don't get the response.

176
00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:31.060
So we can take and make sure we run this huge effect when this really changes.

177
00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:36.580
So he let's use this have the dependency into this array for use effect.

178
00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:41.590
So whenever that changes, whenever it's there, we run this request.

179
00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:44.940
I guess with that tends to continue.

180
00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:50.280
