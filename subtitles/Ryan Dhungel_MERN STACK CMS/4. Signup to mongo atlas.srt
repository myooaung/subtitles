1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,510
All right.

2
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,250
So we had some lengthy explanation about our server.

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:13,260
If their medical fees don't work, once we start making requests and analyze are calling our back and

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,710
it makes perfect sense.

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:19,110
And later we will be creating our own models for out of control assessments.

6
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,410
So once you do it a few times, you'll get fully comfortable.

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,560
All right, so before we do anything, we actually are almost ready to send a request to back in and

8
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,330
start saving the user in the database.

9
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:36,390
But before we do that, we want to make sure we have the correct values here.

10
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:42,540
So if we have MongoDB installed locally in your computer, you could do something like this.

11
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,920
MongoDB equals less less localhost 270176 less.

12
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,420
The name of your project.

13
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:49,410
It can be anything.

14
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,550
All right, so if you have the MongoDB, it's locally.

15
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:58,860
This is something you could do, and that's all you set with the data.

16
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:07,590
However, if you don't have it, you can always use Mongo Atlas, which is not of us as a service in

17
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,130
the cloud.

18
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:09,570
Let me quickly.

19
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:14,160
So first, I'm going to show you how to install.

20
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,170
TV.

21
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:21,920
In case you are interested, I recommend you to install locally.

22
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,790
It's much easier.

23
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:30,500
You don't have to keep signing up for Mongo Atlas every time you want to create a new project because

24
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,020
you get only one free connection.

25
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:43,040
So you can always go to the official docs and they have the instruction, whether it's for Windows or

26
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,340
Mac.

27
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:43,940
All right.

28
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,010
So if it is for Windows, you take it on.

29
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,920
If it's a mac, you take the link.

30
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,110
So it's for windows.

31
00:01:55,490 --> 00:02:04,910
You can download the community edition, you can download using this link and go to all this instructions

32
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:05,690
step by step.

33
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:14,120
If you run into some issues, you can Google it and most likely you will find your solution in the Stack

34
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,380
Overflow or some ghetto issues too.

35
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:29,900
It should be good to go following this guide and if you're a mac you can use homebrew to install.

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,780
MongoDB.

37
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:34,990
Right.

38
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,500
So you can install boot and run this.

39
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,650
Come on to install it in your computer.

40
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,280
All right.

41
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:49,570
So that's if you want to install locally, but if you don't want to go through all that hassle, which

42
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:54,850
is a one time hassle and it's always easy, but you can always check out the Mongo Atlas.

43
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:55,290
Right?

44
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:57,940
Similar atlas.

45
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:07,630
And it's don't always click on the ad because it takes you to some random pages that's makes you lost.

46
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,130
So click here.

47
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,840
MongoDB Dirt comes at the start of this week.

48
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:13,030
You.

49
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,080
And you can sign in.

50
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,380
You see, you can sign in if you already have an account.

51
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,700
If not, sign them.

52
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:27,240
So I'm going to just use one of my existing icon to sign up.

53
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,180
You can log in with Google, which is the easiest option.

54
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,610
However, I'm going to.

55
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,790
I actually am going to log in with a little.

56
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:40,680
It's so much easier if you don't have a fresh account that you want to use.

57
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,320
Maybe just quickly create one email account just for the purpose of this course and just use this so

58
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:46,920
much easy.

59
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,250
So let me log in with Google and I'll get back to you.

60
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:51,480
All right.

61
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:58,170
So I have logged in using a new email I just created for this project.

62
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:06,870
And when you sign up for the first time and you get a little bit of different screen, you see something

63
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:11,340
like that and that's I saved and submit the privacy policy.

64
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,620
But once you have already created, I can't do it will look a little bit different.

65
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:22,010
So you'll learn directly to your dashboard based on what we need sending up.

66
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,990
For the first time, you might see some extra windows.

67
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:30,270
Like, for example, do this window, you know, celebrate extra because it's a first time.

68
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:30,600
All right.

69
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,950
So what is your goal today?

70
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,760
Build a new application.

71
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,050
What type of application?

72
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,630
It's content management.

73
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:44,610
That's the or is it preferred language, languages, JavaScript finishes.

74
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,560
So we want to use the free one.

75
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,960
So let's hear it.

76
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:51,270
Yeah.

77
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,610
So you get this option so you don't really have to do anything.

78
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,370
It's anyways chosen by default.

79
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,740
The free plan we're using.

80
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,180
I believe in Australia.

81
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,950
So Sydney's chosen.

82
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:12,880
But if you're living in some other countries it might Senate or the Senate.

83
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:19,590
So it basically means there's several will be near your location so you can have better performance

84
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,940
at a level like that.

85
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,080
You don't have to do anything.

86
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,460
The only thing you might want to do here is give your classroom a name.

87
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,790
Let's call it modern in this.

88
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,880
All right, so let's all create a cluster.

89
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,750
We get 512 and we're free, rather.

90
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,320
All right.

91
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,670
How would you like to authenticate your connection to on a MongoDB connection to your shrink?

92
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:50,920
So that is the one you get which you can just put in your Ian Macfarlane, start to connecting a database.

93
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,070
And for that you need to create a username and password.

94
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:57,950
Now don't get confused that username and password with your actual account.

95
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,630
That's a different the username and password you used to log in.

96
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,290
That's different.

97
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,100
This is different.

98
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,720
I did this just for the connection.

99
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:05,890
So let's call it.

100
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,530
Let me just keep it simple.

101
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,150
Ryan and password.

102
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:12,920
What happened to the bus?

103
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,030
Lead me out to dinner at the password.

104
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,140
Copy the password.

105
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,140
Come back here and let me just based here.

106
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,830
Just so that I didn't forget.

107
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,090
Because it's really important.

108
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:25,870
You don't lose it.

109
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:29,540
All right, so we got the username and password created.

110
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:29,950
A user.

111
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:35,740
This user is we'll be used to using the Mongo TV connection history.

112
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,930
Okay, so it's done.

113
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,400
Next one.

114
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,820
Where would you like to connect my local environment?

115
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:45,310
All right, I'll even link that IP address.

116
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:56,040
You can add your current IP or you can choose all from anywhere, I guess.

117
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:03,390
This 10.0.00.

118
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,560
Honestly, we like that.

119
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:14,320
I get to later, I'm going to added a different IP so that we are allowed to get it from anywhere.

120
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,680
Okay, so let's finish and close.

121
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,290
I can go to the desk for now.

122
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:20,950
This is the desk.

123
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:24,580
Where do you see when you log in the next time?

124
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:27,850
Only the first time we had to go through all that question answers.

125
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,790
So it takes about 3 minutes to provision.

126
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,830
So let me take a break.

127
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:37,420
I'll be back once it's done.

128
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,340
Okay.

129
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:46,600
Surprisingly, it didn't take even 10 seconds, which is something new, because before I had to wait

130
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,410
like 10 minutes.

131
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:48,940
So MongoDB is doing good.

132
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,840
They didn't read it.

133
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:59,200
Okay, so you can see now you get this these options to connect, we need a connection trying to click

134
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:08,560
here and I should click here and then we want to choose this option connected application and you get

135
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,920
these connections.

136
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,290
ST This is what we need.

137
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,290
I said, let's copy that, copy that and close.

138
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,300
Beautiful.

139
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,680
Now let's put that here.

140
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,680
So that is the connection strings.

141
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,730
That is the one we need.

142
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:26,050
And this will give us access to MongoDB in the cloud, which is pretty amazing.

143
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:32,380
Now write this the name in the password that we created earlier, if you remember.

144
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,000
So this is the password we had.

145
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,470
So let me take this password and put here instead of password.

146
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,690
All this bit, including the brackets.

147
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:45,730
Delete that and base to use a password.

148
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:47,920
Beautiful.

149
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,970
That's how you got the username and password that you've created before.

150
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:52,690
Here.

151
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,620
Just for this note, I was going to say thanks.

152
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,210
That is all you need.

153
00:08:58,570 --> 00:08:59,440
Name, password.

154
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,520
And.

155
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,080
You can leave everything like this.

156
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:05,550
Beautiful.

157
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,350
That's all we need for database connection.

158
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,380
Now those colleagues.

159
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:18,530
And once you start saving something in your database, once we start saving users, then you'll be able

160
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:21,950
to see all the data here by going to that.

161
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,430
Browse collection as what I get.

162
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:27,560
And then here you can see the collection.

163
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:28,970
At the moment we don't have anything.

164
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,290
It's empty now.

165
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:35,930
You might still have some issues and if you have some collection issues or let's come here and have

166
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:38,000
a look into the Security Network.

167
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,780
Access six.

168
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,670
You may need to enter your IP includes current ABC.

169
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,270
Let me.

170
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,170
Click on this one.

171
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:54,810
And what I want to do is you could use our current IP.

172
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:57,700
But I'm going to.

173
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,510
Enter IP address ops.

174
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,240
And this is.

175
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:10,050
Previously, they had one option that would allow you to connect from anywhere.

176
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:18,780
Looks like they a that probably you can try using this option which will detect your IP address and

177
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,310
put it here and you can just save.

178
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:20,910
All right.

179
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,320
So they will leave it like this.

180
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,550
I think this will work.

181
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,040
Let's have a look.

182
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,570
If not, just try that.

183
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,520
Just enter.

184
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:34,410
Click this button that will pre-populated your IP and this thing.

185
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:35,850
All right.

186
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:41,940
And next time when you logon, you probably land.

187
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,910
And this is always good here to browse the collections.

188
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:53,790
And if you want to get the connection string again, you go here, connect, get it from there again,

189
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:54,900
the same thing.

190
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:02,490
And if you want to update the the password, you can go to on down to this axis.

191
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:12,630
This is the user we created you can edit iTunes is password is all right beautiful excluded database

192
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:21,180
browse collections who did have anything at the moment now with that since anytime you make any changes

193
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,850
to any file, make sure to restart your server.

194
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,050
I guess that's really important.

195
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,460
So let me go.

196
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,540
It's a running pygmy store and let me start.

197
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,450
And hopefully this time we don't get this connection there.

198
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,080
How good is that?

199
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,550
I can see here that it is connected.

200
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,520
This text is coming from.

201
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,360
This one is coming from here.

202
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:51,170
The end to point here we connect.

203
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:57,710
If there is any issues we control of the error or those we print out these sticks to be connected.

204
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,000
So in our case, it has been connected successfully, which is absolutely amazing.

205
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:13,760
That's what we've done with our set up for MongoDB on the next legs on the next and let's sign up to

206
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:23,360
send route so that we can send the immune cells over and then we're going full speed with our project.

207
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,020
We're going to send requests from here.

208
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:32,330
Start signing up, signing in and all that amazing stuff ahead.
