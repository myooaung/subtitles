00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.930
All right, let's work on the delete function that is as.

2
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.530
So we have the dated function.

3
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.390
It's work here.

4
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.360
First of all, we ask them to conform because sometimes they might click on the button by mistake.

5
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:17.410
All right.

6
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:23.390
And then so what we do here is we make a request to go.

7
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.500
Data includes a rate excuse.

8
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.100
Don't

9
00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.310
need to make a request.

10
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.660
We need to send the comment idea which we get here.

11
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:48.860
So click we give this as an argument to this function so we we have access to this common to we send

12
00:00:48.860 --> 00:01:04.400
the idea and then we get the response against data that okay if remember we're sending the okay to if

13
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.240
it is deleted.

14
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.730
So it's not cost if it's if data.

15
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:23.170
Okay, then we want to filter the comments are in the state and we want to remove this one that has

16
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.770
been deleted

17
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.160
if data.

18
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.510
Okay.

19
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.580
Sorry, this should be parentheses.

20
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.500
Okay.

21
00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:44.110
So again, use the filter function and this time we filter filter out everything else except the one

22
00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.950
that is deleted.

23
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:52.000
So we take if the comments that we have in the stood, if that's added, does not match with this deleted

24
00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.160
commentary that went all those items we want to filter out and just put in the common state.

25
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.210
So this will exclude the deleted comment.

26
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.480
All right.

27
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.040
And then maybe you want to sort of notification measure success

28
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:22.530
comment deleted successfully and you also want to update this talking point.

29
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.130
So I think that will.

30
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.200
That should get updated once the comments changes.

31
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.260
So I think we can do it like that.

32
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:38.510
Otherwise we could use Citadel or actually we have to do that totally.

33
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.870
Whatever totally we have plans for this is for the preservation, so for the residence.

34
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:51.380
And you can see we saw the normal button based on how many we have, how many comments we have in the

35
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.010
database.

36
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.200
Right.

37
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.720
So when we delete one item, one comment is down.

38
00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.060
So the total also we want to update that this is for the pagination.

39
00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.680
Okay.

40
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.190
So we have 42 comments so far.

41
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.420
We have few comments.

42
00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.570
Let's try deleting one, get one.

43
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:12.560
We get 41.

44
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.870
Delete 40.

45
00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.710
Awesome.

46
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:18.140
Great.

47
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:19.700
So this works.

48
00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.170
We have all this.

49
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.600
The Common Management System for admin.

50
00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.780
Now we want something similar for other users as well.

51
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.780
So subscriber and the regular user.

52
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:40.410
However, it will be a little different because you can see here for the admin we are showing, we are

53
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:49.140
fitting all the comments but for other users we should face only their comments if they have a left

54
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.420
and comments which should fit only their comments and then those comments they can update and do so.

55
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.250
It will be a little bit different, but we can pretty much reuse of this group.

56
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.450
So let's go ahead implement that for other users as well.
