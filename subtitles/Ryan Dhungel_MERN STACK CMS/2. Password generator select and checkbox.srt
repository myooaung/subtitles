1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:06,360
So the next one we want to create here is going to be something like this general password.

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,660
So we need to have this button here and this input here.

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,580
So, you know, both in length.

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,220
So we can use Flex for that.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,100
And then we have this.

6
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,910
Drop down and then we take books like I guess let's keep.

7
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:26,660
Up to the left side.

8
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,010
So let me create a deal.

9
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:36,290
Use the style display clips.

10
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:49,890
All right, so here, inside here, we are going to have a button and the input.

11
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:50,970
All right.

12
00:00:50,970 --> 00:01:01,020
So button and didn't button, we can call it generate password.

13
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,330
And then the next one is going to be the input field for password.

14
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:06,510
All right, so input.

15
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,450
And if we're going to use this input for password, we can actually use it like this.

16
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:23,540
I said, this will give us this side feature by default, which is here you can see.

17
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,720
You can see and hide.

18
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,560
It's nice.

19
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:28,880
I can select.

20
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:33,650
We can use that with input dart password.

21
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:35,390
I see.

22
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:35,690
Here.

23
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,180
First, let's work on this button.

24
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,350
It's a button.

25
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,090
Let's use glee on the clip.

26
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,500
We want to generate the passion.

27
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,010
Right.

28
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,760
So by default, we'll have the ordinary password in the state.

29
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,630
But if we click again, then that will generate a new one.

30
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,680
So on click we use our function

31
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,360
ssid password.

32
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,670
And that could be generated or generate.

33
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,980
And you give the length.

34
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,140
Length six.

35
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:25,130
I get to that click type button type default.

36
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,710
We don't want any color.

37
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,360
We don't want it to be grimy.

38
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,590
Anything just different.

39
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,330
I say we use last.

40
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,130
So we're using input alternates and bottom.

41
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,510
So trying to zero zero ten zero.

42
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:44,600
So we can continue using that one filter to change that.

43
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:51,380
It actually looks a little bit to get, but if you don't like it, just turn the value.

44
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,640
All right.

45
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:56,240
So this one looks a little bit of.

46
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,720
So that's input passwords to little open the input password.

47
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:13,080
Actually, this one is a self-closing compartment, so it's heated like that.

48
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,250
First we use style surmising.

49
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:21,420
Just then, zero ten zero, I think we use ten zero.

50
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:26,280
Okay.

51
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,680
So that's how it looks a little bit too big as opposed to use ten bits and I use tiny,

52
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,810
tiny zero ten to.

53
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:39,570
All right.

54
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:54,630
So let me quickly find and replace ten days from 20 to 10 to command B command F find 20 become replaced

55
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,890
with ten weeks of this very list, click to change.

56
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,240
So you see things everywhere.

57
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,310
Command s to save.

58
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:05,010
I guess that that's we're actually on this one.

59
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,920
We may want to use 20, but for the rest we can use ten.

60
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,980
Let's go on the top on this one.

61
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,150
We can use training and the rest we use system.

62
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:17,640
Okay, nice.

63
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:19,480
Okay.

64
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,500
So generate passwords.

65
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,900
So we've got this input password and got the style sites.

66
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,290
Size loss.

67
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:47,550
Placeholder password, value, password and on chance.

68
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:55,910
So we give the event, the user input, and then we use that put in the state.

69
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:00,770
So we have the auto generated one, but if you want to manually type, then you can do that.

70
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,320
Okay.

71
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:07,680
So you can see what the general posture is.

72
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,820
They can change that.

73
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,380
Oh, they can.

74
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,960
Just type is awesome.

75
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,080
Name, email, website, password.

76
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,110
Next one will be the dropdown for the role.

77
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,870
So after this div, let's use the select component.

78
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,190
Select.

79
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,700
And default value.

80
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:42,350
So we're going to have three types of rules for the user, subscriber, admin and author.

81
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,480
So by default, users will be subscribers.

82
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,200
So when you create by default, you can use the value that's called.

83
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:54,900
Subscribe iTunes and stand here.

84
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,590
Some margin, 10 to 10.

85
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,450
Do we use that with?

86
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,870
We can use with 100%.

87
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,450
Next one on.

88
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:23,560
Since we get the value from the select options, we will have the option to do so, whether it's subscriber,

89
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,910
author, admin or whatever that is.

90
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:27,880
We put that in the role as a string.

91
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,220
Okay.

92
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:30,610
So.

93
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,850
That means we need to have the option for the user.

94
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:35,150
Right.

95
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,200
So.

96
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:43,290
Here, we give them the option to select an option value.

97
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,580
The first one we can use the value of subscribe.

98
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:55,320
Next one we can use the value of admin and next one we can use the value off offer instead of just copying.

99
00:06:55,330 --> 00:07:01,540
It is to add to this to offer.

100
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:14,040
And so whatever option you choose that will be accessible here and that will be set as a rule in the

101
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,460
state.

102
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,240
And finally, we can show the box as well.

103
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,220
So we have the password.

104
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,420
We have this option.

105
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:23,500
Next one.

106
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,090
Let's.

107
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,660
Use the.

108
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:32,600
Tick box.

109
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:38,190
So.

110
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:38,570
Yeah.

111
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,600
Tick the box ticked.

112
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,640
So the did we use the value, whatever that is.

113
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,830
If that is to in true.

114
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,550
Otherwise it would, it would not detect.

115
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,090
I guess so.

116
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:53,750
On ten.

117
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,570
What do you want to do is you get the event and you want to turn it to.

118
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:08,940
Event dot target two.

119
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:18,950
Actually two.

120
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:19,940
That's a tick box.

121
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,160
Here we can show some text.

122
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:34,550
So send the new user an email about their comments.

123
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:43,220
And you see, if you do, then we're going to add a feature in our back in to if it is saved, we will

124
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:47,870
send the user the email with their account details.

125
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:49,850
Okay.

126
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:50,840
So that looks good.

127
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,630
So we've got that now.

128
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:53,900
So.

129
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:02,650
Let's add a burden and then we can work on that submit.

130
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:11,830
All right, so take the monks button and let's call it submit.

131
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,980
So only we want to execute the function called handle.

132
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,540
Submit, which you already have done.

133
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,750
It's a button type.

134
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,850
Let's make it simple.

135
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,070
It's default.

136
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,800
Has the demo type submit.

137
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:33,200
I guess so.

138
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,190
And have they had similar.

139
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,510
This is actually.

140
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,500
Actually, it's not important.

141
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:48,150
If we were using the phone, then sometimes when you finish the form, you hit enter that will submit.

142
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,070
So in that case, you could use that.

143
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:56,070
But in our case, we're not actually using phone, we just using bunch of individual inputs.

144
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:59,920
So the function will execute on button too.

145
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:04,830
So we don't actually have to have that style

146
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:14,940
magazine again, lets you send value and actually just copy that.

147
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:28,520
Loading so we can double the value of learning to true and false.

148
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:33,950
So while it's loading is true, you don't want the bottom to be clickable.

149
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:38,090
So we use the learning so button will be disabled.

150
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:39,170
Okay.

151
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:42,350
So next one is block.

152
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:49,280
So if he is block the button will take the full available with instead of just being in a tiny little

153
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:49,550
path.

154
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:55,670
So it's block and that is all we need to get the front.

155
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,930
All we have to do is work on this function.

156
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:04,190
And then, of course, we have to create the out in a controller in the back end so that we can create

157
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:04,820
a new user.

158
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,270
Right.

159
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:10,370
So now before I do anything in, let me just continue long console table.

160
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:14,830
So let me have a look at all these values that we have in the state.

161
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:20,000
Make sure we have access to all this value before we send it to them back.

162
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,040
Right.

163
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,390
So for I see the role of it.

164
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:25,880
It's not to use.

165
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,270
Let's see.

166
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,080
Why is that?

167
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,650
Sylvester.

168
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:35,880
All I can say to that can stay like that.

169
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,040
So let's try here table.

170
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:45,960
Let's try to print out all of these names and name, email, wayside.

171
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,730
Classroom rule.

172
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:59,050
So let's make sure we have all these people we work on excuse to send this debate.

173
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:08,260
Pull me

174
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,560
in a minute.

175
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,770
Let's try this one.

176
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:27,170
I guess it's leave the password of a new one.

177
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:36,770
Also, like I said, let's make this user author send an email to me and you can see who we are.

178
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:41,030
We have all this information name, email, website, password, role too.

179
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:46,190
So all this information we send to the back end and in the back end we will quit in the user.
