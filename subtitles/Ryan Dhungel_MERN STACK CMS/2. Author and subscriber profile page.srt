1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,110
A profile.

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:02,860
I built this user object.

3
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,130
It works, but there are few things we have to fix.

4
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,930
For example, I'm logged in as admin.

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:14,490
If I go to all users, I can update any user, including myself, which I did.

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,500
Let me try updating another user.

7
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,530
Ryan I didn't make it all.

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,240
Ryan The

9
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,090
two networks sling the images.

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,210
So we got to submit.

11
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:37,230
That works.

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,660
So that is good.

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,190
Admin can do it.

14
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:48,430
However, if you log in has all three years you wouldn't be able to update your profile.

15
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:53,200
That's because the endpoint you know back end.

16
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,290
All still am just keeping this file close.

17
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:57,910
Others.

18
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,790
So, you know, wrote us.

19
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,990
You're going to object.

20
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:09,820
We only have this endpoint and that request to use it to be added.

21
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:17,650
So if you try to update the profile and if you're not admin, you won't be able to access.

22
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,120
Now that's the easy fix.

23
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:27,220
What we need to do is maybe duplicate this controller, make a small change, because you can see here

24
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:31,090
we are basically this route takes for the admin user, nothing else.

25
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:36,670
But when they when you use it, they're trying to audit their own profile.

26
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,270
We want to make sure that user is currently locked in.

27
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,260
All right.

28
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:50,460
So we find the user from the database and if they are to use this address the logged in inside only

29
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:56,790
then we will allow him to update to make sure he's updating his own profile, not everyone else's.

30
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:03,270
So for that small extra tick, we can just duplicate this controller, maybe call it something different.

31
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,100
Call profile user.

32
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:06,180
Object user.

33
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,950
And use that in a different route.

34
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,330
So we create a new route, new controller.

35
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,530
How cold it will be pretty much similar in the back end and in the front end.

36
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,850
The only thing we have to do is somehow change this route.

37
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,750
So when admin is using this, we use that.

38
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:26,070
If.

39
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:36,450
Other users are using it, then we just use object user so we can use the we can pass this route, this

40
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,790
endpoint as a prop whenever we using this component.

41
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:48,150
That way it will be dynamic at least to let me just try and log in as Ryan the awesome.

42
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:56,120
Okay.

43
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,680
So I have access to profile.

44
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:58,580
I can go.

45
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,180
Actually, let's quickly fix that so we can give that a try.

46
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:03,780
Let's go.

47
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,850
Two components layout also.

48
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,460
And then in here in the.

49
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,360
Sorry, not lay out nerve on the neck.

50
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,250
And here, let's do what we did with Ed.

51
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,940
So we need to access the health context.

52
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,200
Give me a split screen.

53
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,920
So this at a minimum, this is.

54
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:37,350
What a nerve.

55
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:42,450
Let's import the context.

56
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:45,510
Let's import the use context.

57
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:48,500
Come down here.

58
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:49,980
Let's add this to.

59
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,870
It's you put it in context.

60
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,840
And then we can use that as.

61
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,040
All the way to the end profile.

62
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,070
We send used that.

63
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:17,340
So he's back in the.

64
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:22,390
All right.

65
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,790
So this should be after stress.

66
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,500
Back to stress.

67
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,790
Also stress logged near the side.

68
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,460
I said let's use sin.

69
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:38,690
Here is rule.

70
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,900
Something to note with

71
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:10,760
Kobe besting author Lance Armstrong's usual 90.

72
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,190
Okay.

73
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:18,700
Let's try.

74
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,160
Good to death for.

75
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,720
Profile.

76
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,790
No guests author profile.

77
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:28,270
No, we don't have that base for author.

78
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,330
So we can go ahead, create that base.

79
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:38,950
And see how the profile update will work.

80
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,310
So we will have some issues.

81
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:47,630
And to fix that, we can use the new endpoint in the back controller and route to fix that.

82
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:53,930
Now when I'm doing here, whatever I'm doing here, I need to do that for the subscriber as well.

83
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:56,450
Let's go to the subscriber.

84
00:05:59,130 --> 00:05:59,490
Is.

85
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,420
Actually, it's here.

86
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,650
Subscriber layout.

87
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,720
Subscriber layout.

88
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,350
Again, here.

89
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,330
I want to import the.

90
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,280
I actually better have the contacts on this one.

91
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:13,570
That's.

92
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:17,280
All right.

93
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:21,910
So profile this user will be able to use profiles profile.

94
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,330
They are forever now.

95
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,130
It's good to subscribe and have.

96
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,630
So we didn't have the context use context.

97
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,090
What context?

98
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:57,640
Put in turn the component and use that auth user ID here.

99
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:13,150
Subscriber is less of a user d.

100
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,750
I'm going to copy this one carefully.

101
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,380
Active name.

102
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,410
Let's put it into tactics.

103
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:33,670
Senator, what he has wants active name less.

104
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:39,990
So Cisco's less of a user.

105
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,380
I.

106
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:50,950
Let's try.

107
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,390
This is awesome.

108
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:54,190
He can go.

109
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,850
Well, actually, we just fixed the drought.

110
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:04,440
We haven't created the fund, so let's go ahead and fight as well.

111
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,940
Maybe close this.

112
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,610
Let's go to pieces.

113
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:18,860
After.

114
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,170
Here, we create a new file.

115
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,310
Do.

116
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:29,340
Right.

117
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,700
That's what we did for admin.

118
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,480
I'm going to just copy that.

119
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:38,130
Put in ten.

120
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,500
All tied to this.

121
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:49,210
Layout admin layer instead of admin left command f replace that with art layout.

122
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:54,600
All right.

123
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,120
So we still use the same component.

124
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:02,370
Now, you can see we have the author has access to.

125
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,620
This phase where he can update his profile.

126
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:09,250
Now, at the moment, if he's submitted, doesn't work because.

127
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:10,990
In the back end.

128
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:15,970
This is only for the opinion we have that mill works if I try.

129
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:21,610
You can see he's a fairly stern school for three unauthorized forbidden artists.

130
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:22,300
We'll fix that.

131
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,920
But let's quickly have a look at the subscriber advertising.

132
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:38,170
Subscriber out doubtless create a similar file subscriber could a new file.

133
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:45,550
I did space to change this.

134
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,020
To come on if.

135
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:54,530
Subscribe now save.

136
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,090
And that is all we need.

137
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,180
Beautiful.

138
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:04,010
All right.

139
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:11,090
So obviously subscriber and also they can't update at the moment different if they try they get the

140
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,860
error for three 4 billion error.

141
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:17,600
So let's fix this by going to the backend and creating a new route in a controller funds.
