WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:08.790
Also we let's use use effect here to load all the categories from our back in which will give us the

2
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:09.930
array of categories.

3
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.960
So yeah, let's bring in use effect to use effect.

4
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.250
And then we can use that here.

5
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.670
Use effect.

6
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:37.960
So we want to run this one, the common man, so we can execute a function called let's get categories

7
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.880
that will fit all the categories from our back end using use.

8
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:47.940
Virtually trial

9
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.930
and error.

10
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.630
Okay.

11
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.620
So let's make sure we have access so it's okay to do we have.

12
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.530
All right, so let's try to make a request.

13
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.700
Contests.

14
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:26.550
Districts start up from excuse starts and get make a good trick with two categories less the endpoint.

15
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.660
And that is all we need now.

16
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.210
Sit.

17
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.030
And it carries data.

18
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.180
It's created this in our state.

19
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.130
I think we don't have it, so let's use it.

20
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.280
Const categories said categories was used.

21
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.530
All right.

22
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.060
So we put the categories.

23
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.150
It.

24
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:53.860
Categories.

25
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.500
Key categories.

26
00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.030
Okay.

27
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.880
So that should give us the all the categories in the state so we can have a look at that.

28
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.120
Let's do that right here.

29
00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.240
Some list of categories here.

30
00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.940
Let me just use this in a string of fine categories.

31
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:16.450
No.

32
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.220
Let's give the value for.

33
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.290
That will make it more readable.

34
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.100
Let's have a look.

35
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.880
And you can see here.

36
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:25.100
Beautiful.

37
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.380
So we have got all the categories.

38
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.960
Awesome.

39
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.330
Instead of saying it like this, obviously we can show them in a list.

40
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.430
And that list component is something I have used here in the feast for the deacons here.

41
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.390
It's a nice simple list items and we can show the links for edit into it as well.

42
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.320
So let's use the similar list component from and design.

43
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.530
So for that, let me just import.

44
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.990
At least.

45
00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.620
From end.

46
00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.850
Then.

47
00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.630
Instead of this one, this remote that I'm going to use list.

48
00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:12.320
To list.

49
00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.840
It requires a couple of things.

50
00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:22.400
If you're new to this one, which you might be, you might want to check out the documentation over

51
00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:25.550
list.

52
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.140
So this is how we want to render.

53
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.490
And you can see the sample and how you can be more flexible again.

54
00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.910
So the images and against the title bit of a description down here.

55
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:46.200
So with this kind of layout we're going to use, but later is really another other section of the application.

56
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:54.130
So you can see they have a ray of data, just like we have an array of categories.

57
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:59.200
So they have already offered to simply see the first item.

58
00:03:59.200 --> 00:03:59.890
Second item.

59
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.920
So these are the items they are rendering here in this list.

60
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.540
So this is how this list works.

61
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.930
Actually, this is the self-closing component.

62
00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:14.660
So you can have the header and footrests so you can see a different component or some just this team

63
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:21.490
of a development tag and so header and further if you want which is look something like this one here

64
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:28.280
and footer in our case we don't need that we just need to list out the items so we don't need that.

65
00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.030
Border that you can use that will give you the borders.

66
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:40.490
And basically all we need is these two things the data shows, I guess, in your array of data.

67
00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:41.750
So that is important.

68
00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.030
That's data source and how you want to.

69
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:45.860
So render item.

70
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:53.080
And this is just like using a map map function to map through the items.

71
00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.270
That's the most common way of rendering items in React.

72
00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.780
If we were not using next year.

73
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:00.080
Right.

74
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:01.280
Sorry.

75
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:02.660
If we're not using and.

76
00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:04.700
So you can see render item.

77
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.070
It's basically arrow functions.

78
00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.030
This is the argument.

79
00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.240
You give it you give it get the item.

80
00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.970
It's item from the data it's item.

81
00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:21.080
And each item is rendered to you in this list item component and they have to use typographic, but

82
00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.130
you can just use a paragraph one has to anything.

83
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.510
All right.

84
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:27.500
So let's give it a try.

85
00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.680
So data source and render item, these are the important ones.

86
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.880
So here.

87
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.910
And data source that is.

88
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:44.520
Categories enlisted write and render item.

89
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.800
Rain, Ryan.

90
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:56.600
So it should be called express sovereign right and basically is our function.

91
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.310
So we used our function.

92
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.590
So this data source the categories.

93
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:11.930
So we get each item, each category we get here again, we render that so we can render any way we like.

94
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:17.510
So we can use paragraph de, symbol B together and we can use that.

95
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:24.440
You could use the typography from and design, which basically means the same thing.

96
00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:28.810
And we can use the border as well.

97
00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:31.210
So, yeah.

98
00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.090
Each item lets you use the item.

99
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:37.850
Don't.

100
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.140
Let's see what data we get in the categories.

101
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.150
We have the names load created.

102
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.100
Basically all we want is name.

103
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:46.640
Right.

104
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.210
Let's come here and let's render.

105
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:51.110
And that name.

106
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.520
And let's have a look.

107
00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:56.700
You can see here we have a list of categories.

108
00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:57.360
Beautiful.

109
00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.180
Now let's make it bordered.

110
00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.240
Actually, that's how we want it.

111
00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:04.870
It's.

112
00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:08.400
Um.

113
00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.020
Least.

114
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:20.120
Into a list we can actually use listed item to render these things to render our.

115
00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:23.480
Let's remove.

116
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:25.670
The.

117
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.940
Peter.

118
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:30.490
And let's use Listerine.

119
00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:38.220
Just like you see in the official docs as well.

120
00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:40.300
Lister I am so.

121
00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:40.890
He is that.

122
00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.990
And here we can.

123
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:47.530
So.

124
00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:56.490
The category name soon list dot item.

125
00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.140
Don't matter.

126
00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:00.460
You're going to use this on Israel.

127
00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:02.310
And then here you can show.

128
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:05.590
This is a self-closing component.

129
00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.320
Title you can give.

130
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:11.690
I don't.

131
00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:17.240
I see that we are too.

132
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:19.460
You can display.

133
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:27.520
Next one is we want to show these two icons for edit and delete the right to do the right end here.

134
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:28.160
Right.

135
00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:42.400
So for that, actually, let's use one more thing that is called item layout, item layout.

136
00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:44.080
We use horizontal.

137
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.010
That just doesn't make a difference.

138
00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:56.860
Okay.

139
00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:58.750
So let's show these two.

140
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:07.560
Text to allow the user to edit and delete to that one we can put right here.

141
00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:19.230
Inside that is inside here you can have access away and in this area you have the access for example,

142
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:23.610
edit and doing so and the text this one to edit.

143
00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:26.430
Next one we can have.

144
00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:30.310
Delete this copy that pasted down.

145
00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:36.940
If in fact, we're not going to use history of ammo, then.

146
00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:40.040
Let me remove this one.

147
00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.860
So we go to these times, edit and delete.

148
00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:49.670
I see here.

149
00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.120
Let's make it all lowercase.

150
00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:06.860
And when you when you click on this edit and do it again until we can execute some functions to implement

151
00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:11.770
the edit and did it features what for the moment let's just leave it like that and have a look.

152
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:12.140
Okay.

153
00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:15.200
So we got the category name, we got the edit and delete.

154
00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:21.800
They didn't do anything at the moment, but we will obviously execute a function to do certain things.

155
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:29.330
So it's not looking good on the thing is we have to fix the layout so they should be pushed to the right

156
00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:29.660
end.

157
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:30.050
Right.

158
00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:31.450
So let's have a look here.
