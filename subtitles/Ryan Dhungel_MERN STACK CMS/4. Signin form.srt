1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:00,660
All right.

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:06,600
So now we're going to work on the signing phase, which will also require a similar form, but with

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,610
this form of support.

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,360
So the dark thing, it's pretty nice here, you can see.

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:16,760
All right, let's go to Santa.

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,970
We can pretty much reuse the same code.

7
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:20,600
All right.

8
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:24,950
So to make things easier, let's just copy this code.

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,540
Copy the entire component.

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,340
We could even try to reuse this and we could.

11
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,370
However, you can see, it's pretty straightforward.

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,690
All we have is the form component and the the input files.

13
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,190
There's not much happening.

14
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:48,600
So there's there's no harm in reusing the similar code for displays as well.

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,950
Just to keep things simple.

16
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:57,420
But obviously later, if you feel like you're not just doing some extra work and making reuse of the

17
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,030
same foam in both components, obviously you can do that.

18
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:03,200
All right.

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,540
So we have a sign.

20
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,100
A sign?

21
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,750
And conversely, let's send this to sign in.

22
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:13,700
By the way, I will show you how you can reuse components.

23
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:21,980
There will be many situations I this course where you will be reusing components, especially for images

24
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:22,550
upload.

25
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:27,200
You know that time we will be using reusing the same component multiple times.

26
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:31,070
So that is also covered, obviously.

27
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:32,690
All right.

28
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:33,940
So we got decided.

29
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,620
Now let's change the heading.

30
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,410
From sign up to sign in.

31
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:48,420
Then we want to turn this button from register to log in and.

32
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,040
If they want to.

33
00:01:53,580 --> 00:02:00,270
If they haven't registered it, then we can ask them to sign up so we can take them to sign a petition

34
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:00,660
here.

35
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,540
Let me see what I have written here.

36
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,400
No, it was good to sign up.

37
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:11,970
You can see our register now and we have the followed password link as it was looking to use as well.

38
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:12,880
So.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,960
Words to know.

40
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:22,510
And let me answer this competition and put right under the button.

41
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:28,030
You can see just like that for bustle, because believe it or not, we will have that feature as well,

42
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:32,320
something that you always need in a real world application.

43
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,730
So you learn how to do that.

44
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,460
So I just.

45
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,070
So this one's for for what

46
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,880
most of this place we don't have at the moment, but we will have soon.

47
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,670
So let's just leave it like this.

48
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,280
Let's have a look.

49
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,530
It's good logging in.

50
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,360
Now we have this space logging.

51
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:04,200
So we want to put that on top and then the bottom.

52
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,020
All right, so let's fix that up.

53
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,160
Otherwise, looks good so we can go to sign up or signing.

54
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:23,000
So here is this link cut from here we put on top of the button.

55
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,280
Probably on top of the form item.

56
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:29,430
Okay.

57
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,390
See that?

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,400
Let's have a bit of a line as you.

59
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,620
Sometimes you need to have to lambrecht.

60
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,260
All right.

61
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:45,460
Perfect.

62
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,020
Okay.

63
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,670
It's a similar form we used in the sign up and side in every log in.

64
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,940
If you try it, you get the same result.

65
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,320
We can have a look and then on the sign.

66
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,640
And we also don't need a name.

67
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,300
We just need the user's email and password to log in.

68
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,970
All right, so let's remove that first.

69
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:05,840
From.

70
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,860
I don't have the name.

71
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:10,340
Awesome.

72
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,290
So we just need email password obviously to the world.

73
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:22,210
Let's try one at the gym from some password.

74
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,680
Log in.

75
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,410
You can see we get the value.

76
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,160
Beautiful.

77
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:32,350
Now all we need is our backing.

78
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,860
So we need a backing so that we can send this information.

79
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,410
So that our end can save in the database.

80
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,790
You know, that's how we create a user.

81
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:44,830
And then we will apply the authentication, you know, when the log in.

82
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,460
Basically, when they log in, we will take the user's email.

83
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:54,340
We try to find the user based on the email and take the password that is already saved in the database,

84
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,430
which will be assessed in the hashed version.

85
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:03,490
So we take this split password, has it, and then compare this one with the one that is already saved

86
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,150
in the database.

87
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:08,800
And if the match that means we have the right to use it, we can allow the user to log in.

88
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:09,100
All right.

89
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,900
So that's how we going to implement all this.

90
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,050
So let's take a rest.

91
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,520
And in the next lecture, we're going to generate our backing.

92
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:22,090
Now, that might sound too good to be true, but that's what we're going to do.
