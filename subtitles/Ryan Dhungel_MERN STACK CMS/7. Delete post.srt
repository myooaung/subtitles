1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,940
So we're going to implement, edit and do it first.

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,730
Let's implement it because that's that's pretty easy.

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,110
So let's do that first.

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,830
Let's head over to our server.

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:15,810
Account.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,810
First, let's create that delete from the router.

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,650
Don't delete.

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:31,110
So we need to begin to create around, let's call it force class.

9
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:33,190
On the score.

10
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,880
I did it.

11
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,710
Just calling posterity just to make things easier.

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,020
Host Ali, we can call anything we like and require.

13
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,380
Signing is admin and the.

14
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,420
Control function name.

15
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,040
We can call this post.

16
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:56,340
Okay.

17
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:03,220
And it's clear this under a false name or post.

18
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:14,210
So yeah, export comes in first.

19
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,680
So again, what we want to do is we want to find the ports that it depicts.

20
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:44,120
I suppose equal weight or small fine but added dilute and we give the eyelid that we get from the params

21
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:48,650
a request for we call that post trading post.

22
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:57,290
And so once you delete we can just send a response or get to, you know, we generally need to send

23
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:01,490
this post, so let's go make a request to this endpoint.

24
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,260
So let me fix the type of interrupt.

25
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,900
I can now include two client.

26
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:20,010
So we go to admin posts index and then we have the handle delete function here.

27
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,540
That's the link.

28
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:22,920
So let's to this.

29
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:26,690
Let's try.

30
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,700
Captain Error.

31
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,610
So here we want to send a request using excuse.

32
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,250
So let's make sure we have access.

33
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,840
We do here.

34
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,360
The first, we want to show some kind of alert.

35
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,760
So sometimes by mistake, they might click.

36
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:56,500
So we don't want to immediately delete the post so we can show some kind of alert.

37
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:04,330
We can use a native browser feature that's called window control.

38
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,240
So let's put it in a variable, let's call it.

39
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:17,020
And so it would suit window dart going from just like under that alert we can use confirm as well.

40
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:21,430
And here we can say, are you sure you want to delete?

41
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,570
And the answer will be either yes.

42
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:26,980
True or false.

43
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,240
So if we click, okay, that will be yes.

44
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:34,510
Otherwise it will be false as to if we give the answer.

45
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,980
So if it if we get the answer, that means it will be true.

46
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,130
So if it is true, then we want to send the request.

47
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:45,790
Otherwise.

48
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,810
We want to.

49
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,580
We don't want to send a request, I guess.

50
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,570
So what are we going to do here is actually we can take you.

51
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:00,780
If no answer, then just return immediately.

52
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:01,900
Don't do anything else.

53
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,520
Otherwise.

54
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:13,870
What we can do is we can send a request to in to cast down to a good soup or sweet excuse to delete,

55
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,430
make a request.

56
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:19,020
So the endpoint is going to be less forced.

57
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:19,660
Less.

58
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,680
Most I guess would make a request to that.

59
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,210
And we give the response.

60
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:27,600
Okay.

61
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,860
To, to, if.

62
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,320
Okay, if.

63
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:31,670
Okay.

64
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,140
Data Okay.

65
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:41,790
Then what do you want to do is you want to remove this item, whichever item has been deleted.

66
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:42,860
Okay.

67
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:49,560
So you want to delete that from the list so we can use said post.

68
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,700
So we have we have the context, said Bush.

69
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:54,490
That's where we are.

70
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:57,260
We have all the force so set forth.

71
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:02,190
So in this post we have the post and categories.

72
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:10,260
So we we can use our function in previous values, whatever we have.

73
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,220
We spread out the previous values.

74
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:13,740
And this.

75
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,770
This will contain the categories.

76
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,240
So we don't want to touch that.

77
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,400
Just post.

78
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,180
We want to update the post.

79
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,480
We want to filter out the deleted one so we can use filter function for that.

80
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:33,180
So previous dot posts don't filter.

81
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:36,600
The filter takes a function to use out of function here.

82
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:48,960
So previous post we filter out till we get it post on the filter from the post and we want to filter

83
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,710
out the one that doesn't match with this IED.

84
00:05:52,590 --> 00:06:01,590
I used to post dirt on disquieted not equals equals post dirt in this fight.

85
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,070
So we're going through all the posts.

86
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:09,000
So if that doesn't match the this 80.

87
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:09,660
So.

88
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:11,860
All of them.

89
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,930
We want to filter out so that value, the filter value will be indistinct.

90
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:23,740
Okay.

91
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,630
So we missed the parenthesis.

92
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,500
So let me just.

93
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,700
Wrap all this in a parenthesis.

94
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,740
And again.

95
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:39,330
So that should immediately remove the post from the list.

96
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,200
Yeah.

97
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:41,700
So let's give it a try.

98
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:47,940
So if I try this Friday editing this third post, we have nine posts at a moment in front.

99
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,690
Want to delete?

100
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:52,500
We get this window window dart confront.

101
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,450
So if I can't and nothing happens.

102
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,410
But if I go ahead and click.

103
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:57,720
Okay.

104
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,210
That is due to the third posted video.

105
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:06,880
And we have eight posts so far and I'm sure that is due date from the database as well.

106
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,030
And as you can see, we got on the edge left.

107
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:09,810
All right.

108
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,670
So that's deleting the post.

109
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:14,460
Now, next one, we want to work on it.
