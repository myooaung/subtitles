1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:00,720
All right.

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,460
So before we move on to the different sections of the different sections, it's going to be obviously

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,320
a signing and signup.

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,850
So we want the users to be able to register and log in.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,020
Only then we will give them access to these dashboards.

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:15,300
Right.

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,580
So at the moment, we're just working on the layout.

8
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,650
So before we move on to the authentication section, log in and log out.

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,960
I want to do two more things here.

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:25,590
One.

11
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:30,980
One is so the active link.

12
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:36,410
Now for that, we have to create one or two pages so that we can see how this works.

13
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:41,470
So why don't we go ahead and create a base for creating a new post?

14
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:47,870
Let's create a base and begin to work on when we navigate between bases, how the active link works.

15
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,280
So that's one thing.

16
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:58,640
And then the next thing is I would really like to ah, to collapse this sidebar when we are in smaller

17
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,570
screen size.

18
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,290
All right.

19
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:07,370
When we are in a bigger screen size I want it to automatically expand like that.

20
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:14,900
And when it is a small screen size, maybe people are using in a web mobile that does not I want it

21
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,940
to automatically collapse.

22
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:22,070
So we're going to open those two things and then we're going to move on to the authentication six.

23
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:27,080
So let me create one page, at least one page here.

24
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,980
So that we can give it a try for active links.

25
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:38,730
All right so that's going to be into business admin to and should be able to add a new post.

26
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,200
All right.

27
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,170
So let's call it.

28
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,820
Admin posts.

29
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,460
But it should be a folder that made you move there.

30
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,570
That's fine.

31
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:55,780
So into admin folder, we had to create a new folder called Post and Insert Post.

32
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,090
Let's create a new products called New Jersey.

33
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:05,260
So here we're going to share the admin layout that is already.

34
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:06,840
Here.

35
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,680
That's index.

36
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,760
Let me just copy that.

37
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,330
Good post.

38
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,190
New and tasty.

39
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,270
Let's call it new post.

40
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,100
Copy.

41
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,060
This two.

42
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,250
All right, so we came one step down here.

43
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,740
So we need to go once to go to step or three step.

44
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:34,300
So one more step and then let me just.

45
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,110
Right here.

46
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,680
Create new post.

47
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,460
Let's leave it like that.

48
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,720
No, it's at this place.

49
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,990
You can see this place will be accessible, adds less admin less posts this new.

50
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:03,560
Hopefully that is the you are and we used in the admin navigation and double check admin posts new.

51
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,110
All right.

52
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,280
So that shouldn't be post.

53
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,720
That's a single post.

54
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:10,920
So let's fix that and then let's give it a try.

55
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,620
Now add new me if I click here.

56
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:22,230
You can see I landed on this component and it turns it see the previously we were here and now we add

57
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,450
new thank.

58
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,630
Now when I click on Add New.

59
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:34,010
I expect the link to be active.

60
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:35,190
All right.

61
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,470
It is active now.

62
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,210
If I reload the page.

63
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,680
It's not right.

64
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,990
So that is something I want to fix because we have many components.

65
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,230
Yes.

66
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:53,550
I want to give the users the admin, the ability to easily understand where they are currently.

67
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:53,840
All right.

68
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:59,640
So we want to highlight whichever link we should be there visiting.

69
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,820
I want to highlight it as an act and offer that.

70
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,810
Are we going to access this?

71
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,880
The route I took, that's the domain.

72
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,960
And then there's the road.

73
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:16,910
So we're going to access that and then we're going to compare that with.

74
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,730
The history.

75
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:19,620
Right.

76
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:28,030
So if the current path, the other path in the history, if you can see here, if the Met, then we're

77
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,520
going to said that as an active link.

78
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:30,910
Right.

79
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:34,480
So that means you're going to use some thesis to make it look like acting.

80
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,280
So that's the logic, right?

81
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,420
So we compared the history with the Parthenon.

82
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:42,180
All right.

83
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:46,850
So to get the bathroom, we're going to use the use effect.

84
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,710
To actually use effect.

85
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,280
Hook is something that runs immediately when the component mounts.

86
00:04:53,730 --> 00:05:00,810
So in the React component, once it is rendered on the screen, that's when it would run automatically

87
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,460
when the component mounts.

88
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:02,880
All right.

89
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,720
So we're going to use that to use effect to.

90
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:10,900
So you faked.

91
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,740
We put that here too.

92
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,670
Let's stay.

93
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:18,430
So comment.

94
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,330
You used a fake?

95
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:26,350
No, this is a function, and it takes another function as an argument so we can use our friends in

96
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:26,570
here.

97
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:26,570
You.

98
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,610
So this is another function.

99
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:30,630
I guess it is.

100
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,970
So that's the first argument.

101
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,450
Do you defend takes a function as an argument.

102
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:36,960
That's a first.

103
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,660
And second argument is the defendant.

104
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,850
So here you can pass anything.

105
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:49,530
So if you want to run the court here, whenever this value changes the variable value, then you can

106
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:52,020
put that as a dependency array here.

107
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,440
So we're going to use that.

108
00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:00,960
Now, one of the things you need to understand in next, this is the next.

109
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,040
This runs in both client mode and so more.

110
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:04,410
All right.

111
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:11,040
So you want to make sure that you are in the client set environment first and that one you can do using

112
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:19,530
process dot because there are two two properties you can access in next.

113
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:24,900
This one is persistent browser that will make sure you are in a browser environment.

114
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,650
So if we are in a persistent browser, you can do something here.

115
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,500
Now another one is process dirt.

116
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:32,550
So.

117
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:38,360
So you can take it are in a settlement by using processed do so.

118
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:41,850
So in our case we use browser supported browser.

119
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,580
If we are browser environment then.

120
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:52,650
And so any query right here will execute only if this value's true.

121
00:06:53,160 --> 00:07:00,540
So if we're in a browser environment, we want to set the current value.

122
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:07,800
So we get the Parthenon from the URL and put in a state, and then we're going to compare that with

123
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:09,690
the header.

124
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,840
So that means we need a value in this data.

125
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:19,860
We can call that something called, let's say, current account, current length.

126
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:24,960
So current set current equals to use state.

127
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,080
Leave the default value to empty string.

128
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,840
All right, so if we are in a browser environment, I want to set current.

129
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,730
And I want to set here the value.

130
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:53,080
Of the path here and you can see you all saw the deadline is helping me type here so window dot location

131
00:07:53,080 --> 00:08:02,230
don't but name so that way you'll be able to access the path name whatever is currently at the moment

132
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:12,720
you can access them I think curious you can also control love which I'm sure you just can't.

133
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:17,320
So don't log window to location.

134
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:24,280
Don't let me comment that out for now and let's have a look at the bottom there.

135
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,980
If that gives us the actual path name, let's have a look.

136
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,610
Let's go right click click on the inspect.

137
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:36,520
Student athlete that would be considered.

138
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,190
Yes.

139
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,010
Well, we got quite a lot of warning here.

140
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,280
Looks like we have been.

141
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,820
We have some duplicate keys in the menu.

142
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:51,490
We can fix them.

143
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,550
That's fine.

144
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,560
And we give her a face.

145
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:00,460
Okay.

146
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,930
So window is not defined.

147
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:09,250
So you can see we get that kind of issue because the next year it runs in both environments.

148
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,090
So in play.

149
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,440
So we can do that kind of thing.

150
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:15,040
All right.

151
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,820
So it looks like it's better to just try this inside here.

152
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:25,060
So the fact I want to do that and I want to.

153
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,820
Actually, I could do it here as well.

154
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:45,430
You can add posers, Donna Brazile And if only if that is true, then you try to control the window,

155
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,450
location, Parthenon.

156
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:47,880
No, no.

157
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:48,790
When you do that.

158
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,870
Let me give a quick refresh.

159
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,550
No.

160
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:04,060
You can see we got Parnham, that is less Edmunds, less post, less new, beautiful.

161
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,950
So that's the one we need now.

162
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:09,490
We get the current value to whichever means we are at the moment.

163
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,680
If we go to the decimal, you see decimal.

164
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,590
All these apps we interface that you can see recorded.

165
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,390
And so whichever page you are, you can see that.

166
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,710
So that value we put in the state.

167
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,420
So we put here.

168
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:38,820
And then we're going to compare that with the history to determine which one is the the actively.

169
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,800
Now, by the way, a different select case.

170
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,710
I don't want to use that.

171
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:42,710
Remember that.

172
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:46,630
Because we don't need that.

173
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:52,270
Since we are, we have this code that will detect on which we currently at the moment so we don't have

174
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,070
to sin differently.

175
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:05,860
So let me just remove that and continue him.

176
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:18,410
So if forces, Rosen said to the current, now you want to run this call when we are in the client environment,

177
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:18,770
right?

178
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:24,470
And then when we have the patterning available so we can pass that value, add the dependencies.

179
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:29,090
Well, here, of course, is dog browser.

180
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,300
So whenever we're in Brazilian better do you want to run this call?

181
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:39,710
So you pass it here as a dependent theory and window to location dog.

182
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:49,460
When that is available, then you want to run this code and that will put the current partner in the

183
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:52,070
state with that code.

184
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,980
Let's make sure we don't have an errors.

185
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,440
Okay, so that's looking good.

186
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:01,760
Let me quickly fix try to fix this and then we're going to.

187
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,300
Work on making them active.

188
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,670
Since we have the value already here, it's going to be straightforward.

189
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,840
Let me have a look.

190
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:14,470
So we have the same keys for the navigation menu.

191
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,460
From the ended answer.

192
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,480
Let me quickly take that, Edwin, there.

193
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:20,970
One, two.

194
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:23,160
I think we don't have any duplicate here.

195
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,710
Seven, five, six.

196
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,660
Seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, two.

197
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:31,680
Okay.

198
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,290
So we have.

199
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,030
So.

200
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:38,040
So we've got 12 to 12 and then 30.

201
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:39,840
40.

202
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:47,070
Okay.

203
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:47,640
So that's.

204
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:52,800
Bearer inland collapse not controlled.

205
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,430
Many under suits.

206
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:55,860
It collapsed on the side.

207
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,640
Man still.

208
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:58,730
All right.

209
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,550
So collapsed on the side.

210
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,790
But we're going to work on this one.

211
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:06,120
We're going to dynamically collapse when we are in the smaller screen as well.

212
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:06,950
That's next.

213
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:08,240
So that's right.

214
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,320
Let's do one that.
