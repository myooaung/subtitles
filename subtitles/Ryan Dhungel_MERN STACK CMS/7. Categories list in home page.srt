1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,990
All right, so we could buy Alex Parallax images that looks like this is pretty cool.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:09,960
Now, if you want some kind of a separate which looks something like this, so you're going to have

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,160
this horizontal line with this I can centered right here.

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,230
So if you want something like that, we can easily do that using a divider or two.

5
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,330
Let's import divider from end.

6
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:26,850
And then let's try to use that.

7
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,110
Let's come on with down.

8
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,960
We have the heading heads do.

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,670
Then here we put divider.

10
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,310
And then into divider.

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,340
And the children we can use the item.

12
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:45,420
So that item is called thunderbolt.

13
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,150
So we can import that from and.

14
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,460
Some on this from.

15
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,530
Thunder Bolt Portland.

16
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,100
All right.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,290
And let's try to use that.

18
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:30,180
And you can see here we have got this beautiful horizontal line.

19
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,120
It depends on the background image.

20
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,960
If you have a bit darker image, then it will look more vibrant.

21
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,380
But you can see it's there.

22
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:38,540
Right.

23
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,090
Beautiful.

24
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:41,580
All right.

25
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,790
So that is all it's done.

26
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:52,350
So next thing we want is the categories, list of categories, which is something we can just import

27
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:56,940
our hopes and easily display the categories and then we are going to create the future.

28
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:00,920
Okay.

29
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,380
So after this one, let's work on that two categories.

30
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,260
Let's also create a separate rule for that.

31
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:10,610
So rule.

32
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,040
So we got the divider.

33
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,780
Integral, critical.

34
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,780
I'll give it a full width, of course.

35
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,010
Spent 24.

36
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:36,820
And then here, let's also write some thesis on this school.

37
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:41,250
I want to center the list of categories here.

38
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:46,690
So text line center and bit of a margin on top and bottom.

39
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:49,840
So we have a bit of a gap margin total.

40
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:57,220
Let's give it a D margin bottom eight.

41
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:00,000
All right.

42
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,640
So here I want to map through.

43
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:10,320
The categories are just like we did before for posts like let's actually copy this deep.

44
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:19,470
It's easy to use space here and we just want to send this from let us post to categories we already

45
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:19,950
have.

46
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:27,050
The categories he really do use from the hooks.

47
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:28,520
All right.

48
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,330
So we've got that.

49
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:40,670
So that one, when we click, when you use a click, we tell them to.

50
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:46,890
Category Sloths and sloth.

51
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,280
See.

52
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,140
Let me just call her.

53
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:54,950
See this to me just for the sake of simplicity.

54
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:55,520
See?

55
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:56,930
Category slug.

56
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,940
Category name.

57
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,460
Now, we don't want to destroy history.

58
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,960
Instead, we want the button.

59
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:06,500
Right.

60
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,450
So let me change that to button.

61
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,460
Button.

62
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,660
And then we can just give it.

63
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,780
If you actually try to use tape, let's leave it like that.

64
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,720
And you don't want them to be attached to it.

65
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:27,180
It's over.

66
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,580
So let's give it some margin.

67
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,360
In to.

68
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:35,810
All right.

69
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:43,800
And since this is a map function, we should use a key that we can trigger that underscore.

70
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:45,890
All right.

71
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,580
And let's use this key in here.

72
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,910
I think I forgot.

73
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,770
Post-op endoscopy.

74
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:57,440
Perfect.

75
00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:58,960
All right.

76
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,260
So we got this rule.

77
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:06,110
We were showing all these categories, name in the button, and they clickable.

78
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:06,740
Let's.

79
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,470
Button.

80
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,360
Let's make sure we import that.

81
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:19,760
Beautiful.

82
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,670
We've got only four categories, so they are here.

83
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:23,930
If I click.

84
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,630
Land on the right base.

85
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,070
So we have a lot of post for react categories.

86
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:32,730
Beautiful.

87
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:36,210
Okay.

88
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,510
So the next step is the footer.

89
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:45,000
But before we do that, Fred, let's actually not forget to give it a heading as well for the categories.

90
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:54,400
So right on top of the category, just like before we had the heading.

91
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,420
We can have similar heading in the divided world.

92
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:03,280
So if you want to let me just copy that along with the heading.

93
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:11,620
And then who do you see in this two categories.

94
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:15,740
Oh, I.

95
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:21,820
I.

96
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,760
So you've got the categories now that looks too big.

97
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,880
Let's make something like this small.

98
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:34,060
And this time, instead of using this as I can, we actually put the category itself in the middle.

99
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:35,980
So let's let's do that.

100
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,400
So that means categories.

101
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,940
Actually, we don't need all this heading.

102
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:42,940
Let's remove the heading.

103
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:50,650
And instead of thunderbolt, we use categories text simply like.

104
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:52,400
Beautiful.

105
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,180
That looks good.

106
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:55,250
All right.

107
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,010
Now let's work on the future as well.

108
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:04,100
So we basically showing some icons and some text in the footer with the background image.

109
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,090
It's quite simple.
