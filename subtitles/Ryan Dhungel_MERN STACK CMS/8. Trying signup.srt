1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,440
All right.

2
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:06,290
So at this point, you might want to give it a try so you can try creating a few users.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:13,080
Let's create one user, the instructor, and one student later so we can see how everything works.

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,550
All right, so register.

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,480
I still have this placeholder, which is something you might want to remove.

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,140
Let me just register as one stripe seller.

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,990
Let me log in as the seller.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,710
The instructor create some closest, and then we will try as a student, try to enroll into that and

9
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:38,550
see how it works.

10
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:52,530
So one stripe seller run stripe seller very stressed and successfully logging rights for a set of perfect.

11
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:55,790
All right.

12
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,140
So nothing here.

13
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,360
But he can become instructors.

14
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,120
Let's try that said about.

15
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:02,780
All right.

16
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:20,620
All right.

17
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:27,940
So I completed the onboarding process, and I have my reader back and I have my instructor dashboard.

18
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,500
I can go and create course.

19
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,070
Beautiful.

20
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,410
I have zero balance at the moment.

21
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:41,860
Create course and create has the middle course for beginners.

22
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:43,900
I'm just going to.

23
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:45,870
Oh yeah.

24
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,660
Just copy.

25
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:53,440
I have one course by the way you can take out some free course you in good dot com.

26
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:56,980
So let me copy some text from here.

27
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:07,440
And let me just add some information.

28
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,100
Pain free.

29
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,540
Let's make it free first.

30
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,480
Let's create a free class

31
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:15,930
category.

32
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,380
Has to improve upload images.

33
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,140
Let's just try this.

34
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,680
Let me just.

35
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,510
Let's just use some emails.

36
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:42,310
I guess I still have that in me if you want to remove that.

37
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,270
This is free fire and save and continue.

38
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,380
Okay.

39
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:51,490
So you have this course instructor instead of adding lessons

40
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,850
learned uploaded on video.

41
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,540
Let's go to desktop.

42
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,790
Let me just grab one video from here.

43
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,020
Let me open the inspector.

44
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,760
You might come across one issue here.

45
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,280
If the file is too big, you might get an error.

46
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,870
For that, you just have to add one line of code in your engine.

47
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,960
So let's see.

48
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:32,620
Sometimes you might get max max file size.

49
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:39,340
If you get if you get that kind of fare, you can always get a profit.

50
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,000
That's good.

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,440
Because I wanted to show that when.

52
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,590
Our request entered two lots.

53
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,560
So if you get this error.

54
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,860
You have to do two things.

55
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:04,450
One, you can set the file size in the affirmative in rounds, and then you can also do something in

56
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,330
your next in the next config file.
