1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,660
All right.

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,760
So we learned a little bit about one stack.

3
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:05,580
We had a look at this incredible application as well.

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:12,810
But what it takes to actually be able to build the application, not just that you will watch recording

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,560
and copy that, but also be able to understand.

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,620
Now, obviously, coding is not easy.

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,330
No, it's not like watching a movie, you know, it's watching movies pretty easy.

8
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,160
It's easy to understand the story.

9
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:31,320
You know, it it's straightforward how gaudi's not like that.

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:38,640
So even when you're watching me doing this, you might have to repeat ten times sometimes to get full

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,620
understanding of what I'm doing, right?

12
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:41,700
So it's different.

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:50,850
However, I'm sure you have the previous experience with JavaScript that's extremely important and the

14
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,000
basics of React.

15
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:52,840
This gets it.

16
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,630
This is the minimum requirement.

17
00:00:54,990 --> 00:01:01,350
So when I say basics of React, if you know the basics, that means you know the basics of modern JavaScript

18
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,430
as it because React is basically a modern dance.

19
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:11,970
Could you use the modern JavaScript features, for example, instead of creating using VAR to create

20
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:18,090
a variable, you use LED icons, you use reference and quite a lot, right?

21
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,350
And so many other things like DE structuring.

22
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:30,620
And some of the new features that we will come across, for example, using map function to map through

23
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,790
the array elements, right?

24
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:41,300
So those basics that you use when writing react, could you need to have that understanding?

25
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:50,690
Because even though a month's tech will be earning from scratch, one stack stands for MongoDB Express

26
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:51,590
React in note.

27
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:59,630
So all these different technologies, different frameworks will learn to use all together to build the

28
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,400
robust full stack application.

29
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:04,090
So that process will be from scratch.

30
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,720
However, you need to have the understanding of modern JavaScript and react.

31
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:12,500
All right, now you don't have to know nodes first.

32
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,830
You didn't have to know MongoDB, Node.js and MongoDB.

33
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:19,760
It's going to be pretty straightforward and easy to understand.

34
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:26,810
I will be explaining is in every line of code, so I'm sure you'll be good in that six.

35
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:28,070
All right.

36
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:31,520
Now, of course, everything will be explained very clearly.

37
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:39,440
However, I have to emphasize that the knowledge of modern JavaScript and react is absolutely necessary

38
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:44,210
to take this course so that you fully understand.

39
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:47,980
And whatever I'm explaining to you, you understand, right?

40
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,690
So that's the minimum requirement if you have that.

41
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,880
Welcome to this.

42
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:54,880
Awesome journey.
