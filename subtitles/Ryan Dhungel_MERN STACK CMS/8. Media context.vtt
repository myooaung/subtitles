1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:00.780
All right.

2
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.170
So we've been able to upload the single images, multiple images as well.

3
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.920
Now all this upload, we get the response.

4
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.050
So we want to use that response.

5
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.180
So basically now is time.

6
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.320
The image has been uploaded.

7
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:21.120
We want to boost that to the context so that we have the collection of medias in the context.

8
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:21.930
All right.

9
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.420
And then in that context, we will also add the selected property.

10
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.300
So the images, the last one will be always selected.

11
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:38.680
We will have the array of images and then we will also control the model when to show the model component,

12
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.560
when to show this media model, when to close.

13
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:42.900
Right.

14
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:52.390
So let's go ahead, create the media context scrutiny file, let's call it media starts to use to make

15
00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.980
things easier.

16
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.360
Let's grab one of the component.

17
00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.420
Let's copy post, post context and just copy and paste here.

18
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.670
And we just make some changes here.

19
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.120
So post context, change that to the media.

20
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.490
Media context.

21
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:10.090
All right.

22
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.520
So first provider, change this to media provider.

23
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.310
And in the state, we will have media and set media.

24
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.720
You say in the media, we will have the images around.

25
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.700
So is there an image has been uploaded?

26
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.080
We will post them here

27
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.500
and later in the media library we will use use effect to load all the images from the database and populate

28
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.090
in the context as well.

29
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.540
All right.

30
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.320
So images, our next one is selected.

31
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.420
There will always be a selected image if the user have uploaded.

32
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.770
For example, if I upload one file here.

33
00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:05.380
From within this compound, then obviously my intention is to use that feature image here while creating

34
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.920
this post.

35
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.080
First of all, we want to give that selected.

36
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.740
We want to add that image as a selected image here.

37
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.540
That way, we can easily send this to our back in when we are creating a new post.

38
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:24.190
So images selected and then the property moving to add that is called social media model.

39
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.390
We give the different value.

40
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.290
The reason we need this one is when they upload a single image.

41
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.790
When it is uploaded, maybe you want to automatically close the model.

42
00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:40.960
There's no point saying that.

43
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.040
Close the model.

44
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.640
And so the selected images as a preview images right here.

45
00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:47.930
So we can control that.

46
00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.900
So we use this one as well.

47
00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.450
So that's our state.

48
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.210
And now let's send this to.

49
00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:10.120
Post context, let's send that to media context provided we give the valid that is media and said the

50
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:11.150
media.

51
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.220
And we turn this

52
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.090
post to media.

53
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.470
So that is our we.

54
00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.910
Okay.

55
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.860
So now we have media contacts as well.

56
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.720
Before we start using it, we need to make sure to input in the addresses.

57
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.940
So let's import that.

58
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:38.360
It's good to have.

59
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:41.800
Let's just copy it.

60
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.040
That.

61
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:50.050
I don't have to send this to media provider for context media.

62
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.300
And then we can read.

63
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.980
So we have post everything in it.

64
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.530
It's called the NAV.

65
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:04.330
And the component could use media provide.

66
00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.570
And spirited back again.

67
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.450
Ah, now you can see we have full different context there wrapping our application.

68
00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:19.220
Awesome.

69
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.350
Okay, so we've got the media provided.

70
00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.510
That means we can now access the media.

71
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.930
We can post the images to media in the context.

72
00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:27.740
We can do all that.

73
00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.010
So we can start from our profile.

74
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.750
All right, so here we got the response, right?

75
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.720
So we want to do something with the response.

76
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:44.760
Let me just comment about what I want to do here is I want to push to the media context.

77
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.820
Now for that, let me first input.

78
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.670
Context media.

79
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.670
And we can start using event counts.

80
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.890
Media set media to use state.

81
00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.580
So use context.

82
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.860
Media context.

83
00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.740
Okay.

84
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:30.480
And then when you get the response, what you want to do here is said to media.

85
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:44.900
So we get actually let's do different set media we use this function so here the media has the is a

86
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:52.730
really it has the selected property as well so images what do you want to do with the images is you

87
00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.110
want to post this new response to the images.

88
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.350
All right.

89
00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.350
So you have images.

90
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:08.410
So the array spread the array, media dot images.

91
00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:16.400
So whatever we already have living like that and we just want to add a new one to that would be in 4.5.

92
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:17.810
response.

93
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:28.170
I guess that's what we get to that filtered response that contains the the media information that were

94
00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.510
just saved in the database to that response.

95
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:37.880
We add to the already existing media as the images, if there is any.

96
00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:39.450
Otherwise it would be the first one.

97
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:40.830
Okay.

98
00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.620
So that's images selected.

99
00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.890
Do you want to make it too?

100
00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:53.040
And you want the search teams to be the currently uploaded images.

101
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:53.280
All right.

102
00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.320
So in for the fighting response.

103
00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:03.280
And you also want to change that social media model.

104
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.640
You want to make it false.

105
00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:09.880
So by default results of false.

106
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.800
By default it's false.

107
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.140
When we upload, it will be true, right?

108
00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:19.480
When the upload has been done, when we give the response, then again, there's no point showing the

109
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.850
model, so we make it false.

110
00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.630
All right, let's see what we have here.

111
00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:30.940
Media context model.

112
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:31.620
Not fun.

113
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:33.100
Nine five.

114
00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.090
Media context.

115
00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:40.440
Okay.

116
00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.850
So it's 11..

117
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.130
All right.

118
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:53.330
So you should try this one.

119
00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:04.910
We should try and we should show the list of medias in the admin post new.

120
00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:06.510
So let's quickly go to new.

121
00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.880
It's important context.

122
00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.240
Import media context.

123
00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:18.050
From.

124
00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:23.840
Context media.

125
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:24.770
All right.

126
00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.710
Let's make sure we have used context to that.

127
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:28.220
All right.

128
00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.400
So let's use that.

129
00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:44.040
Concealed media, since media includes to use context, media context that will give us access to the

130
00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:45.560
media in the state.

131
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:51.450
So let's put it right and talk about this one to see what we have.

132
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:56.250
In the context to.

133
00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:04.120
Jason's string of high medium.

134
00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:04.870
No.

135
00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:08.120
Four will remove this fire soon.

136
00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:09.140
Just for the now.

137
00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.160
Just for the moment.

138
00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.200
I want to see if we get anything.

139
00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.000
So by default, we have folks.

140
00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:20.730
All right, so let's try uploading and let's try.

141
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:23.430
So why?

142
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:29.200
Beautiful.

143
00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.810
I see you as soon as you upload.

144
00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:36.140
We have been able to update the media context.

145
00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:37.880
So we have one image.

146
00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:44.570
In this image is a ray and this image has been sent as selected images as well.

147
00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:45.650
Beautiful.

148
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:46.550
Absolutely beautiful.

149
00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:48.710
So it works.

150
00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:53.750
It works for on the single upload.

151
00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:58.160
No, we have to do the same in a media library as well.

152
00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:03.920
So let me just open these two windows side by side.

153
00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:05.870
So this one is upload file.

154
00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:09.590
Here, I want to open a media library and let's make some change.

155
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:10.460
And this one as well.

156
00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:14.450
So it's going to be exactly the same.

157
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:15.630
So said media.

158
00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:21.950
Oh, actually, let me just make sure we have the context.

159
00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.000
So let's go on top.

160
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:28.370
So we import the media context in this one as well.

161
00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:33.620
Import that one and then use the context.

162
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:43.310
Then come down here and then use the said media on the response.

163
00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.420
On the response.

164
00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:45.800
Comment that out.

165
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.140
Put it here.

166
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:49.820
Beautiful.

167
00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.180
Okay, let's give it a try.

168
00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.040
Let's try multiple approved as well.

169
00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:00.390
And it's trying to images.

170
00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:10.260
By the way, here we will be showing all the media that we have in the database and will be later to

171
00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:11.220
have been uploaded.

172
00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:19.500
And you can see in our images area now we have 1 to 3 minutes and the selected one has been.

173
00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:22.930
This one, the latest one.

174
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:31.210
So this one ends with the RTA.

175
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:33.040
That's the one.

176
00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:33.610
Okay.

177
00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:39.470
So that's the latest one.

178
00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:42.170
Let's quickly have a look at that.

179
00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.110
That's so beautiful.

180
00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:48.230
Okay.

181
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:49.370
So this is great.

182
00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:55.500
Now, moving forward, we can show the selected images as a preview is here.

183
00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:58.010
And then you may have also noticed that.

184
00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:00.520
The the mortar.

185
00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.350
This didn't close automatically.

186
00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.750
That's because we're not actually using that yet.

187
00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:08.200
So the social media model falls this fairly.

188
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.160
We're not using it.

189
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:15.130
We are still using the one we created previously in our admin.

190
00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:19.390
New is we created this one visual media.

191
00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:27.760
This started we used to toggle the visibility of this media model so we can stop using this one and

192
00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:35.830
switch to the context value we have in the media so we can use that, we can switch that.

193
00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.790
Otherwise it's looking good.

194
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:41.590
So we can show the featured images here.

195
00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:48.940
And then we have to make a little adjustment in our create post, for instance, so that when we have

196
00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.490
the selected images, we send that.

197
00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:59.830
Altogether so that when we create a new post, if the selected image is there, then this post will

198
00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:01.390
have defeated in Israel.
