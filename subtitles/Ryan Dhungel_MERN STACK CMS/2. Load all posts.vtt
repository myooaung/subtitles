00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:00.690
All right.

2
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.570
So we want to show the list of posts just like this one.

3
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.610
So let's go first.

4
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.800
Let's add a navigation link like that.

5
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.360
So let's go to the the nav component.

6
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.680
Start nav.

7
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.440
So we have the same.

8
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.950
That's the opinion that Scorpion finished one more time.

9
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.190
And this one we can post.

10
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.680
So it will take us to post.

11
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.730
So we need to create that base, and maybe we need to change the item.

12
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.950
Thank you.

13
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.020
So that's how it looks.

14
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.040
So we have to change the key as well.

15
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.520
Key posts.

16
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:54.940
I guess it doesn't exist.

17
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.320
So let's fix that.

18
00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:02.710
And we also want to use a different name is so that we can use.

19
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:03.630
Let's try.

20
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.550
The one I want to use is the database outlined.

21
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.300
You can obviously choose any agent you like.

22
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:23.300
And I also noticed that we have this mail item for the brand name, so let's fix that.

23
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.450
So let's use App Store instead.

24
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.440
So let's come down.

25
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.060
Let's turn this to App Store and this one.

26
00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:40.660
Let's change this to totally sound left over 90.

27
00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.560
We have the brand name and then we get the posts.

28
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:48.490
I guess it is.

29
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.070
Good post and let's clear this base.

30
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.250
It's weird that we need to have bases full.

31
00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.400
So here in said base folder posts don't see us.

32
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.290
Exposed casts forced to

33
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.890
return.

34
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.910
Maybe we can just.

35
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.400
Post for now.

36
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.630
It's fun to have this different base.

37
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.620
First, we need to prove the endpoint to that, give us a boost, and then we can do more work on this

38
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.740
one.

39
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.800
Okay, so we've got a post here and I just realized that we actually already have the post endpoint.

40
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.980
So that's how we are showing all the post for the admin here.

41
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.960
Me, we could all post and we are always doing all this post, right?

42
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:57.520
So this is the endpoint we can actually use this endpoint because if you notice here on the post office,

43
00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.770
we are actually just showing the images and the title.

44
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.690
We're not showing any extra information.

45
00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.580
For example, all this information, the post content, we actually are not showing that.

46
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.790
We just showing the post title and the image.

47
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.330
That's all we need and we need this slope.

48
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:21.170
And so so that means I think we can continue using this end point if we need to create a different endpoint

49
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.130
later, one for public and one for admin, then we will do that.

50
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.850
But for the moment, let just utilize this existing endpoint.

51
00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:37.190
So let me quickly go back and Sue, you wrote post, so we already have the post endpoint.

52
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.340
Here in our control.

53
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.150
So to show the images, we have to populate the images.

54
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.920
So let's.

55
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:59.970
Populate Image's featured image is slim distributing the moral post featured images.

56
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.740
So let's populate that as well.

57
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:09.170
All right.

58
00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.850
So with that sense, we should be able to show the posts with images.

59
00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:20.180
So let's go work on the homepage outside of the post office.

60
00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.660
So, like I said earlier, we're not going to use use effect.

61
00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:31.130
We instead we're going to use get some sad props so that our base will not load until we receive the

62
00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.430
data from the server, until we receive all the posts from the server.

63
00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.530
Only when we receive on the post we saw the base.

64
00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.140
That will be good for issue.

65
00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.690
All right.

66
00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.560
So that function, let me quickly take you to the next test documentation.

67
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.060
Scoot in the docks and let's search for some.

68
00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.590
Some say it props.

69
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.370
There are different ways of clearing data.

70
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:11.140
So basically for server side rendering, this is a function we use and it has to return props properly.

71
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.280
This is really important.

72
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.910
Again, you can just return the data you got from the server.

73
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.580
Whatever response you got, you don't do that.

74
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.290
Do you always use props?

75
00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.120
I guess that's one requirement.

76
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.710
Okay, so let's use this function.

77
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.760
So as you can see, this function is written like that export async function.

78
00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.570
Get some said props.

79
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.110
And here we are.

80
00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:52.070
Actually, if there is a need to access the context, the request and response, you'll be able to access

81
00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.880
that here as well.

82
00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.150
So here, what are you going to do?

83
00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:02.270
As you can see, we have to return the props so we can use it.

84
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.800
Excuse to make a request.

85
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:16.750
In poor excuse and then we use ex use against data includes two point excuse.

86
00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:26.680
That means we're using async so we can use it excuse don't make it get requests to the endpoint.

87
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:27.700
Now this endpoint.

88
00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.250
Let me quickly take you to the Ian bit at local.

89
00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:40.530
So previously I explained if this Ian variable you need to access in the browser environment, then

90
00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.210
you have to use next public.

91
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.460
So that's what we were using so far.

92
00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.710
But this time we need to use the API.

93
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.520
So because we are using it in the server side, so we use API.

94
00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:57.790
So yeah, let's use batting dollars and call it base forces.

95
00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:02.020
Start EMV, dart API, S+ first.

96
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:04.650
So that's the endpoint.

97
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.390
That's where we make a request.

98
00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:12.570
Then we should receive the data on the post so we can return props.

99
00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:18.390
I guess this is a requirement to make sure to use written props.

100
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:26.130
And then here we want to return the post right to post data, the values data.

101
00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:28.850
And you could also you return data as well.

102
00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:33.850
That's fine, but let's give this the name of posts.

103
00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:40.620
That way it would be it would make sense, you know, I suppose.

104
00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:47.540
So here, when you return the props, you can access that props post here.

105
00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:50.340
So you can destructor posts here.

106
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.270
So I want to destock suppose that you have access to on the post or you can sign the post here.

107
00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:09.000
So here first we need a layout so we can use the rows and columns from end to this important input of

108
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:15.570
draw and call from and design.

109
00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:18.720
And then we return the row

110
00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.700
and then we use column.

111
00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:25.590
Now what are we going to do?

112
00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:30.600
Is we going to have a sidebar like this instead of seeing the finished product?

113
00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:39.970
So we're going to post images, post title, post content here on this with and then this sidebar.

114
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.030
We also some other interviews and now of course it's up to you you can just make it full with it's up

115
00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:46.360
to you.

116
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.960
You can also the image full width and so the content.

117
00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:54.460
And then so this extra content here, you feel free to style it differently.

118
00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:57.430
But I'm going to continue using this style.

119
00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:04.660
So this much space we use for the post and then we use the same graph to show all the information like

120
00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.280
categories, recent post.

121
00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:06.910
All right.

122
00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:10.450
So we can use a column with the span.

123
00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:18.820
Actually, let's use the value small in small screen.

124
00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:20.110
We take the full width.

125
00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:26.200
On larger screen, we use column eight.

126
00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.520
No, actually, it's a drawing of a column grid.

127
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.970
So on bigger screen, we can use 16.

128
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:41.180
I guess that will be the one column, and then another column will be for sidebar.

129
00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.750
So on small screen we can give it a full width.

130
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:48.860
On another screen, we use eight angles here.

131
00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:57.110
And we use them just right sidebar for them.

132
00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:58.330
And here

133
00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.270
I want to show the content.

134
00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:03.820
So.

135
00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:08.310
Let's just have a look at what we have.

136
00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:13.590
Pretty decent string of funny posts.

137
00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:17.370
Now for.

138
00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:25.130
And I think on the road we can give the go to 12.

139
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:31.840
Okay.

140
00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:34.040
Let's visit both space.

141
00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:35.120
Okay.

142
00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:35.780
So beautiful.

143
00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:40.070
Now we have all the posts as this and other.

144
00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:43.640
We got that and we have the sidebar to show that additional information.

145
00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:44.660
Beautiful.

146
00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:46.390
Awesome.
