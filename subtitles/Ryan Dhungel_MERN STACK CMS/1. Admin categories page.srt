1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:00,720
All right.

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:06,900
So now we are going to work on actual content management systems.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:13,200
So when we think about content management system like WordPress, we think about this beautiful desk

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,080
world where admin can do a lot of things.

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:23,370
Admin can create categories, posts, manage media files, manage users, things like that, right?

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:30,110
So let's say in send and this users subscribe.

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,080
At the moment it's not even admin, but we'll work on that little bit later.

8
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,250
At the moment, let's go to the admin desk.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,310
And as you can see here, we have a lot of these features that we're going to implement one by one.

10
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,670
And by the end of the course, everything will be working.

11
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:48,720
What do you see here?

12
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:49,730
All right.

13
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:50,970
So it's going to be awesome.

14
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:58,860
So at the moment, let's go ahead and create one piece.

15
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,220
Now, first, I wanted to start with the post.

16
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,810
I wanted to allow the admin to create a new post.

17
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:11,490
But before we do that, we have to implement the categories feature because when you create a post,

18
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,190
he want to assign some categories, right?

19
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:19,290
So that means we have to work on the categories so we will implement the categories.

20
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,460
Quote so called stands for create, read, update and delete.

21
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,880
So we would implement those features for core.

22
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,680
So four categories and then we're going to move on to other features.

23
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:32,040
Right.

24
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:40,920
And I was talking about it earlier that we're going to put it there out at the moment this user is not

25
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,180
even admin, right?

26
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,990
So anyone logs in, they have access to this desk.

27
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,270
Now that will change a bit later.

28
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:56,730
But at the moment, let's just focus on working on this space so that we know how to create categories,

29
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,590
how to work with forms.

30
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,610
That is something we already did in our sign in insider basis.

31
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:10,320
But Stuart, let's implement the categories feature through to the space and then we move to the back

32
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:18,180
end and we will see how we're going to protect that route so that only the user with the role of admin

33
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:25,650
will be able to create a category, create a re update, delete all those features in the back end.

34
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,700
Only our user with the role of admin will be able to do that.

35
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:34,770
So we will implement those role based restrictions a little bit later.

36
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,820
But first, we want to work on the space categories.

37
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:47,820
So let's go ahead now let's go to let's first tick if we click here.

38
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:53,640
So we have the the correct link.

39
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,790
So admins, less categories, we just have to create this space.

40
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,140
So let's go ahead.

41
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,230
Let's create that into basis.

42
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:04,380
Admin create a new folder.

43
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,420
It's called categories.

44
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:12,830
Categories.

45
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:21,320
And instead here we can do a file called index dances and it's going to use the admin layout and that

46
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,220
is something we have already used in the admin index, as you can see here.

47
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:32,720
So we can reuse this code and then go to categories index based here.

48
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:37,340
So basically we are using the admin layout, the admin layout.

49
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,970
When you said earlier that means this layout.

50
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:45,770
So this will have the menu on the sidebar and the content will be here.

51
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,130
All right.

52
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,540
So that's the add layout.

53
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,330
So we use that here in.

54
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,080
The Categories index, right?

55
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,110
Q Let me close out the taps,

56
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:06,260
and here since we are one step inside, then this one we have to go one step up

57
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,090
and let me just call it.

58
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,730
Categories.

59
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:19,940
Just leave it like that.

60
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,400
Listing the company name.

61
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:26,480
Let's call it categories.

62
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,850
It's a model not found.

63
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,050
So from here we going?

64
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:46,870
Okay.

65
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:47,440
Sorry.

66
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,540
So I supposed to.

67
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:56,260
I thought I was here, but I'm actually modifying this index fan, so let me copy all this code and

68
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:01,690
let me just undo a few times just so that we don't make any changes here.

69
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,350
All right, so this is how it was.

70
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,970
Live it good.

71
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:12,590
Two categories index and the space that hit I.

72
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:17,530
So we just added one more this line.

73
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:21,610
So we go one stick up and we change the name.

74
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,400
That's pretty much it.

75
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,020
And we change the heading.

76
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,280
All right, so let's give it a try.

77
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,250
It's good categories.

78
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,150
And you can see we have that base category, small country.

79
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:35,210
Right.

80
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:35,980
So we've got that.

81
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,910
That's great.

82
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:39,200
No.

83
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:44,220
Now we can continue working on the scale of the special.

84
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,100
We will basically allow to use it to create categories.

85
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:53,730
So the categories that are created and allow the admin to even update and delete all within the same

86
00:05:53,730 --> 00:06:01,140
component because the just categories basically they just need one form field called the category name

87
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,060
or category title, whatever you like to call it.

88
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:07,980
It's going to be a nice little foam and we can pretty much do everything here.

89
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:14,130
Now, if you want to have a look at that, how we did in the finished product, you can try.

90
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,030
So let's send it.

91
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:23,680
All right.

92
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:29,370
So you go to the categories index and this is how we're going to implement it.

93
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,270
So at the end, this is how it will look.

94
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:39,940
You can create a category, you give a name, let's call it moral step, and you can create like that

95
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,310
as soon as you create it.

96
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,680
We saw the notification and that comes up here.

97
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:49,990
You can see immediately that comes up here and then if you want to delete it, it's clear another one.

98
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,330
If you want to delete, you can delete it.

99
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,610
That's gone to continue.

100
00:06:55,090 --> 00:07:01,420
If you are updating and I'm dead, we allow the user to object in this model.

101
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:09,710
So it says the name, let's say all caps look monster and then immediately that will change here.

102
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:14,530
So nice, beautiful categories crud all within one component.

103
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,750
So this is what we trying to achieve, right?

104
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:23,470
So you can see here, the first thing we need to do is create a form, have a button so that we can

105
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:29,680
create a categories and then we will move on to affecting all the categories from the database, allowing

106
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,620
the user to edit and delete.
