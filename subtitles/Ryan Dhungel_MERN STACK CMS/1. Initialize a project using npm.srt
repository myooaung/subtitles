1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,830
All right, sir.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:08,340
Finally, we have arrived to a point where we can start building the application, learn the full stack.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:09,750
So a skin development.

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:10,170
Right.

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,430
So, again, to set up our front end project.

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,830
So the first thing you want to do is decide where you want to put this project.

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,100
I have this folder in folder in my computer.

8
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,350
So here I'm going to create a new folder.

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,760
I'm going to right click and I'm going to call to see Ms..

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:30,760
Inside here.

11
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,850
We're going to have two separate projects.

12
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,830
One is the frontend.

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,120
One is the backend.

14
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,650
All right, so here, let me create a new folder and let me call it client.

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,540
And then later we will create another for Rufus server.

16
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,850
But at the moment, let's just leave it like this.

17
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:57,650
Client All right, now let me click this folder and drag to my editor via code.

18
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:08,660
I guess I'm going to put this second window so we can just go through the preview and the code editor

19
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,220
nice and easy like that.

20
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:17,320
Okay, so we have the project, but it's basically empty at the moment.

21
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,880
It's just a full so what do we do?

22
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,970
So the first thing we want to do is set up a project.

23
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:26,380
So we are setting up a JavaScript project here now.

24
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:33,780
Any JavaScript project you want to send on, you want to use NPM.

25
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:40,500
So NPM is NPM in sort form, stands for node packages manager NPM.

26
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:46,330
So basically any more than to applications you want to use.

27
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,190
You want to build it.

28
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:57,000
You want to use NPM because there are hundreds of thousands of packages available in NPM, which you

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,850
can easily within the one single line command line you can easily install in your project.

30
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,230
And then you can start using those libraries.

31
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,380
For example, React.

32
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,330
React is a library that you can download from NPM.

33
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:20,070
Next, this is another library you can download from NPM, even explicit test, which will be used to

34
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,040
build a server that is also available in NPM.

35
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:31,230
So as you can imagine, without NPM, it's, it's almost you can't build anything using more than Dallas.

36
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,980
I guess that's that's how important NPM is.

37
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:36,270
All right.

38
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:44,070
So that means we have to set up a project and brand new project using NPM and quite straightforward.

39
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:44,550
All right.

40
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,760
So what are we can do?

41
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,720
We can go to terminal.

42
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:58,500
By the way, if you're using voice code, the voice called has built in terminal.

43
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:04,650
So what you can do, you can just on my mat, I use control.

44
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,690
And the tilde character.

45
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:10,080
Tilde means the key.

46
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,750
Whatever you have underneath the escape key on the top left corner.

47
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,160
Okay.

48
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,710
Now you should be able to open from here.

49
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,730
You could go to the code terminal turn.

50
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,420
You can easily open from there as.

51
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,420
Now, during the discourse.

52
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,940
Through discourse, I will be using a separate terminal just so that you have a bit more space here

53
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,360
to see the code.

54
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:38,700
Right.

55
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,550
So if I open terminal here, have the sidebar here.

56
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:45,240
So we have very little space left for you to see, right?

57
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,490
So that's why I'm not going to use this one insert.

58
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,990
I'm going to use a separate one here.

59
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,040
To let me navigate through that directory.

60
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:58,670
We have a project which is, as you can see here, you didn't see.

61
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:04,170
So I need to give you that full right so I can go here sans directory.

62
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:07,740
That's what I did meant CD You did.

63
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,670
And I can restart the files using else.

64
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,350
You can see here we have two full step.

65
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:15,840
Okay.

66
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:24,660
So I want to get into it seems to change directory C, D, C, and now these LCD, these commands might

67
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:31,650
differ if you're in windows, but I'm sure you you know how to use run this command.

68
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,400
So these are.

69
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,380
Widely used come once, I'm pretty sure you know.

70
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,480
How do you work with your windows machine?

71
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:45,650
All right, so here, let me list out the files.

72
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:51,900
And inside seamless we have the client for so let's go into a client for city client.

73
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,680
I can now then if I have a look, there's nothing there.

74
00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:00,000
Okay, let me clear the these previous comments.

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,230
Yes.

76
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,820
So we are inter client for here.

77
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,820
Now we want to set up our project with NPM.

78
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:06,120
Right.

79
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:16,470
So what you do is NPM in it means initialize this and you can pass dest y flag, which means to us.

80
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:21,910
So if you don't pass this way flag and hit enter, it will ask a couple of questions for you.

81
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:26,450
It you can type the project, name the entry, file, things like that.

82
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:33,330
However, to make things easier, you can just pass the white flag, which means to us npm in it.

83
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,140
That's what.

84
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:45,460
And that will initialize the project with NPM and that will automatically create this spec is consistent.

85
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,730
Have a look at here you can see previously it was empty.

86
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:54,820
Now it has the spec is a decent file and this content is what you see here in the terminal.

87
00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:04,480
So you can see here that that command, NPM command created this basic information and put it in this

88
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,800
bag is a decent file.

89
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,880
So it has the project name, version and description.

90
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:14,390
You can write the main into file scripts.

91
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,780
We don't really have anything.

92
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,530
Who is going to change that very soon?

93
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:24,340
Okay, so all the information you can write to, pretty much the standard information is, you know,

94
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:32,770
any NPM packages you install, for example, React Nexus, any package you install, they will be listed

95
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,360
here, they will appear here.

96
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:36,430
All right.

97
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:41,590
So that means we want to set up our React project using Nexus.

98
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:41,830
Right.

99
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:42,730
So how do you do that?
