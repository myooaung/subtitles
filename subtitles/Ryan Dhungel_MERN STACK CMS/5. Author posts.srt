1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:00,930
All right.

2
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,360
So also concrete boost.

3
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:09,840
And once the bush is created, we redirect them to cesspools that business and exist.

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,280
Let's go ahead and clear that one.

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,180
So that begins with the list of posts that belongs to that author.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:22,490
And then we will allow him to update and delete that post just like we had four admin isolates.

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,230
Who didn't disclose on these?

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,590
We did have that base for our mentalist crew to have a look at that.

9
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,470
So bases and boosts index.

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,570
So you can see here.

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,420
So we have user fit that fits all the posts.

12
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,270
For admin, obviously we can phase on the posts, so that's fine.

13
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,840
But for other we have to create another route because we want to fit the post that belongs to the office.

14
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,100
So we have to create a new round that will give us the.

15
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,490
Currently logged in users on the post.

16
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:10,570
Instead of getting the entire database on the post from the database for admin.

17
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:11,160
Right.

18
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,180
So far though it's going to be different.

19
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:23,710
Edit again we can take them to edit this just like we use the create page so we can just use that.

20
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:31,220
Basically just import the component and that's how we're going to implement that delayed.

21
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,990
We have this delay as well.

22
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,360
So this one has can.

23
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,640
Update middleware has been applied to to work like that.

24
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:48,690
And finally, we just rendering in the layout, we are rendering the list of posts.

25
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:54,630
So this component shows all the posts in a list.

26
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,290
And actually we have the edit here.

27
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,510
That takes to the edit pace.

28
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:02,500
All right.

29
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:03,460
So let's go.

30
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:14,260
Let's try to use this quote from admin index, admin post index who's and good and good to also post

31
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,030
the scrutiny file called index.

32
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:19,720
In space study.

33
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:23,620
Okay.

34
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,200
So let's save and let's have a look what we get here.

35
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:28,600
Okay.

36
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,090
So obviously this is Arthur.

37
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:36,280
So we have been redirected back because that is protected for admin only.

38
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,390
So we can change that.

39
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,370
It seems that from admin to also.

40
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:44,330
So.

41
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:45,290
I mean.

42
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,760
Copy and paste so off allowed.

43
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:55,880
Let's come down here.

44
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,570
Come back to the written block since then.

45
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,370
All the way down to.

46
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,180
No.

47
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,470
I should be able to access.

48
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,190
I'll post anything to you.

49
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,590
We go to the post now.

50
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:18,390
This user created just, I think two or three posts.

51
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,550
The rest of the post doesn't belong to this user.

52
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:26,460
So if it tries to enter delete, I'm sure I'll get an error because we have the middleware in our server.

53
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:27,890
So let's give it a try.

54
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,250
Let's let's see what happens.

55
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:37,070
Actually, you know, when we edit, we take them to the base and that base.

56
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,950
We haven't created that for Awesome.

57
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,090
That took them, took us to the admin base and we got redirected.

58
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,220
Okay, so that's fine.

59
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,030
We'll work on that.

60
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,290
Welcome to edit.

61
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,460
Let's try delete.

62
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,970
Obviously if I try, I'm sure I'd get an error.

63
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,120
In error.

64
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,140
Forbidden.

65
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:11,370
Except that forbidden in their training.

66
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,480
Obviously we've got to form it in there.

67
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,080
But if I tried to do it on my own, I should be able to.

68
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,460
Let me just try that.

69
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,110
And that's gone.

70
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:23,540
Beautiful.

71
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,910
So we've got ten books left.

72
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,010
Finding this one, we got nine posters so I can do on.

73
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:41,090
But without making any changes here, because you can see here this function is here and then we have

74
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,200
the middleware in the back end.

75
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,570
To delete is pretty good.

76
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:51,140
Reading the files, reading and getting the list of the posts.

77
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,290
So we want to create a new round in the back.

78
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:58,640
Into that we get only the post that belongs to this user.

79
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,330
Let's go quickly more than that one.

80
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:06,050
And then we'll come back and and, you know, implement.

81
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,200
The edit.

82
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:09,760
All right.

83
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,760
Still, it's good to see some.

84
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,080
Around sports.

85
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,400
Let's create a new post you wrote.

86
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,370
Walter, don't get.

87
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:29,490
We can call that this.

88
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,450
Call that.

89
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,540
Posts by awesome.

90
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,020
Right.

91
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,060
Posts by awesome.

92
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,080
This will be for the love to new this require signing

93
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,910
posts by all.

94
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,990
So here with this meal we get the load in this society.

95
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:59,400
Now we're going to find the other post based on the the user side.

96
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,290
Because each post had the posted by property.

97
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:08,740
So we're going to find the post based on that property, get all the posts of this logged in user and

98
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,720
send as a response.

99
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:17,080
Now, this is really important from the control.

100
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,860
And this could use control.

101
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,850
You explore comments posts by also.

102
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:37,630
I.

103
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,150
Kit and Eric.

104
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,090
To hear.

105
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:56,410
What have you to do is be asking to query the posts of contest posts.

106
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,580
It could soon await post mortem find.

107
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:07,630
We are going to find out what are the institutions we going to find based on the posted birth posted

108
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:10,150
by and the values the logged in user site.

109
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:11,960
All right.

110
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:16,100
And then you want to populate.

111
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,710
So you want to populate.

112
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,330
Posted by.

113
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,720
You want to get the name?

114
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:32,090
I will automatically include some popular name for one of the categories.

115
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,390
By the way, all this.

116
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,020
We're not going to use here

117
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,100
but might be useful in doing the edit.

118
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:42,500
So.

119
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,960
Actually John Edwards also is not actually using.

120
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,220
Let's.

121
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,330
Let's do it anyways.

122
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,490
You can always just remove them to donate.

123
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:54,730
To

124
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,150
populate.

125
00:07:58,990 --> 00:07:59,870
Featured image.

126
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,060
Just two year will be enough.

127
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:10,610
You want to start so that you get the new newly created ones on top.

128
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:15,830
So serve by created date and that is all that is over the next.

129
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:22,640
Now let's send return response to Jason posts.

130
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:31,040
All right, now we can make a request to this endpoint to get only the selected post that belongs to

131
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,930
this user instead of everything here.

132
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:34,490
All right.

133
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:37,850
Because this was originally intended for the end.

134
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,520
So let's go try and make my request to post by authorize.

135
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:46,450
To this front.

136
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,730
Okay, close.

137
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,430
Close.

138
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:58,760
Back to pieces author post index and here Facebook post that gets executed in a huge effect.

139
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,020
It seems that two posts by author.

140
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:11,640
Now you can see here I think this user had created to post we deleted so there's none.

141
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,120
Let's go ahead and try creating one and let's see if that holds.

142
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,510
Best move.

143
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:20,740
I.

144
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:23,500
Okay.

145
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,460
So this is still taking us to admin, so we have to fix that as well.

146
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,860
Let's quickly fix that.

147
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,620
So herein the return and new listings that do.

148
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:55,290
Seem to want to put some dummy text.

149
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:55,980
Right.

150
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,020
So you can just put anything.

151
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:59,810
Yeah, just write it.

152
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,880
Listen to what he wrote in his.

153
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,650
This creates some dummy posters for drawing nudes.

154
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:14,330
Right?

155
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:17,940
Some of this and you can see it.

156
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:22,980
This post is here because this user created this post.

157
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,560
Now, if he wants to delete this, he can do it.

158
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:26,560
Awesome.

159
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,310
So let me create.

160
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,770
Every great few points and then we're going to work on the edit.

161
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:42,470
Six of let's have some few.

162
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,610
She paused here so that we can work them.

163
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,710
By the way, here, Siemens should work abroad.

164
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,970
Let's try this one as well.

165
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,280
I feel it's probably.

166
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:15,300
Okay.

167
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,310
So I forgot to add the categories.

168
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:20,520
So that is something we can do in the edit section.

169
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,000
All right.

170
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,470
So let's work on that next.

171
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,990
So delayed.

172
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:25,770
Already works.

173
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:26,400
We saw that.

174
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:34,470
Now edit outside of work we just have to pass the pro just like we did before during the the decrease

175
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,430
in of the new post.

176
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:40,930
If you remember, you can see here we had to pass the basic props also.

177
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:45,180
So we have to pass something like that for edit as well.

178
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,190
Now that is happening.

179
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,830
Let's go back to index.

180
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,990
So also post index.

181
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:57,270
You can see all the posts we are showing in the post list component.

182
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,840
And that's where it is.

183
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,340
It's post has these links.

184
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,150
Edit in delete.

185
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,670
This did function is also executed.

186
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:14,120
Because we pass them as props and sing with the handle added.

187
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,110
We bussed them from here?

188
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:23,070
Oh, actually, we passed employment, so we didn't even have to pass the props because we actually

189
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,020
using the phosphate.

190
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,410
So that's even easier.

191
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,030
It says this off all you and that should work.

192
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:31,380
Right.

193
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:31,800
That's it.

194
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:35,910
Well, when the edit is clicked, we take them to SLAs.

195
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:48,570
Also less post posts, less the edit, which should be a base that is similar to what we have here.

196
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,680
And MinnPost Slaughter.

197
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,800
This way we can grab this slow, right?

198
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,710
So it's going to have a look.

199
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:00,900
Indeed.

200
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:02,610
Okay.

201
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:06,180
So we haven't actually refactored the code for edit.

202
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,140
So what?

203
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:15,510
We can do it just like we did before for creating a post on this code that we have for updating the

204
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:21,390
post, we can put it to a different component and try to reuse like reference and that would be much

205
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:21,750
easier.

206
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:22,800
All right.

207
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:30,390
So but now so far, we should be able to at least take the user to less authors, less post less the

208
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:33,040
slow pace whenever they click on edit.

209
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,020
So let's give it a try.

210
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:39,390
So if previously we were taken to the admin tool, we were automatically redirected.

211
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:46,620
But now you see we are in the author's last post less this slow.

212
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,020
So we are on the right place.

213
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:51,750
So let's implement the edit as well.

214
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:58,080
Now before we do that, we're going to refactored the code here in the admin.

215
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:04,010
All right, so let's go to admin busy admin post.

216
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,140
We have this post and it pays for admin.

217
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:14,020
So we're going to use this code refactor so that we can use it for authors as well.
