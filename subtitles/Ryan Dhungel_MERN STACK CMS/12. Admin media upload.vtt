WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.790
All right, so let's continue with her application.

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:10.380
So we implemented the update feature as well so we can update the post, which we tried in the previous

3
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:10.800
lecture.

4
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:19.170
All posts we have on the post we can delete and actually try one more time.

5
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.290
And then I'm going to work on these features.

6
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.810
Now, we pretty much done with post and categories, which is the core feature of the CMS.

7
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.070
So we have done all that we can to move on to these other features.

8
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.460
So work on the media, which is very easy because we already have the components, so we just bring

9
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.900
them and just put them here.

10
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.010
So that's easy.

11
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.650
Next, we're going to move on to users.

12
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.190
So admin will be able to create user object delete user.

13
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.890
This profile will be used for anyone who was logged in.

14
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.490
You will be able to update its profile, upload a featured image, and then some more topics.

15
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:08.410
And then finally, we should create more pages based on the role of see if the role is also, then he

16
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.070
will be able to do certain things.

17
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.180
So and you know, there's a bit to do, but we have done quite a lot already.

18
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.730
So let me try just one more post, because last time I

19
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.400
recorded the video, that was almost a week ago.

20
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:32.700
So let me just do the one that I did post is now working.

21
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.870
Featured images.

22
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.620
I'm just going to pick one existing one.

23
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.430
Let me pick.

24
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.610
I guess it absolutely promise.

25
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.390
All right, great.

26
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.710
Let's go and have a look.

27
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:06.490
So it's here.

28
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.510
All right.

29
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.480
So let me go ahead and try to update.

30
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.410
Okay.

31
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:25.720
Update to.

32
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.640
AT&amp;T.

33
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.320
It's updating.

34
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.950
No delete.

35
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.630
It's gone.

36
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.410
Beautiful.

37
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.610
So far, it's working.

38
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.820
Good.

39
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.950
Now let's move on to these phases.

40
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.770
So we have the media library and help me.

41
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.870
Now, basically, they're saying we already using them when we're creating a post.

42
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.680
Right.

43
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.440
So in recruiter post we have access to the library.

44
00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:56.140
So this is the library.

45
00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.120
So we have all the photos there.

46
00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.320
We can multiple upload here, drag and drop.

47
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:07.030
So that will be the library and the add new will be this component.

48
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.400
So you can see these two components, basically these two components we want to show you and that is

49
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.550
it.

50
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.600
All right.

51
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.620
So let's move on.

52
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.230
Let's start from this one to add new.

53
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.990
So at the moment we don't have the base.

54
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.800
Let's go ahead and create a base for admin media new.

55
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.780
So I mean instead admin put a new folder media create a new file new

56
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.130
and then multicoloured another file for the library, I guess a media.

57
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.310
Another one called library.

58
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.480
I guess so.

59
00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.220
Here, let's create a basic.

60
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.920
Base for that one.

61
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.450
We should use the admin drought so we can create one.

62
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.640
We can use an existing road.

63
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.730
For example, this one you can see Edmond's index.

64
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:04.570
There's nothing here.

65
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.580
So let's just use this one.

66
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.370
Go to new best here.

67
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:11.050
I guess so.

68
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.800
First, let's change this to new media.

69
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.150
To the name.

70
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:21.270
New media.

71
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:26.220
So we have the admin layout that is one step inside this folder.

72
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.910
So I guess I may have to go one step up.

73
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.370
Okay.

74
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.190
So we got admin layout.

75
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.860
This layout winner using that.

76
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:41.220
Oh yeah.

77
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.130
We use content in slightly distracting.

78
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.490
Um, content and slide is not actually being used to just that.

79
00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.820
Remove that.

80
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.670
Okay, so we got this from the content now.

81
00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.070
And of that content I want to show the media.

82
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.340
Right.

83
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.270
So here I actually need the columns in rules.

84
00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:15.050
So let's import import rule and called from and.

85
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:29.720
Negative and then we can use here will grow into a group created column spend 24 year we can create

86
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:36.300
column that takes full width and inside here we let's create a deal.

87
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:47.850
It's called divide and it said this time we can put that component so that one will be media upload

88
00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:48.180
file.

89
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.200
So we import that.

90
00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.190
So we go one step up to the step of.

91
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:08.360
So from here, one step, two steps, three step components, media

92
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.600
upload five and we put that here.

93
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.000
We use that abroad file.

94
00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:29.220
And let's have a look and see how this works.

95
00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:32.790
All right, so we've got that.

96
00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:33.510
That's nice.

97
00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:41.850
Now, since we don't have anything else here, since maybe we went to the some put somewhere in the

98
00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:42.750
center of the business.

99
00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:52.050
So let's use some styling, give some penny stock betting, and it's 500.

100
00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.730
And text around center.

101
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:04.070
All right.

102
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:07.820
So that's.

103
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:08.960
That's good.

104
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:10.910
All right, so let's try it.

105
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:18.590
Now, obviously, it works because we already know these components for uploading media works.

106
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:25.210
The only thing we did here is we are using it in this different base.

107
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:27.170
However, the way it works is simple.

108
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:33.590
So it's going to abroad, send the photo to the back in back and will upload to a cloud near.

109
00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:40.460
We get the URL and that media with that here will be saved in the database.

110
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:41.030
Right.

111
00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:42.050
So sent.

112
00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:50.510
Now the thing is we may have to do one more thing is that is when the upload finished, what do we do

113
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:51.020
right.

114
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.710
So here we're not actually creating any post or anything.

115
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:59.250
So to be honest, we may not even need to.

116
00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:00.080
So this.

117
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:05.800
This one is not really important here, to be honest.

118
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:12.580
But let's add anyway, because that's how the word we've is, that's how they work.

119
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.560
So we trying to build something seamlessly.

120
00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:19.990
It's just continue these images I have.

121
00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.070
I think I have two new images.

122
00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:25.710
Let me just try one or.

123
00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:29.100
All right, this one, and let's try putting this one.

124
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:32.820
Okay.

125
00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.530
So it has been uploaded successfully.

126
00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:41.430
Now you can leave the user to this piece if you want to return them to some other ways you can.

127
00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:46.890
For example, when they finish uploading, maybe you want to redirect them to library so that they will

128
00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:52.170
be able to see all the existing photos as well as this newly updated one.

129
00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:53.520
So you can do that.

130
00:08:54.840 --> 00:09:04.050
So if you want to redirect when the upload finished, then you can pass some kind of the prop called

131
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:10.200
redirect and then redirect library or something like that.

132
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:18.090
And if that property is received in this component, then you will redirect to library.

133
00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:18.450
All right.

134
00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:19.710
So let's let's try that.

135
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:26.490
So when the upload is done, we want to read it, redirect them to library.

136
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:27.030
Right.

137
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:33.840
So let's pass this prompt redirect to the library.

138
00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:37.140
Okay.

139
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.280
So we passing this props to this upload file component.

140
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:46.350
So let's go ahead, try to use this upload file redirect library.

141
00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:55.890
So we see that property structure and then we have this function here.

142
00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:08.340
So when the upload is done, we are putting this image to the media context.

143
00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:10.560
We are showing the misses.

144
00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:14.540
Now one more thing we want to do, and that is redirect the user, right?

145
00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:15.610
So we can do that here.

146
00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:28.480
If redirect to library.

147
00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:35.770
So if we have that props, I guess if by the way you can give this product a default value as well.

148
00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:40.840
So let's quickly do that so you can give a default value on false.

149
00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:45.280
So by default you will not redirect is always false.

150
00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.390
It's a default value.

151
00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:53.680
However, if this prop received some value other than this one, then that will be used.

152
00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:54.340
All right.

153
00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:55.750
So this is the default.

154
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:57.100
Well, by default it's false.

155
00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:05.050
We're not redirecting, but if the value we receive as props, which is true and that that's what's

156
00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:06.820
happening in we sending the value true.

157
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:09.910
So if that is received only then it will work.

158
00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:10.840
Okay.

159
00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:11.920
So if that is true.

160
00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:19.260
Yeah, if that is true, we want to redirect to library so we can use Roger

161
00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:30.370
Urban to push to add means less needs less library.

162
00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:33.700
All right.

163
00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.960
Now let's make sure we have real.

164
00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:40.520
We don't.

165
00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:50.840
I guess it's important for you wrote a book for Next Run and to use that.

166
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:59.060
Controller equals to use row, and then we can use that rather.

167
00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:05.090
Felt a push to push for you to their face.

168
00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:05.970
Okay.

169
00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:10.820
So with that change, let's turn back to previously we uploaded and we just got the message here.

170
00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:11.470
Nothing happened.

171
00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:13.200
We were not redirected.

172
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.850
But now let me try uploading the images.

173
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:20.040
Now this time we should get redirect.

174
00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.100
You can see we have been redirected.

175
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.230
