1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,050
So we got the title, we got the content.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,830
Next thing we want to create a post is a list of categories.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,500
So when you create a post, you want to select few categories for your post, right?

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:20,940
So for that, first we have to get all the categories from our back in and hopefully we have the end

5
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:28,000
point slimmed down to several roads category categories.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,190
So this should be our guest.

7
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:38,730
So you can see here we are getting all the categories from this control function.

8
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,110
So that means

9
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:49,230
we can make a request to select categories and that will give us all the categories to exclude here.

10
00:00:52,630 --> 00:01:00,580
So here in the new new post, let's use a use effect to use effect.

11
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:06,880
So in the component amount, we want to make a request to get all the categories.

12
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,490
So let's create a state.

13
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:12,040
So we get all the categories we can put them here.

14
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:19,270
Categories said categories equals to use state.

15
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,660
So it the array of categories.

16
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,080
Okay.

17
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,550
So we have that.

18
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:31,760
And then actually we will have two types of categories in the state.

19
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:38,070
One is all the categories from our backends or whatever we already have created.

20
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:47,310
And online the list of categories will be the ones that will be sent along with the total content to

21
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,390
serve in the database.

22
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,650
So any create a new post.

23
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,330
You want the categories as well.

24
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,030
And this is the whole category.

25
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:01,770
So that means let's to make it less confusing, let's create another state for.

26
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,770
To put all the characters that we get from the database, we can call them loaded.

27
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:15,530
Loaded categories that loaded

28
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,800
new secular categories equals to use state.

29
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,020
All right.

30
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:31,880
So this way, when we make a request, you define all the categories that we get, we put here in this

31
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:40,250
state, and then during the push create or whatever, the user selects the categories for this post,

32
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,470
those categories that we put them here.

33
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:53,590
All right so let's use this use effect took it takes a function and now the second argument dependency

34
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,460
would leave it empty.

35
00:02:54,940 --> 00:03:01,360
So here we want to use axis to load all the categories.

36
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,390
So I want to put that in a separate function here.

37
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,180
So I'm just going to execute that function load

38
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:11,680
load categories.

39
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:14,860
All right.

40
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:22,090
So here, let me write that function load categories that we import X use.

41
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,330
So here I try.

42
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:47,660
So we destroyed it and data.

43
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:54,770
From.

44
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,150
Oh, wait.

45
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,470
Excuse.

46
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,120
Let's make sure this is async.

47
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,340
Are we to excuse?

48
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:10,960
Don't get to make it get to the end point.

49
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:11,680
That is.

50
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,420
C-class categories.

51
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:20,010
All right.

52
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,850
So that is all we need when we get the rest of that stuff.

53
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,790
You can console.log the data if you curious.

54
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:34,230
I'm just going to say directly in the state, I'm pretty sure we have got the data, so it should be

55
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,130
here in the state.

56
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:37,560
That's all.

57
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:44,940
So this function will fit all of the categories, populate the state, and this function is executed

58
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,260
on the component mounts.

59
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:53,550
All right, so if you want, let's have a look at these loaded categories in the state.

60
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,650
So we got this.

61
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,160
Ed, let's put it right after the break.

62
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:06,550
Break them just to use JSON string in front.

63
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,700
Loaded categories.

64
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:21,310
Okay.

65
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,580
Now, you can see here we have got the categories.

66
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:25,750
Beautiful.

67
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:34,750
Now these categories, I want to show them in a multiple selection element.

68
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:44,050
So we continue to use and designs select component.

69
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,090
So let me quickly sue.

70
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,620
So that one will be something like this one.

71
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,090
I guess they're going to more than one.

72
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:07,920
They will be able to type if 15 hit enter 17 should enter to their concerts and then when they select

73
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:15,000
the it will be popular here they can delete from their oh they can just click as well and we will be

74
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,930
able to, although they use it to select multiple categories.
