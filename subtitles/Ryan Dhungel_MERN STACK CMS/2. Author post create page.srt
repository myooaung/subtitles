1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:01,110
All right.

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:03,080
So we have the author layout.

3
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,370
We have the the navigation for author.

4
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:08,650
Currently, we are in our author desk for peace.

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,850
So let's go ahead, start working on these basis.

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,650
So let's start from the post.

7
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:20,010
So let's clear this base so that author can create a new post.

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,700
So let's go pages for admin.

9
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,340
We had the folder structure like this and then.

10
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,680
These are the files to create a new post object post.

11
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,840
We want to have a similar structure for also.

12
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:41,170
So let's create a new folder posts.

13
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:44,970
Inside a new.

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,950
And here let's have a look at the admin posts new.

15
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:59,580
And you can see we applied the layout and then we have the new push component.

16
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,580
So this component should work for us as well.

17
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,210
So all you need to do is change the layout from admin to author.

18
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:06,800
All right.

19
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:15,660
So let me just copy this one and then go to also post new and paste you to this to

20
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:25,050
actually we can leave it we can leave the name and just change the name from admin layout.

21
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,520
So let me just copy.

22
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,490
And now command f.

23
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:37,220
Find Ed Miliband and replace with also left.

24
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,310
It can then be safe.

25
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,830
And that is all we need.

26
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,460
That's so ridiculous.

27
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:48,970
Come here.

28
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,100
You can see how the police knew.

29
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:56,740
We have the exact same base to create a new post right now.

30
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:03,750
There is one problem in the some sense in the client state it's all good.

31
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,890
So used to be able to quit a new post.

32
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,750
This post is by also.

33
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,710
So you can choose the image.

34
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,880
So we don't see the images here.

35
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:26,340
That's because he said, don't worry about this one.

36
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:26,850
This one.

37
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,790
I was running a different story with Sokoto.

38
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:37,990
So what's happening here is a let me quickly take you to the back end.

39
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,700
So basically, the media is not accessible for author, right?

40
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:48,820
So previously everything we did was accessible only for the admin because we have the is admin middleware

41
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,620
applied in all our out.

42
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:50,980
Right.

43
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:56,050
So to create a post also you must be able to load the media library.

44
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,010
You must be admin.

45
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,930
Let's have a look

46
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,630
server raut's post.

47
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,200
Media.

48
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,250
You can see the is admin middle middle where is upload.

49
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,590
So that's where this user currently logged in.

50
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:20,480
This is the author has the role of author so he have no access to media.

51
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:28,910
So we have to fix this the middleware because now not only admin will be able to create, update and

52
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:36,050
do post, but also will also be able to create the post update and delete his post.

53
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:42,130
Not everyone else's but his post and should have access to the media is really should be able to upload

54
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:47,840
media and delete the media if he uploaded that particular media.

55
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,190
Right.

56
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,840
So we need a flexible middleware here.

57
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,040
The is admin.

58
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,380
We cannot continue using here.

59
00:03:55,010 --> 00:04:04,250
We'll be using his admin for some other things, but for the post categories in media, both admin and

60
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,220
author should have access, I guess.

61
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,120
So we're going to modify the middleware.

62
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:15,620
We're going to change this to something else so that it works.

63
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,780
So we'll work on that in the next video.

64
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:21,440
But here, as you can see, we didn't have access to media.

65
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:27,140
And if we try to create a post, let me just open the console.

66
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,870
If I try to publish.

67
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:39,510
You see, I get the air for three unauthorized.

68
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,710
This is a forbidden error.

69
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,250
If you go to the network and click here, you see.

70
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:54,280
Unauthorized because the user is not authorized to create a port, the user has to be awesome.

71
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,290
Quick boost and right.

72
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:04,720
So let's go ahead, create some flexible measures that will allow both admin and the user to create,

73
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,220
read, update and delete.

74
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:10,330
And then we can come back and just continue working on this basis.
