1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:08,280
I guess I will also be referring to this application all the time during this course, and you can also

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:15,960
come and have a look at the application and every part, whichever we are going to be working in the

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,560
Lexis.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,450
You know, you can see that here as well.

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:24,960
So that really saved me from writing a lot of diagrams and showing you the diagrams and extending,

6
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,550
I guess, are we doing this now?

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:27,420
We're going to do that.

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:28,440
We can do that.

9
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,460
You know, that takes quite a lot of time for you, for me as well.

10
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:39,540
Now, when we have the actual application already there, that eliminates the need for the for the diagram.

11
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:44,310
So I guess that is another reason why I decided to deploy this application.

12
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,780
So instead of drawing the mockups, I have the actual thing already there.

13
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:49,650
All right.

14
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,240
So let's let's say we are now ready to build our application.

15
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,310
So what is the first thing you will do?

16
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,200
Okay, so you have two options.

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,740
One, you can set you back in or you can set of your it.

18
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:11,520
Now, I usually prefer to set up in the the front end because front end, to be honest, front end requires

19
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,250
a lot of code worth writing in.

20
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:20,490
It's a little bit gets complicated as well as backing once you understand it is really straightforward

21
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:27,810
because back in you have the kind of a straight map, you create the routes, you create the control

22
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,210
functions, and that's pretty much it.

23
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,840
And then the controller will communicate with the database.

24
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:39,870
You have some database models, schemas, but that's pretty much it always the standard thing.

25
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:43,020
Whereas in the front end you have to do so many different thing.

26
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,090
For example, sign in is an app is have different things on the home page.

27
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,670
You do something different on the post page, you display the post and then in the back in the desk

28
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:59,220
where there is a whole lot of things to do, creating categories, creating post, uploading images.

29
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:03,840
There are so many things now when it comes to the back end, it's easy.

30
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,730
You send the blog, title, content, image, everything to the back end.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,300
Begging will save in the server and give you the response.

32
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,610
You know it's straightforward, whereas front end, it has a lot of moving pieces here and there.

33
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:24,240
So what are we going to do is we can just start with the funding that will make things so much easier

34
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,500
to understand as well.

35
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:26,190
All right.

36
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:31,110
So when you think of the application, when you think of building a full stack application, we should

37
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,250
have the back end funding.

38
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:37,110
Whereas the first thing you think is obviously set of the project at the moment, we don't have anything

39
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,330
with right away empty, sitting empty.

40
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:49,560
So we create in next year's project we'll be using next year, which is the most popular framework used

41
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,520
for products and applications to build React applications, right?

42
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,380
So it's a framework, React framework.

43
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:00,270
So we set up the project and we set up using NPM.

44
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:06,240
So I'll be showing you how you can set Node this project from absolute scratch.

45
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:14,250
Now don't get confused with Node.js and the react actually even react to use notice.

46
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,990
They also require a server.

47
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:16,560
All right.

48
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,670
So we'll be setting up React in next this project.

49
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,660
Once you have the project, we create a few basis, right?

50
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:29,730
So we create home and then maybe we create some sign in base and sign up base.

51
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:38,610
Once you have those phases, then we can think of actually creating the content for those phase.

52
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,090
All right.

53
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:46,590
So first we try creating new phases, maybe create a navigation, we add some links so that we can just

54
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:51,600
navigate around, go to Homebase, good design and basically design a base, you know, just have the

55
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,590
very basic framework for the application.

56
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:03,480
Few bases, epicenter shape is there and then we're going to focus on creating such forms, right?

57
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,130
Same in forms and of forms.

58
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:11,700
And then we need to send all this information that a user enters name, email, password, everything

59
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,260
we need to send to the backend so that we can save the user when they sign them.

60
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:16,830
Right?

61
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:20,970
And that's when we're going to go to the backend and set up our back end.

62
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,340
So that's how we go with the flow.

63
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:24,180
Okay.

64
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:28,260
Even though it's a bigger application, you don't need to stress we go with the flow.

65
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:36,960
So in the next section we set up the client application with React and next year we'll start creating

66
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:43,410
spaces for comparison and that's how we're going to start this beautiful journey.
