1
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.490
All right, so we have this feature.

2
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.670
However, we need to load different thesis files.

3
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:17.550
So for that, we have to put these separate CCS files, the dark and light in a folder here.

4
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:17.910
Right.

5
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.980
So in next year, whenever you have to store some kind of a static data, for example, images or cases,

6
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.460
there is a folder name you can use inside your project here.

7
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.880
Let's create a new folder called Public.

8
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.180
So this name is really important, just like pages.

9
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.610
This name was important because anything, any route you create here will be all relevant.

10
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.150
As a base here, right?

11
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:58.600
So just like that slice had me so we could go to admin because you created paste by the name of Amy.

12
00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:59.010
Right.

13
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.050
Similarly.

14
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.520
This public folder is quite important to any time you want to store some static images or CSS files.

15
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:16.490
This is where you want to put and the beauty of using this file name is you don't have to refer to Dada

16
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.510
to public.

17
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.510
You don't have to manually go like this.

18
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.340
You can just easily reference any folders in tag this directly.

19
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.250
You didn't have to write Dada publish manually.

20
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.610
You know, that's another beauty art.

21
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.320
So here we're going to have a two file.

22
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.340
One is called Light to assist in fact.

23
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.970
So let's put them inside styles folder.

24
00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.850
No to Celsius for.

25
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.460
Everything to this fall relates to fall.

26
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.940
One is light, it ceases in another.

27
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.210
One is dark, dark seriousness.

28
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:10.570
And now what you can do is you can go to this end component in the node modules and copy those two files

29
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.180
content and then just based here.

30
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.700
Now, I have to warn you that they're going to be quite a bit.

31
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.230
And when you copy paste, sometimes your calculator might hang.

32
00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.800
All right.

33
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.460
So another option, the nice and easy option is to just manually.

34
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.160
Good to explore your idea to hit.

35
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.880
So let's do this first, just so that you don't run into any issues.

36
00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:34.210
All right.

37
00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.340
So this is the project we are working on.

38
00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.920
Let's go into node modules and inside, let's go to end design.

39
00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.540
So let's go to end and inside here, let's go into this full.

40
00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.680
And here you can see we have the bunch of thesis for fallacy.

41
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.650
This is the and doses this is this standard delayed thing.

42
00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:03.690
So you can copy this and rename this file to light and this one and done you can copy this and.

43
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.180
Rename this to Duck.

44
00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.410
All right.

45
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.660
So let me just copy this one.

46
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.900
Come here and the public.

47
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:18.060
Yeah.

48
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.790
And let me ask you to move this one I to this just so that we don't run into any issues.

49
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.430
Let's remember that in this based here.

50
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.480
All right.

51
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.960
So this for the light thing, let's go back one more time.

52
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.910
Let's copy the dark one as well.

53
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.530
Copy that.

54
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:48.490
And good public thesis is that here we can since it's send the file name.

55
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.660
Rename to Light.

56
00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.640
And then this one, let's rename to Doc.

57
00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.130
So I'm just going to remove this product.

58
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.440
Awesome.

59
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.630
Beautiful.

60
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.980
Now we have light and dark themes, and both theses files are here.

61
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.690
All right.

62
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.630
Okay.

63
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.860
Let me close that.

64
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:27.100
And you said they are here, so that means you don't want to now import and use here and introduce a

65
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.000
common debt out.

66
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.440
And if you come in the out, we don't have anything at the moment, obviously.

67
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.720
Thank you.

68
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.980
What do you want to do?

69
00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.750
Well, in fact, let me just.

70
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.650
Oh, okay.

71
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.380
Since actually it is already working so hard.

72
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.490
Working because we already draw the court to make sure you don't have it here.

73
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.010
And then it's good to with him.

74
00:04:54.010 --> 00:05:00.490
Since we already implemented this, it is already working because whenever you click, the value changes

75
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.130
from light to dark and from dark to light.

76
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.720
All right.

77
00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:12.640
So based on that, the CCIS is loaded and it is put in the headset so that you could easily toggle the

78
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.000
thing.

79
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:19.600
And since his time you told him the value saved here and the local stories as well, you can see it

80
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.890
changes from light to dark.

81
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:28.480
And if you user choose the dark theme and then they come back to our application again are really over

82
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.990
the place.

83
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:35.530
We continue to use the dark theme and if they were using light, come back to the application.

84
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:41.140
We continue to use the light theme we remember use this preference because we have saved in the local

85
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.390
stories absolutely beautiful.
