1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,910
So we noticed that we have the title, but we don't have the content to fix this one.

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:13,320
We can use the loading state, so by default we can keep the loading stated to two saluting the value

3
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:14,580
instead of false.

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,480
Let's make it true.

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,340
I guess if by default it's true.

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,560
That means we're still loading the post.

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,940
We don't have the post yet.

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,690
But when we got the post, we changed this to false.

9
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,350
And when it is false, that means alerting is done.

10
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,850
Now we can show the content because we have already received the total content, everything we need.

11
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:40,980
So with with that issue, we will be able to serve the content in absolute post.

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,740
So by default, what we're going to do is said, Oh, actually we don't have to do that by default.

13
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:54,060
Loading is true in our state, unlike false, which we have been using a lot of the time.

14
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,350
This time we said it.

15
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,240
Okay, so.

16
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,800
Once we received the data, we said that the force said loading.

17
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:05,720
We said that to false.

18
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,710
So as you can see, by default, the loading will be true.

19
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:11,540
Until we receive the data.

20
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,030
When we receive the data, then it will be false.

21
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:20,600
Based on that conditional, we can do the rendering of this content in this edit.

22
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:21,980
So here.

23
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:28,580
Let me put that into entire div in the conditional.

24
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,000
All right.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,140
So let me cut.

26
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:31,610
And you.

27
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:35,590
They've got.

28
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:45,670
You know, if if we have the loading state using the 2D stoner operator, if we if we are in the loading

29
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,890
state, then we can do something.

30
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:50,410
Otherwise we can show that.

31
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:54,820
So that's that's a proof based what we got.

32
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:01,870
I guess if we are in the loading state, then we should be loading text.

33
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:06,190
Otherwise we should the entity with the content.

34
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:08,410
Okay.

35
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:09,820
So the loading actually.

36
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:10,780
Yeah.

37
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,680
We can do like that.

38
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,780
We have the different value content now.

39
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,740
I think he was quick.

40
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,400
Reload.

41
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:25,850
Okay.

42
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:31,760
Now you can see for a brief few milliseconds we saw loading, but then when the loading became false,

43
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,750
then we got the content.

44
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,860
And then only then we render this at the editor.

45
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,450
So that works now.

46
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,310
Let's try one more time.

47
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:44,690
Listen.

48
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,470
Let's see.

49
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,670
We want to edit this one.

50
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,110
You can see networks.

51
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,290
Beautiful.

52
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:53,840
I also got the title.

53
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:57,330
We got the content, the categories.

54
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,600
Now you can see these are the loaded categories.

55
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,390
These are not specific to this post.

56
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,730
These categories are the list of categories that we have in our database.

57
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:15,780
Now, instead that what we want is we want to fill these post categories and we have to show them,

58
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,000
as people put it, pre-selected here.

59
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,090
Actually.

60
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:29,600
What we need to do is we have to continue pursuing these options, but we have to show the existing

61
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,820
categories of this forced, if there is any.

62
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,930
We have to see Olympia as preselected because just like.

63
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,440
Just like this one.

64
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,330
Me?

65
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,450
This is the finished project, madam.

66
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:42,160
It's.

67
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,670
Come here.

68
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,180
Let's find a post that has some categories.

69
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,330
And this one might have to.

70
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,840
I've said this one doesn't have.

71
00:03:59,400 --> 00:03:59,700
Okay.

72
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:05,250
So none of them have to let me actually go and edit this quickly so that I can see.

73
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,060
Let's edit this graphic you.

74
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,010
It doesn't have react?

75
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,400
No.

76
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:18,580
So let's say this post has these two categories.

77
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,530
Let's update.

78
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:22,040
I'll get done.

79
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:28,160
Now, if I go to edit this one, you can see these categories are preselected.

80
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:29,360
Beautiful, right?

81
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,890
So these are preselected.

82
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:34,130
That means when you're upgrading, you know which category is already there.

83
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,680
If you want a chance, obviously, you know, you can now choose more.

84
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:42,730
And the selected ones are already there.

85
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,750
You know, they they are identical.

86
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,700
You can see these are already selected.

87
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:51,600
So you can click to on select, select or you can get beautiful.

88
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,090
So that's what you want to do.

89
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:59,540
So for that, first of all, it's good.

90
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,740
It's load first.

91
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:03,820
What do you want to do here?

92
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:04,950
We want to

93
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:14,070
map through the categories because if you remember, let me just continue on the post categories that

94
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,650
is object that just not the category name.

95
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,120
They have the slug.

96
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,920
They have the idea as well.

97
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:21,990
So.

98
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,140
So here you can see categories.

99
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:40,040
We basically need just a name for this and is and component.

100
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,820
However what we get is this the entire object.

101
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:47,120
Now it has the name ID and slot.

102
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:53,090
Now what we need to do is we need to map through the categories every and just extract the name so that

103
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:57,380
we can show them here along with the other options.

104
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:58,550
Right.

105
00:05:58,910 --> 00:05:59,240
So.

106
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:14,590
What we can do here is we can do before and create a loop to get all the names in common, plus category

107
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,220
names.

108
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:19,750
So let's create a variable called array equals to the value.

109
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,730
Add the empty object, also empty array.

110
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:29,290
And we're going to map through the categories data dot categories, dark map.

111
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:36,160
So we move through the category and each category we get, we want to push to this area so we can use

112
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,740
a red dot whose.

113
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,220
See me.

114
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:46,300
Because all you want is puts the name into the story.

115
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:51,400
I So with that we get all the categories names in this area.

116
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:58,090
Now we can use that value to populate the categories states or set categories.

117
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:58,680
Or we.

118
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:02,440
Okay.

119
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:03,340
So.

120
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:04,760
That.

121
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,570
Let's come here.

122
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:12,190
And did.

123
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:13,780
Okay.

124
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:19,880
So when we created this post properly, we didn't have any categories, so we don't see any of them.

125
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,600
So let's.

126
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,600
Let's go ahead and create a new one.

127
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,030
Screwed a new one.

128
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:38,330
And it's what?

129
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:38,950
Content.

130
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,640
Let's pick one featured image.

131
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,340
Let's pick one of the existing one.

132
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:47,620
Let's be.

133
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:49,530
This.

134
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:01,250
Thank you to my competitors running really slow the processor struggling because I'm recording at the

135
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:01,730
same time.

136
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,250
Okay.

137
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,960
So we've got twos that feature image categories.

138
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,630
Let's choose to react and note and publish.

139
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,100
I guess it has been published.

140
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,540
You can see it's there.

141
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,680
Let me try.

142
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:16,250
Edit.

143
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,930
When I come to edit, I don't see them pre-populated here.

144
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,060
So that's fine.

145
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:27,690
But at least we know that this post now has two categories, so let's see why it's populating here.

146
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,300
That's probably because if you come down.

147
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,510
So we've got a select.

148
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:48,870
So on terms we had but two so the the default the existing one so we can use another box called value.

149
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:51,420
So the value.

150
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:58,310
So the VAT is going to be the array of categories, right?

151
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:02,420
So that you can spread out the risk to the arrays.

152
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,110
The categories are the array and they have the.

153
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:07,910
Just in name.

154
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,110
That's what we need.

155
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,300
So if we didn't.

156
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,390
Didn't do that.

157
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,000
Look, are you just to give the name?

158
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,140
Then you'd be just looking at the objects.

159
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:25,520
I guess that's why we had to just extract the name, push, push in the array and use that to upgrade

160
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,060
the state.

161
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:32,900
So as a result, we should be able to see the category names here with this value.

162
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,690
Why do we set the value to the select with the array of names?

163
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,070
Beautiful.

164
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,610
Now you can see we have them there.

165
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:50,570
And then since the loaded categories and this these selected categories, they share the exact same

166
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:50,810
name.

167
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,350
You can see the list there selected here.

168
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:55,790
Now you can add more.

169
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:56,750
You can delete more.

170
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,310
Beautiful.

171
00:09:59,540 --> 00:09:59,870
All right.

172
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,330
So we've got the name.

173
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,770
We get the content.

174
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,640
We can choose the featured image.

175
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,520
We can upload a new one, or we can choose the existing one.

176
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,820
It doesn't really matter this component.

177
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:17,950
He's sitting there and it works whenever you.

178
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,370
I use on anywhere else.

179
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:21,630
Right.

180
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:27,750
So it has the context whenever you select the selected images will be available in the context.

181
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:33,550
So when you update the post, you just have to grab it from the state and say all together so that you

182
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,800
have the updated images.

183
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:36,280
All right.

184
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,350
So let's say we did this one.

185
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:40,720
So this one.

186
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,120
And finally we can publish.

187
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:54,560
Now, at the moment it will not work because we have to create the endpoint in the backend to handle

188
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,490
the post update.

189
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:59,090
And here also we may need to make some changes here.

190
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,900
So obviously we have to change this.

191
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:10,280
So let's, let's do it send this to edit post and we want to send the post slow post.

192
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,780
I have already saved the idea in the state, so let's send that.

193
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:20,000
So that would be post I'd.

194
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:25,230
So good.

195
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,840
The title content featured images.

196
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:33,240
The film is actually what we need to do here is first we have to take if this post.

197
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:46,640
Well, actually, first we have to check if the media in the state, if we pick a images from the library

198
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,160
like that.

199
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,740
So when we have that, whether we upload a new one or pick from the library.

200
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:55,760
So whatever that is, so we can show that which we are already doing here.

201
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,090
So if the media selected it.

202
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:07,130
So if we have that, then obviously we want to send that to the back end so that we can serve as a featured

203
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:07,390
image.

204
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,680
So in that case, we do.

205
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:12,790
Media

206
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,880
selected this Friday.

207
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,090
Otherwise.

208
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:26,770
We may actually have the featured image of this post already, I guess.

209
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:26,770
Already?

210
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:27,920
Not always.

211
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,970
You want to update a him as if the image was already there.

212
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,670
And you okay with that then obviously you can continue using that.

213
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:42,080
So that means and the the post might have the existing featured image which is you can see here when

214
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,180
you load the post said featured image.

215
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:48,290
We have this state here local state and we put the value here.

216
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:51,560
So featured image we can access from the state.

217
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,140
So if it is there, then we can use that.

218
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,680
You know, if it is selected then we grab that.

219
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:03,680
If not, we may already have in the state, then we can grab that featured images.

220
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:09,260
Otherwise it's going to be a nested ternary.

221
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,050
I guess that's the the first expression.

222
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:14,620
If that is true, we use that.

223
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:18,830
Otherwise, again, we take for future limits.

224
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:23,060
So if we have the featured image, let's take four on the slide.

225
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:29,870
So if we have the featured image I.D., then again, we're going to continue using that.

226
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:30,080
Right?

227
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:35,840
So featured image, don't underscore it.

228
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:44,150
Now, if it is not there, which means you can see nothing was selected and it didn't have the existing

229
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,410
featured images as well.

230
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,350
So in that case, this post doesn't have the implicit image.

231
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:55,460
So in that case we can just send undefined.

232
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:59,660
So when you send undefined, the nothing will be saved in the database.

233
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,950
So it looks like we have some syntax error.

234
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:06,140
So that's the funnest first time.

235
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,480
If it is true, we use that.

236
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,310
Otherwise we use that.

237
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:13,570
Otherwise.

238
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,670
Again, it's a nifty toner.

239
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,280
So we use question mark here.

240
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,040
If that is true, we used that otherwise.

241
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:30,340
Finally, if nothing is undefined, I guess it's a big finish to time to get the featured images.

242
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,650
We're going to send it to the back end.

243
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:41,640
Now there's one more thing we have to do here before we actually worry about this request, and that

244
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,440
is suing the featured image.

245
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,440
So at the moment we are suing it only if they pick one.

246
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,860
What if this post already had the featured image?

247
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:51,360
All right.

248
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,560
So we had to work on that.

249
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:58,380
So we know when we created the created this post just before we build the image.

250
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:02,410
So we are sure we have this post as the featured image.

251
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,490
So let's see how we can show that featured image here.

252
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,130
If I reload now, you don't see that.

253
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,330
So let's see how we can show the existing featured images.

254
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,730
And then finally we're going to give it a try.
