1
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.200
All right.

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.380
So here in the user comments, a component.

3
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:13.970
We need to have similar code that we previously had for the comment section in the admin desk.

4
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.660
Right.

5
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.960
So let's go to Baz's admin.

6
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.420
Comments index.

7
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.490
We can copy all discord.

8
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.030
Scorpio on Discord and we make the changes.

9
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:36.560
I used to copy everything, go to user comment and actually you can see that a place that sends a name

10
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.840
to the user comment.

11
00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:44.200
You should come.

12
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.500
So here.

13
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.390
Let's leave the imports as it is for now.

14
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:53.620
Admin layout.

15
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.370
We don't need that.

16
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.920
So let's do the layout.

17
00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.490
So that means let's come down here to the layout.

18
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.690
Let's leave it like a fragment.

19
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.670
Okay.

20
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And then here we will not have the pagination.

21
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.560
This is only for showing the current to use this comment.

22
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.380
So we don't need to get.

23
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.700
Don't.

24
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.430
We don't need.

25
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.980
To face the comments based on the phase changes.

26
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.380
Right.

27
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.940
So we didn't get total.

28
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.390
That means we don't need the total and BS from this in the state.

29
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:40.700
Next.

30
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.750
Andrew Tillett.

31
00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.050
Let's leave it for now.

32
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.760
We'll come back to this one filtering.

33
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.570
We can leave that list of comments.

34
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.370
We're going to leave that the insert of view.

35
00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.350
It will be edited.

36
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:00.950
We will work on that.

37
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:04.420
No more.

38
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.200
We don't need them.

39
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.920
I guess let's go on to the first thing we want to do is face are the comments, but this time it will

40
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.410
be the user comments.

41
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.800
All right.

42
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.150
So first comments here, let's send this to the user.

43
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.860
Comments.

44
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.330
Back and then we can just use sitcom and stuff.

45
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.230
All right.

46
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.180
So let's have a look.

47
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.720
Let's make sure we're getting the uses coming out of context.

48
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.530
So the path of results especially.

49
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.630
Are important in the right path.

50
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.590
So we are here.

51
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.460
So one step up to step up.

52
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.920
That's true.

53
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.690
All right, so we have the base here.

54
00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.560
Great.

55
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.000
We don't see any comments.

56
00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:02.640
User.

57
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.110
Comments.

58
00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.640
See the comments.

59
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.460
Populate is not a function.

60
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:14.490
User comments.

61
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:15.500
So we have some issues.

62
00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.370
Controllers push this to 75.

63
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.030
Let's have a look.

64
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.950
Let's go to the backing controllers post 275.

65
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:27.310
Populate.

66
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.980
So we find out the comments.

67
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:37.330
Come and find out this time we trying to find by the posted by foster by request user ID.

68
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.460
Then we populated posted by.

69
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.060
Popular post indie.

70
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:54.550
This looks high.

71
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.840
Population is not a function.

72
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:13.500
Okay.

73
00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.780
Okay.

74
00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.700
So we have this table here to find.

75
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.300
Right.

76
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.020
So find.

77
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:20.600
Find about that.

78
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:27.710
And then we should have the the parenthesis, closing parenthesis, and then we as populate that should

79
00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:28.060
be there.

80
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.810
Okay.

81
00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.200
So there was a bit of type of that.

82
00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.720
Okay, let's after that fix.

83
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.120
Hopefully it works.

84
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.440
You to reload.

85
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.580
Beautiful beautiful.

86
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:49.410
So we have this user commented this user have should come in to it comments ryan also has a comment

87
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.470
let's have a look at this are the uses of square.

88
00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:56.960
And he doesn't have any comment.

89
00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:02.300
So let's go and let's leave some comments by this user.

90
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.290
Just some.

91
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:12.220
Wow.

92
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.660
I like the commenting system here.

93
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:27.280
All right.

94
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.700
So this is a live to comment.

95
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.860
Let's see if we can have a look at that in out in the decimal.

96
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.660
Surely we can.

97
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:35.260
Beautiful.

98
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.560
I guess it's working for subscriber.

99
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.530
And also now we want to implement, edit and delete.

100
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:48.010
So let's change this from view to edit and then we work on the delete as well.

101
00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:54.640
I think delete will work because we already have applied the mirror work and update delete.

102
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.900
So let's actually give it a try.

103
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.150
So we have it coming.

104
00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:02.230
Let's delete and we have seven comments will reload.

105
00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:05.190
Beautiful.

106
00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.560
Archie Dillard is already working.

107
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.550
Starting.

108
00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:09.300
Already working.

109
00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.670
I'm pretty sure she is beautiful.

110
00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.870
So the only thing we need to do is work on this one instead of you.

111
00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.840
Let's make it.

112
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.170
Edit Or if you want to, you can even leave this.

113
00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:20.400
You can live you.

114
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.570
And just add one more link for us to.

115
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:30.610
So user comments.

116
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:33.890
Let's go down here.

117
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:35.810
Accents are really.

118
00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:37.410
It.

119
00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.130
All right, so let's copy that.

120
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.910
View, edit and delete.

121
00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.000
Let's call it edit.

122
00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:53.550
And this time what is going to do is we're going to actually take them to a different page to edit the

123
00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:54.140
comment.

124
00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.250
Instead, we're going to open up a model.

125
00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:02.820
So some kind of a model, pop up model, and that's where we use them to be able to update the comment.

126
00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:05.220
So that means.

127
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:14.480
Edit Let me actually just let me remove this link on to you.

128
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:18.890
Let me just leave the edit here and click.

129
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.310
We'll do something.

130
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:21.290
So what do you want to do?

131
00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:28.610
If we want to source the model, then we need to have the visible state in the state by default will

132
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:32.840
not make it visible, but when they click on this edit, we make that visible.

133
00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:33.890
Okay.

134
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.030
That is one thing.

135
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:40.730
Another thing is whichever comment either wants to edit on click.

136
00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:46.700
We want to put this item, this comment in the state so that we know which comment to edit.

137
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:47.300
Right.

138
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.280
So that is also we want to put in the state.

139
00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:54.230
And the content.

140
00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:59.790
So basically when the update happens, the content of the comment tends is right.

141
00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:06.430
So to put that change in the state, we need another state called content.

142
00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:07.010
All right.

143
00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:08.550
So let's let's work on that.

144
00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:09.570
That's great.

145
00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:13.050
Some state needed for update.

146
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:19.200
So we need one selected.

147
00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:27.670
Comment said selected government agencies to use state

148
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:31.760
meteorology.

149
00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:32.500
All right.

150
00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:40.090
So we need that when the when that edit it's clicked we take that comment and put it here in this state.

151
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:48.160
Next one is the contents sent continue to be used.

152
00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.670
State by definition of empty.

153
00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:59.230
So the comment the comments value on click we would populate the content and then they can make some

154
00:08:59.230 --> 00:08:59.770
changes.

155
00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:02.340
That's how they would update, right?

156
00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:08.380
The next one is visible, said visible.

157
00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:11.430
Increased use state false.

158
00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:15.010
This will be used for our model.

159
00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:19.030
So let's bring the model component from and as well some model.

160
00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.650
And then on the bottom click we change the value.

161
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.940
So let's go down.

162
00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:33.130
So we have the edit on click.

163
00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.180
We can put this quote in a function or we can just do it.

164
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.620
It's not much.

165
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:42.660
Only said selected comment.

166
00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:48.060
That would be the item toward a rendering comment item that Trump said visible.

167
00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:49.530
We make it true.

168
00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:55.350
And then said content.

169
00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:59.280
That would be item of content.

170
00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:00.550
All right, beautiful.

171
00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:02.700
Great.

172
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:06.090
Now, all this value that we have in the state, we can.

173
00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:09.680
Use the phone just like we had before.

174
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:11.180
Comment form to create a form.

175
00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:19.010
We can use the similar form pre-populated the value that would be content based on the visible.

176
00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.510
We can display the model.

177
00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:21.560
Okay.

178
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:22.070
So that's.

179
00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.510
That's beautiful.

180
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:26.640
So let's show the model.

181
00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:31.130
And our model doesn't have to be anywhere inside the room.

182
00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.280
So it's come down here.

183
00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:38.880
This role, it's quite another role for morale.

184
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:48.280
Actually.

185
00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:59.070
Yeah, we should create, draw and column because we want to show the comment form as well and the comment

186
00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:02.730
comment from will so into tomorrow.

187
00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:06.170
So it's column and rules.

188
00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:10.290
I think it's not really important, but it's still to use it anyways.

189
00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:17.420
I guess we got the roll call inside here.

190
00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:18.640
We want to show the mural.

191
00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.220
That's a model.

192
00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:29.330
Dorothy.

193
00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:33.880
Update.

194
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:40.170
Let's call it comment because we give the target to the model

195
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:43.520
on.

196
00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:44.180
Okay.

197
00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:45.700
Okay.

198
00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:46.350
Set.

199
00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:49.340
We should use elephants here.

200
00:11:50.450 --> 00:12:00.710
Sit visible faults so we can use this for council as its own council.

201
00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:05.900
I'm okay.

202
00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:11.930
Close cancel to close funeral.

203
00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:15.200
We don't want to show any different buttons or make.

204
00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:15.560
No.

205
00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:19.890
And when it's finished, you.

206
00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:21.930
Starting.

207
00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:22.560
Okay.

208
00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:30.360
Cancel visible the most important visible visible value in the statue.

209
00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.410
And that is true.

210
00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:34.500
When this is clicked, that'll be true.

211
00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:36.120
So when it's true, we saw the moral.

212
00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.470
Otherwise it would be hidden.

213
00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:39.570
Okay, so in this model.

214
00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:47.610
In this model, we want to show it's use it like that to intel model.

215
00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:49.650
We want to show the form, model, form.

216
00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:53.130
And luckily we we can reuse this form.

217
00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.140
Previously we had comment form.

218
00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:57.330
You can see this coming form.

219
00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:00.700
Has the text area and a button.

220
00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:03.370
So we need to make sure we pass these functions.

221
00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:11.050
Comment said comment listed values and the function and then handle submit to when it is submitted.

222
00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:12.850
What should happen to previously?

223
00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:14.050
We created the comment.

224
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:19.930
This time we would object comment so we can send the handle submit function, send the comment.

225
00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:25.050
And this would work because we had the text area, we have the button.

226
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:25.650
All right.

227
00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:28.840
So let's try to use that comment form.

228
00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.770
Let's import.

229
00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.930
So we have already entered component.

230
00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:43.560
So we actually we just for I can't comment.

231
00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:46.390
Okay.

232
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:47.650
It's that.

233
00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:51.510
Inside the model.

234
00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:55.890
Let me just leave it like this for now.

235
00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:58.110
Let's see the progress so far.

236
00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:03.660
When I click edit, I get that model comment from Beautiful.
