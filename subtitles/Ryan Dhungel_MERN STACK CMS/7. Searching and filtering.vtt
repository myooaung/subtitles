00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:06.210
All right, so let's work on the searching and filtering something like this.

2
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:18.900
So we start from this page admin posts of posts, and I think we all read their admin posts index.

3
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.180
So here is a first.

4
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.440
When you type something in the input field, we need to put that value in the state.

5
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.210
So let's clear the state.

6
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.650
Let's bring the use state.

7
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.270
Who again to?

8
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:45.740
And we can call that keyword keyword sort of the user types said keyword used to.

9
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:57.730
Then once you have that, it would need to have that source back and we can render it that way, which

10
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.070
we have the post list.

11
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.540
We have the heading.

12
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.130
We can just put it right here.

13
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.350
So here we use input component from end.

14
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.300
All right.

15
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:21.470
And then we give the placeholder, let's call it search type.

16
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.470
Search

17
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.890
value

18
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.500
to value is going to be keyword.

19
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:46.940
And then on its end, we give the value, the uses that types using event target values, event set,

20
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.310
keyword event target target then.

21
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.940
Now in addition to this, now what I'm going to do is I'm going to make it all lowercase because when

22
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.150
you're just typing in for sorting something, most likely they will be typing in the lowercase.

23
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.720
So we use it lowercase.

24
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.840
Actually we can just you to lower case.

25
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.000
All right, so we have the input field.

26
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.660
So why do we use the types in we put in the state all lowercase.

27
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.980
And then.

28
00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.560
We just need to filter out the list, right to post list.

29
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.400
We have this component that is responsible for suing on the post.

30
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.780
So this post we just need to filter out.

31
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:44.120
So.

32
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.190
You did.

33
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.140
Looks like we have duplicate.

34
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.540
Oh.

35
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:54.590
So it's already there.

36
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:06.000
Input we don't have the component from and it's important inputs.

37
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.880
All right.

38
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.850
So we have that.

39
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.620
But obviously, it doesn't work at the moment.

40
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.290
What do we use, the types that keyword we have in the state?

41
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.890
Now, based on that keyword, we can filter out and that is something we can put in a separate function.

42
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.050
Oh, we can even put.

43
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.420
All right here.

44
00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:31.750
So post instead of sending the post, let's filter out based on the keyword because that's the only

45
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.410
those are the posting one want to show.

46
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.890
Right.

47
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:46.750
So post dot filter and filter is a function that takes another function.

48
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:47.500
All right.

49
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.770
So when you filter, that means

50
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.020
we are accessing its post into this filter function.

51
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:10.570
So when we get is post, what you would do is you want to filter out the post total dot lowercase.

52
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.860
You want to make sure make it lowercase so that we can compare with the keyword.

53
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:22.840
I used to if the post title lowercase includes the keyword that you have typed and that is in the state,

54
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.800
then you want to render that right.

55
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.420
So by default it will all render.

56
00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.260
To lower costs.

57
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.910
I guess by default it would render everything.

58
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.070
But as soon as the user type something in it will take if.

59
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.280
That cured whatever time did.

60
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:54.690
If that in if the post data includes that keyword, then that will be that rendered.

61
00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:01.150
So when you use it, I have something that will get filter, but otherwise it will be just empty so

62
00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.790
that everything will be visible.

63
00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.190
I get to Can he see you?

64
00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.850
So let's try first.

65
00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:17.330
First you can see here, Phaedra, understand you.

66
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.130
Okay.

67
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.170
So this really nice searching filtering.

68
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.480
And this is something we can use in other bases as a principle.

69
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.580
All users see and use it here as well.

70
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.350
So let's try to use that here.

71
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.440
We can filter out and we can filter out.

72
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.630
So it's going to be similar.

73
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:37.590
So I'm going to.

74
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.200
Open a new and new split window.

75
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:48.650
And here I want to open another file for admin users index.

76
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.310
All right.

77
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.050
So here we need this state so you can just cook in it.

78
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.600
Then.

79
00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.770
We want that input, which is right here.

80
00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.140
Let's copy that and make sure we have the input component.

81
00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:25.020
So it's come down here to the written block and we can put it right here, just under the heading.

82
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:27.470
All right.

83
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:39.020
So the similar do we need to filter out right now this time what we have here is we are using list list

84
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.390
data, source, narcissus users.

85
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.890
I can put it in a variable as much of this value.

86
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.750
Let's call it filtered users.

87
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:52.370
It's a data source.

88
00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:58.450
To use this.

89
00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:59.950
I'm going to put it in a very.

90
00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.920
Going to filter two uses equals to.

91
00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:20.310
He uses a filter might have been maybe just put this question mark at as well so that sometimes you

92
00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:24.720
might not have the post immediately and the filter function will throw an error.

93
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:25.800
Okay.

94
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.120
So uses filter filter function.

95
00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:35.970
Then you get each user and you.

96
00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.880
To use a dog name.

97
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.960
Don't do no kiss.

98
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:51.340
Includes the cure.

99
00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.040
All right, so that's the filter.

100
00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:57.760
It's the same thing.

101
00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.880
But this time we put in a variable just to make things a little bit cleaner.

102
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:07.810
All right, so filtered uses we are giving here to this list as data, so let's give it a try.

103
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:11.140
Now, guess we've got that server admin.

104
00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:14.400
Beautiful also.

105
00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:15.910
All right, so it works.

106
00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:16.510
Awesome.

107
00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:26.290
All right, so you learn how to easily use searching and filtering in your users as well as in posts.
