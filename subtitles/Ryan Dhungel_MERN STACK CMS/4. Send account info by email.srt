1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,140
All right.

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,450
So let's try this e-mail feature as well.

3
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:09,810
So in a tick and when I send a valid email so it's important you need to send the used a valid email

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,480
so that the email can be delivered, right?

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:19,860
So first of all, let me go to the database and delete this user because this user, it's already created.

6
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,970
Morency to Linda in that.

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:32,880
Okay.

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:40,470
Now, before I try submit, let me just come back here in my control.

9
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,830
And here, let me just go to the top first.

10
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,090
Make sure we have seen.

11
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,920
All right, so we have that.

12
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,580
So we're going to use SendGrid to send to email.

13
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:59,040
So if we're going to send an email, so first we can prepare the email.

14
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:09,180
So when we prepare the email, it should have the, the, from, from where it's sending to who is receiving

15
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,370
those email addresses and then the subject and the body of the email.

16
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,440
So I can put that in a variable email, Don.

17
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,260
So I can't.

18
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,430
Do we need do we need from.

19
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,480
We need a subject.

20
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,960
And then we need his team, his body, so we can send them.

21
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:43,620
Also to that will be this user, the user's email, the one we have.

22
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,180
So we're going to queer this user.

23
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:52,230
So that email, that's why I said make sure to use the valid email because that's where it will be sent.

24
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,880
So it should be valid now from now.

25
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,500
This from is really important.

26
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:56,840
Okay.

27
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:05,430
So from if you remember in the very beginning when we sign up to send SendGrid, we had a verified email,

28
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:05,880
right?

29
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:12,030
So that when we put in our N refer manasi a message symbol dot com.

30
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:19,680
So we used the similar just to sign up to send and send it ask us to verify the email address.

31
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:19,970
Right.

32
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:22,830
So, and we use that email to verify it.

33
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,210
So they send us the link.

34
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,490
We Clinton the league email us verify.

35
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,580
So only this discounts an email.

36
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:40,110
Okay so this email from here from it will always be processed or invited email from okay so make sure

37
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:47,040
we have that verified email that you used previously.

38
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,660
Now when you sign up for SendGrid and verify the email, use that here.

39
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,300
I guess that's important subject.

40
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,460
Let's call it account

41
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,330
create.

42
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:09,600
Right so when admin many liquid user then we send them the email account created and his team an email

43
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:18,660
going to compose you could use basic you could just send a text like this as well but we can use has

44
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:29,040
time, so let's use back text and here in the back text we want to we can put some page one has to write

45
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,890
some standard his email email.

46
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,060
So on his one we can write hi.

47
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,160
And we can use the user's name.

48
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:52,270
So in practice we can put all these variables using the syntax here.

49
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,500
I'm going to use.

50
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,840
So we have the users.

51
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,440
His name.

52
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:01,930
Let me just use a Peter.

53
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:14,350
And he lets the youth see him as a comment been.

54
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,420
Created it successfully.

55
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:41,390
I was calling this one, put it on me and I can show the log in details as you see your log in details.

56
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,480
That didn't make it through this one.

57
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,250
Slogan details.

58
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:53,600
I can certainly use this email and the use as possible.

59
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:54,130
All right.

60
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:59,330
So email that that will be the email, right.

61
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,360
So that's fun and password.

62
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:08,800
Again, we send the password now if you want you can create some of as well.

63
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:12,110
So start equal to email.

64
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,960
Make it let's make it call.

65
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:18,230
Wait and let me do the same for password.

66
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,930
That's a start.

67
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,610
For which.

68
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,310
All right.

69
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,280
And we didn't see one thing here.

70
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:56,880
It's it's it's often but what we can say is since we are many of a generation, the password may be

71
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,340
user 1 to 2 in the password.

72
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:10,050
So let's say we do recommend you to change your password after you log.

73
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,430
Let's make it smart.

74
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:20,610
All right.

75
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,890
So this is the email we want to send to the user.

76
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:29,790
So if we create this email data and we want to send this in Mendonca, and for that we can use SendGrid.

77
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,130
Right.

78
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,190
So let's try.

79
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:36,710
Get in there.

80
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:43,170
Console.log.

81
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,900
And so what are we going to try here?

82
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,020
Is we going to

83
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:58,830
use a we send we need mail.

84
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:03,670
$0.01 and we give this in.

85
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,690
No funding cuts and low.

86
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:15,870
All right.

87
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,250
So that's all you need to send the email now.

88
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:26,350
Let's give it a try to make sure the email is sent.

89
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:33,310
Now, of course, for the email to be sent to you, use the valid email address.

90
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:42,250
You use the verified email in the from field and you need to make sure that you haven't exposed the

91
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:47,430
send secret key anywhere in GitHub repository or anything like that.

92
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,850
Otherwise that would be invalid.

93
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:55,240
I guess in that case you can again generate another one, go to the SendGrid and then just generate

94
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,590
a new key.

95
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,270
So let me try.

96
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:07,250
This looks like we've got some issues.

97
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:11,360
I just cannot access password before initialization.

98
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,650
Line two.

99
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:13,250
One, two.

100
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:17,620
Basil.

101
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,630
Okay.

102
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,640
Passports.

103
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:32,230
Thanks to the password it actually has phosphor but we're not saying it has burst.

104
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:35,030
Was obviously passed for.

105
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:49,550
I think what we need to do here is put this block.

106
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:59,400
Cut it out and we put on top before we actually use here to grow to use it.

107
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,930
So let's just move here.

108
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,560
All right, so he has the password.

109
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,500
If we send the e-mail as well.

110
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,110
And then we're going to save.

111
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:18,750
Because at this point, we can save the user because we will detect if the user exists.

112
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:24,660
I guess in that case we can send the email and then continue saving the user in the database.

113
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:31,710
The reason we have that issue is because we distribute password like this.

114
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:41,010
So unless we could, we could actually, instead of using rest, we could just manually sent the response

115
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:47,820
like response system like for example, user

116
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:55,880
email user don't in.

117
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,960
So we could send like that, right?

118
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,260
So the name is the name.

119
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,480
So we could send the response like this.

120
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:08,420
So this user has been created and we send the created you this information.

121
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,630
We can send it like this.

122
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,900
What if we do it like this?

123
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,360
Then the password is already here.

124
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,190
The variable so that conflicts here.

125
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:24,420
So within this block, if we can put it here, so we can just put it on top like this.

126
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:30,810
Okay, so let's give it a try and it's try submit images taken.

127
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:31,620
So looks like.

128
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:38,570
Yeah, even though we had the issue, it was actually created, the user was created telling me this

129
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,210
difference.

130
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:52,460
Let's delay it from here and try one more time just so that we can see if the email will be sent.

131
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,240
I said that has been deleted.

132
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,280
Let's try.

133
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,910
User created successfully.

134
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:06,870
That's good.

135
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,700
Let's take the email.

136
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:22,310
I guess if we got this email account created for some reason, if you don't see it here, make sure

137
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,480
to go to your.

138
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,670
Spam folder and ticket.

139
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:27,480
All right.

140
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,050
So we got that.

141
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,060
Looks safe.

142
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:34,910
Hi, Ryan.

143
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,090
The author does her name.

144
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:40,140
You see, this account has been successfully created.

145
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,300
Logon deduces even.

146
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,020
That's password.

147
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:44,390
Beautiful.

148
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:45,170
All right.

149
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:48,920
So with this information, the user can log into the application.

150
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,930
All right, let's give it a try.

151
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:59,800
So this user, the admin created manually, right?

152
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:03,790
So let's say this user got the email, he tried to log in.

153
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,590
He should be able to.

154
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,780
U.S.A. and he's author.

155
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,000
So we redirect him to author page.

156
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,680
But obviously that doesn't exist for D.A. This works beautifully.
