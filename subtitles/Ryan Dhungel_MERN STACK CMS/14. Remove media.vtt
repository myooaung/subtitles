1
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:00.780
Okay.

2
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.950
So let's add a delete functionality as well.

3
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.260
So we saw the icon and we can put that underneath this one too.

4
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.650
Let's use a line break and then we use that icon that we input earlier.

5
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.490
So close

6
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.870
circle outlined.

7
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.790
Stone and give a bit of a stand just to make the look a little bit better.

8
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.440
And we used to cut off red muslin, right?

9
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.130
Imagine, right?

10
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:40.300
Ten.

11
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.290
Gonna use this hex value if.

12
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.970
Five.

13
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.050
Doo doo, doo doo.

14
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.400
Lucy Martin, I.

15
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:05.600
Okay.

16
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.860
I can see if I did this on the last one.

17
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.780
All right.

18
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:13.210
Okay.

19
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.710
So that was oh this V that I put it outside.

20
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.000
I should put it inside.

21
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.130
Matt So let me cut and I have these images.

22
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.600
So underneath the images I put it here.

23
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.600
So that also means that I have to put everything inside a fragment.

24
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.040
So let me just wrap everything in the fragment like this.

25
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.640
I guess if we get the images, we get Lindberg and we get the icon.

26
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:53.550
Okay.

27
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.590
So it's them.

28
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.060
But we got a bit of an issue

29
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.260
to solve this.

30
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.120
We can use the Mars component from and design, so let's input that.

31
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.410
That is what I used in this fitness project as virtual and quickly gooner.

32
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.460
Because when we use bears, the nets, it works.

33
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.190
Let's try bears.

34
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.750
And we wrap the images and the eye and everything with the bad.

35
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.490
So actually, we can use this fragment.

36
00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.800
Let's use that.

37
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.060
Okay.

38
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.790
That looks bad.

39
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:51.750
So we could probably put I think we don't need this much as in virtually the same event.

40
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.920
Yeah, I think that's not needed.

41
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.840
It's right in the middle instant.

42
00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.280
Maybe we can have a beautiful magazine and talk instead of margin.

43
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:03.000
Right.

44
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.740
We should use margin models.

45
00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.530
Okay.

46
00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.150
So that looks a little bit too much.

47
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.680
Let's just press it.

48
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:29.350
That's better.

49
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.720
All right, so let's make it clickable.

50
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.290
So let's use the on click click.

51
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.590
We use a function so we can execute a function.

52
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.990
Let's call this function and the it means to lead.

53
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.780
And we give the images, actually, we just need to give them this idea.

54
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.310
That's what we need.

55
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.890
So that's the current address.

56
00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:21.200
Can I just have my hair stylist done on click?

57
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.580
So that's closing.

58
00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.520
Tony Briskin I guess that's book.

59
00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.310
So let's write this function.

60
00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.230
Handle it means delete.

61
00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.790
So that one we can put right here handling is delayed async.

62
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.960
So basically we're going to make a request to back in a delayed request.

63
00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.290
We have already created the endpoint.

64
00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.440
Okay.

65
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.240
So here we get the images aid.

66
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.000
All right.

67
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.230
So that will be the argument to include that in Ms..

68
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:15.340
ID and then here we use excuse against data equals to await excuse to delete.

69
00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.140
This time we're making a request.

70
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:24.250
The end point is let's use back sticks instead of courts.

71
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.870
Thank you so.

72
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.140
It's less media less.

73
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:30.600
He missed it.

74
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:41.100
So we're sending them inside as the right parameter so that we'll delete the image, I guess, if data.

75
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.760
Okay.

76
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.150
So if it is deleted, we get the downloaded.

77
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.450
Okay.

78
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.870
True.

79
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:46.200
Right.

80
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:53.970
So if it is true, then what do you want to do is you want to find this deleted image based on the data.

81
00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.610
You want to find this student images from the media collection in the context and remove that out.

82
00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.460
So for that, we can use the filter function.

83
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:04.170
Thank you.

84
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.500
So spread out the media properties, whatever is under there.

85
00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.640
Now we just want to update the images.

86
00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:17.880
So the media images we apply the filter function and filter function takes another function as an argument.

87
00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:29.990
So here we are filtering out the images ID any images that does not match this one, this image already

88
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.290
because this has been deleted.

89
00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.050
So with that filtering, whatever is left.

90
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:43.590
All that will be saved will be available in the state, excluding this one and the one that is deleted.

91
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:45.260
All right.

92
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:51.100
So that is all we need to media at this point.

93
00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:57.420
You want to, if it has been deleted, then selected also.

94
00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:58.560
You want to make it.

95
00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:59.100
No.

96
00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:01.730
Thank you.

97
00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.950
Because the null the empty object.

98
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:11.430
So for some reason, if the images were selected at that time and if it is due to do you want to send

99
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:12.240
it back to now?

100
00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.840
So let me quickly go to the media context.

101
00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:25.940
Context media selected instead of string.

102
00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:29.070
I'm going to give it a different value of none.

103
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:35.970
That's because when we get the images, when we put the images in the selected field, all our images

104
00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:37.740
are coming from the database.

105
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.230
They all have this object structure.

106
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:42.060
They have the I.D., they have the posted by.

107
00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:42.990
They have the URL.

108
00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:45.750
So use no instead of string.

109
00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:48.680
All right.

110
00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.120
So that should work.

111
00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:56.630
They handle images due to artists at work so we can try.

112
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:05.940
I guess we've got all these images, for example, this if I want to do this one and you can see that

113
00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:06.360
is gone.

114
00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:07.570
Just to make sure.

115
00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:08.340
Let's reload.

116
00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:19.590
And as you can see, that image is gone.

117
00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:20.520
Beautiful.

118
00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.050
Now let's try uploading.

119
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:34.460
Maybe I've got two more images just to make sure that they appear here.

120
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:35.270
Okay.

121
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:36.950
So they are overlapping here.

122
00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.390
So that's issue.

123
00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:42.640
Okay.

124
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:50.100
So under the images uploaded it is automatically the model is closed and the uploaded.

125
00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:53.230
The last one has been sent as a featured image.

126
00:08:54.610 --> 00:09:02.430
This behavior, it happens only when we are using it in our new post component.

127
00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:09.070
But when if you go to the media library and access this, then it will not behave like it will not automatically

128
00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:10.000
close the model.

129
00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.640
So we haven't worked on this one yet.

130
00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:13.720
We will come back to this one.

131
00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:18.640
But for creating a post, I think that that makes sense.

132
00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.940
But if you don't want to automatically close the model, that is hard to find.

133
00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:24.580
You can just remove that.

134
00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:26.770
So when the.

135
00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:32.180
The media has applauded the agency.

136
00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:33.180
So it said.

137
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:37.400
So medium model we set it to false.

138
00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:43.430
So you can remove this one if you want to keep showing the model in many of the clips.

139
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:46.430
But either way, it works.

140
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:53.060
And we have the images you can to the two images here.
