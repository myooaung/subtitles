1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,230
So previously I requested from a password.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,670
Let's do it one more time.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,310
So that user was.

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,640
So let's go through one more time, see if you followed the password.

5
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:18,170
We want to log in.

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,410
You come here to San Base, click on this link.

7
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:23,150
Forgot password.

8
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:23,990
Enter your email.

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:25,790
Ma'am.

10
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,400
Him as this to.

11
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,040
Take your email password.

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:35,810
Wisconsin.

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:43,620
Now, when it was happening, it took maybe a minute, 1/2, something like that.

14
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,650
So that time you could show the loading indicator.

15
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,930
So it is a bit more interactive, right?

16
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,210
So let's quickly do that as well.

17
00:00:53,700 --> 00:01:01,050
So we have the button button and we have the loading property as fluid changes dynamically here.

18
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,090
So we're going to use that value.

19
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:08,070
And thankfully with end is end and isn't button component has the loading.

20
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,020
Also.

21
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:14,230
So if she passed Hillary based on true and false, it will show the spinner.

22
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:16,260
All right.

23
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:25,920
So let me do a quick refresh and try one more time just so that we can see the loading Mancini is doing

24
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:26,050
and.

25
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:32,260
Now you can see that slurring we saw and then we got the success.

26
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,340
Mrs. Enter the reset code.

27
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,740
So user will go to his email.

28
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,160
All right, so we got this few emails.

29
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,630
Let's use the latest one.

30
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,620
This is the cordless.

31
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,250
Copy that.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,680
And come here.

33
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,470
Paste that code, and then the new password.

34
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,930
Now let's try and use new password.

35
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,600
Let's call it password.

36
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,030
Okay.

37
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,230
It's for a summit.

38
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,590
Password change successfully.

39
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,050
Please log in with a new password and we reset the filter as well.

40
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:12,650
Beautiful.

41
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:16,990
All right, so let's go try logging with the new password, Szymanski admits.

42
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:27,860
I didn't try the previous password, which was just this character that.

43
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:30,780
Okay.

44
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,140
Well.

45
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,510
We got the error message.

46
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,320
Wrong password.

47
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,510
But wish to redirect the user.

48
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,730
So there's a bit of a fix to doing the signing, I guess.

49
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:48,020
But.

50
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,200
We saw that for the password to reset, password works.

51
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,600
Let's quickly fix this one as well.

52
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,430
Let's have a look.

53
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,430
Let's go fix this issue in signing.

54
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,850
So we have to try.

55
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:08,610
Okay.

56
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,010
So we didn't take for the data error.

57
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,150
That's the issue here.

58
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:15,210
So let me quickly go to our backing off.

59
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,270
Let me take the sign in.

60
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:19,530
Sign it.

61
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,770
So there are error messages we are sending.

62
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:23,850
All right.

63
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:30,600
So we should check for the error messages and then we should display their message.

64
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:34,260
All right.

65
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,810
So we made a request.

66
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,600
We give the data now we take for the data error.

67
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,910
All right, so let me just got all this cold and ticked.

68
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:55,550
If data does not want you to do something, so some portion notification and whatever, otherwise,

69
00:03:55,550 --> 00:04:00,600
otherwise else, we based that code back into it.

70
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,860
I guess you've done an error do stuff.

71
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:05,600
Yeah.

72
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:13,550
And here we can sort out the dirt and sort of the error message we got.

73
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,650
Six loading two.

74
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:17,310
False.

75
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,120
Beautiful.

76
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:22,530
Beautiful.

77
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,580
Let's give it a try.

78
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:32,000
So all we did is move that court in the L block and we take for the air using the if statement.

79
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:32,540
All right.

80
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:37,320
Let me also go to sign up and let's make sure we have that.

81
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:44,840
Okay so on sign of we did but I think we missed understanding anyways we have this one now let's executed.

82
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:51,470
So sign in, Ms..

83
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,700
And try using the new boss all password log.

84
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,110
Now, this time it doesn't work, obviously.

85
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,830
Now let me try using the new password.

86
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,870
I just reset the new password.

87
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,210
Right.

88
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,220
So let's try this one.

89
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,800
And beautifully it works.

90
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,200
How cool is that?

91
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,520
I asked this.

92
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:18,670
How you learn to implement a password into an application as well.

93
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:21,760
Something that is very important in a real world application.

94
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:27,250
Now we did we pretty much done with authentication.

95
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:33,490
It's a full authentication with sign up signing for password, reset password, sending emails, everything

96
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:33,940
is done.

97
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:45,790
Let's now focus on creating the admin restricted basis so that we can all of the admins to do more serious

98
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:49,420
stuff like creating categories, post things like that.
