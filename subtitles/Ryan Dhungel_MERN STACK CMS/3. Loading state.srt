1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:06,180
So what are we going to do is we're going to use a state called Lori.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,770
So use state.

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,490
I guess we create a learning state.

4
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:26,200
Loading said loading the used state by default will leave the value of false.

5
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:27,970
All right.

6
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:34,630
Actually, this time what we're going to do is we're going to have the default value of so by default.

7
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:42,970
But the learning will be true and we will not show any of this content if the learning is true.

8
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,200
You because you saw this from pure milliseconds, because when the component mounts, only then this

9
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,010
function runs.

10
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,280
So as a result, you get that quick glimpse.

11
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,720
So we don't want that.

12
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:00,040
So by default, we show some kind of a loading.

13
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,630
You could show empty space as well if you want.

14
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,510
But I think it's good to show some kind of a loading spinner or something like that.

15
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,420
And then we.

16
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:20,180
Do the stick and if the user is not admin, we redirect them to some other place.

17
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:23,240
Otherwise we send the learning to France.

18
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,220
I guess so when the loading is false.

19
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:28,040
We will sort this one when the loading is true.

20
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,840
By default it is true.

21
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:35,060
So when it's true, we just for the loading spinner, we don't show any content, but when it becomes

22
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,160
false, we saw this content.

23
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,680
So here we can do that as.

24
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,870
If it is not admin we redirect.

25
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:49,180
If it is admin then we sit loading to false.

26
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:57,730
I can now we can do some conditional rendering here and we can have the return before this return as

27
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,180
well, using some kind of a function.

28
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,950
For example, here we can take if loading.

29
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:12,680
I guess if the lowering event lowering value in the state, if that is true, we can show some kind

30
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,350
of we can return anything.

31
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:20,960
Maybe let's a hedge one, we can show a nice loading spinner.

32
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,360
But for now, let's just keep it at four.

33
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:24,250
All right.

34
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,960
So by default, it is always true.

35
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:32,860
So we don't show any content like before for quick milliseconds.

36
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:37,630
At that time we also loading you would show empty, empty bays as well.

37
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,910
So you just return empty.

38
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:40,930
You can do that.

39
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,440
But we showing returning the loading text.

40
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,570
But as soon as the set learning becomes false, we are showing the content.

41
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,970
So let's keep them track of issues.

42
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:52,690
Is not admin.

43
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,400
He tries to go to admin.

44
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:03,370
You can see we saw that loading and then immediately we are back.

45
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:12,450
So that meant we didn't show any content from the admin which which includes the the sidebar a bit.

46
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:19,630
So anything we are not showing, we just showing the load, we could just leave it empty as well.

47
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:30,100
I guess if you try by the way, let me use the white more be a bit easier.

48
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:31,480
And.

49
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:37,830
It's really fast.

50
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:38,790
It's hard to see.

51
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:44,280
Oh, actually, we're not slowing the loading, so we just saw the empty space and then we redo it.

52
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:53,370
So that way we avoid that issue of the swing, the content for a brief second, maybe slowly.

53
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,770
Loading and then home beauty.

54
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,180
So far so good.

55
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:10,000
Now, like I said earlier, this is not the most secure way of taking the value from the context or

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,840
the local stories.

57
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,160
So we're going to have another solution by making request to back in.

58
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:21,340
So we need to create the endpoint in the back end where we can to make a request to make to get the

59
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,450
currently logged and use it.

60
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:31,060
And if the currently logged in user is admin, then based on that response, we will do all this.

61
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:36,850
So if it is admin, then we set the learning defaults, we saw the content, otherwise we take them

62
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:37,810
to some other bits.

63
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:43,930
Okay, now before I finish this video, I want to show a loading indicator instead of this text.

64
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:48,460
And I can do that using the end design component.

65
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,520
So import loading.

66
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,560
Let me actually.

67
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:04,300
Have a look at the and ducks to make sure I'm using the right icon.

68
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:10,150
By the way when you here you phone just quickly source the site command key.

69
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,630
Then this up so I can.

70
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,100
Click here.

71
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,500
Also you can see we have the load loading spinner.

72
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,880
Maybe we can use this one floating out land.

73
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:36,590
All right, let's.

74
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,620
Loading our land till we can return then instead of floating.

75
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,670
Floating out land.

76
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:57,310
And if you want to make it bigger, better, maybe center in the base, you can do all that.

77
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:03,040
Let's use a CSO stone.

78
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:16,660
Let's say display, flex, justify content center, a line items

79
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,610
center.

80
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,370
And then we give this a height, height.

81
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:34,030
We give 100 feet vertical height.

82
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,250
And just so that we can see the loading.

83
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:50,200
We can said this two points just so that we can see that and go here and try to go to admin.

84
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,040
Oh.

85
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,480
Guess we've been redirected.

86
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,950
Um, let's come and escort out.

87
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,710
We just want to show if luring is true.

88
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,890
We want to show this one.

89
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,620
I guess we should.

90
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,350
Something.

91
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,060
We did something here instead of post.

92
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,840
Let's keep it true and keep it true.

93
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,510
Nothing's changed.

94
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:26,880
Only thing you have to do is comment this out just while we are taking this loading icon.

95
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,530
All right, so we give some CSIS.

96
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,950
And we commented this out so we don't get redirected so that we can see how this looks.

97
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:38,150
It's coming in.

98
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:44,380
Okay.

99
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,750
So you can see that loading.

100
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,410
Beautiful.

101
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:48,730
Now only problem.

102
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:52,690
It is a little bit small, but otherwise you can see it's a nice the center.

103
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,430
Horizontally and vertically.

104
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,780
It's quite nice.

105
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:01,840
Let's see if we can make that bigger font size.

106
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,320
Let's, um.

107
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,310
Let's say 50 bits.

108
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,080
Let's try.

109
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,000
Okay.

110
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:09,660
That's.

111
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,700
That's not bad.

112
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:12,950
Nice.

113
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,320
You can give it a different color if you want.

114
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:30,100
Maybe and maybe read this better because it's loading.

115
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,150
Awesome.

116
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:32,200
All right.

117
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:38,670
So let's turn this back to let's bring back the use effect.

118
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,570
All right, beautiful.
