00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:00.810
All right.

2
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.180
So we have the categories as well in the States.

3
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:09.390
When we send this to a back in to say in the database, we can send the target, we can send the content

4
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.330
and we can send the categories up.

5
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.710
Now, the next thing we want is, as you can see in the field, the finished product.

6
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.300
We are going to allow the post to have featured images.

7
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.630
So we, we, we would implement this one.

8
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:32.640
And we also need to make sure that you can embed images in this rich text editor as well and like this

9
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:32.820
one.

10
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.850
So we have to work on this one.

11
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.640
So let's work on this one and then we're going to move on this one.

12
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:45.660
And finally, we will be ready to publish and I will show you how you can use that previously, even

13
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.990
though it's not really important because this restricts editor present pretty much everything you can

14
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.830
see here in front of your eyes.

15
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.470
So we don't really need much, but we can, we can work on that.

16
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.530
I guess so.

17
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.320
Let's see why how to fix this image.

18
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:14.010
Because as you can see here in our project at the moment, we don't have the image of our you said the

19
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.620
reason for that is for uploading the images you need to have here in the editor.

20
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:25.030
You need to have a name called upload image.

21
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.560
Right.

22
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:26.460
And then.

23
00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.630
You'll be able to use a function, for example, to use a function.

24
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.600
When you do that, you get the file, all right?

25
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.900
And you can control the file.

26
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.890
So basically what you want to do is when you get the file, you want to send this file to the back end

27
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:55.570
so that we can save it, you know, back in or maybe use some cloud storage system like cloud injury

28
00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.100
or abuse is 3 hours.

29
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.940
So we're going to use cloud in here, which is nice and easy to use.

30
00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.830
So we're going to open up to cloud an area and now in return we will get the uploaded image here so

31
00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.730
that your will receive here.

32
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:14.140
Okay.

33
00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:22.030
And then when we save the post, we are going to save everything on with the the you are so each post

34
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.390
if the post has image here that here it will be here in the post right here.

35
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.970
Now you can see we have this image option because I added this function.

36
00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.410
All right.

37
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.490
So let's try that.

38
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.110
Let's have a look at the console.

39
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.740
Let me try some in this.

40
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.580
Let me try this one.

41
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:54.020
All right.

42
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.500
So here.

43
00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:57.390
What we have here.

44
00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.980
You see, we got the file.

45
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.940
That is the one we come to locate.

46
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.110
That's the name.

47
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:06.010
All right.

48
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.410
So, as you can see, it works.

49
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:15.760
So what we need to do now is we have to, in sort of console.log, we have to use a function that will

50
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:16.960
handle the upload.

51
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:17.530
All right.

52
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.670
So let me just

53
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.130
let's come back to this 1/1.

54
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:33.010
Let's go to the back end and create the round in control function so that we can implement the image

55
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.430
upload.

56
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.100
Then we're going to send from here.

57
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.330
All right.

58
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.830
So when are you going to send it?

59
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.950
We're going to resize the images in the client ad, which is much faster, and sending the big file

60
00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:47.670
to the server.

61
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:54.510
And so with resize, make it smaller in size, you know, doing in of doing all that we can resize in

62
00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:01.500
the ground side which will very fast and then we send the resized images as binary data to the backend

63
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:09.210
and back we'll upload to cloud binary and then we get the uploaded year that that's the year we'll be

64
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.750
saving here when we're creating a post.
