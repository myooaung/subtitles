1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:01,750
All right, so let's.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:04,110
So the featured image preview here.

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:10,260
So if the image has been uploaded and there is a selected one, it will always be there when the image

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,310
has been uploaded.

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:11,880
All right.

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,110
So using this model.

7
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,330
So at that time, we want to show the preview.

8
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:21,780
So let's do that and close this so that in the ad menu.

9
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:31,620
So right here, we can show that maybe underneath the categories just before the publish button.

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,630
So all the way down.

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,710
All the way down here.

12
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:39,780
So we're going to publish button.

13
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:41,820
Let's put it on top.

14
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:49,230
So here we can use the the images component from and so landfill 153.

15
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,370
Let me just want to.

16
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,090
So we don't have them.

17
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,270
It's important.

18
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,180
Must go to 953.

19
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,180
Let's come back.

20
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:15,780
I think it's a yeah, we can think we have the access to media contacts so we can take media and if

21
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,000
we have selected property in the media, so by default it would be empty.

22
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:27,630
But if the user have uploaded, then they will be selected.

23
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,520
So if we have this image, that means we want to show that as a preview, right?

24
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,830
So yeah, if we have that.

25
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:47,760
What do you want to do is you want to use the image component said the with 200 person so it takes the

26
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:55,290
available within the sidebar and source for the screen to be media

27
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,420
selected or to you are right.

28
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,760
I guess from the response you get from the database that will contain the URL.

29
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,140
So we want to use that.

30
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,390
So that's all we need.

31
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,080
Let's have a look.

32
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,710
Beautiful to now you can see here we have the preview images as well.

33
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:17,910
Awesome.

34
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:22,080
And let's add beautiful margin and talk.

35
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,850
The Taliban break.

36
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,360
I considered this trial.

37
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,630
Okay.

38
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,180
So one doesn't want to do.

39
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:45,730
That's it looks a little bit more jeopardy if you don't like that.

40
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,690
What he can do is just create a div.

41
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:56,790
And let's let me just put it inside fragments.

42
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,670
And it that's.

43
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,010
I can use a dip into a fragment.

44
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,190
Let's it and.

45
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:12,910
Here's some.

46
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,300
Murdoch.

47
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,100
My top 15.

48
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:29,380
Thank you.

49
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,020
Beautiful.

50
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:32,480
Okay.

51
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,360
So we have been able to show the selected one as well.

52
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:38,360
Now let's close the model.

53
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:38,840
All right.

54
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,740
So when we have the images, we have uploaded the images with it's singular multiple.

55
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,420
We want to automatically close this model.

56
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,010
All right.

57
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,610
And then let's also remove this one.

58
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:54,470
So it's foundation string.

59
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,760
If I were to have that.

60
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,200
That is.

61
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:01,290
Oh.

62
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,640
Key that says.

63
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,280
Find the return.

64
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,580
I guess that's assuming that.

65
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:22,500
So when the open road is done, we want to close the model.

66
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:32,110
So that means we have to treat the the value instead of using our own from the state which we created

67
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,990
earlier only visible media.

68
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,360
Let's don't use that.

69
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,250
Instead, we can use what we have in the media context.

70
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,160
We have media.

71
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,880
We have.

72
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,940
Context.

73
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:57,130
We have this social media model by different folks, so let's use that.

74
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:06,150
So instead of that, we go down all the way to that model.

75
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:20,190
We have the model for featured images on click set visible media truly things that do.

76
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,100
Said Media.

77
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,130
Media, straight out the media.

78
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:39,860
So whatever we have or have images selected, whatever it is, they leave it like that.

79
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,670
We just spread out.

80
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,480
We just want to toggle the property.

81
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:52,760
So media model, we make that to click to I guess on click to be true.

82
00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:01,240
And when the upload is done here in the upward file, you can see it becomes false.

83
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,750
All right, let's try.

84
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:08,650
Yes, of course.

85
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:13,950
Wherever or wherever we're using the previous value, we have to change that as well.

86
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,640
So to model.

87
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:27,600
That one will be no media tart.

88
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,950
So the media model.

89
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,030
All right, let's try.

90
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:47,990
Beautiful.

91
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,350
You can see it has been uploaded.

92
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,830
It has been said as featured images and that is closed.

93
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:53,870
Amazing.

94
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,660
Let's try and monitor the long route.

95
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:08,950
Now do the multiple of or maybe you don't want to close because.

96
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,460
Normally you wouldn't do one day, but I'm not from here.

97
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,470
You would just do one.

98
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:17,050
But for whatever reason, if you do, that's fine.

99
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,180
It'll stay in the library anyways.

100
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:28,240
So when you do multiple, then what we can do is we can actually show the, the, the actual images

101
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:35,530
from the library including this recently uploaded once and then we can ask the user to click on those

102
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:35,860
images.

103
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,470
So when they click on the images, that will be the selected one.

104
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,810
So we can, we can of them there.

105
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:41,320
That's fine.

106
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:42,520
But so far so good.

107
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,690
It's been working fine and on click.

108
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,040
Yeah.

109
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,900
And closer to that it's in this it's fixed.

110
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:57,280
That said visual model now into that that would be we have to change that.

111
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:03,610
Said Media.

112
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,090
Media.

113
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,550
So sorry.

114
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,880
Send me some model fonts.

115
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,380
I guess you just copy that.

116
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,370
Put it down here, doc.

117
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:24,990
Beautiful.
