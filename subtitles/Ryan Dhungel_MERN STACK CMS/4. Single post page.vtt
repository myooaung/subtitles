00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:00.550
Yes.

2
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:07.200
And now we're going to make these cars clickable so that we can show the posts on the single page.

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:15.690
So let's come here and let's make them clickable so we can use the link component from end, isn't it?

4
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.590
Sorry not ended in Nexis.

5
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.350
Mixed link.

6
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.030
And then we can wrap our card in that link.

7
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.830
So this car.

8
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.780
So you just got to use the link.

9
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.820
Internally, we need to have a context with its use then.

10
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.380
And here it's best that God no link heads through.

11
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.040
We can use this object back to so we can take them to SLAs.

12
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.590
Post based SLAs.

13
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.350
Slop, I guess is post will have a unique slogan.

14
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.470
Now based on that we saw the business dynamic right.

15
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.220
So post and then we use post.

16
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.170
Don't smoke.

17
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.720
Beautiful.

18
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.130
Now, let's come here now anyhow.

19
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.970
You can see right down here, you can see the poor slum.

20
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.090
This second post that's more than home interior.

21
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:39.340
Last post merging into that effect feature that will take us to that base, which we don't have at the

22
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:47.550
moment, but we can go ahead and create one and I think we should just call it just post without S.

23
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.980
So let's quickly fix them as you post.

24
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.430
All right.

25
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.480
So let's create that folder.

26
00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.890
And inside there, we're going to create this space that will dynamically get the slug to whatever that

27
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:02.100
is.

28
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.610
And based on that slug, we're going to make a request to back in to get that particular post.

29
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.170
And this basis let's create new for called post intent.

30
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.350
Here.

31
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.260
We're going to create that file called Slug.

32
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.570
Now we create this space differently.

33
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:27.720
Again, to do our sort of do a raise here, an integer, you give the name so you can give it an animal,

34
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.700
you can call it ID, you can call it slug.

35
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:30.510
Doesn't matter.

36
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.150
But what do we call it?

37
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.480
Based on that, you'll be able to access the.

38
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.450
The slope, the parameter from the root.

39
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.010
Okay.

40
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.070
So you can see the brackets and then don't this.

41
00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.580
So you have to create your base to capture that dynamic value.

42
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.340
Okay.

43
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.180
So with that, let's write our component.

44
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.390
So const.

45
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.990
Let's go call single posts.

46
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.010
It to.

47
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.880
Return again.

48
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.550
We used to use the rows in column like we did here in the post.

49
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.310
So let me actually grab this fragment, the entire fragment.

50
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.620
In fact, let's copy the whole code.

51
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.420
It's going to be quite similar.

52
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.410
Let's go beyond that.

53
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.090
Go to Slug.

54
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.800
And it's just best that I guess we student we're going to use gifs.

55
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.770
So said Brooks, obviously, because we want that piece to be suicide rendered for issue.

56
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:52.960
So let's send this from the top to the name, from post to single post.

57
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.300
Single post.

58
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.020
So we will have this function that will make a request to get that single post.

59
00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.660
Now we have to create that endpoint.

60
00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.820
We don't have that yet, so let's wait for that.

61
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:27.780
Didn't head the this post this individual post title we can sort that here damningly similar the description.

62
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.010
Let's wait for that as well.

63
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.720
Let's just continue using the rules in column.

64
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.190
And everything else.

65
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.230
So the column, it's a demo of the mapping of this one.

66
00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.540
So total rows, we can put the column.

67
00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.750
We're going to have to column one with the

68
00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.610
sides extra small excess more.

69
00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:09.950
We take the full width extra, plus we take 16.

70
00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:17.120
And then the remaining other part, we give that to the sidebar.

71
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.470
So it.

72
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.280
This one will be used for sidebar.

73
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.920
This one from post.

74
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.560
Okay.

75
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.300
Let's go back.

76
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.990
Come here.

77
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.660
I guess we'll see the post here.

78
00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:38.830
We should decide by.

79
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:40.570
So far, so good.

80
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.280
Let's go and create the endpoint that will give us the single post.

81
00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.000
So what we need to do here is from this base.

82
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:57.510
So if we were using huge effect, we could grab this value from the parent forums and make a request

83
00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:58.410
using Axis.

84
00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.930
Based on that program, the slow motion that we could get the single push.

85
00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:11.280
Right now we're using Southside Cross, but even here we have access to the params so we can destruction

86
00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.270
programs.

87
00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:20.320
And then from programs we can access the slot because we call our file slug, we will access slug.

88
00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:25.560
But if you call it something else like 80, then you call it like 80% of it.

89
00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.620
In our case, it's going to be pronounced as slow.

90
00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:30.180
So less.

91
00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:33.630
It's less, post less.

92
00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.760
Parents don't smoke.

93
00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:40.950
I guess this is the input.

94
00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:41.730
We have to quit.

95
00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:46.050
Less posts, less the smoke.

96
00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:53.520
I guess that's the endpoint we have to create and that will give us the data which should contain the

97
00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:55.170
post single post.

98
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:58.880
Let's make it a singular post.

99
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.390
It's all to make sure we are returning a singular purpose.

100
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:03.750
Perfect.

101
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:05.960
And let me just.

102
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.890
Jason Stringer.

103
00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:07.190
Fine.

104
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:07.370
You.

105
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:16.120
Post.

106
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.140
No.

107
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:18.190
Four.

108
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.820
And so we don't have anything at the moment.

109
00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:29.770
Let's go create this endpoint and then we can continue working here.

110
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:39.070
So it's good to rotate and to send a single post we can consider out of the gate.

111
00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:43.480
So that's going to be less post stress.

112
00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:52.810
Let's call it slug and then that will be single post.

113
00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.450
Let's cover here.

114
00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.090
Let's import that from our controller

115
00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.580
and let's go to controllers post.

116
00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:05.020
Let's read that here.

117
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:14.040
Single post equals to async requests.

118
00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:15.560
Response

119
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:20.690
we try.

120
00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:27.880
Yes, an error comes along.

121
00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:28.660
And

122
00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:33.700
so here we use.

123
00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.290
We created the Davis flight.

124
00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:37.780
So.

125
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:45.560
Here we get access to the Prince concert.

126
00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:51.240
So he wants to request.

127
00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:56.940
Perhaps I should call it something else instead of slow.

128
00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.850
If you call it I.D., then you could access that as I.D..

129
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:01.770
All right.

130
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.770
So we get we grab the slot.

131
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.310
Now, based on this global, we can query the database and find it.

132
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:09.270
Thank you.

133
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:14.840
So const post equals to it.

134
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:21.510
Here to post model dot find one we aim to use find one.

135
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.960
This time of going to find best in the slot.

136
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:25.130
So slow.

137
00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.630
You didn't have to do slow.

138
00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.150
It's still like that in the same key.

139
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.380
Very slow.

140
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:35.790
And then you want to populate the user who created it.

141
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.690
So posted by name, maybe idea.

142
00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.840
I think when you do populist, it's always in fear of living like that.

143
00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:50.840
Okay.

144
00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:57.260
And let's actually use I'm not really sure, but we can give it a try.

145
00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:01.260
A little excuse to try again.

146
00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:03.040
We can always come back in ten.

147
00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:09.790
So we populate the posted by the creators name.

148
00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.550
Next one we want to populate the categories as it should be.

149
00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:17.920
Its books have a lot of categories may have a lot of categories.

150
00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:22.360
So we populate the categories and we want the name and slug.

151
00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:28.390
Next one we can also probably defeated him is obviously that's important.

152
00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:31.510
Properly

153
00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.020
featured in.

154
00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:42.670
For the Fiji women.

155
00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:50.230
I just need to hear a sliver here and then that's pretty much all we need.

156
00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:51.760
Response this post.

157
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:54.720
All right, so that should give us the signal post.

158
00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:58.200
Let's quickly go here.

159
00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:01.600
Good posters.

160
00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.300
Q And how good was that?

161
00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:12.040
You can see here we got the post single force and yeah, so we don't have to populate it.

162
00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.900
It always includes automatically.

163
00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:15.880
So that's good.

164
00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:17.230
Main named strong.

165
00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:17.770
And you are.

166
00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:20.110
Beautiful.

167
00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:21.850
All right.

168
00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:23.650
So we've got all this information now.

169
00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:30.070
We can show this information nicely here on a base that will look something like this.
