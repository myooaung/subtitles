1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,540
All right.

2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:05,640
Now we need to create in the file and add this environment variables.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,880
So let's do it here.

4
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:14,460
Now let's see here.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,920
Let's start with server.

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,940
City server.

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,190
And we need to create the Wi-Fi so sudo

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,670
don't dirty and V inside the subfolder.

9
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,230
I guess now we have the Ian Buffet.

10
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:37,020
You don't see the the hidden file with L.

11
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,800
So if you want to see in France you can do l l.

12
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,530
As you can see, we have the.

13
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,100
Dirty envy.

14
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:49,750
All right, so let's open that and edit using him.

15
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,510
So sudo vim dart envy.

16
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,900
I'm sorry, suni sudo.

17
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,640
Okay, so let's hit.

18
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:06,440
Right.

19
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,140
To insert the code.

20
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,680
So now we can go to our project.

21
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,040
Project where we start here.

22
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,870
And let's go to the server and let's go to the end file.

23
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,870
So this is the environment variable we have locally.

24
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,490
We've been using locally.

25
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:35,580
Now let's copy paste in this different file here and let's see what else we need to change here.

26
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,720
So we can leave that database.

27
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,610
So we need to install MongoDB.

28
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,720
Let's forget that.

29
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,760
Let's do that very soon.

30
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,260
Did a pretty secret we can continue using same or maybe just try different.

31
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,100
Doesn't really matter.

32
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,200
The Adobe's keys in secret.

33
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,400
They will stay the same.

34
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,530
Email from that will stay the same strip.

35
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,870
Now in the production, if you want to start taking real money or real credit card payments, then you

36
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:08,100
will go to the strip desperate and get the live APIs right.

37
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,380
So at the moment we're using the test API.

38
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,060
So I will continue using this one.

39
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,910
But when you are ready, when you deploy, you give, give, give it a try, make sure everything is

40
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,300
working.

41
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:26,970
And once you start receiving real money, then you can obviously get the live keys from Stripe and replace

42
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,770
this one with the lived keys.

43
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,740
But for now, we can just leave it as it is.

44
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,400
So redirect here.

45
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,160
That will not be localhost 3000.

46
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,820
That will be our API.

47
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,620
So until we add the domain, which is really easy to add to domain.

48
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:50,140
In this lesson you can easily shows how to add domain, how to add domain.

49
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,270
In this lesson, I suggest that you created a property.

50
00:02:55,270 --> 00:03:04,620
You can add a domain and follow a couple of steps and it's really easy, so you can easily do that later

51
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:04,850
on.

52
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:07,560
But for now, let's not worry about adding a domain.

53
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,470
Let's just make sure we can up and run.

54
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,180
We get up and running with the IP address.

55
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:15,540
All right.

56
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:22,830
So here instead of Legolas, it will be your IP address, slash the URL name.

57
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:27,200
But later when you have the domain name, it will be the domain name.

58
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:30,390
Slash the these zeros.

59
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:30,780
All right.

60
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,600
So let's change that to a domain name.

61
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:43,140
So not the domain name, the IP address, it's copying that and just replace that localhost 3000 with

62
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,450
the IP address.

63
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:54,850
All right.

64
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:56,730
And that is all we need to do.

65
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,680
Now this file we can use in the production.

66
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,600
Ian Lee, I guess just copy the code here.

67
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:04,950
Based everything.

68
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:07,670
Okay.

69
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:14,510
And then we can just use hit a skip colon w to hit enter.

70
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:15,350
All right.

71
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:19,570
That's our server in front.

72
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,580
Now, we can do the same with the client as well.

73
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,760
But before we do that, why don't we install MongoDB as well?

74
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:30,810
That way server side is done and then we can just focus on the client side.

75
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:31,430
Right.

76
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:36,590
Now let's go to let's follow here.

77
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,600
Let's follow this.

78
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:43,820
So we can copy that to install MongoDB scoping that.

79
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:45,530
Come here.

80
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,770
Let's go to the root and let's run that.

81
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,160
Then sudo apt update.

82
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:08,040
Sudo apt install das y mongodb.

83
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,180
You should see the active running stats when you run this.

84
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,690
So let's grab that called.

85
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:23,530
Once it's done, we can give that a try and we should see the active running status.

86
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:25,870
Let's try that.

87
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,970
You can see MongoDB.

88
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,100
It's active up and running.

89
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:30,730
Perfect.

90
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:34,390
Now you can also try to run to Mongo comments.

91
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,980
For example, let's try Mongo.

92
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:37,480
Again.

93
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,810
Now we are in the mongo self.

94
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,510
It's the SO DBS.

95
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,330
So by default you get this database.

96
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:47,840
But we didn't have any other database, so we can create one.

97
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,890
So let's create use EDV here.

98
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,150
I have used not API.

99
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,700
Now this one we're going to use this name.

100
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,990
Use Udemy like it is to Udemy.

101
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,820
There isn't this one.

102
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:08,960
Make sure you have the same name that you have in the the EMV file.

103
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,290
That's the database name to make sure you have the same name here.

104
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:13,850
Okay.

105
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,740
So once that is done, updated the EMV, which we already have.

106
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,960
Will it have that?

107
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:27,200
You can use 127.2.1 or you can just use legalese.

108
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:28,490
Either way, it works.

109
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:29,980
Okay.

110
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:41,480
Now we pretty much done we have into MongoDB it's controlled X and it.

111
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,560
I did get inside.

112
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:50,800
Before we actually get inside, we're going to run our boats back in the front end.

113
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:58,060
Using PMD to use a beam to is built for production use unlike not one, not one.

114
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:02,290
As soon as you close the tunnel, it will stop.

115
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:02,570
Right.

116
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:02,980
So.

117
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:13,760
You want to use NPR PM too so you can insert that globally in beam i this DPM to.

118
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,680
So Beam two will make sure your server is always running.

119
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:22,480
Okay.

120
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:29,560
So we have to use sudo sudo npm ie death and z beam to.

121
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:42,960
Okay.

122
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:47,880
So once you have the PIN two installed, we can start running our server.

123
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,880
So let's get inside.

124
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:54,960
So before we run, we need to make sure we run NPM installed because we don't have the node modules

125
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:55,390
folder.

126
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:55,770
All right.

127
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,640
So NPM install and you have to use sudo.

128
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:11,860
Okay.

129
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:15,730
And women still had been successful if you missed out.

130
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,980
Now you see not modules as previously we had get ignored, not modules.

131
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,000
So it wasn't there.

132
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,250
But now we are running in women.

133
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:30,100
Some say it is based on whatever peg is was here in the bag in today's market.

134
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:36,130
So let's try running the server PM to start NPM.

135
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:42,820
Oh, actually our server that is server or that's the end to point.

136
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,060
Right.

137
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,280
So you can use PM two to start this.

138
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:47,800
Perfect.

139
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:48,760
No.

140
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,420
If you go.

141
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,410
And try your IP address, which is here.

142
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:06,720
Now this is what you see because we haven't running we haven't been running the.

143
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,180
But if you go to less API.

144
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:13,760
Okay.

145
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,690
So we got five or two bad get away now.

146
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,320
When you have things like that, things are not going the way you want it to.

147
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:29,270
You can always try running NPM start just like you do that locally.

148
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:33,230
That way if there is an error, you can see in the server console.

149
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:33,650
Right.

150
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,300
So let me run this.

151
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,970
Actually, let me stop this beam to kill.

152
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,190
Kill all the Iranians process and then npm start.

153
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,060
Let's do this.

154
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,670
This is just for debugging purposes, right?

155
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,110
Obviously you want to use PM too, but now things are not working.

156
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:52,410
Right.

157
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,030
So let's see what's wrong.

158
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:55,560
Let's try.

159
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,140
Cannot get API.

160
00:09:59,160 --> 00:09:59,460
Okay.

161
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:03,450
So then whenever you see anything like this, that means APIs are running.

162
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,290
Now, I'm not sure why it wasn't running previously.

163
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:13,080
You can see it is running it's try courses.

164
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,930
I guess we have an entry.

165
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,940
So seems like it is working.

166
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,460
We might have some other issues.

167
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,090
Think I know what is the issue.

168
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,480
The issue is.

169
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,370
Let me stop that.

170
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:32,090
The issue is you can see in server sorry, in package.

171
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:40,780
Jason, we have been using the import export index which is not supported by Node.js just by default.

172
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:47,050
That's why we use this beggars to help us write import export.

173
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:47,290
Right.

174
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,300
So this is how we started our server.

175
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:52,750
So that means you have to do the same thing in the production as well.

176
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,900
Maybe you could write a different command.

177
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,160
You could do that as well.

178
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:07,930
You can just use this does our yes and so so let's try that PM to start.

179
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,970
Well, actually, it's not being Brewster.

180
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,870
From the m to start desk.

181
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:21,190
Our ears and shoulders decided this.

182
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,100
This is the right way.

183
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:28,730
Okay.

184
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:34,010
Let's make a small change in our project here so that it's much easier.

185
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,450
So you can see here, we can leave it as it is this way you can always run Pim to start subjects.

186
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,170
It's okay.

187
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,880
So what do you want to do?

188
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:52,400
Is in the server this instead of writing everything, let's move all this code in a separate file and

189
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:59,600
then here we just going to import ESM and then we're going to serve this, this file.

190
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:02,180
That way you can easily use that in products in Israel.

191
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:07,020
Actually, let me change this file name to index for this.

192
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:08,180
All right.

193
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:12,510
And then here in the directory me create another file conservatorships.

194
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:16,310
So what what I'm going to do here is I'm going to require

195
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:22,100
require equals to

196
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,210
require ESM.

197
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:38,930
Module and then module two exports equals to acquire.

198
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:47,770
Index is because we all the code that we had in the server to this we move that to index.

199
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:51,940
So now here we are in the server to this file.

200
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,250
We are just inputting this index or this.

201
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:03,650
And the difference is this required is equal to the ESM module.

202
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,150
All right.

203
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:05,990
So this way.

204
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:08,760
Okay.

205
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,280
Let me make sure this is in the server folder.

206
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,780
Again, this is important to me.

207
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:18,260
Drag it and just make sure it isn't the server folder buffet.

208
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,430
Now we can give this a try locally before we push to the alive server.

209
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:28,530
And this way you'll also see how to make changes and push to the disclosed.

210
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:28,950
Right.

211
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:33,090
So let me go back to my server engine start.

212
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:39,650
There has been no changes and you can see everything is perfect.

213
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,410
You can go.

214
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:52,200
Local host Let me just try accessing api eight thousands less api so you can see everything is working

215
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:52,760
beautiful.

216
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:57,590
I guess that means we made that changes now.

217
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:02,830
We need to commit that to GitHub and then pull that changes in the digital logs.

218
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:07,910
I think it gives status.

219
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:16,280
You can see one file has been changed modified git and get commit death and.

220
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:21,050
Tinged soldier juice.

221
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,830
And let's get puss.

222
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,760
I guess the code has been pushed to GitHub.

223
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,320
Now we can pull that tinges into the disclose.

224
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:41,290
So it's good to disclose and make sure your intentions touch over full and you can pull the changes

225
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,030
using sudo get pulled.

226
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,250
Okay.

227
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,700
So we have pulled the changes.

228
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:08,150
Now you can see we have the index address and we have the server.

229
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:09,320
This says.

230
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,870
Now let's try to start server duties.

231
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:17,090
You.

232
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,830
Now, this time, let's see if this works.

233
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,280
And beautiful.

234
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:23,880
It works.

235
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:27,130
Now you can see a pin.

236
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,590
Anytime you get anything like this.

237
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,670
Dead in service running.

238
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:34,480
We just don't have anything served on this endpoint.

239
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,410
But if you go to courses, you see we have m-theory.

240
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:39,190
Perfect.

241
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,350
So I was able is up and running.

242
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:47,350
Now let's make sure our server at the front end is running as well.
