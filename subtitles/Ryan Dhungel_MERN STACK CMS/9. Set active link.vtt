1
00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:02.590
So.

2
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.530
Let's see how we can make them active.

3
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.840
Right.

4
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:06.190
So it.

5
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:08.370
Come here.

6
00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:10.160
And.

7
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.260
To make things easier instead of writing very long code comparisons to the current.

8
00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.940
If the current is equal to his riff, let me use a helper function here.

9
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.570
So let's call it active name.

10
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.450
It can stoop to this function, will receive some argument, and then it will return some class names

11
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:40.240
which will make the current link active with some extra standing so that it stands out right.

12
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.620
So active name.

13
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.440
This function will receive the name, which will basically be this history.

14
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.370
So this history will be received as name.

15
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.500
And then we take right to now link.

16
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.490
I don't think actually we need leveling since we're not using bootstrap guitar, so we just want the

17
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.510
word active.

18
00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.190
All right, so here we use current.

19
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:22.930
So we access the still variable current and we take if the current equal sequence equals the current

20
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:31.480
value matches, then our name will be sending as argument which could be administered bedpost which

21
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.980
could be anything.

22
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.340
Right.

23
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.740
So if that match with the current, if that is equal to a name then.

24
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.170
You want to use the class name active.

25
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:45.280
That's it.

26
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.850
Now the active class name.

27
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.460
We can just swear to see a system.

28
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.390
Make it look active.

29
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.630
All right, so that's perfect.

30
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.040
Now we can use this function on all these different links.

31
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.890
So let's try on the desperate.

32
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.380
So a.

33
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.690
We use class name.

34
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.130
The class name.

35
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.110
Active.

36
00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.220
I didn't name.

37
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.490
Right.

38
00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.520
So that's now a function they would take.

39
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.720
Actively subclass them.

40
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.000
We want to determine whether it's active or not, and for that we can use this function that will return

41
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.540
the value.

42
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.020
If Mets then it will return the value of active.

43
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.500
All right.

44
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.050
So we execute this function.

45
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.030
We need to make sure to pass the name, which is less admin.

46
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.010
We have to pass the string like that.

47
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.760
And that is all we need to do.

48
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.440
I could.

49
00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:58.470
I think, Alisha.

50
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.480
And if I rightly inspect, you can see this now has the class name active.

51
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:07.680
You can see classic.

52
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.440
Now if I click on Add New.

53
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.830
You don't see active at the moment.

54
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.850
And you let me right click inspect again to see if it doesn't have the active plus name.

55
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.980
But as soon as I use this.

56
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.050
I should be able to.

57
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.050
Said the acting class then, if that is.

58
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:39.930
So let me replace the anchor tag with that coat and limit this to Edmund's less posts.

59
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:53.450
So that's almost as good as the add new replacement to it by sending it back to Edmonds, less posts,

60
00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.260
less new.

61
00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.310
So whatever has if you put that here now, if you try.

62
00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.160
Previously we couldn't see acting.

63
00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.360
But now if we click.

64
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.860
You can see now it has the active plus name.

65
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.900
And based on that, we can study.

66
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.950
All right, so let's do this for all the links.

67
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.040
This one is Adnan's last.

68
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.370
Categories.

69
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:28.200
Next one library and means less media.

70
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:30.480
Library.

71
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:32.160
Next one.

72
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.910
And means less media less.

73
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:42.950
Next the comments.

74
00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:51.290
Add Winslet's comments next one for users.

75
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.180
And means less uses.

76
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.320
By the way, you can pause the video and finish it on your own.

77
00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.910
This one's pretty straightforward.

78
00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:08.300
Ed means less, uses less then.

79
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.280
And means less.

80
00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.060
Usually that's living like this for now.

81
00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:21.700
It's going to be dynamic a bit later, but for the moment, and the last one customized to that end

82
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.530
is less customized.

83
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:25.270
Okay.

84
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.500
So we have added.

85
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:34.110
This functionality that will give us the active last name, which whichever a leak has been clicked.

86
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.740
Now, at the moment, you don't see much difference.

87
00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:41.660
So what we can do is.

88
00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:42.140
We can.

89
00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.260
Create a style set and then.

90
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:52.980
Use the use and she uses to make the active plus them look a unique.

91
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:55.250
All right.

92
00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.580
So.

93
00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.610
Previously we used the public folder to Stasi curses only screwed.

94
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:06.080
One must use this for our own self external storage system.

95
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.880
So yeah, we tried the cases for the class.

96
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.190
They're so active.

97
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.240
I want to send the caller to the caller.

98
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.800
I want to set the blue car.

99
00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:25.440
189890ff.

100
00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:33.060
By the way, if you're interested in getting these weird colors, I'm my favorite one is always search

101
00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.590
for pasta as the animal color.

102
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.510
And I go to w three schools.

103
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.850
And then begin to speak the colors get their value.

104
00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:51.260
As you vary, you can choose the different states.

105
00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.560
It's pretty cool here.

106
00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:55.350
All right.

107
00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.920
So this is how you can get the valleys.

108
00:06:59.340 --> 00:06:59.700
You know.

109
00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:04.860
Oh, there's valleys using a slide loose fairly here.

110
00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:06.300
That's a goal.

111
00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.920
And then takes decoration.

112
00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.280
I want to set it to underline.

113
00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:17.610
So the active platinum name will have this blue color and then a beautiful underline underneath.

114
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:19.110
Okay, so.

115
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:21.600
And save that in me.

116
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.010
Reload the page just to make sure.

117
00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.880
And let's see if the active links works.

118
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.440
Now, if I could click.

119
00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:32.200
And new.

120
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.050
Actually, it's not sure.

121
00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:49.450
Let me give you and important I think that that's needed giving you a readout.

122
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:52.390
That's world.

123
00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:53.940
And new.

124
00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.030
Only when I click it twice.

125
00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:00.260
It's actually working, too.

126
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:01.490
Something's not right.

127
00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.100
On the line.

128
00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:06.910
It's good to win now.

129
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:08.720
Okay.

130
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:17.510
So I just realized that kind of a silly mistake that we did is because I created this started, but

131
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:19.150
I haven't actually imported it anyway.

132
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:22.040
So let me go and input in.

133
00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.310
Underscore averages.

134
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.300
By the way, let me quickly show you one more thing.

135
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:36.830
So sometimes what I do is I have this plug in in my column that's called a live C editor.

136
00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:47.330
You can download it from Google Chrome Web Store and Google Chrome Web Store or something.

137
00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:48.170
They call it.

138
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:54.080
We've seen declining.

139
00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.950
So you can search for that long life surface editor.

140
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:06.670
This is one of my favorite tools for cynicism that you can quickly try to assess.

141
00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:09.780
This one, right?

142
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.690
If you don't have it so you can click and in some I'll have it so you can see I see a remote and that

143
00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:17.680
will let you.

144
00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:21.580
Provide some services that gets applied immediately.

145
00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:28.960
So for example, if a train now you can see immediately it is it has the underline and the column blue

146
00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:35.140
if I am that that's got a thumb on the decimal then that gets hacked.

147
00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:37.210
I found on the.

148
00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.040
And knew that act.

149
00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:40.810
You can see.

150
00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:41.710
All right.

151
00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:42.420
You.

152
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.030
We have to make sure we import here.

153
00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:54.010
Import.

154
00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:02.230
So we have to go to let's see.

155
00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.730
This is just he says.

156
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:08.480
I said, come here.

157
00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:11.730
Can't resolve.

158
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:12.380
Let's see.

159
00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:15.890
So I think we have to give a full partnership on this.

160
00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:21.750
Only in the adverts is everywhere else and just give it like that since it's in public.

161
00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:28.830
So let me just stress this probably less.

162
00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.410
So let me go.

163
00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.660
Go one step or two paces.

164
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:42.680
So it's inside business.

165
00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:46.250
Who wants to form good spaces in public spaces?

166
00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:48.050
So that's how it should work.

167
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:52.290
Okay.

168
00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:52.830
Beautiful.

169
00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:54.480
All right.

170
00:10:54.480 --> 00:11:00.060
So you can see here, even on page reload, we can see that we have the active link here.

171
00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:01.170
All right.

172
00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:03.930
Now, Fernandes, you see that's active.

173
00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.470
If you reload is too that would be active.

174
00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:09.150
If you're gonna add new.

175
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.940
Even if you reload, that's active.

176
00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:13.990
Beautiful.
