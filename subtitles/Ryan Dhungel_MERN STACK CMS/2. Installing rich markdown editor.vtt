00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.370
Archer now getting to work on this base so that we can create a new post.

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.150
And for that, first thing we want to do is prepare this editor, which is the rich mark donator.

3
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:20.580
Let's insert this one and then we're going to work on the other features, for example, title and all

4
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.300
these features.

5
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.720
All right, so let's go this search for NPM, a rich markdown editor.

6
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.950
It's called Rich Markdown, not react markdown.

7
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.300
I guess just keep that in mind.

8
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.740
Otherwise you will be wasting your time looking around.

9
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.700
All right.

10
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.680
So you can see this one is developed by this.

11
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.290
This company outlined this.

12
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.230
I think they provide software as a service.

13
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.330
If you're interested, you can take out their website as well.

14
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.600
I guess if they provide some kind of a service, I haven't really got deep into it, but they're the

15
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.820
ones behind this markdown in development, this Ed isolates.

16
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.700
And so this one in our client.

17
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.980
So let me stop that and run this.

18
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.320
And while it's happening, let's continue.

19
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.080
And you can take out the source that as well.

20
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.680
Sorry.

21
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.240
The end PM.

22
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:27.110
Yeah.

23
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.600
A very, very little documentation here.

24
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.720
However, if you visit this site, they have a very nice documentation to me

25
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:39.950
that link.

26
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.740
If you go to the homepage, I think we will get them.

27
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.000
Just go to the home, homebase.

28
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.350
Live demo.

29
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.370
I think this is the one.

30
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.510
This is where you get to see all the features of this editor.

31
00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:58.400
So he can see that.

32
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:07.130
You can edit, you can edit, you can insert images, you can insert images as we saw how to make to

33
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.710
try and save headings and block quotes.

34
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.610
The tables you can put called yeah really nice restrict after this one.

35
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.550
So let's continue with our app.

36
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:33.860
Let's start this again and then come here and in the new post new let's import that.

37
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:42.140
So we import that editor from which markdown editor.

38
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:44.240
All right.

39
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.130
So we can put that here.

40
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.690
So the editor we put this charm editor.

41
00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.640
Now let's see what we get just out of the box like that.

42
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.570
Duplicate use of six.

43
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.160
That's a new error.

44
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:19.780
Okay, so I was finally able to get rid of that error and I have the energy here, but it was a bit

45
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.220
of a work, so I'll show you how I managed to fix that issue.

46
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.790
All right.

47
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.010
So first thing you want to do is come to your client package, transition file and then.

48
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.470
And this overwrites pro's mirrored tables.

49
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:44.170
I guess this value you put in your packages isn't just you can put it right after the end, just before

50
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.610
the closing codebase.

51
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.260
How could this value I got?

52
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.790
Because I went to their official documentation.

53
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.130
You can see here I went to the repository.

54
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:05.250
I went to the issues section and then someone had already posted this question to it since like a bug.

55
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:08.240
And.

56
00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.610
And this this guy, he posted this solution, which worked for me.

57
00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.230
So this is what I added.

58
00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.760
And then did you want to uninstall?

59
00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:25.970
I removed the node modules folder, which is right here, removed the node modules folder to just delete

60
00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.750
that delete back is dest log decent file as well.

61
00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.280
So delete that so that we can reinstall all these packages again.

62
00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.760
All right.

63
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:44.090
So once you do that, then you come here and then you instead of using npm, installing what you do

64
00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.370
is you use here.

65
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.640
Yeah.

66
00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.000
In install or you can even just run here.

67
00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.780
Okay.

68
00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.320
So that will reinstall the packages which I already did.

69
00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.900
So you see this message, but you do that and that will fix that error.

70
00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.460
Okay.

71
00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.630
Now if you don't have a yarn installer already, you can easily select with npm.

72
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.450
Okay.

73
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.330
So let me show you how to install.

74
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.490
Yeah.

75
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:16.220
And globally all you do is npm introduced as global.

76
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.700
Yeah.

77
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.360
So this is what you need to do if you have to use the yen before.

78
00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.900
Okay.

79
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:31.220
And then instead of npm instantly you use here just once you can continue using NPM commands, but just

80
00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:39.950
for once for the sake of this package you use here and that is all you need to do said that to fix this

81
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:40.280
issue.

82
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.450
So basically what we did is we added this to a package there.

83
00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.860
Jason Fine, remove the node modules, remove packages logged.

84
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:55.910
Jason And then we use a yard to install pre-installed the packages I guess and that fixed the issue.

85
00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:05.300
But then again you're on NPM, run dev, run the server and that will give you this integer.

86
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:12.320
This is really beautiful, Ed, but it's a little bit tricky to install, I guess.

87
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:14.160
And then you can see.

88
00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:15.750
Click here.

89
00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:17.140
Get this option.

90
00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.810
Or you can just force this get on this earth.

91
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.160
Since you can even you don't even have to scroll.

92
00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:24.220
You can just type in here.

93
00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:31.660
For example, if I wanted to insert code block, I would destroy the code enter and they can second

94
00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:32.710
so long.

95
00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.210
It's really nice.

96
00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:42.070
Okay.

97
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.440
So you can type H1.

98
00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.050
You can even double click and get this option.

99
00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.360
You can maintain blog posts.

100
00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.380
It has so many features.

101
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.510
It's absolutely beautiful.

102
00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:02.250
All right.

103
00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:03.540
So we got this one.

104
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.140
Now we have to fix a bit of a styling issues here, which we can do.

105
00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:14.310
But otherwise, I'm hopeful that you were able to install this practice along with me.

106
00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:20.970
If you have some issues, of course, post your questions in the Q&amp;A section and I'll try my best to

107
00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:21.390
help you.

108
00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:28.500
But most of the time, if there are some such weird issues, most likely you will find the solutions

109
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:34.530
by going to the the digital base for those libraries.

110
00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:40.740
And then if you browse the questions in the issues section, most likely you will find the solutions

111
00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:40.980
that.

112
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:43.970
All right.

113
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:52.850
Now, this team, this editor also takes this property, the light and dark theme you can use very simple.

114
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.820
And with dark theme, it doesn't actually really.

115
00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.060
Well well, it looks right as with.

116
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:02.300
So fix that we can quickly give it a try.

117
00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:05.750
You can also try to.

118
00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:09.160
Doc.

119
00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:11.410
I can do that.

120
00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:15.960
Now this looks like it's not a theme.

121
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.130
It's called

122
00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:21.810
dark.

123
00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.290
And they give the value of true or false.

124
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:31.670
I guess that gives us this dark energy as well.

125
00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:37.730
Well, there are a few things we can do to make this Ed amazing, including file upload.

126
00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.220
Okay, so we'll come back to it.

127
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:46.310
Now this I don't want to hardcore this further because if we are using the light theme again, it looks

128
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.760
different.

129
00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.840
So to fix this weekend are going to access the theme valley from our context.

130
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.590
And based on that, we can change this dynamically.

131
00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:56.750
All right.

132
00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:00.020
So let's continue all that in the next video.

133
00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.760
So let me remove this from the.
