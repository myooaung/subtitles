00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:00.680
All right.

2
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.030
So we can create a new post.

3
00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:09.210
We can add a featured image to the post, so we can upload one image, we can upload multiple images.

4
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:16.820
Now, the next thing we want to do is we want to show the uploaded images here, right?

5
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.370
So as a library, so all of these images are saved in the database.

6
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.300
So we want to show the list of images available because when you're creating a post, you may not always

7
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.560
want to upload a new one.

8
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.950
You may want to choose from your library.

9
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:32.220
Right?

10
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:39.000
So you may have uploaded now lots of images before you actually use them.

11
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.450
All right.

12
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.500
So that's the whole idea of having this media library.

13
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.340
All right.

14
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.560
So let's implement that.

15
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.960
And that will look something like this one so that this is the finished product to upload.

16
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.770
Of course, you can upload a new one or you can choose the.

17
00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.220
For those that I already uploaded.

18
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:05.710
If I if I click here you can see that image has been saved as featured image for this fall.

19
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.000
So inaccurate a new post.

20
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.570
This image will be the featured images for this post.

21
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.620
So we want to implement something like that.

22
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.930
So let's go to our back end and create the endpoint.

23
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.290
Actually, we need to add one.

24
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.760
One is to get all of the media files and another one is to implement the delete feature.

25
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.360
Let's go to the back and create these two endpoints and then we can implement that feature here.

26
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.960
So it's good.

27
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.970
So let's start from the road post.

28
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.950
So let's add.

29
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.660
And media outlets.

30
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.580
So, Ron, don't get to make it get out.

31
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.260
We can call the media.

32
00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:06.220
And we want to apply some middleware require signing is admin and then we call it media.

33
00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:08.230
Okay.

34
00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:17.580
Next one, let's create the delete endpoint as rules around a dot delete so media and then to delete

35
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.090
a media, we going to send the media ID so we can do that.

36
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:29.900
As I recall, assigning is admin and then we can call it to remove media, I guess.

37
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.910
So that's to get all the media and that is to delete the media.

38
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:41.170
So let's bring them from our control media and remove media.

39
00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.450
So let's go to this control controllers posts

40
00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.300
I.

41
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.310
So let's write them here.

42
00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:04.170
Export counts media equals to async request for response Friday.

43
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.380
So here what you want to do.

44
00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:21.770
Actually, let me just create another important as well to do it export concert media.

45
00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.610
So to get all the media files we can put in a variable media.

46
00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.450
Media equals to await the media model.

47
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:55.910
So we use the media model.

48
00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.960
Use the find function that gives us all the files.

49
00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.340
And now it's media file.

50
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.050
Have the posted by the user and from us or whoever created them.

51
00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.080
So we're going to populate that as well.

52
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.550
See?

53
00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:10.550
So populate.

54
00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:14.420
Posted by.

55
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.940
And you done.

56
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.080
We don't need the whole a user object.

57
00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.480
We just need the ID of the user.

58
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.700
So we can just select, underscore, tidy.

59
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.260
Sorry.

60
00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:34.370
So coats and whatever fuels you need, for example, if you want it, if you remember, you can just

61
00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.160
write like that with space.

62
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.350
No.

63
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.740
Com.

64
00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.060
But we just want the so we just leave it like that.

65
00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.100
Heidi and then we also want to populate.

66
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.790
It is not popular.

67
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:54.590
We want to show so we want to sort of based on the created dates or the latest, latest ones, the newly

68
00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.620
uploaded ones will be on the top.

69
00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.070
Right.

70
00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.080
So created and.

71
00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.290
Minus one.

72
00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.490
All right.

73
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.170
So that's how we get all the media.

74
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.680
We populate the posted by users I.D., sort by the created date, and that's all we need.

75
00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.750
We can send the decent response media.

76
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.720
I guess that would contain all the files that we have now.

77
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:28.130
Next one is to remove such remove we can again find the medium by adding Andrew What I need to go on

78
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:35.990
media includes to await media don't find by I d and

79
00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:49.970
delete find variety and delete and the idea of the media will be receiving in the params a request for

80
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.690
outside.

81
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.490
All right.

82
00:05:53.660 --> 00:06:00.200
So once you find the media and remove, all we need to do is you can send the deleted media as a response,

83
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.030
but we don't really need that.

84
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.520
So we can just send response station.

85
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:06.110
Okay.

86
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.500
To.

87
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.560
All right.

88
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.600
So that way we will be able to get all the media and the media as well.

89
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:15.880
All right.

90
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:22.880
So let's go to our client and then let's implement this so that we can show all the media and allow

91
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.500
the admin to remove ads.

92
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.740
Well.
