1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:01,110
Oh.

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:06,300
And so the next thing we're going to work on is a bit of a code refactoring.

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:15,870
That's because you can see here this dashboard is for user with the role of admins or admin can click

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:21,150
post categories media now and we can create users as well.

5
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:29,670
So now what do you want to do now is we want to make sure the user with the role of author he also has

6
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,400
access to the certain features.

7
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,440
For example, the author should be able to create a new post.

8
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,750
They should be able to see all his post.

9
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:51,180
He should be able to update or did his post not everyone else's, but just his post and the library.

10
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:59,190
Also, authors should be able to upload emails and delete the emails if that image has been deleted

11
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,030
by himself.

12
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:00,600
Right.

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,270
So not anyone else's, but just himself.

14
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:05,500
Yeah.

15
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:13,350
So on you just we don't need for authors are basically for post first categories and media.

16
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:19,590
These features will should be accessible for the user with the role of author as well.

17
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:19,950
All right.

18
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,990
So so far the way we have built the application, it is only focused for the one admin.

19
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,790
But now we have this concept of role based authorization.

20
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:35,040
So user with the role of author should have access to these bits as well.

21
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:42,520
So what are we going to do is we try to reuse these the code that we already have.

22
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:42,750
Right.

23
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:49,880
So instead of duplicating which would be which would not be a good idea to, you know, duplicate all

24
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:56,940
the features all over again for other what we can do is we can simply put our code in on a component

25
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:06,570
and then bring that component and put in the admin decimal places and also for other decimal places.

26
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:12,330
So basically all we have to do is move the code to a component and then just bring them.

27
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:25,170
And I saw in the user desperate that we just have to create two extra basis for author author and then

28
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,970
that's pretty much that's how it's going to work.

29
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,740
It's going to be very straightforward.

30
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,370
All right.

31
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,710
So let me show you what we're going to do here.

32
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,260
First, we have to refactor our code.

33
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:34,960
All right.

34
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,670
So we're going to start from post.

35
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,570
So it's good to pages.

36
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,050
Admin post.

37
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,520
Now at the moment we have the admin posts.

38
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:46,290
Right.

39
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,220
So you can see here.

40
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,230
What are you going to do?

41
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,020
Is we going to start from district to new?

42
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:57,190
So here admin is able to create a new post.

43
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,160
All right, so all this code we have in this space now, instead of keeping it in this space, we're

44
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:10,720
going to move it to a component and then just simply bring them here and then admin will be able to

45
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,470
create post.

46
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:18,370
The page will be authenticated only for the admin because all we need to do is wrap this component with

47
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,570
admin layout.

48
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:24,430
So all of this roll all the way from top.

49
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,790
The bottom of this quote, we can move to a component.

50
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:30,990
Okay.

51
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,570
And the same with the inputs in this function.

52
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:34,290
So we can move to a.

53
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,180
So let's see how this works.

54
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,480
Let's go to the components.

55
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,760
And it's called a new folder.

56
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:51,400
And let's call it the scrutiny for the four posts and then tell you it's good enough.

57
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:56,630
Let's call it new post component.

58
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,130
All right.

59
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:06,230
So here, basically, we pretty much want all the score to be there so we can copy all the code from

60
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:10,250
post new go to the new post component and paste here.

61
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:11,120
All right.

62
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,470
So let's start by changing the component name new post.

63
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,420
New post from former.

64
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,620
New post-Communist Soviet is the name.

65
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:38,290
The next thing we let's come down here and we have the layout, right?

66
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,440
So this layout we are going to put here instead we're going to put the layout in in here.

67
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,220
All right.

68
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:53,770
So that way it can be used for admin using admin layout and later it can be used for auto using auto

69
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:54,310
layout.

70
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,450
All right, so that's the idea.

71
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:00,700
So let's remove that and it's got all the way down removed from here.

72
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:11,230
Well, so we are returning this row and we just removed the layout and this layout had the authentication.

73
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:18,400
So if you have forgotten, let me quickly show you that just the components layout, admin layout.

74
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,290
So you can see here we basically returning the children props.

75
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:26,320
And before we do that, we have the tick.

76
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,510
We have the set loading.

77
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:37,640
We have the use effect.

78
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:44,600
It makes a request to back in to give the current admin that makes use this user have the role of admin

79
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:44,900
right.

80
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,580
So otherwise learning will be.

81
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:52,300
Otherwise we redirect them to the homepage.

82
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,300
So if loading we are showing the loading item.

83
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,280
And immediately we redirect to Homebase.

84
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,330
Otherwise we saw the content.

85
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:05,560
All right.

86
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,050
So we removed that layout.

87
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:13,320
We keep the row, and then from here.

88
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,920
So we can just remove that.

89
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,050
Thank you.

90
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:23,980
So now that we have moved our core to a new push component, let's go back to admin post new.

91
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:29,920
And here you want to let's start from the top.

92
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:35,410
You don't want any of this imported because all this has been moved there, right?

93
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,480
You don't want all that.

94
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:46,300
You don't want all these functions as well.

95
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:49,150
So this is our component name from there to.

96
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,770
All the way to return.

97
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:53,430
Yes.

98
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:54,630
On that code.

99
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,560
All those functions.

100
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,700
Some of that.

101
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,370
And then the admin laird.

102
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,120
We have the room.

103
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,120
We're going to remove all this row.

104
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:06,480
We have already moved this code here, so we just keep it clean like that again.

105
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,660
So what do you want to do now is we want to import the layout.

106
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,580
So import

107
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:18,430
admin layout from one step of custom.

108
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,660
All these two components.

109
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,340
Layout, admin lounge.

110
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:32,460
So we import layout and then we want to now import this component.

111
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:42,150
All right, so import new post component from components posts, new post component.

112
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,010
And then we put it here.

113
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:47,920
Simple as that.

114
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,320
Now let's give it a try.

115
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:52,690
Let's see if this works.

116
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,910
It's good to add new.

117
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,330
Okay.

118
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,990
So we may have to fix some of the path.

119
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,550
Components Boost New Push to theme context.

120
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,630
To this Footloose convert.

121
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,090
Let's try to fix some of this.

122
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,510
So probably the path.

123
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:14,860
So one step up.

124
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:18,820
One sip of.

125
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:21,850
To step up.

126
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,400
So just remember back to.

127
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:26,920
Sam.

128
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,990
You want to stick?

129
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,370
And component is right here.

130
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:39,770
So we go one step and then it's here.

131
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,160
So it's removed.

132
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:41,730
Both.

133
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:44,590
Component.

134
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,340
We are already in intel components.

135
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:48,020
Context.

136
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,400
Just to step up.

137
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,270
I think that so.

138
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,800
Let's have a look.

139
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,300
Give it.

140
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,870
Reload.

141
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:02,730
Media.

142
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:06,750
Okay.

143
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,280
So we already had two components.

144
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:12,720
We didn't need the components to just go on step.

145
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,190
Okay.

146
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,870
How good is that?

147
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:19,830
All right.

148
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:29,250
You can see we have avenue based just like we had before, but we simplified it by moving into this

149
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,350
component and this and bring them here.

150
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:33,720
Beautiful.

151
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,770
Let's try.

152
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,080
Let's try to create one and make sure it works.

153
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,290
Go to factory.

154
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,830
Just put some placeholder text.

155
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,480
Okay.

156
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:54,990
Featured image.

157
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,340
Let me pick one existing image.

158
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,520
And this one.

159
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,450
And this one.

160
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,980
Categories react.

161
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:13,770
Note.

162
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,880
Okay, let's promise.

163
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,400
And you can see everything works the way it was work before.

164
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:25,760
Beautiful.
