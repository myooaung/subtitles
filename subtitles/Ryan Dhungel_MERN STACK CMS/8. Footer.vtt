1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.780
All right, so let's work on the future with sort of look something like that.

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.100
So for that, we can put the future in a separate component.

3
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:08.450
Right.

4
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.900
So let's create.

5
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:12.780
Components, spaces.

6
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.930
Let me quit for a year or two years.

7
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:17.100
And then here.

8
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.310
Launched for Truth in two.

9
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.150
Let's return to the.

10
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.980
We can just use parentheses here.

11
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.800
Yeah.

12
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:45.410
Now let's return in, Dave and let me just write food for now will come back to exclude default, destroy

13
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.000
that you put it here and then we'll continue working on that one soon.

14
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.050
That's important.

15
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:54.370
Footage from.

16
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.800
We get inside components.

17
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.940
Bases for.

18
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:12.120
So it's kind of a dome and footer we can put at the very end.

19
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.630
So let's just put fruit right here.

20
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.350
Oh, look, we got the footer.

21
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.780
Okay, so let's continue working on that.

22
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.540
It's good footer in here.

23
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.570
Since we want to show the the full width image, we can use the parallax image that we already created.

24
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.490
Import.

25
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.700
Parallax images from right here from the same directory.

26
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.160
Let's import.

27
00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:54.430
Rows and columns row called on from and we want some icons as well so let's involves some icons from.

28
00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.250
At Indiana Jones and I have already chosen the icons.

29
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:10.120
So these icons are these are the ones the users group of this one a bit happier something this icon

30
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.010
is common in the copyright.

31
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:22.010
So here user group and outlined.

32
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.870
Make sure you don't have any typos.

33
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.940
You can see it's all lowercase.

34
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:36.170
All of the documentation for all you can just get this search code if you find it, something's missing.

35
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.420
So user group out and outlined.

36
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.170
API outlined.

37
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.900
And the next one is copyright outlined copyrights.

38
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.740
Without s, I think copyright.

39
00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:55.210
All right.

40
00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:56.380
So good that I can tell you.

41
00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.280
Now, let's work on showing that.

42
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.390
So we got this div.

43
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.010
If you want to do some extra customization, you can import the team context.

44
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:21.200
And based on the theme, you may want to, you know, control things, the colors and things like that.

45
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.950
If you you can always do that.

46
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.940
If you want to spend some more time on study.

47
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:37.780
So here, pilot's images here by default, the images that one is use, which is images to show.

48
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.730
Let's try this time let's try pass the are.

49
00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:51.410
And we can pass that as images less what we call the colored images, too.

50
00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:52.760
Let's pass another one.

51
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.230
It means three.

52
00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.410
Don't depend.

53
00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:05.820
And then here basically we can send the content which will be rendered and children props to roll into

54
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.930
drew column, inside column.

55
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.020
We want three columns, right.

56
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:23.820
So you can see this is what are trying to achieve three columns, agent and some text so we can put

57
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:24.230
them here.

58
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.900
The column, first column.

59
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.540
We can give this style.

60
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.680
This time for this one.

61
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.100
First of all, I think we should give the span to aid through the 24.

62
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.150
So we use column eight for all of them.

63
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:54.300
Spend it style we want to center.

64
00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.350
Text Alliance Center.

65
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:02.040
CALLER.

66
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.210
The text call we can use.

67
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.800
Oh, we may actually need to use this one, so let's leave it for now.

68
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.810
Okay.

69
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.960
So yeah, let's use that.

70
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.990
I'm going to use a group outlined here.

71
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.930
We can use that slightly.

72
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.930
Make it bigger by giving the style font size.

73
00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.270
Let's choose 80.

74
00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.900
I get quite big and then it's create a line break.

75
00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.500
And then after the line break we write some content.

76
00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.020
So let's say the ultimate.

77
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.390
Blogging that.

78
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.670
Okay.

79
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.560
So this column we want to copy, it's copy paste twice.

80
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:57.030
And for the second one, we use another icon that is called API outlined.

81
00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.120
Let's write something here.

82
00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.520
Let's call it build using

83
00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:10.740
demand stack.

84
00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.770
Let's see.

85
00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.240
MongoDB Express.

86
00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.360
React note and the last one.

87
00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.680
This one we use copy.

88
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.070
Right.

89
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.620
Outlined and we're right here.

90
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.470
Copyrights copyright.

91
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:35.450
You can use the date.

92
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:36.020
You can.

93
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.740
Hard code.

94
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.110
This is 2022.

95
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.270
You can hard or let's do the better.

96
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.260
We could date and get full year.

97
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.690
That will always give you the current to you.

98
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:57.320
And then you can use the copyright symbol using and copy code.

99
00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.500
And then we can write all rights reserved.

100
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:02.900
Perfect.

101
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:08.030
And with all that, it's a bit of a break.

102
00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.260
And let's give it a try.

103
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.040
It looks beautiful.

104
00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:14.230
Really nice.

105
00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:17.860
You can see.

106
00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:19.570
Awesome.
