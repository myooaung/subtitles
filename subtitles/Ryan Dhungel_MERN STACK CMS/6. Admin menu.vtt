1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:00.720
All right.

2
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.050
So let's continue working on this sidebar now.

3
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.350
This collapse button we don't actually need.

4
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.150
Because if you have a look here, we have something like that, right?

5
00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.430
So you can implement something like that.

6
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:24.950
And then we will have a look into these options as well, how to keep them open or close.

7
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:25.750
All right.

8
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.620
So we can do that.

9
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.230
That is something you can do here.

10
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.760
You can see default selected keys is one.

11
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.900
All right.

12
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.750
That's why when you land in the base, the first thing you'll see is this navigation.

13
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:42.440
It's open.

14
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.090
This is closed.

15
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:45.110
All right.

16
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.150
So these are these are not collapsible.

17
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.020
But this one, you see, it stays open.

18
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.060
That's because the default selected keys is the one.

19
00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.170
And that is the one.

20
00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.950
The option one.

21
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.160
He's one different open kills someone.

22
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.190
So someone is here.

23
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.090
So you're going to this navigation one and it has all these submenus.

24
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.030
Navigation one.

25
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.910
This one stays open because that's the values here.

26
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.170
Now, if you want to keep more than one item open, you can just put those values here.

27
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.820
All right.

28
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.180
So, for example, if you want to keep this, so to also open.

29
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.260
You can come here and then just use some to as well.

30
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.040
If you see now you can see if you learn in the base.

31
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.680
Both of them will be open.

32
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.750
All right.

33
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.570
I guess that's good.

34
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.350
Now.

35
00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.940
Next thing we want to do is do some work on the the look how it looks.

36
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.270
Right?

37
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.590
So, first of all, let's fix this up so that it collapses like that, right?

38
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.840
Let's fix that up.

39
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.820
And then we work on showing the.

40
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.730
And proper links that we need for our teams.

41
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.320
And we, we use different items so that they are a bit more relevant to the content, whatever we're

42
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.890
doing here.

43
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.790
All right.

44
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.260
So first, let's fix that.

45
00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.170
The collapse.

46
00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.700
So what we can do for that is you can see we're not actually using side or component at the moment since

47
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:40.390
we're using layout and this admin now is basically use here in the the layout.

48
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.960
You can see here, we can use theta four on this one.

49
00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.400
So let me import the layout.

50
00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.530
And then let's import cider.

51
00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.340
Sorry.

52
00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.210
A destructive

53
00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.650
side of fun.

54
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.790
So here's the consistent layout.

55
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.970
And then let's replace this dip, the wrapping dip with side.

56
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.430
It's come all the way down and turn this to site the moment.

57
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.730
If you save, you don't see any things here in the same.

58
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:30.400
However, you can pass some crops for example collapse and just double to collapse.

59
00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.740
So.

60
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.420
Collapsible sword.

61
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.420
If you pass that, you will get beside and you can click on that to collapse.

62
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.650
Make it smart.

63
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.240
All right.

64
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.120
So that's beautiful.

65
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.020
Now, once we can do that, we we have no need for this one.

66
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.230
So let's remove that to assume that button.

67
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.370
Awesome.

68
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:55.810
Okay.

69
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.560
Beautiful.

70
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.460
Now, next thing, let's use the proper items and things.

71
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.800
The links as well.

72
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.750
All right, so this menu, it's using a dark theme.

73
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.260
Now, when we are in a dark mode, it looks good.

74
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.460
But when you go to the light mode, you can see we're using the dark meat.

75
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.890
Now, if you don't want that, you can just change that.

76
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.570
It's removed.

77
00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.240
So we see this standard menu.

78
00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.620
All right.

79
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:32.420
That looks good.

80
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.730
Next one.

81
00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.770
So the first option.

82
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.170
Question one.

83
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.280
So we want the first one to be the despot for the admin.

84
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.550
All right, so let me change that.

85
00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.700
We need the link component from next there.

86
00:04:52.700 --> 00:05:00.170
So let's end for that first info link for next link.

87
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.120
So the first one is going to be an admin link.

88
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.900
A.

89
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.310
Link has red.

90
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.640
So we use this less admin.

91
00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.160
And here we are, right?

92
00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:25.850
That's for

93
00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.090
now, isn't that?

94
00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.360
That's very frankly.

95
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:39.230
We're on the same base adamant to this that basically currently at the moment and looks good.

96
00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.110
So we've got the admin that one makes one.

97
00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:52.370
We want to call posts so we don't have those links at the moment, but obviously we would be adding

98
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:53.060
later slates.

99
00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:58.250
Copy that link cut and put it here and call this post.

100
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.830
It's going to be for advertisers, less ad means less post.

101
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.200
All right, so here it's calling posts.

102
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:08.900
Let's cut off all posts.

103
00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.220
All right, let me copy again.

104
00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:16.560
The next one.

105
00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.240
We can call it anew.

106
00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:28.290
So you just admin will be able to add a new post by clicking on this link.

107
00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.270
So we can create a base for that called admins.

108
00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.950
Less posts, less new.

109
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:41.310
All right, then the next one we want is category.

110
00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:48.270
So let me copy that menu item into a menu item based here and call it admin less.

111
00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.510
Categories

112
00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:59.020
and year ten is two categories.

113
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:09.310
Now the next one, we'll have the we will have this dropdown menu submenu.

114
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:09.700
All right.

115
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:17.110
So this one will be used for the image abroad and managing the images.

116
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:18.580
So we called media.

117
00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:25.230
And here we are going to have to officer 2 minutes and to remove this extra two.

118
00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:28.680
So the two option here.

119
00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:36.030
This one again, we need the link to copy the link component.

120
00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:39.480
You'd prefer that option.

121
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:45.570
And here, let's put that link and we can call it a library.

122
00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:47.640
Library?

123
00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:54.180
And here we can call an advanced less media slice library.

124
00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:55.360
Right.

125
00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:01.670
Copy this menu item and replaced this one with.

126
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:04.180
We call it.

127
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:11.920
And so they can access the media library or they can just upload individual images.

128
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.820
So this one, we call it admin media less new.

129
00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:18.930
All right.

130
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:23.230
So there are few more comments and you just for let's have a look how it's going.

131
00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:24.110
So far so good.

132
00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:25.240
That looks pretty good to me.

133
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.610
And the post add new.

134
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:28.360
Okay.

135
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.890
So this has to be nested.

136
00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:32.140
Let me go to the finish project.

137
00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:38.280
So we have the post and inside post we'll have the these nested options.

138
00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:42.760
This is for the post, these nested options for media.

139
00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:46.480
And so I guess so we can fix that up.

140
00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.510
We get the media that's looking good.

141
00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:55.430
All right, let's go back.

142
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.120
Let me fix that for the post.

143
00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:01.130
So that's going to be a submenu.

144
00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:02.180
All right.

145
00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:05.390
So I think I can copy that from here.

146
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:09.760
This one to be used for media, actually live and leave a comment.

147
00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:10.030
Right.

148
00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:12.950
By the way, if you.

149
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:14.850
She.

150
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:16.890
How did that come on?

151
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.090
And then this less.

152
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:19.200
That's what it did to you.

153
00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:21.080
I saw.

154
00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:23.000
Library.

155
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.140
This is a library.

156
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:26.930
Let me copy this bit.

157
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:31.560
And.

158
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:41.510
So he had let me go all the way to the top base to leave a comment post.

159
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:42.480
All right.

160
00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:43.920
So the title.

161
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.140
Let's turn this to post.

162
00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:52.140
And then we all have these links that we created.

163
00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:55.140
So let me just copy them on these three.

164
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.200
Copy.

165
00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:03.700
And then come here.

166
00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:06.910
And then this court did not.

167
00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:08.640
Put them back in.

168
00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.040
Now for these nested menu items.

169
00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:15.190
We're not using icons, so let's remove the icons.

170
00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:24.120
All right, let's have a look.

171
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:32.490
Okay, so we have the posts, all posts and new in categories that this one seems to be extremely limited

172
00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:33.210
fixed that.

173
00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:40.690
So we cut all posts.

174
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.530
All posts are new in categories.

175
00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:53.020
I wonder where this library is coming from.

176
00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:55.850
Okay.

177
00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:56.570
So let's go.

178
00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:58.670
All right, so we've got post.

179
00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.900
Let me go to the got more posts.

180
00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:05.300
We got media.

181
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:06.530
Beautiful.

182
00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:08.600
Let's work on the next one.

183
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:09.890
Next one will be.

184
00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:11.960
So that's posts.

185
00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:15.810
That's a library.

186
00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:25.590
When we copy paste, we also have to make sure to give them the unique key.

187
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:25.950
All right.

188
00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:30.540
So we give them the unique key and we have to make them active.

189
00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:35.330
So whenever we click, whenever base reloads, we have to make that active, right?

190
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:40.620
So that's something we can continue working on that for phone only discontinue the links.

191
00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:45.270
So the next one is going to be for.

192
00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:53.980
Comments to comments are going to be individual items to let me just copy one of these pull down the

193
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.840
air pockets.

194
00:11:57.810 --> 00:11:59.220
So this one, I'm going to call it.

195
00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.170
And means less content.

196
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:11.970
So admin will be basically able to remove or delete anyone's comments if they're there.

197
00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:17.480
Something you know not relevant to site admin should be able to control the content.

198
00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.020
So it tends to.

199
00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:22.160
Come.

200
00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:24.020
All right.

201
00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:26.850
So we're going to change the keys bit later.

202
00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:28.220
Let's leave it like that for now.

203
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.790
Next one is users, right?

204
00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:34.060
So use this going to be in groups.

205
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:37.740
So this submenu, let me add to that.

206
00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.640
It will go back to my previous one.

207
00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:41.690
Let me just copy that.

208
00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:45.800
Users.

209
00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:49.350
I said this one.

210
00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:55.430
So the first one we call it uses let's call it all uses.

211
00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:00.720
Give this title to the submenu he uses.

212
00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:05.310
So the you are listening to admins less users.

213
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.200
Next one is add new.

214
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.650
That's going to means less to users less new.

215
00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.780
That's for adding a new user.

216
00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.540
Another next one's going to be a profile.

217
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:25.980
So you have the link for user targeted, the profile to be copied, and that's going to be a single

218
00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:28.170
menu item.

219
00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:40.360
Changes to add means less for the profile and means less.

220
00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:46.180
It's going to be the unique user I.D. for the moment since you don't have the user ID itself and just

221
00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:49.210
leave it like this for now, we're going to come back and tend to let.

222
00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:52.550
Profile.

223
00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:53.990
All right.

224
00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:54.710
So that's good.

225
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:59.950
Next one, the last one, we're going to have a customized suit.

226
00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:04.790
So you and we should be able to customize the the site.

227
00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:11.810
For example, here admins will be able to upload updated the images and text on the homepage from within

228
00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:15.230
the dashboard, since it seems that is something we had to add.

229
00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:15.560
Right?

230
00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:18.590
So that ones are going to be here as well.

231
00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:19.930
Customize.

232
00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:29.260
That's going to be customized.

233
00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:32.580
And we call it.

234
00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:39.410
Awesome.

235
00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:41.830
I guess.

236
00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:43.840
I think we've got all the links we needed.

237
00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:44.740
Let's have a look.

238
00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:45.760
That looks good.

239
00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:49.590
All right, let me give a reverse.

240
00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:51.970
Okay.

241
00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:58.650
Pretty much all of them are open and all of them close at the same time because we're using the same

242
00:14:58.650 --> 00:14:59.160
keys.

243
00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:01.500
You can see submenu.

244
00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:02.700
It's also one.

245
00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.800
This is also one.

246
00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:08.130
So that's why they are behaving at the same time.

247
00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:14.130
So obviously we can fix that up by changing the keys to the end to do that, change the keys and then

248
00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.820
use the relevant icons here as well.

249
00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:20.280
So let's do that in the next video.
