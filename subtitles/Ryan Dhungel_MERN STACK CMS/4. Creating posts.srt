1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:16,140
And if you go to the plant, you can see at the moment we just gone to logging and showing the total

2
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:16,700
notification.

3
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,820
We're not redirecting our emptying it from the local stores.

4
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:21,210
All right.

5
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,130
So let me try.

6
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,540
So we got this post.

7
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:28,140
Okay.

8
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:30,660
So let's try saving it from this.

9
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,870
I guess it looks like we didn't get any response.

10
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,100
Let me double check.

11
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,710
Getting used in a different arc.

12
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:52,760
Obviously, I think we didn't import the categories model in the first controller, so it's important

13
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:52,970
that.

14
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:04,800
Model category.

15
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:05,340
All right.

16
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,450
So that's good.

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:14,190
Now, maybe one more thing we can do here that is showing some kind of for our learning, because it

18
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:15,210
might take a while.

19
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:20,190
It will take definitely 1/2, more than 1/2, because we have others delayed by 1/2.

20
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,750
So maybe we would show some kind of a learning, which is something we can work.

21
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:24,570
So let's try.

22
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,890
Most creative, successful, beautiful.

23
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:32,740
Okay, so that's good.

24
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:37,600
Let's have a look in the console and you can see her post published response and see the post has been

25
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,110
published.

26
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,330
It has been saved in the database.

27
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:46,870
We have got the unique ID categories array, the content created, posted.

28
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,430
Everything is yeah, beautiful.

29
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:50,370
Okay.

30
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:51,740
I want to have this one.

31
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,940
What do you want to do is you want to redirect the user to the old post office.

32
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:57,720
Okay.

33
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:04,350
And then in that page, we will make another request to our back in so that we can show the list of

34
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,170
posts, whatever.

35
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,870
How many has been created so far?

36
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,420
All that we can sort in this space.

37
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,070
I guess so.

38
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,540
Let's quickly redirect.

39
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,360
Let's undo that and let's try it now.

40
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:25,710
I think this time we will get an error because if I don't do anything and try to again create, that

41
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,360
will be a duplicate title.

42
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,860
So let's see how that works.

43
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:36,930
Now, if there is error, obviously the content will not be deleted from normal search, which is a

44
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:37,350
good thing.

45
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,460
So let's try.

46
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,380
So we didn't get any response.

47
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,330
So we got the error here.

48
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:57,660
Duplicate air we have, but for some reason we are error handling.

49
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,690
Supposed to work here if I don't exist.

50
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,130
All right, so I tried the console.log.

51
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:12,410
As you can see, I tried until all other exists and see what I get.

52
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,630
And I saw that we get not.

53
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,890
So that means true.

54
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,330
Already exist.

55
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:19,710
Not.

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,380
That means.

57
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:32,200
So if I try with this call, I'd get the oldest, not let me see it saying that it doesn't.

58
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,000
It's not there.

59
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:43,000
I think what happened here is that when I'm saving the posting in to here, I, I'm not giving slow.

60
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,720
So that is I think that's in the issue, which I forgot definite.

61
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:51,400
So let me use that slow, slow fire.

62
00:03:53,910 --> 00:04:02,460
Stanley I that so we didn't have to make it look this big a slog will always be low cost based on our

63
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:03,690
money.

64
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,410
Okay, so with this slot, I think in this time it works.

65
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:10,980
Let me just.

66
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,260
Try it one more time.

67
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,140
So let me remove that control of her hat.

68
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:20,070
Return.

69
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,180
Here, give a refresh.

70
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:27,840
Let's try.

71
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,840
Let's try to create this same post with the same token.

72
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,330
Post created successfully.

73
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,090
I think what happened is for the first time we didn't have the slug.

74
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,860
So probably that is the reason, though.

75
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,880
Let me try again.

76
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,470
Let's try a second first.

77
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:51,870
Okay.

78
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:52,780
What happened here?

79
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,110
Content for the second post was.

80
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:03,840
Thank you.

81
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:10,800
To pick some categories, let's try to save this and I'm going to create another one with the same name

82
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,050
just to give that a try from this.

83
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:14,010
Okay.

84
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,150
It has been created.

85
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:20,970
Now, let me go ahead and try creating the post with the same title.

86
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:28,520
It doesn't really mirror the categories and it's try to at least take now this time it looks like.

87
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:31,350
So what happened is for the very first time, because I didn't.

88
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:34,990
Use the slow.

89
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,160
There were some issues on the very first post, but now you can see this area is working and so that's

90
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:42,580
great.

91
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:50,740
And now when we create if I correct this by Ryan, let's have a look at this one more time.

92
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:59,410
So then the error, what if I get my ten at the time it works.

93
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:07,000
Now you noticed in one or 2/2 we have a bit of a pause now for better user experience.

94
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,630
Let's see.

95
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:14,980
So the lowering here so that when it is saving, we show some kind of a loading spinner so that the

96
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,600
user knows what's happening, right?

97
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,260
So at the moment everything else is looking good.

98
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:23,650
So let's close the files from this.

99
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:29,410
So here in the front end one more time, let's have one more state for learning.

100
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:39,910
Front loading said loading it would see use state funds.

101
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:48,510
Since we are redirected, we don't have to worry about setting it.

102
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:52,580
To false once again to when we handle it.

103
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,190
The first thing we do said learning.

104
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:55,670
True.

105
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:01,770
And then if there is error, then that time you want to set learning to false.

106
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,420
If there's error.

107
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:11,540
Now, but if it is successful, you don't have to do it because we are redirecting anyways.

108
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,070
Right.

109
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:15,560
Let me just come to love that one comment that up.

110
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:21,350
But if there is error again you are right so that learning to fox is beautiful.

111
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,600
Now we have this dynamic loading state.

112
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,010
We can put that in our boarding component, thankfully.

113
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,500
And that's part and component works.

114
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,360
Based on the learning.

115
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,050
So you didn't have to do anything extra.

116
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:41,310
Sit here and we do loading across the loading van from the state.

117
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,990
So if it is learning, it will serve the learning spinner and it will also disable the button.

118
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,080
Let's try the

119
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,730
second post.

120
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:04,290
From this title is taken.

121
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,520
Thank you.

122
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,370
And let's dig in now.

123
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:09,940
You didn't really see that.

124
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:14,640
But if I create three or three.

125
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,060
Let's focus.

126
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:25,040
You can see the lorry for a while and then we get redirected.

127
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,170
Beautiful.

128
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,450
So it's great to.

129
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,710
You have been able to.

130
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:37,210
Create a new post, save it in the database if you want to, you can take on the date of the sensor.

131
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:42,250
And so you logged in as this user.

132
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:47,540
Among the TV.

133
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:06,040
So the next thing we have to work on is probably.

134
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,860
The media fiction, which is very exciting.

135
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,620
It's similar to how it works with WordPress.

136
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,180
All right, so let's browse collections.

137
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:22,320
Posts.

138
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:29,970
You can see we have covered a post and just created what categories are is there.

139
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:31,350
Okay.

140
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,110
So.

141
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:41,830
Once we create, we are redirecting the user to the open space.

142
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:49,180
So in the open space we want to show a list of posts so that the admin can edit or delete.

143
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:49,600
Right.

144
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:56,410
And then obviously later we will be showing the post in the home for the post office.

145
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,690
We can put on the homepage as well if we want to.

146
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:01,090
And that's when you will see how this.

147
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:10,090
The categories are, how are you doing to actually show the category name instead of just tired?

148
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:15,650
So you basically you can use dot populate function in your back and that will give you all the information

149
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,150
based on this idea.

150
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:21,320
So we'll we'll check that out later.

151
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:29,030
I guess I didn't finally create one nice post and then we done for creating posts.

152
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:31,670
So.

153
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:41,080
Modern home interior.

154
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,700
I just found one image that is really nice.

155
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,680
I'm just going to

156
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,670
post that it is.

157
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,890
Let me put some code.

158
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,810
Let's try posting some code.

159
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:10,360
Using these code, we can create a post, send request to turn back

160
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,520
and base then.

161
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:17,320
All right.

162
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:25,630
And at the moment, it may actually put that image in the veterans images.

163
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:32,940
Okay.

164
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,820
So that image actually is not here.

165
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,270
Unfortunately I will say that.

166
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:44,910
Nice it is a bit later, but for now, let's work with this.

167
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,380
Okay.

168
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,510
So you can give it a caption as well.

169
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,460
Peace.

170
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,030
It's a slippery line that.

171
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:07,320
React.

172
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,780
Note Awesome.

173
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,780
Let's publish beautiful.

174
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,070
It has been created.

175
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,230
Now obviously we don't see it at the moment.

176
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:22,470
It's a very beautiful post with a very beautiful image, but obviously that that's coming in future

177
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,040
lessons.
