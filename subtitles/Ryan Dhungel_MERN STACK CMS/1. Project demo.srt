1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,650
So you can see here this is a learning base.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,280
Now, obviously, you can go crazy with the styling.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,230
I have focus on the features more than more than styling.

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:19,410
So I have just to use a photo with images and parallax theses full with images.

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,630
Here we have the counter.

6
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:28,990
They are representing the actual value, the what we have in the site.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,310
We have three categories at the moment, 11 posts, a few comments for users.

8
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,070
We have the light and dark theme as well.

9
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,790
You can see here is the light theme.

10
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,710
You can choose to dark theme.

11
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:50,810
Now I'm already logged in as and I am going to log out and as soon as I log out landed on the space.

12
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:56,120
And now you can see here this application is already deployed to the live service.

13
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,890
Feel free to take it out.

14
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:01,700
I will provide this email and password.

15
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,830
You can log in as an admin.

16
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,360
Have a look at the application.

17
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:10,340
Have a look at the dashboard, which is the most exciting feature of this whole project.

18
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:11,870
All right.

19
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:15,740
And you can also check out as author and subscriber has.

20
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,410
Now let's go through the front.

21
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,020
Let's see how this looks, looks and feels in the fondant.

22
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:29,570
And then probably in the next lecture, we will discover the back in the ad, which is absolutely incredible.

23
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:36,630
So if you are familiar with WordPress, it's very, very similar to that seems.

24
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:38,180
All right.

25
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:43,640
So we have this we have the section we were showing the latest blog post.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,040
We are showing all these categories that we have in our vacation.

27
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:51,320
So when you click on those categories, you land on a base symbol.

28
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,940
Let me click React.

29
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:59,910
You can see all these posts are in this category, React.

30
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,370
I saw quite a lot of post all these categories that we have.

31
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,320
You can browse them from here as well.

32
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:13,250
And we are showing the latest blog post, a few six of the most recent blog posts here.

33
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,460
So you can click here and visit the post as well.

34
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,060
Before we do that, let's come back to our friend Biz.

35
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:20,540
Yeah.

36
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,420
And by the way, this section you can control from the admin despot as well.

37
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,270
You can choose the image so you can see as the title subtitle.

38
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:31,880
You can do all that from the admin desk.

39
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,380
How good is that?

40
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,210
All right.

41
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,280
So this is the landing page.

42
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,900
Let's go to the post where you can choose the theme.

43
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,630
You can go to light mode.

44
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,290
Dark mode.

45
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,430
Now, this is text.

46
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,570
It is actually a dying dream come true.

47
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,470
You can see you'll be able to push the classroom.

48
00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:02,110
You'll be able to write reduced list items, tables.

49
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,650
You can embed images.

50
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:09,620
There are so many features, so many text formatting options I will be showing you in the next video

51
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,820
when we discover the back end of this application.

52
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,360
So you can see here.

53
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,090
I have to keep it absolutely simple.

54
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:27,360
I'm just showing the post images and the title, but obviously there is so much information on each

55
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,110
and every post.

56
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,480
So if you want to get some more information here.

57
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,550
But I decided to keep it simple.

58
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:38,280
So when they click, we will obviously show more information about each post to you.

59
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,610
So you can see here we have we are showing currently six at the moment.

60
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,050
We can use it, can click and load more if there are more post.

61
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,050
They will be loaded here.

62
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,380
So we have so far 1142.

63
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:55,120
So let's take out one of them, I guess.

64
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,790
So you can tell when you click on the post.

65
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,510
We land on this single post with where we show the images.

66
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,820
We still using the sidebar.

67
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,880
Now this sidebar, we can be more creative.

68
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,170
You can shoot Google ads so you can show some kind of a promotional item to you on the sidebar.

69
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,370
All right.

70
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:14,770
You can just take the full width for the images.

71
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,200
It's totally up to you.

72
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:20,340
You can see here the is blog post, have all this information.

73
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:23,310
So when it was created, how many comments are there?

74
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,560
You can see the comment section is here.

75
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,480
How many comments?

76
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,860
You know, which categories to this post belong to all these categories.

77
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,550
They are here.

78
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,410
They're clickable and created.

79
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:35,460
By which user?

80
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:41,820
So all this meta information is here and you will be able to share on the social networks as well.

81
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,010
Faith, email, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn.

82
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:53,100
Now, at the moment it works because we have the we are using the actual domain name.

83
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,490
So you would be able to share to the social networks as well.

84
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,290
All right.

85
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:02,130
And then we have this absolutely beautiful, rich, fixed editor.

86
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:07,800
You can see here using the list items to render the content.

87
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:11,930
Now, some other post may have some other content.

88
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,680
Just try this one.

89
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,410
This one has certain some other information.

90
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,420
So we have the heads to some list items.

91
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:25,510
Now this restricts Ed, I will be showing you in the next video in the ad when desperate, it is absolutely

92
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,500
a dream come true.

93
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:29,390
Okay.

94
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,580
So user can leave a comment if they logged in.

95
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,750
If not, they have to log in to leave a comment.

96
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,450
So this is how we displaying the post.

97
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:43,750
Users will be able to send an email to the site owner as well.

98
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:50,110
So this is similar to the standard contact form that you find in many websites.

99
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,420
So it's one of those and it works.

100
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:58,150
If you can fill out a name, email, some misses hit submit and admin will receive the email.

101
00:05:59,620 --> 00:05:59,920
All right.

102
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,340
So we have the lighting dark team as well.

103
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:07,030
Obviously, we have the signing and the sign up basis.

104
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:13,750
So let's explore the desperate by signing in as an admin.
