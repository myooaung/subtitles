1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:00,600
All right.

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:06,450
So we created this control function that will give us all the data post user comments categories which

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,530
we get like this.

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,200
So based on this data, we can display them.

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,010
We will display that in the homepage as we will later.

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,290
But for the moment, let's just show it in the admin desk full.

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,780
So here is the landing page for the admin.

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,210
This is where I want to display that information.

9
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,670
Let's go to admin client pages.

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,590
Admin index.

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,230
See here, we don't have anything at the moment.

12
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:36,930
To hear.

13
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:37,890
What I want to do is.

14
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:38,790
I want to.

15
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:52,330
First make a request to back in to get all those numbers right so I can use you to fit booklets.

16
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,840
Import duty free.

17
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:56,430
Um.

18
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:00,980
Use a state.

19
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,050
We are.

20
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,630
Then for destroying the dollar.

21
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:19,350
We need to import rows and columns from and row column.

22
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,660
Actually, we're not using layouts.

23
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,950
Let's assume that.

24
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,520
So I mean, what is there?

25
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:39,290
We don't really need the context here since we have to use that link, we should be using link.

26
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:48,010
From the next link, that is to make it clickable.

27
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,960
So you take it to the finish project.

28
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:57,760
You can see here we have the postcard user and the admin clicks here we take them to our post feeds

29
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:02,230
and if the two categories we take them to category space.

30
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,290
I guess it's just a list to make things easier.

31
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:09,470
All right.

32
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,530
So we have the link as well now letting products use

33
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:16,370
it.

34
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:21,650
Now it's doing that and here and it's huge, huge effect.

35
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:28,040
And when we get the data we can put in the states first, actually we can start from the state step

36
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:37,160
concert numbers that numbers to use state.

37
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,310
Physical object and use effect.

38
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:55,480
We use this to make a request so we can write a function here called Get Numbers.

39
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:07,240
And we can borrow that from down here and get number sequence to it's a function.

40
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,240
Let's make this function async

41
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:15,490
tri

42
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,560
count error.

43
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:32,250
No, the error here we make a request using excuse punched dollar equals to wait excuse to get we make

44
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,850
a gift request to slice.

45
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:41,980
The numbers that we give us all the data and we put that in the state said numbers to symbolize that.

46
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,320
Okay.

47
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,510
Now we can return.

48
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:51,910
So let's use the go inside rule.

49
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,010
Let's use column.

50
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,050
Column.

51
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,000
Let's use.

52
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,790
So we have the four items.

53
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,230
We getting these four items so we can display them like this.

54
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,340
One, two, three, four.

55
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,110
So 12 column grid.

56
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,370
We can divide two.

57
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,490
Six.

58
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:14,890
It's six.

59
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,210
It's.

60
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,000
Actually not six is 12.

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,970
It's because we want 12 to 24.

62
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,920
And then I know the road to a trifle.

63
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,490
First, let's give a bit of a heading here.

64
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:38,450
So in this column, the first column, actually first row, we can use full width for the heading.

65
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:42,950
Give full width.

66
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,480
24 and then here.

67
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:49,520
We can use another component from and that is called divider.

68
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,480
I guess that looks something like some kind of horizontal line.

69
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,100
Divide it and we're going to use that here.

70
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,800
The further inside here.

71
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,110
It's right.

72
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,950
Let's give it a heading.

73
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,070
It's statistics that.

74
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,650
It's reload is.

75
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,930
You got some issued FS.

76
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,700
Why is that?

77
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:28,810
I mean.

78
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:37,720
Okay so sometimes fiscal tries to you know auto import so that's that's an right we shouldn't be importing

79
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,090
anything from so let's remove that.

80
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:43,890
Get no mercy, you.

81
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:46,010
Awesome.

82
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:46,450
All right.

83
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,090
So we have the heading now underneath that.

84
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,620
Let's create another rule.

85
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,820
And inside this room is critical.

86
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,990
Again, he's quoting, We used to spend spend two.

87
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:10,090
And we can get rid of hostile Israel style

88
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:13,470
Amazon.

89
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:19,570
Top 100 Text Alliance Center.

90
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:28,210
Font size with his trim.

91
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,160
Again in this column.

92
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,010
We want to show the numbers.

93
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:38,060
So, for example, to show the post numbers.

94
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,230
Numbers that post.

95
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,060
It will be posts with this.

96
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:53,610
Okay.

97
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,500
So we get the number 30 now.

98
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:03,660
What I want is I want some kind of the circle, something like that for that student.

99
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,590
Not just that we want this to calm down, start the countdown.

100
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,760
Because if you notice.

101
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:16,460
You land on that for the very first time, you see the numbers start going down from one to whatever

102
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:16,880
that is.

103
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:17,180
All right.

104
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,390
So for that, you can see.

105
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,690
For that, we can use this library, it's called.

106
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:30,510
Now this one is called Let's Google It.

107
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,700
Rendered progress.

108
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:38,860
I think this once and then we act render

109
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:42,400
progress.

110
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:55,140
Actually, it's not a bean bag, as I used a indigenous component.

111
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,200
And then they have this component called progress.

112
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,720
So I use them.

113
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,870
I guess this is the one I use.

114
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,530
So let's see how we can use this to make it something like this.

115
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,000
You can make it nice.

116
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,070
Give it a beautiful color, Israel.
