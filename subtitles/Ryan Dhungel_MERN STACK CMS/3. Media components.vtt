1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:00.690
All right.

2
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:06.840
So let's go ahead and create these two components for library and add new.

3
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.850
So in the media suite, we actually don't have the media fully.

4
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.550
Let's create that one inside admin.

5
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.150
Before the media.

6
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:31.910
And you said you we're going to have one final call index studies which will be available as a route.

7
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.760
Less ad means less media.

8
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:35.690
So that will be there.

9
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.260
So basically here we're going to import those two components.

10
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.370
So create another one file.

11
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.960
Let's call it media library.

12
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.840
And the next one we call it.

13
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.150
Upload.

14
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.390
We just got it.

15
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.850
Media.

16
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.120
So a profile of your friend Curtis.

17
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.970
All right, so let's import.

18
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.060
React

19
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:18.360
concert.

20
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.100
Fun return.

21
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.340
Let me just written some text for the moment.

22
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.300
So we just return.

23
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.660
Upload five.

24
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.560
All right, so give me the scope of this one.

25
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.300
Go to media library based here and change this to.

26
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.930
Media Center.

27
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.800
All right.

28
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.230
So we got these two components.

29
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.030
Now let's bring them here in the index 20th.

30
00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.880
Now, when I bring them here, I will use the term from and design.

31
00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.880
So that looks something like that.

32
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.640
So you can see we have the depth.

33
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.670
So first step, upload files, just have the button.

34
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.320
Second one, the media library.

35
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.930
We have all the photos.

36
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.860
So we use this step to keep both of these components there.

37
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:39.420
And then we can basically import this this component in and put in the admin.

38
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:49.180
Post new ways to get old media to open up to the media and access from the library.

39
00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.110
Let's import React

40
00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.690
and let's import these two files.

41
00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.040
We created upload file from

42
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.490
upload file and then upload media library.

43
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:26.650
Now we are also going to need to import and isn't so deb deps from and and then we have to destructor

44
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.920
deb.

45
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.660
Ben.

46
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.380
Ben, that thing from Taps.

47
00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:38.110
Okay.

48
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.500
Now we can write a component goes media equals to

49
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.030
return to.

50
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.560
We want to return taps.

51
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:53.570
Inside.

52
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.710
We're going to have a tap in to Devin and then Devin

53
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.150
will close.

54
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:11.040
I.

55
00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.550
So here we're going to show the components of the first tab.

56
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.080
We're going to upload file.

57
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.580
So tap in depth.

58
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.560
Give the tab name and we call it upload file.

59
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.410
Fine to call it.

60
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.580
I think we can operate more than one find and the key one.

61
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.990
Now, let me just copy that.

62
00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:38.550
Put it down.

63
00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.270
This one, we call it our media library.

64
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.570
Key to.

65
00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.200
Intense component to media libraries.

66
00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.400
All right.

67
00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:02.720
Now, you can see we created these two components and then we bring them here in this index to this,

68
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:12.380
I guess we have the tab and that has the two pens and these showing these two components.

69
00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.440
Now let's explore.

70
00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:35.810
And let's import this one in admin new so that we can show the media which contains these two components.

71
00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.930
So here it's going to.

72
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.440
To do two step.

73
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.070
Components media.

74
00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:58.030
All right.

75
00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:59.650
So import.

76
00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.610
And then basically we want to show this now inside our model.

77
00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.880
So let's remove this text.

78
00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:13.120
Instead, we use that media component, simple as that.

79
00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.460
So that's going to try.

80
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:30.980
Module not found online allowing me to donate to.

81
00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.420
So we are here to be one step up.

82
00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:38.430
To step up.

83
00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:39.120
Three step.

84
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.860
Get into it component.

85
00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:51.870
Okay.

86
00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.250
So what is happening here?

87
00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:56.680
Components media.

88
00:06:58.630 --> 00:06:59.170
Okay.

89
00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:07.090
I think what we did is we supposed to have these these fights, media, library, the media, the whole

90
00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:11.890
folder supposed to be inside components, but until we put them in the pages.

91
00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:14.140
So what you can do, you can just click and drag.

92
00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:19.300
If you're using voice call, if you're using some other editor, you can just go do your folder and

93
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.320
manually move.

94
00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:22.420
I get to click, you can click and drag.

95
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.950
So let's move that to inside compliance.

96
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:30.590
Okay.

97
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:36.010
So I moved media to components.

98
00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:37.220
I can see here.

99
00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.050
I say everything is same.

100
00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:46.860
We just moved media folder from pages from here to compliance.

101
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Okay, let's try now.

102
00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:53.840
Okay, good.

103
00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:00.390
Now, when you create, you can see this media model upload files, media library.

104
00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:03.300
Beautiful.
