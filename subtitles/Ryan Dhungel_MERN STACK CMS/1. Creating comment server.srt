1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,020
All right.

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,440
So now we're going to work on the comment system.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,850
So it's post users should be able to post a comment.

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:13,050
So for example, we can click to view the the post.

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,930
All right, so here we got the post post content.

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:22,710
And here down here we want to have the comment section and then we show you the finished.

7
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,260
And how it's done.

8
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,330
So we go to.

9
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:30,550
Post.

10
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:34,690
It's visit post and then.

11
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:40,180
You can see down here, we have comment section two user can leave a comment.

12
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,530
And we saw the the existing comment.

13
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:44,500
All right.

14
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:47,530
So this is how we came to implement Common System.

15
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,270
So let's work on this one.

16
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,360
So first thing I want to do is work in the back end.

17
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,730
Create a comment more.

18
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:07,170
Create a right and controller function so that we can come back to our frontend, create a form so that

19
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,800
the user can post a comment, something about this like a simple form with a button.

20
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:19,610
So when user enter something here, we take that comment and send it to the back end so that we can

21
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,440
see in the database.

22
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:27,410
I guess that's the first step, creating a comment, saving in the database, and then later on we will

23
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:34,460
display the comments and then we will allow the admin to delete the comments because some point as an

24
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,460
admin you may need to delete all the user's comments.

25
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,590
Some sometimes they could be offensive.

26
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:39,890
Right.

27
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:47,300
So admin will be able to see all the comment and delete and at the same time the user, whoever posted

28
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:52,520
those comments, they should be able to view these comments in their dashboard and they should be able

29
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,050
to update and delete.

30
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:54,830
All right.

31
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,800
So let's start from the backend.

32
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:06,170
Let's create a more comment model, root and controller function so that we can send the comment from

33
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:09,110
the front end and start saving in the back end.

34
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:11,600
All right.

35
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,630
So let me just go to our backend.

36
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,640
So let's collapse this one.

37
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:27,570
It's good models with a new file and it's called comment dirties.

38
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,660
And here we create a schema.

39
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:37,390
Let's go to category and let's copy this so that we save some time.

40
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:39,240
Come here.

41
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,590
This that in and turn this to.

42
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,630
Let's call it a common schema.

43
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,570
So it's common to.

44
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,430
We'll have the content.

45
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,360
Okay.

46
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,210
So let's call it content.

47
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:02,290
So its content will be the type of string and it is required.

48
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,140
You can set the the maximum length.

49
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:08,840
All right.

50
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,140
So for example, let's say maximum is

51
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,970
20,000 characters.

52
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,580
I guess so we can send the max length as well.

53
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,040
And then.

54
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,490
We win.

55
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:29,790
We want to have the posted right feel so that we know who posted the comment and that is something we

56
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,120
have done in post as well before.

57
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,470
So something like this.

58
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,220
Let's copy that based here.

59
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,140
So I'm detecting.

60
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,120
We need to have the object ready.

61
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,680
That is something we can do.

62
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,120
Structure from memory schema.

63
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,230
So it's copying that.

64
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,290
There's to.

65
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:56,790
All right.

66
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,310
So we got the content, we got the poster by.

67
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:09,000
And we also want to know the post I.D. So each comment will not be the individual comment on its own.

68
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,700
They will always belong to a certain post.

69
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,120
Right.

70
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:16,500
So that means we need to know which comment belongs to which post.

71
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,040
Right.

72
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:23,740
So we need to have the post some kind of reference to the post so we can let's call it post 80.

73
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,790
Again, this one, we do the type of object I.D. and it will refer to the post model.

74
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,010
So it is time we save the comment.

75
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,050
We want to have some content.

76
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,810
We need to know who created the post.

77
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:42,780
So logged in users ID and the post date so which post this comment belongs to.

78
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,760
So that post idea to win it.

79
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,990
And that is all we want for the comment.

80
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,190
All that's so that's a whole comment scheme.

81
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,050
Now let's go to Roberts, create a comment.

82
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:58,690
Randazzo.

83
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:05,250
Well, actually, actually, we can put it all in the post because comments basically will be the part

84
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:05,880
of the Post.

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,240
All right.

86
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:16,650
So let's leave a comment in comment and then here, let's create a post wrote surrounded a dot post

87
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,510
to save the comment.

88
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,960
We can create a.

89
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:30,730
I wrote called Comments Less Bush Style so we can send the post at the request forums and to quit my

90
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,320
comment.

91
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:34,260
We need the logged in user, so we want that malware.

92
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:40,710
Can create, read and create compliance.

93
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:45,450
So quick comment again, creatively, let me just have a look at that mirror.

94
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,590
Actually, we don't need that email.

95
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,570
We can create read.

96
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:00,500
This familiar basic tactics if the users add mint are awesome, but in this case for the comment, anyone

97
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,110
any logged in user will be able to leave a comment.

98
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,710
It doesn't have to be admin also, so we don't need this maneuver.

99
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:11,650
All right.

100
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:16,140
So let's go with this quick comment control function.

101
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,900
And controllers forced.

102
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,230
It's right here.

103
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:31,670
Export accounts create comment equals to async.

104
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,830
So we can use try

105
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,470
quotes and.

106
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:55,780
So yeah, what we want is we want to create a comment.

107
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,990
So for that, let's make sure we have the comment module on top.

108
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,200
Comment from.

109
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:12,960
Comment

110
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,510
I just saw too great a comment.

111
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:23,170
What we can do is first, we need a couple of things.

112
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:29,290
We need the post and we need the comment comments content which should be coming in.

113
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:34,450
The request body to that is something we can access as requests more detailed content, right?

114
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:42,040
And then we create new comment using the new keyword and we give all these values that are necessary

115
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,820
to query comment.

116
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:50,260
For example, the content posted value should be the log to News Society and then the post, which will

117
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,290
be the added that is coming in the request params.

118
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,060
And then we save and we send it as it is in response.

119
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:00,010
Beautiful.

120
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,250
So that's how we can create a comment.

121
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:14,110
So we created the model row and the function that this event means we should be able to create a comment.

122
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,290
We just need to send it from the front.

123
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:17,710
Right.

124
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:18,400
So let's see.

125
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,450
We have some error.

126
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,150
Cannot override category model.

127
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,370
So looks like we have had some.

128
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,960
Cannot override.

129
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,080
Controllers post the swarm.

130
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,290
Controls post.

131
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,560
Let's go back to our model carnival.

132
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,670
So we still have to link category to this to comment.

133
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:09,000
Okay, so we got an error, so it should be good in our back.

134
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,130
And let's head over to our funding so that we can start creating the comment.
