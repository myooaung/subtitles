00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:00.750
All right.

2
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.210
So here, let's show the list of comments.

3
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:04.980
Let's zoom on this one.

4
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.300
Let's use the list component from and let's make sure we have that.

5
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.470
We don't include its import list.

6
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.760
So here we use lists

7
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:38.850
and lists takes the item layout, horizontal data shows comments.

8
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.050
Part of what we have in the state write render items.

9
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:58.230
So we get his comment, we can call it an item and then we render in list, item, list, item.

10
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.670
So here we want to shoot at it and do.

11
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:05.600
Dobson Right.

12
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.610
So we can show them as excellence.

13
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.840
That'll be an array of items.

14
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.090
Edit and delete and then.

15
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:16.660
Inside here.

16
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:27.700
We'll be showing the comment information from a list list item don't matter.

17
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:38.310
So here we can show the comment, description, description to what we want to do here is we want to

18
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.000
show that this command belongs to which post.

19
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.290
Right.

20
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.850
So we want to show that.

21
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:57.660
So what we can do here is we try to access the post title to which this comment belongs to, and it's

22
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:03.540
common to have the post information so we can access that using item what?

23
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.340
Don't post I.D. what dot title?

24
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.020
So we can access that.

25
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:20.400
Let's use this separate widget on top of the enter key and a keyboard and then we can show the name

26
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.340
whoever created this title, the post item dot.

27
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.870
Sorry, this one is the name of the user who left the comment.

28
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.600
So item which is a comment.

29
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.460
So item posted by dart name.

30
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.180
So we can just use the question mark.

31
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.110
So if for some reason this user, if there's an issue, we will not get the error.

32
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.510
All right.

33
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.640
So belongs to this post title by this user.

34
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:08.690
And then we can show the created data as well when this comment was posted.

35
00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.320
Right.

36
00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:11.420
So we can do that using

37
00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:15.770
item dart.

38
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.070
Sorry, using this.

39
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:23.330
Jesus.

40
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.350
I don't.

41
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.420
Create to that from now, and we can choose this from it.

42
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:40.300
L l d This one I used, I don't know exactly remember how it disappeared, but we can obviously have

43
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.750
a look here.

44
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:43.750
Five comments.

45
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.430
Don't see any comment listed here.

46
00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:57.790
Cuts of the item.

47
00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:58.600
Note items.

48
00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:59.140
Item.

49
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.380
They just are defense and makes you have that.

50
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.930
And we need to import that relative time.

51
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.970
They just plug in stress related to.

52
00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.770
So no, this one is not related.

53
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:49.730
And this is something we used earlier to render the comment when it was clear to use that this one is

54
00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.350
a localized format.

55
00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:52.030
All right.

56
00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.030
So we tried this from contest

57
00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.200
localized format.

58
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.880
It looks to.

59
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.030
Require busiest plowing in localized format.

60
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.610
I think it might still work.

61
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.300
The impulse index from let's try this.

62
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.090
Imports.

63
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:32.410
And then we use this as a blocking so they just don't extend localized from it.

64
00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.780
All right.

65
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.380
So that's the format I used here.

66
00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.540
This is a localized format.

67
00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:41.930
All right.

68
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:51.520
Okay.

69
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.880
So from now is not a function from now.

70
00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.730
Thank you.

71
00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:03.490
Just since we are using this local as foreman, I think that's not the right one.

72
00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:04.870
It should be format.

73
00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:08.260
Format.

74
00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.040
So far.

75
00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:24.930
I dug it beautifully and here we are showing this in the localized format in gives us the full time

76
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.280
in the the the time and PM whatever the exact time.

77
00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:30.900
That's great.

78
00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.010
Now, here you saw two different ways of rendering the.

79
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.830
The comments.

80
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.600
We have 35 comments.

81
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:45.320
Let's add a few more and then let's implement business and as.

82
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:52.580
Now I noticed we have on undefined so let's see what is then on.

83
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.390
Item dot four sided title.

84
00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:57.860
So we're not getting that.

85
00:06:58.930 --> 00:06:59.580
We'll stay.

86
00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:05.920
Let's have a look.

87
00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.950
Maybe our popularity is number one.

88
00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:08.970
Not working.

89
00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:19.950
It's good to comptroller's post getting on the comment post and we are populating title and slug.

90
00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.270
I think it's very we should console.log him.

91
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.210
The response that we got comments.

92
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.350
So you've got five comments.

93
00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.380
Let's have a look on understand, ma'am.

94
00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.300
So on the on on the stand.

95
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:51.130
So on this one, it's working only on the last two wounded.

96
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:52.700
Last two.

97
00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.980
So posted titled.

98
00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:58.660
We got that for the first three.

99
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.340
The last two.

100
00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:04.870
Okay.

101
00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:11.850
So last 2 minutes when we were trying to create the comment, I think the first time when we were trying

102
00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:12.520
that time.

103
00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:17.860
I think we send the comments without the full status that that is the reason.

104
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:18.850
I think that's right.

105
00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:26.680
So from Noah, anytime you've created works this one, if you don't want to, you can do it from the

106
00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.360
database as well if you want to.

107
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.170
But you can see it's working now.

108
00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:33.040
This doesn't work yet.

109
00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:41.140
Business doesn't work yet, but we are able to render the list of comments before we work on the pagination

110
00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.430
and in the search.

111
00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:50.830
Let's create a few more comments so that we have plenty of comments to try to try our business.

112
00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:51.940
So let's try this one.

113
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:54.880
It's good in your comment.

114
00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:56.710
Hey.

115
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:04.570
Now we can

116
00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.070
leave comments.

117
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:13.690
Let me also create some comments by a different user.

118
00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:19.790
Let me call you as different user.

119
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.450
Ryan Awesome.

120
00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:29.700
Its views on post.

121
00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:48.870
Let's go back.

122
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:50.490
Let's go try one more.

123
00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:51.690
Let's try this one.

124
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:03.530
Okay.

125
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:04.860
So we got a few comments.

126
00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:12.420
Let me just put some some random stuff so that we can do it later.

127
00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:21.770
All right, so let's close this.

128
00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:25.820
Come back to our admin dashboard.

129
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:29.510
Go to the comments.

130
00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:36.080
He's still getting six comments because that's how many we get.

131
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:37.610
On the first request.

132
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:42.860
To get more than that, we have to work on the pads in a similar moment, so let's see how we can implement

133
00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:43.220
that.
