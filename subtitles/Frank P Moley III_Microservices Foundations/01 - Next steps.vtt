00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.010
- Throughout this course I aim

2
00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.090
to give you the base foundation of microservices.

3
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.000
Let's revisit what we have discussed.

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.020
We started our discussion with the history of microservices

5
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.030
and some of the major milestone architectures

6
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.060
in the history of this space.

7
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.050
We discussed some of the key benefits

8
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.080
of the microservices architecture,

9
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.090
as well as some of the risks you need to mitigate.

10
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.060
We introduced the concept of cloud native

11
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.070
and how it relates to microservices.

12
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.010
I then introduced a few key elements

13
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.010
of the architecture itself,

14
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.090
including the services, the communication patterns

15
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.080
between those services,

16
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.060
the concept of enentual consistency,

17
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.060
and finally the API layer.

18
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.020
We then looked at some more advanced concepts

19
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.090
of the architecture, including asynchronous messaging,

20
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.090
logging and tracing, CICD as a requirement,

21
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.080
and finally we spent a little time

22
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.080
looking at a couple hybrid architectures.

23
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.050
We wrapped up the course talking about

24
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.020
the architectural and cultural choices

25
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.050
you need to address when moving into this model.

26
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.020
All in all, I've shared with you

27
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.060
an introductory journey into microservices.

28
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.050
I've offered you a taste based on my experiences,

29
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.020
but there is a wealth of information out there.

30
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.070
I would encourage you to continue learning

31
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.090
and forming your own opinions

32
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.010
on what are the most important aspects.

33
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.000
One of the things that I have noticed

34
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.010
about people discussing this architecture pattern

35
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.080
is the passion for sharing knowledge with each other.

36
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.030
I would encourage you to read more

37
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.070
and listen to some of the thought leaders in this space.

38
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.080
There are a lot of them, and you can peruse my Twitter list

39
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.030
to see who I'm listening to.

40
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.060
I want to thank you for your time in this course.

41
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.060
It means a lot to me to have spent this time with you

42
00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.060
even virtually.

43
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.090
My commitment does not end when this course is over.

44
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.060
I respond to requests on Twitter and Stack Overflow

45
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.080
on all of my content here

46
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.040
or any other public platform I present on.

47
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.000
I love learning and sharing knowledge,

48
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
so please reach out to me with questions or ideas.
