00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.000
- The world of software is on fire

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.060
with various discussions around microservices architecture.

3
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.070
Any conference you go to,

4
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.000
any architect you follow on Twitter,

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.080
or any other medium where you engage

6
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.080
with established software architects,

7
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.020
you will hear about microservices.

8
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.060
Hi, my name is Frank Moley,

9
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.040
and I'm a software, technology, and security architect

10
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.020
with significant time in all aspects

11
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.090
of the software development lifecycle.

12
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.000
I have been engaged with web and service-based architectures

13
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.060
for quite some time now,

14
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.040
and have experienced many different hot topics

15
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.010
in this arena.

16
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.000
No other architecture pattern

17
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.090
has given me as much excitement as microservices has.

18
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.020
This architecture aims to solve the global challenges

19
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.090
that today's businesses face,

20
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.070
as well as promote patterns of distribution,

21
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.030
agility, and scalability needed in today's world.

22
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.030
We're asked to do more with fewer resources

23
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.060
each and every day,

24
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.070
and microservices answers many of these needs,

25
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.090
but it does come with a cost.

26
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.010
In this course, we'll start with a brief history

27
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.000
of software architectures for enterprise

28
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.050
and internet-based systems.

29
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.030
We'll dig into the three biggest patterns

30
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.080
that have emerged over the last 10 to 15 years,

31
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.090
the monolithic N-tier architectures,

32
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.080
the advent of service-oriented architecture or SOA,

33
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.030
and the new hotness, microservices.

34
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.080
We'll then talk about the services themselves

35
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.010
and how to determine the boundaries between services.

36
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.060
As we discuss microservices and the core concepts

37
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.020
about the architecture, I'll provide you

38
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.020
the basic information you need to make

39
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.050
educated decisions about how your system

40
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.080
can leverage the key concepts.

41
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.080
After we have a footing on the core concepts,

42
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.000
I'll dig into more advanced areas of the architecture,

43
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.030
including event-based, asynchronous communications,

44
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.040
tracing and logging in the system,

45
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.040
and various hybrid architectures.

46
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.010
We'll finish up looking at the architecture choices

47
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.040
you need to make, design considerations,

48
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.030
managing the trade-offs,

49
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.020
and the need for edge services

50
00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.090
using real-world examples.

51
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.050
I will also talk a little about the importance

52
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.050
of a DevOps-type culture when moving into this architecture.

53
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.060
This course will be fast-paced

54
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.010
and loaded with industry examples,

55
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.080
my personal experiences, and industry best practices.

56
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.080
This in-depth conversation will leave you

57
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.040
with a solid foundation for you

58
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.020
and your team to make decisions

59
00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.080
about moving to this architectural model,

60
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.000
so let's get started.
