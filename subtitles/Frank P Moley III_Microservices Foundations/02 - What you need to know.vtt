00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.080
- Making the move to microservices is no easy task.

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.020
It takes a team effort and buy-in from the entire team

3
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.030
in order to make this migration successful.

4
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.050
This course is designed for everyone involved

5
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.020
in the software development lifecycle.

6
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.030
For the managers and directors,

7
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.060
this course should provide you with the basic knowledge

8
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.070
of why the work associated with microservices

9
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.040
may be worth it.

10
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.050
I'll provide you some of the benefits of this architecture

11
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.020
and some of the challenges your team may encounter

12
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.090
all while focusing on where your team

13
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.040
and bottom line will be positively impacted

14
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.050
by moving to this architecture.

15
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.010
Because moving to this pattern

16
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.070
really takes everyone's buy-in,

17
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.090
yours is very critical for obvious reasons.

18
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.030
While the non-technical manager

19
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.010
may not understand all of the ins and outs of the pattern,

20
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.050
there's a clear value in understanding the basics

21
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.050
so you can properly empower your teams

22
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.060
to do the work needed.

23
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.060
To my fellow architects,

24
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.020
this course should be a great starting point

25
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.050
in looking at this pattern.

26
00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.070
While I cannot deliver all of the information you'll need

27
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.090
in order to make the appropriate decisions

28
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.060
when migrating to this architectural model,

29
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.030
I can provide you a good baseline

30
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.070
to supplement your existing knowledge base.

31
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.090
You'll be exposed to the most core concepts of microservices

32
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.060
in a way that allows you to start asking the right questions

33
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.010
in order to make the best decisions possible

34
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.020
for your organization.

35
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.000
You'll also be made aware of the challenges you'll face

36
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.020
so you can react to them more quickly.

37
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.010
For the developers out there,

38
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.080
this course should provide you with a great foundation

39
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.000
to explain why you're writing the code the way that you are.

40
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.070
You'll be exposed to the overall concepts of the pattern

41
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.070
in a way that provides you with insight

42
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.050
into the questions that should immediately come up

43
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.000
when trying to solve real-world problems.

44
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.020
You'll also be exposed

45
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.020
to some new ways of thinking about writing software

46
00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.030
in a globally distributed marketplace.

47
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.050
While I won't focus

48
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.030
on how-to aspects of writing microservices,

49
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.010
most modern languages have frameworks and patterns

50
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.050
for delivering RESTful services

51
00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.030
that will be used in this architecture.

52
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.090
No matter your role,

53
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.030
in order to be successful in this course,

54
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.070
you just need to have a desire to learn

55
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.000
and some basic knowledge of software development.

56
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.050
As a developer or architect,

57
00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.010
you should have some fundamental knowledge

58
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.090
of software composition and decomposition.

59
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.050
You need to understand basic remote network calls over HTTP

60
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.010
in order to grasp some of the complexities

61
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.040
associated with a microservices architecture.

62
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.000
With that said, let's jump into some history.
