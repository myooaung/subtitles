00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
in every program we may have toe load the driver.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.800
We may also have to open a connection because through this connection,

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.320
only you will be able tow,

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.150
send our SQL statement toe,

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.440
be executed on the server side and get the results as well.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.350
In order to simplify our task,

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:24.930
let us create a new class over here called DB Util that actually simplifies this test so I

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.160
can reuse the same thing.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.610
So I'm gonna right click on my package New class.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.100
I'm gonna call it us BB Util Click finish.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.890
Typically,

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.080
Util classes are going to be final so that you don't want to inherit this on all the

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.680
functions are going to be a static in nature so you can call them using the class name and

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.890
not creating an object.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.160
You also would like to make this constructor as private,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.350
so I'm going to say your private debut till on not having any court in that.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.710
So the idea is that you will not be able to create an object because it's a private

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.020
constructor as well as you cannot inherit and create an object off subclass because it is

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.470
final.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.770
Most of the util classes are like this.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:10.820
As an example,

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.670
you can look a job order language.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:13.250
Matt.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.220
It is a final class.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.940
It has a private constructor,

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.680
So the only way you can make it off Matt functions are by calling matt dot their function

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.150
names.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.430
The only function I want to write here is supposed to be a public static.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.610
It's a post or it on a connection object that's called us get connection and I'll just say

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:35.500
return.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.080
No.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.180
For the time being,

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.490
I haven't imported this connection.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.840
So that's why the editor you can actually press command,

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.870
shift all our control shift on windows and you can see it is automatically important.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:49.740
No,

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:57.270
I can actually copy the court that we used over here on then probably put that in this

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.380
particular class.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.640
So instead,

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.230
off creating and designing toe this particular variable,

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.820
I can simply say here,

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.590
return the return value off that I don't need this return not lower here.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.890
Let's former this by pressing command shift F or controlled shift F one windows.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.570
So we have all this.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.560
Now the class start for name is actually causing a problem once again.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.490
Instead of handling the exception I can throw it away from year.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.750
So wherever I'm going to call this function,

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.650
that would be in the best connection on all other programs.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:30.960
I may have 200.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.880
Same thing I'm gonna do for this.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.460
Also,

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.850
as they are throws declarations for SQL exception.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.730
Now that I have this function,

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.720
I can delete all these lines.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.150
Of course.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.690
Over here on in this place,

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.410
I can say dvu till dot Get connection.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.140
Andi saved this.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.510
Of course,

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.030
I don't need these unused imports.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.280
I can press again.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.570
Command shift.

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.710
All to remove are organized imports.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.090
You can see that it's all gone.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.320
Save this.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.730
It is your d beautiful dot Get connection is not phone.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.850
That's probably because you can see it is not safe.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:12.700
You can say all the open files by pressing command shift s and now we see the other is gone

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.040
so far under court,

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.570
I should still get the same thing.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:16.540
As you can see,

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.950
I got the same result.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.610
One last thing that we will do as far as debut.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:26.390
Tillis is concerned that I don't want this to be hard ported in my program because tomorrow

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:33.000
if I have to change the name off the user or password or the driver or a U R How?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.450
Come on change this.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.160
Which means I have toe rebuild my application.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.330
So that is why it is a good idea.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.070
Toe externalize thes strings in tow,

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.940
a property file.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:49.360
So the way you can do is you can clear that property file under either SRC directly are

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.850
cord out.

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.170
We know the folder.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.000
If he used the court dot with full dollar package,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.750
then you have to refer to that as a package member.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:58.630
So anyway,

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.040
let's go and give the same thing.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.850
So I'm gonna right click on this package.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:08.940
I'm gonna go give the name off this file as jelly bc dot properties The extension is

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:09.600
important.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.360
Jerry busy their properties Kerrigan type driver.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.290
Last name equals two or colon.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.320
And then it is our dart hits two dot driver.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.240
I can type your ur equals to one of the U.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.490
N.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.200
That we have been using over here.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.220
So there's the urine.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.330
Do not copy the double courts You The name equals two.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.050
We don't password equals toe secret.

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.470
Save this file.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.350
Close this now.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.940
I don't want any of these things to be hardcore did over here.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:49.800
So this is where I can say something like resource bundle R B equals toe resource bundle

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.080
dot get bundle and then we have to give the base name.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.050
If the property file is inside a package,

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.050
then you have to use the package name like this on.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.130
We only have to give the base name,

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.670
not the complete name.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:11.860
So we know how this RB representing the content off JBC Properties file now I can say

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.560
you're I don't want this,

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.120
but I can say are we don't get string.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.770
And the key is driver class name.

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.550
That is the key used in jail BBC dot properties file Over here.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.380
The remaining ones,

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.640
probably I can use them directly over here are definitely I can say you're RB.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.450
Don't get string off.

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.500
You are in probably.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.800
I can copy this and based over here,

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:45.140
this is gonna be user name and this is the password.

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:51.530
So make sure that the keys are matching the one that you have given already in the

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:51.980
properties.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:52.300
Five.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:59.120
So let's say all the files on then run this court once more to see if our connection is

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.850
successful.

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.560
So executive,

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.110
you can say I got the same thing.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.910
But if you go to the properties and then type your little a spell mistakes so password is

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:08.300
wrong.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.390
If I run the program again,

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:12.130
I should get an exception on.

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.400
The exception would be very clear about wrong user name.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.320
Our password,

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:17.600
of course.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.420
The other messages come from the underlying database management system.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:22.220
In our case,

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.600
it is hitched to If you use a different database such as my SQL our oracle,

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.940
the adult messages would be probably different.

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.860
Let's go fix the problem.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.770
Remove that extra e,

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:37.930
save it around the program and everything is OK now.

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:39.850
So that's all for the lecture.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:41.430
In the next lecture,

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:45.150
let's try the Creator table using our application.
