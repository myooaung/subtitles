00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
now that we know how to execute a still select statement and get the records and handle the

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.730
same in this lecture,

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:12.940
let's see how to handle a specific scenario where the SQL Select statement may produce

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:18.600
either zero or Wonder card because you're executing a select statement based on candidate

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.040
keys such as primary key.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.070
For that,

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.210
let's create a new job class under the same package.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.200
Right click New class.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.900
Get one product at a public static wide may click on finish.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.750
Let's get it up there to do full screen This first,

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.340
let's accept the idea from the user for which we want to get the data on the user may in

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.930
turn i d.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.050
That may exist.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.230
That may not exist,

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.630
so we need to handle both the scenarios.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.510
Let's create a variable first and say int ID equals toe keyboard.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.860
Util don't get into.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.020
And then they were message ender product.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.550
I d.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:58.740
On the string.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:05.760
A skill for the theme would be select star from products where ID equals toe question mark

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.760
.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.120
Now,

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.060
if you're thinking,

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:13.350
why don't we Concorde innate the idea over here and then execute using a statement we have

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.360
discussed earlier that that kind of statement would be probably a scope for SQL injection.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.650
So we never want to do that.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.590
Any values that the user enter,

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.340
we always handled that with the help of question marks.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.900
That way we're safe from SQL injection and,

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:29.700
like always,

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.380
let's put a try catch block and in the try block over here,

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.570
we have to declare a connection equals toe de beautiful,

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.120
dark get connection.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.940
And then we're gonna use a prepared statement.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.610
It's TMP equals toe conduct.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.470
Prepare statement off SQL.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.750
That's also import the prepared statement.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.610
The others that you see here are because these are checked exception on I have not returned

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.090
a catch block yet,

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.220
and I also not thrown any exception.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:08.260
So to a white that let's just put a catch block and then say exception e x e extort Prince

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.500
tractors and I was there was a bomb.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:17.340
Unlike the previous example where we included the results it right here We cannot do this

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.280
distant because notice we are actually executing the quality.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.550
But we cannot execute the query it because the quality of the perimeter so we need toe set

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.480
the value for this parameter And unfortunately,

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.650
we cannot set the perimeter inside this particular round bracket because this is the place

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.900
holder only for auto plausible variables.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.630
So you contra straight statements like assignment or a function called are a far loop or an

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.440
if condition.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.550
You can't do that.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:53.170
So you have toe get inside the try block and then say s t empty dot said int on the

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.950
perimeter one has the value off i d.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.190
And now that the statement is ready for execution,

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.540
I have to say results that articles toe extended or execute quiet.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.120
But if I do that,

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.700
then I have to take it off.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.650
Closing it again.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.780
Soto always that once again,

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.130
I can you their tribal three sources block.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.050
But this time I don't have to write a catch block or finally,

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.510
for this because if any exceptions are thrown over here,

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.380
it will be caught from this.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.770
So I'm gonna do that.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:23.120
Same.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.110
I'm gonna type your results set.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.920
Orestes equals toe STM t dot executive quality off course.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.650
I need toe import it.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.870
I know that I have the artist.

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:40.450
It may be pointing toe single record or no record at all the way you can handle.

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:41.080
That is,

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.940
if you are able toe successfully,

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.200
move to the next record.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.510
That means we found a record matching the I D given by the user.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.650
If not,

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:56.280
we did not find any record matching the idea given by the user so I can type your system

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.980
that outdoor print Alan no data phone for I D and then give idea over here.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.600
But if it is found,

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:10.090
I can probably get all the values from the record and then with the same thing so I can

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.330
type your string name equals toe orders,

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.510
don't get string,

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.570
and then either I can get a column number or column name.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:19.610
My preference,

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:20.680
as I mentioned earlier,

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.610
is the name of the column,

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.360
and I'm going to stick with this this time.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.240
That's a string description equals toe orders.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.300
Don't get string on the name off.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.080
The column is description.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.660
And now that we have all the values that's also print the same thing,

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.730
I'm gonna type your system 0.0 dot print.

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.500
Ellen are reckon use print.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.220
If so,

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.570
it will be formatted nicely,

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.550
and I'm gonna type your name.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.330
Give some states colon percentage s and then,

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.690
of course,

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.350
I have to give a slash in.

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:51.480
Otherwise,

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.490
there will not be a new line character and then name over here,

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.670
and I'm gonna copy this and paste for the rest of the values.

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.540
And now we have our program.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.940
Really?

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.300
Let's save it and run by right clicking Rana's Jolla application.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.750
Let's give any idea from 1 to 4 and we should be able to see our product output properly.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:11.580
No issues.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.200
They let me run it again.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.710
I'm gonna enter the 91.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:16.690
We get our,

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:17.090
you know,

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.750
a laptop.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.270
We run it again.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.360
And this time I 22 which is an invalid lady,

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.300
it comes back and says no data phone for 22.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.330
So when your SQL statement result in multiple rows,

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.480
handle using a while loop.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:39.070
But if your SQL statement such as a single record and you know about that you always is an

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.570
if condition instead off y loop.

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.480
That's all for this lecture.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.790
In the next lecture,

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.850
let's see how to handle Otto incriminated primary keys
