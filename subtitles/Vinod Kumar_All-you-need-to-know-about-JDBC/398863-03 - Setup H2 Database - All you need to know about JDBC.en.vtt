00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.930
hitched with a Java SQL database,

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:06.520
the main features of which two are It is very fast.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.050
It is open source and it is also an implementation off jelly B C.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:11.180
A.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.650
P A.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:18.270
It provides an embedded are in memory database as well as a standalone star or more.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.270
You did a single jar file that consist off a DB server,

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.770
a browser based console application,

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.630
as a less jail BBC implementation.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.690
It footprint is very small on around two nb off jar file size.

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:34.120
The current question,

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.110
as you can see here,

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.640
is Washington one dot for that 200.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.230
But unfortunately,

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.270
this has a known issue for running it as a standard on server.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.460
So we may want to stick with an older wishing,

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.770
which is wondered for that 1 97 which is not available even in the all downloads.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.120
So in orderto download the appropriate version,

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.360
let's go toe May 1 repository,

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:05.310
which is also known as May 1 Central and search for hedge to on the very 1st 1 that you get

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.090
is the link that we want.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.360
Click on that now Here you can see all abortions are listed on the one that we want is one

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.450
dot for that 1 97 So let's click on that.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.990
Here is a job file that we condone Route,

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.820
which is around 1.8 MB.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.950
I'm going toe click on this to download onto my desktop.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.310
Save it now let's open a terminal on Windows.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.410
You open a command front city in tow.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.050
Desktop.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.990
Andi,

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.350
You can see here that the file it's to dash one dot for that 1 97 job is there On Windows,

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.750
you can simply double click on the jar file on your desktop.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:50.600
It will start a DB server as well as opens a browser based console application on my quest

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.990
as well.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:58.230
S Lennox open a terminal city into the desktop and then type the command Java miners jar

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.850
hits to dash one dot for that 1 97 job.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.460
When you press enter,

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.500
you can see that it starts the DB server as well US.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:15.320
It opens up a browser with its local host age 082 and it brings up this logging pitch in

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.020
orderto connected the database.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.300
There were that we started.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.250
We have to first select from the list,

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.300
generate hitch to server.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.140
You can give any other name if you feel like and then take on the same button for future

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.720
references.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.870
Whatever the name you give here will be appearing over here in this job done for me.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.030
This name is OK,

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.660
so I'm going to leave that as it is,

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.200
the driver class is our got hitched to that driver.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.070
We don't have to make any changes over there.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.880
The JBC oral is a connection string for the underlying database.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.460
As you can see here that it is made up off to parts here.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.050
The first part is that Jerry BC,

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.190
which is the protocol for the client.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.440
And the second part is hitch to cool and PCP,

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.650
which is the protocol off the server.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.020
So if you're connecting to a different database,

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.570
for example,

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.580
my SQL this would be Jade BBC Cool.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.460
In my skill,

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.300
we will talk about this You oral in great detail in the next chapter.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.120
Then you have colon double slash local host.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.280
That is your I P address are the computer name in our cases,

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.870
the local Oh,

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:20.750
so that's OK.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.710
And then you have your slash tilde slash test on Mac OS and Linux.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:27.920
Still,

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:34.390
that correspond to the home directory off the user and test is the name of the file that it

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.100
has created as off.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.270
No,

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.150
there is no file,

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.900
but one sec.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.020
Click on the Connect.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.670
You'll see that it connects toe the test to database.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.840
If you want to give it a different name,

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.510
for example,

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:45.820
for this particular training,

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.050
I want to give it us GBC training as the Devi name.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.220
I can just give any name I want you on.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.050
There'll be a new file created when I click on this connect.

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.030
Since this particular debate doesn't exist,

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.480
the user name doesn't exist,

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.560
so you can give a different user name if you feel like.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.350
For example,

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.300
I can give here as we not on password.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.410
As a secret,

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.180
I can click on Connect.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.400
Since the DB does not exist days,

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.200
user name and password will be assumed as the new use element password.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.370
But if the DB already exists,

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.780
then it'll very fiber that this user name password is correct or not.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.790
You can test if the connection can be established by clicking this button.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.530
You can see it's a start successful.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:33.230
Let's get the password again on click on the Connect button to connect another thing.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:38.800
That there is a you I hear that allows us toe executive a skill command.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.100
Since this is a brand new database,

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.480
there is no tables so we can go on,

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.150
create our tables over here.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.650
If you want to disconnect the user,

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.080
you can take on this icon that disconnects,

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.090
and then you can click on the connect toe connect back.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.920
But in case if you're close to this particular brother indoor and if you want to visit,

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:06.320
you can come down directly to a new browser tab and then type local host 808 to press enter

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.320
.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.300
You'll see it will come back over here in case if you don't remember this particular you

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.670
are in,

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.310
you can see on my top right corner.

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.820
Over here,

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.860
there is a small button that indicates hitch to database on Microsoft windows.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.550
It would be at the bottom where you will see notification area.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.600
You can click on that are expended notification area,

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.180
and you would see this icon on Windows.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.260
You have to do a right click button.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.990
Mac worries.

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.360
You just have to click on this,

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.290
and it will show you these three options.

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.400
Clicking the age to console will bring back their particular you a on.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.410
Then you can take on connect to connect the same thing.

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:43.450
No,

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.620
no,

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:44.510
there's all this time.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:50.360
Our Devi is still running so you can see that this particular window are terminal is still

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.760
running.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.320
If I press control,

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.810
see or close this particular terminal,

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.500
then the debates are or would be stopped,

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:03.080
and he would not be ableto connect to this particular server so you can check it out by

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.890
person control.

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:04.340
See,

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.680
it is stopped.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.570
If I click on connect here,

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.530
you can see that it comes back and says the site cannot be reached.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.430
So going back again,

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:13.750
if I have to run,

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.980
I can simply type jobs minus jobs.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:16.260
It's,

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:16.650
too,

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:21.780
whatever the worsen dot job and it'll bring up that you I and take on Connect.

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:22.870
I can get into that.

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:29.340
You can also exit the Sarwar by going to this icon here and then click on this exit and

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.410
that is actually going toe shut down the server.

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:32.530
Let's have a look at that.

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.760
So my sad what is up and running But if I go here and then click on exit,

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.650
you can see the gel application has script.

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.870
And now I don't have this particular you.

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:42.970
I say very fresh.

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:43.340
Here,

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.090
you will see that it's gonna come out.

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.510
I'm say the site cannot be reached.

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:49.100
Let's have a look at one more thing.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:56.790
If I goto a new finder window or Windows Explorer and Windows And if I goto my home

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:57.400
directory,

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.580
which is here,

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:06.560
you can see that it has created one file here called GBC Dash Training dot envied or DB the

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.410
dot M v.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:07.630
D.

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:11.910
B is the file that contains all the database information.

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:17.080
So every table that I'm gonna create all the records that Amber are will be stored in this

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.590
particular binary file.

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:23.200
You may not be ableto open this in a text file and understand what's going on,

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.970
but this is the file that's going to be used by H two when we connect to this particular

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:28.720
database.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.850
So at any point in time,

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:33.890
if you don't want this particular db are you want to drop the date of issue,

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:36.160
just come and delete this particular file?

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.040
So that's all for this lecture.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.220
In the next lecture,

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.150
let's write a Java program toe.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:42.550
Connect to this particularly be
