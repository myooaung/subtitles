1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.720
Welcome back.

2
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:07.260
And today we are going to speak about computer services, Amazon, EC2 and the Amazon, easy to cost

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.870
optimization and the container services.

4
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:18.480
Then we will look to the serverless computing and Amazon A.W. as Lambda and Elastic Beanstalk in a W

5
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.330
as there is multiple services that we can use for the compute layer and those services, the VAT, as

6
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:34.410
if from having Amazon to where we have basically a server that we can use to launch any service in the

7
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.860
cloud.

8
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:43.500
And we have also the container services like Amazon easy to and Amazon Elastic Container Services which

9
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.410
are container based computing instances.

10
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.970
We have also an S lambda, which is a zero administration computer platform where it enables us to run

11
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.450
a code without provisioning and managing servers.

12
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:06.690
You can only pay for the compute time that is consumed and this cost basically will be way much cheaper

13
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.960
than running a server 24 hours, seven days a week in the container based services, including Amazon

14
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.770
Elastic Container servers, Amazon Elastic Pranati Service and Amazon Fire Brigade, which is a server

15
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.720
listed cluster management system.

16
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:30.690
And we have also the Container Registry of Amazon Elastic Container Registry, which can enable us to

17
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.260
run multiple workload on a single operating system.

18
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:42.060
And those containers spin up more quickly than virtual machine and thus offering a responsiveness and

19
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.480
container based solution to continue to grow in the industry.

20
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:56.760
The first thing we will look at is Amazon is Amazon EC2 is a service to run an elastic compute service.

21
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:04.920
It is the servers that provide this with virtual machine to run in the cloud and it give us a full administration

22
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.210
control over the Windows or a Linux operating system that we choose.

23
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.840
Most server operating system are supported, including Windows and Red Hat and Ubuntu.

24
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.500
An operating system that runs on a virtual machine is called a guest operating system and it is easy

25
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.980
to distinguish it from the host operating system because the host operating system is directly installed

26
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:37.020
on the server hardware where we put our virtualization software with Amazon easy to you can launch any

27
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:43.200
number of instances of any size into any availability zone in a WAC cloud.

28
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:50.130
And you can control which machine or Amazon machine image that you want to launch in that server.

29
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:58.080
You can control the traffic to and from the instance where you can add an extra layer of security using

30
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.890
security group and access control list.

31
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.570
The first time you want to launch an Amazon AC to an instance, you will use an a w.

32
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.940
S management console to launch the instance.

33
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:17.100
Using the instance with you have to decide a nine key decisions in order to launch that easy to successfully.

34
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.910
And those are started from selecting the correct M and selecting the correct family that you want to

35
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.080
run the AC two.

36
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:33.300
And so let us look now into how we can launch that easy to enable us to cloud so to launch an easy to

37
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:40.350
in the sense we need to go to the Amazon US console and there in the US console we have to go to the

38
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.670
AC two services.

39
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:48.480
So from the services we need to select Easy two and then we will click on Launch and Innocence.

40
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.540
And the first thing we need to do is to decide which Amazon machine image we have and we have multiple

41
00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:01.740
options we could use, the quickest of which are basically a preconfigured Amazon machines image that

42
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.390
is provided by us.

43
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:11.430
And we can just select them and we can have here any operating system of our choice, like Windows or

44
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.630
Ubuntu or even any other operating system.

45
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:22.920
Now most importantly to know here that you could also launch an Amazon machine image based on your arm.

46
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:29.100
So let's say you have an easy to it is running it has and contains all the software that you need for

47
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.970
your application.

48
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:38.190
Then you could go to the Amazon m i by creating an am I and you will be use it to basically launch more

49
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.760
machines.

50
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:48.750
The Amazon marketplace or the A.W. s marketplace is the place where you can find a digital catalog of

51
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.710
thousands of software solutions that offered by a third party.

52
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:59.840
And normally those are paid software you could also find in the community which are created by people.

53
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:08.020
Around the world and these can be used and checked by IWC so you can launch your easy too based on those

54
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.840
images in your own risk.

55
00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:18.100
Now, for the purpose of this demo, I'm going to go back to the Quickstart and I will select the Amazon

56
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.550
links to Amy, which is the first one in the list.

57
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.170
So I'm going to select it and this is will take me to the second choice.

58
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.540
In the second choice, we have to select the instance type.

59
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:36.280
Now each instance type can determine the memory, the CPU, the disk space and the disk type.

60
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.100
And the network performance enables us.

61
00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.990
We have five categories.

62
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:46.270
We have the general purpose, we have the compute optimized, we have the primary optimized instances,

63
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:52.930
and we have also storage optimized and accelerated computing, those instance type offer a familiar

64
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.880
generation and sizes.

65
00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:00.290
So we have to be careful here in order to know exactly what we are going to learn.

66
00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.960
For example, if we have the machine, it's called T three.

67
00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:13.990
The three family has a machine starting from at3 nano, which is a two virtual CPU with a half gigabyte

68
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:23.020
of memory all the way to two e 3 to 6 large, which is eight virtual CPU use with 32 gigabyte of memory.

69
00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:29.980
Now it's very important to know that the T family is a general purpose, which means the three is the

70
00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:35.950
generation number and T three large, for example, is the size of that machine.

71
00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:39.850
For the purpose of this demo, I'm going just to select another family.

72
00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:44.200
Let's say I want to have a compute optimized instance.

73
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:51.970
You can find that there is c five dot larger from two virtual CPU with four gigabytes of memory all

74
00:06:51.970 --> 00:07:00.340
the way to C 524 s, not just a large machine that we can use it for a huge enterprise application.

75
00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:08.110
Now, most importantly for the three tier application, if we just want to do a simple demo here, we

76
00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:14.500
can select the T two family, which is another general purpose beside all the other family, like image

77
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.890
three and five and four, which are memory optimized.

78
00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:24.640
Sometimes you have a machine which is like M five, a, which means it's a memory optimized, it's the

79
00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:31.990
fifth generation and also it is network optimized and M5 D is a disk optimized.

80
00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:37.870
You have also machines which are sometimes at disk optimized in the network optimized.

81
00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:44.800
So depending on your need and your application, you can select the right time now for this demo, I'm

82
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.670
going to select the three tier one, which is the T to micro.

83
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:49.900
In the third decision.

84
00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:58.150
We have to select now that networking settings for where and how we are going to launch this machine.

85
00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:05.050
So normally we need to decide in which VPC, we have to select, we have to launch this easy to by default

86
00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:12.160
you are going to phase or to have what we call the default VPC in North Virginia or in the region.

87
00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:17.350
You are logged in, then we have to enable or to assign public IP.

88
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:21.220
We can also use the subnet setting for the hostname.

89
00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:28.870
If you are not using a hostname with a DNS hostname as well know the capacity reservation, we can choose

90
00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:37.960
the capacity to be determined by our key bit open or we basically select only target group if we have

91
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:39.910
or a target by ID.

92
00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:46.330
If we have a target group already created in native us later on, we are going to study this in more

93
00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:46.720
detail.

94
00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:51.070
But for today you could also decide the placement, the group and the placement.

95
00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:54.640
The group decided how your machine will be placed.

96
00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:56.430
And there is a three options here.

97
00:08:56.470 --> 00:09:01.480
Whether you want your machine to be cluster, which means they are going to be in the same availability

98
00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.520
zone and close to each other.

99
00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.200
And normally we use this choice.

100
00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:11.830
If we have a web server speaking with an application server and a database of or we want them to be

101
00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:19.230
spread, which means each server will be placed in a separate availability zone to avoid any fault or

102
00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:23.710
power cut cutoff in a specific building or in a specific data center.

103
00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:29.950
You could also choose partition, and in this case the group will be partitioned into multi availability

104
00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:31.450
zone in the same region.

105
00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:35.680
Now for the sake of this demo, I will keep this without any placement.

106
00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.150
The I am role.

107
00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:44.020
If we are going to assign a specific profile for that easy to let's say our easy to needs to read and

108
00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.220
write to C three.

109
00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:48.730
So we are going to pass the role here in this field.

110
00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:54.080
We could also change the behavior of this send down from being a stop to termination.

111
00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:56.380
As you know, the lifecycle of the machine.

112
00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.650
When you terminate the machine, this means will be deleted.

113
00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:00.330
Imminently.

114
00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:02.620
If you stop the machine, it will be stopped.

115
00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:06.760
So you can change the shutdown behavior and you make it all the time is stopped.

116
00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:14.440
Instead of terminating the machine for good, you could also enable hibernation and hibernation option.

117
00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:21.580
This means that you can save the data that is currently in the memory of the virtual machine.

118
00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:29.380
If there is a stop action or we change the status of the machine from running to stop, you could also

119
00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:35.950
enable protection against accidental termination, especially when you are still doing some maintenance.

120
00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:41.230
You could prevent that behavior and you can also enable detailed monitoring.

121
00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:46.600
With detailed monitoring, we are going to get of the inside of 5 minutes metrics about the virtual

122
00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.020
machine.

123
00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:53.860
We can get a one minute metrics and we can save those checking cloud watch metrics in S3 for doing more

124
00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:59.560
analysis that in NC here, the default is to run it in a shared hardware.

125
00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:07.360
If you use for data regulation, all of you need for data regulation, a dedicated tenancy or a dedicated

126
00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.050
hardware.

127
00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:13.060
You can select whether you want a dedicated instance or a dedicated host.

128
00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:20.980
You could also enable elastic interface if you are going to enable elastic accelerator to basically

129
00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:24.490
improve the machine performance.

130
00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:30.520
If you are running a web server in it and you want basically to speed up and to keep a static elastic

131
00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:34.810
IP, then the last thing we want to do is to pass a user data.

132
00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:40.320
And this is a script that will be executed once the machine is started.

133
00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:46.390
And normally in this script we are going to install a specific software in the machine, like a demo

134
00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:50.830
application or an application that we use as we are going to see in Lab three.

135
00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:57.970
In the next step, we are going to decide the storage and the storage as you know, it is elastic storage

136
00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:04.870
and we have multiple types of elastic the storage that we are going to discuss in the next lessons.

137
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:07.570
Now for today, we are going to keep it general.

138
00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:12.130
As you notice here, there is a magnetic stand up, the storage we call this.

139
00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:20.770
And in extensive storage, it has very cheap price for temporary data, but it has one single issue.

140
00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:26.710
If you stop the machine, all the data in that easy to instance, will be lost.

141
00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.620
So this means you can change the time of that.

142
00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:34.380
Easy to, if you choose, maybe stone you could keep the general purpose at.

143
00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:41.080
Now you could also add another volume if you need, but at this case we are not going to add any volume

144
00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.140
and we will go to the next step where we add tag.

145
00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:50.920
And it's very important to add tag in order to keep monitoring the resources and we will know why we

146
00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.760
create this instance advanced in step six.

147
00:12:54.760 --> 00:13:02.440
We have to configure and to choose the rule that we want to open to control the traffic in and out that

148
00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.490
easy to machine.

149
00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:09.400
So in this example, I'm going to call my security group, a demo security group and this demo security

150
00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:16.210
group, I'm going to enable a switch port and I could enable people there is so many ports depending

151
00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:18.670
on your need and your application that you can enable.

152
00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:25.150
But just for this demo, just to show you, I'm going to enable the port at port 80 and this is will

153
00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:31.570
be open and from anywhere I click on review and once the last launches that is going to ask me about

154
00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:32.740
creating a keypad.

155
00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:36.850
This keypad is going to create a public key and a private key.

156
00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:42.880
We are going to download the private key in this case is going to be the key that I'm going to create,

157
00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:49.150
which is demo, for example, and I will download the private key into my computer here and the public

158
00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:52.000
key will be installed in the easy to do machine.

159
00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:59.110
So every time I'm going to access the machine via asset, it will compare the private key to the public

160
00:13:59.110 --> 00:13:59.440
key.

161
00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:04.000
The last step is to click on lunch and this is the easy to innocent.

162
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:11.140
So these are all the options that we need to worry about in order to launch and easy to successfully.

163
00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:17.530
Once you click on a view, you will find that the instance is going now to change from pending to running,

164
00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:25.930
and you can change the status of the instance of from running to start to stop or to reboot or hibernate

165
00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:26.650
or terminate.

166
00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:33.220
Now remember, terminating also means the machine is going to be deleted completely.

167
00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:40.810
So the innocent lifecycle, once we launch the instances, go to the pending state and after the pending

168
00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:44.880
estate the issue is going to go into the running estate.

169
00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:47.920
If you want to stop the A, you can stop it.

170
00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.080
If you want to reboot it, you can reboot it.

171
00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:53.320
And if you want to start it, you can start it again.

172
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:58.330
Now it is the time for you to do laboratory in larvae three.

173
00:14:58.540 --> 00:14:59.620
We are going to do.

174
00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.200
A very simple task.

175
00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:05.490
We are going to create and launch a new Amazon EC2.

176
00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:12.330
We are going to experience how we monitor the EC2 instance and we update the security group to access

177
00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:19.740
a demo observer and then we will change the instance DB and the elastic block storage volume and we

178
00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:25.020
will see the limits of the EC2 and we test the termination protection.

179
00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:30.090
You can refer to the Lab three solution in the attached video.

180
00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:33.030
Thank you for seeing this video and see you in the next one.
