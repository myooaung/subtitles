00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.820
So to secure and a U.S. networking environment, you have to add a security group.

2
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:13.250
A security group are stateful firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic to the U.S. resources.

3
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.060
They act at the level of the instance or the network interface.

4
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.970
When you create a security group by default, it will block all inbound traffic and allow all outbound

5
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:24.540
traffic.

6
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.760
You can create a custom security group.

7
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:35.340
It will allow a specific port with a specific protocol from a specific source to come on to access your

8
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.300
easy to instance in the public subnet or even in the private subnet.

9
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.790
It's very important to do a chaining or security group similar to what we did in the previous demo.

10
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.310
Most likely you will have, for example, a web to you.

11
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.410
You need to open that tier to accept traffic from the internet or from any IP.

12
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.990
Only when you go to the application to make sure to change the security group of the application to

13
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.680
Tier two accepted traffic only from the web tier then in your database to make sure that your database

14
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.130
of security group allow only the communication to come from the application to your security group.

15
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.950
We call this the chaining of security group.

16
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:21.090
You could also create another security layer in the VPC, which is the network access control list or

17
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.030
the ACL, the act at the subnet level.

18
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:31.290
But the security group guys remember that the act at the instance level, you can allow or deny a specific

19
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.540
inbound or outbound traffic.

20
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:42.150
However, by default it will allow all inbound and outbound traffic access list are stateless firewalls

21
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.250
that require explicit rules for both inbound and outbound traffic.

22
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:55.380
Now, what we mean by stateless, if you often port 22 inbound, you have also to specify that the reply

23
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.400
port at 22 is also outbound allow.

24
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:06.300
When you create a custom network access list, you can associate it with a specific subnet by default.

25
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:14.130
Each custom network access list denies all inbound and outbound traffic until you add and you specify

26
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.430
the rule that you want to apply as a best practice, you should secure your infrastructure with multiple

27
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.480
layers of defense.

28
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.150
By your running your infrastructure in a VPC, you can control which instances aren't exposed to the

29
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.600
Internet.

30
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.390
You can define both security group and network access list to protect your infrastructure.

31
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.040
Add the infrastructure level.

32
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:42.300
You can also secure your instances with a firewall at the operating system level using security.

33
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:49.560
When you implement both networking access lists and security groups as a defense, in-depth way of controlling

34
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:56.250
a traffic mistake in the configuration of one of these controls will not expose the host to unwanted

35
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.940
traffic.

36
00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.870
To create a public subnet, you need to refer back to the demo.

37
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.960
So in order to tag a subnet to be public, remember that you need to attach an Internet gateway to your

38
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:07.620
VPC.

39
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.690
You need to allow to your subnet roundtable that directs the Internet to bounded traffic to the Internet

40
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:13.170
gateway.

41
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.840
And you need to make sure that your instances have public IP or elastic IP address.

42
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:25.560
And you want to make sure that your security group and network access list allow the relevant traffic

43
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.340
to flow.

44
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.290
Now, let us look to the guided lab creating a virtual private cloud in this lab.

45
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:37.770
Guys, you will use Amazon VPC manually to create a VPC with public and a private subnet with an Internet

46
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:43.770
gateway under our table, which can run out and direct Internet bound traffic to the Internet gateway

47
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.340
and the security group for easy to end instances in the public subnet.

48
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.450
And then you will launch an application server to test that a VPC.

49
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.960
So the final product of this lab will look similar to this day.
