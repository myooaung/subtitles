1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:06,640
In this, we will do lap five, which is build your DB server and interact with your DB using applications.

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:12,480
And now let's go to this scenario and understand what we are going to have for today.

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:19,490
So basically what we have, we have a web server which is basically this is what we create in the last

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:19,800
lot.

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,190
This is what we create in number three.

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:32,340
And now we want to add a new component to this architecture where we add basically an art of this and

7
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,900
that are the we will test that our web server interact with it.

8
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:42,720
So the first thing we need to do after starting the lab and exiting the console, you can see the console

9
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,980
is here with me.

10
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,660
All of this to a second screen.

11
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:53,580
And this is will enable me to basically have more freedom in the creation process.

12
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:02,640
So now in the first task, guys, we want to create a first a security group.

13
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,250
So we want to go to the easy to.

14
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,750
Or even you can go and find security group in the VPC.

15
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,640
So go to the VPC.

16
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,530
And from your VPC, you have security group.

17
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,700
Now in the reflection in step number seven, we want to create a security group.

18
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:29,280
And the name of the security group will be a DB security group.

19
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,750
And the description is going to be to permit access from Web security group.

20
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,880
And this is neat.

21
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:47,210
You need to be careful here because you need to disable the default VPC and you select the lab VPC alone.

22
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,830
Then you need to add a third and this is will be basically my sequel, Aurora.

23
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:54,930
You can search for it.

24
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,950
My sequel, Aurora, which opened 40 3306.

25
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:04,120
And in the custom part, we want to basically.

26
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:13,720
In the custom parts, we want just to basically enable a specific security group called the security

27
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:13,960
group.

28
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:20,110
So from custom, click here in the box, you can find that there is a Web security group there.

29
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,780
Now, why do we need this security group or why we want to enable just only the security group?

30
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:34,420
If you open your easy to and you see that you have a Web server here, that web server use that security

31
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:34,750
group.

32
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:42,790
So we are saying here we only allow the traffic coming from this web server to go to the RTA.

33
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:48,040
So we only want to allow that web server to access our are there.

34
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,720
So we created the security group.

35
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,050
Now, let us move to task number two.

36
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,870
So we need to go to the ADRs console from the ADRs console.

37
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,280
We want to create a subnet, a group.

38
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:08,460
Now the subject group is basically just only a way to control where these are.

39
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,690
They will be placed.

40
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,660
So basically we want to make sure that our audience, based on their love and instruction.

41
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:22,850
And if you just review the lab and guys goes the diagram, you will see that they want us to launch

42
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:26,820
start Argus in the private subnet one and the private subnet too.

43
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,050
So we want to follow these.

44
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:33,600
In order to achieve that, we need to create and out of this, this mean go to the obvious console,

45
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,680
go to the subnet to group, create ADB subnet group.

46
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:44,880
Now this is should have the name, which is if you go back to that instruction, the audience should

47
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,920
have the name DB something to group.

48
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,870
And the description will be ad lib something to group again.

49
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:00,780
We need to launch this in VPC now in the lab.

50
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:08,390
VPC They are saying in the lab instruction, guys, we need to select basically two availability zone,

51
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:17,030
which is US East one A and one B and this is a due to the fact that our audience will be only last in

52
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:22,940
those two private subnet in East one and East one and one B.

53
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,890
Now, the next thing they are saying, it is step number 60.

54
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:33,420
And we have to select the subnet which are 10 to 0, the one zero and ten 20.30.

55
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,420
So let me show you why fit so you can understand in the future what you are doing.

56
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:46,010
This is that in particular, if you go to your VPC and to your subnet in the last VPC, you have four

57
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:49,620
subnets, you have private subnet one and the private subnet two.

58
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,530
Now look to the IP address for the private subnet to extend that 0 to 3.

59
00:04:55,010 --> 00:05:03,470
And subnet one is standard 0 to 10, which means I want only my database to be in a private subnet one

60
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,280
and the private subnet two.

61
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:06,470
So let me go back.

62
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:13,190
Select ten 0.1.0 and ten 03.0.

63
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,370
And then they click on it create.

64
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,080
In Dusty three.

65
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,690
Now we need to go back to our database solution and we create a database.

66
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,110
Now we need to select.

67
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,380
My sequel.

68
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,120
That's a strange.

69
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,720
They have removed my sequel from the page.

70
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,180
Now we're talking my sequel.

71
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:04,440
And now from my sequel, we want to make sure that this is basically.

72
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,690
The test.

73
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,680
Now in.

74
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,700
Our sitting.

75
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,300
We want to keep it as a single, easy deployment.

76
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:25,250
Now the database identifier will be lub db.

77
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:31,600
Let me be.

78
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,470
And the master reserve name is going to be.

79
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,270
Main.

80
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,960
The password is going to be a lot.

81
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:43,960
That's.

82
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:55,690
Password and then that guess password again.

83
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:03,080
Now that these are the default for is clear.

84
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:09,000
Now if you switch between the create and sender create the sender create are going to give you too many

85
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,140
options.

86
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:16,710
Close this now the first single we love the be main love password.

87
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:22,350
Now for the instant machine they want to use the best every class, including three classes.

88
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:31,200
Now the love is asking you to use these three macros so you can see here I have selected or given ttt3

89
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,430
macro by default.

90
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,100
We need to in the source configuration we need to disable.

91
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:44,120
A few checkbox, which is, for example, enable the storage or scaling.

92
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:52,880
And in the connectivity now part we want to select our last VPC and this is will select by the default

93
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,560
DB subnet group.

94
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,940
Now for our VPC security most a student they do this mistake.

95
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:05,600
They keep the security group of the default there and then they choose the DB security group, which

96
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,360
is the one I create in this task, number one.

97
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:18,800
So we select the DB security group D select the default, and then we need to add additional configuration

98
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:19,700
give.

99
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,460
Our database.

100
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:22,970
A name.

101
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:28,090
We will call a club because we need that name for later on.

102
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:34,620
So we disable enhanced monitoring and automated backups and encryption.

103
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:40,050
And that's all for this database configuration.

104
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,190
So again, guys, it's going to be standard to create my sequel.

105
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,800
This test, it's going to be labeled as the main password.

106
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:58,400
The password instance, the three a micro T for the storage unit on purpose in the VPC in the DB subnet

107
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:05,610
group to the existing security group, the DB security group and select the default and then give the

108
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:10,830
database a name because you will use this in the connection and we'll see you later on and then click

109
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:11,820
on the create.

110
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,790
Normally, guys, this will take a few minutes for the debate to be ready.

111
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:25,290
So we want to wait now from the creation to make our TV available.

112
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:33,690
Now, once this finished, I need to go to my easy too and my Easy Too has an application in that web

113
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:34,230
server.

114
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,980
That application, we are going to use it.

115
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,170
So I'm going to copy the public IP.

116
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,520
I'm going to use that application to connect to my out of this.

117
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:50,250
Just add this so you can see that as an order step here we are going to put to the endpoint the database

118
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:57,870
name, the username and password, and this is what we are going to do in the step number for.

119
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,140
This will go to my out of this.

120
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,240
Now, normally, this could take up to 4 minutes, guys.

121
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,800
So we need to wait for that to finish.

122
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:16,390
Okay.

123
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:22,880
As you can see now, my database is available so I could see that the status has been changed from creation

124
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,570
to available.

125
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,250
Now click on up DB.

126
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:32,380
It will give you a quick information about the connectivity and the security, the port we open in which

127
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:38,840
VPC we have created this ah, this subnet and with subnet as well with security group.

128
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:45,080
Also if you go through the configuration, you could get for example, the database in a sense and the

129
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,830
DB name.

130
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:52,910
Now if you go back to your website, we need to now to provide this information, the end point, the

131
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,800
database, the username and password.

132
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:02,690
So let me go back to connectivity and I will copy the end point and I will paste it here.

133
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:08,810
Now the database name, if you notice, the database name is called Lab.

134
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,650
So I'm going back and fill up here.

135
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:18,690
The username is man and the password was the password.

136
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:22,770
Click Submit.

137
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,820
You should be able to check that you have a correct.

138
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:34,120
Connection between the website and your database so you could interact with your database.

139
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:44,440
You can remove record, add a new record like test, for example, one, one and one at me dotcom.

140
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:47,860
And submit.

141
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:53,920
Just to make sure you have basically a correct configuration between your web server and the are there.

142
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,020
So that's will be all for five.

143
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,430
Thank you for seeing this.
