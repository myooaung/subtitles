00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.980
Welcome back, guys.

2
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:07.630
We are going to do a guided lob creating a highly available environment for the fall of this academic

3
00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:07.860
cloud.

4
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:18.990
Architecting a class in this lab, we have a current VPC with a public and a private subnet and with

5
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.310
an application server.

6
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:27.850
And we want to make it highly scalable and highly available with once the deployment, it's about 40

7
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.220
minutes to finish the lab.

8
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.660
So the first thing we need to do is to access the resource now.

9
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.640
So let me access the console.

10
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:43.350
As you can see, we need to go and see if we have the current VPC, which is the VPC that we need to

11
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.280
use for this lab.

12
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.420
So we have a of VPC in the subnet.

13
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.790
We have to love VPC as well.

14
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.670
With for subnet to public and to private.

15
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.460
And then we have an art gateway.

16
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.460
As you can see, but still impending because I just pushed the creation of the lab, maybe.

17
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.160
So we need now in.

18
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.950
The first thing we need to go and check as well.

19
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.700
After that we have well table.

20
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.730
And you can see those out there that are associated with the lab VPC.

21
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.220
So all we can see there is many things which are look good.

22
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.820
We can also look to the access list, network access list and based on step number 11.

23
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:48.330
We can see there is a network access list for the BBC with inbound trawl, all a traffic inbound and

24
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.850
all traffic outbound are allowed.

25
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.320
We want to check the security group.

26
00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.540
We have an inventory app security group and a DB security group.

27
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.250
We want now to create an application load balancer.

28
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:13.540
So let us go to the easy to outline, the easy to create application load balancer.

29
00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.390
Now, this load balancer will act in the public subnet.

30
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.780
Create a load balancer.

31
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.020
It's going to be an application when.

32
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.100
Now this is will be an inventory.

33
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.810
It'll be

34
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.840
it will be an internet facing IP before it will act or work in VPC.

35
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:52.130
In the face of it is done with public subnet one and in the second ability zone with public subnet two

36
00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:00.680
and the security group, we need to select the current one and we select the security group and then

37
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.130
to the.

38
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.680
Actually, we need to create a new one.

39
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.690
So we need to create a new security group.

40
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.710
And we call it inventory help.

41
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.800
This is to enable access to the load balancer.

42
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.890
So we need to open port eight gate.

43
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.440
Now make sure here that the BBC is not the default, it is the VPC.

44
00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:34.910
We need to add the role and this is will be and has to be a road port and this from anywhere IBP before.

45
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.770
And then create a security group.

46
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.130
Go back to the creation of the Lebanon site, refresh the page, and you should be able to see the new

47
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.250
inventory and make sure to select the default one.

48
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.670
And for listening and voting.

49
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.490
We need to create a new targeted group.

50
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.470
Now this target group will be based on the type instance and the group name is going to be the inventory

51
00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:07.610
of the group.

52
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.160
It is in the PPC CTP.

53
00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.390
And with Advanced Health Check, we want to choose.

54
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:22.120
Fans of Chick.

55
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.940
The threshold is going to be two.

56
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.600
For the health ritual if they're going to change this to to.

57
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.050
And the Internet.

58
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.610
Well, it's going to be 10 seconds because we want to get much more faster information.

59
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.500
And then we click next.

60
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.340
So we have the group treaty.

61
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.670
Then click on a create group.

62
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:55.060
Now in step 32, we know we need to return back to the creation of the load balancer page and refresh

63
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.440
using this icon.

64
00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.360
And you should be able to see the target group and create.

65
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.560
The load balancer.

66
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:15.950
Now we can see the load balancer is created and this is the public DNS name of the load balancer.

67
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.530
The next thing, we are going to create an auto scaling group.

68
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:30.450
So that water skiing group will make sure to create more AC two in instances for the application server

69
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:31.680
in the private subnet.

70
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.650
So the first thing we need to do is from the AC to we need to create and I am.

71
00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.120
Foreign observers action.

72
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.760
Create an image.

73
00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.050
And that image should be called.

74
00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.420
Web server am I?

75
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:05.300
And this is a lab I for the web server all you can call it a configuration said if you want just to

76
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:11.510
make sure that this is will be used mainly by the load balancer and I would love to create more machine

77
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:12.260
in the future.

78
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.650
Okay,

79
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.070
now we need to go back.

80
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.070
Once this AM is finished.

81
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.560
And available and we create a lunch configuration.

82
00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:37.350
So we create lunch configuration and this is will be an inventory and see or lunch configuration.

83
00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.190
Now hopefully by now the AMA is ready but still in the creation.

84
00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:44.700
So we need to wait for a few minutes for the I to be ready.

85
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:51.300
Now I can see there my OC Dennison stove is going to be P3 may crop.

86
00:06:53.770 --> 00:07:00.760
Which means it's going to be the the new one that we are going to use basically and lap.

87
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.020
We usually use T2.

88
00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:12.290
Now seem to be T3, which is the third generation is the one we are going to basically use

89
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:19.160
for an a profile where we can select the infantry all.

90
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:28.480
And we need to expand the user data and into user data.

91
00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:31.230
We will put.

92
00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:32.040
This is correct.

93
00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.100
Now we should select an existing security group.

94
00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.050
And that security group will be there and then to up.

95
00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.840
And the keypad is going to be four.

96
00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:51.910
Key.

97
00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.670
And there is.

98
00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.650
And more information we need, which is.

99
00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:12.740
We need to expand the advanced details and we add a scan of a user data to the lens configuration.

100
00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:22.550
Here it is.

101
00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:23.700
So that's the script.

102
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:25.260
We need to copy that script.

103
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:30.730
From Step 45 and we paste it here.

104
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.480
Now we need to select that launch configuration from the action menu.

105
00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:41.290
We create an auto scaling group and that order scan group is going to be called Inventory ASG

106
00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.510
and it will use the inventory LC.

107
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:49.680
It's going to be enlarged.

108
00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:57.180
VPC In the first availability zone and the second availability zone.

109
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:06.930
A private subnet now IDC left by mistake public, so it lets me remove its private subnet in the first

110
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:10.470
that it is on and the private subnet in the second of it's on.

111
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:12.390
Then a click on next

112
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:22.650
we will attach it to the existing load balancer which is the inventory ah load balancer and the things

113
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:24.390
that we need to do for the check.

114
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:31.620
We want to make sure that the ILB do that and the grace period is going to be 90 seconds, about one

115
00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:35.610
minute and a half and then addition and setting.

116
00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:41.220
We need to have to decide.

117
00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:45.500
And to a minimum and to a maximum.

118
00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:51.870
Now the scaling policy, we choose none.

119
00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:58.370
And with select next add notification.

120
00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:10.250
We do it next year and for the tag we add name and for the name we need to select inventory.

121
00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:18.170
Most of the time you will try to distinguish this and then we are going to create a security.

122
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:28.640
I was just getting a group and that the group is ready and we can see that this group started to be

123
00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.250
active after we created.

124
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:34.430
But this is will take time because now it's updating the capacity.

125
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:39.770
So we need to wait for a few minutes because the minimum and the maximum here are two.

126
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.710
So we can't keep waiting or refreshing the lab.

127
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:51.620
But you can also go to the instances and see if there is any new instances start to appear here and

128
00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:55.370
the servers and in your load balancer as well.

129
00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:59.700
We can proceed now to task numbers.

130
00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:01.930
Four.

131
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:04.250
And we update the security group.

132
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:06.990
So we need to select that.

133
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:08.790
And then the art security group.

134
00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:18.130
And then from inbound it hit the inbound rules and the inbound rule.

135
00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:19.420
We had the new one.

136
00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:22.550
And this is going to be his step.

137
00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:28.220
Now the custom is going to accept the traffic only from the load balancer.

138
00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:33.770
So once you go custom and you type ASG, you could see the security group that we create.

139
00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:37.040
So that's the inventory LP, the load balancer, the group.

140
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.860
Which accepts traffic only from the load balancer.

141
00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:45.840
And we save the.

142
00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:49.750
For the DB security group.

143
00:11:49.750 --> 00:12:00.070
Now that DB security group, it needs to accept only the traffic from the application security group.

144
00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:09.170
So we need to delete the existing one and we add a new my sequel, Aurora.

145
00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:17.210
And the custom will be the inventor, the app security group.

146
00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:23.870
And this is will accept the traffic only from the application servers.

147
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.530
And we set of rules.

148
00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:37.150
Now we can test the application, we can go to the instances and see if there is any permission happening

149
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.400
or new instances appearing here.

150
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:45.190
And now we can copy the load balancer public DNS name.

151
00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:49.520
And we basically test that.

152
00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:57.360
We can see the application which normally take a few minutes, guys, to give us a crack at performance.

153
00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:02.150
You can see the inventory app is ready and the testing is successful.

154
00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:09.920
You could also go to the target group and your load balancer and check.

155
00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:18.880
And you can see these are both healthy in a sense is that we have.

156
00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:30.740
We can also attest to the Amazon 82 console and we basically terminate the application and go back and

157
00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:31.460
do that.

158
00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:38.400
From instances the observers will try to stop.

159
00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:42.290
Terminate.

160
00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:57.150
Let us select one of the inventory application and we terminated this well and we want to test that

161
00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:00.930
the auto scanner will be able to replace it with any new instance.

162
00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:09.760
Now in Optional Task one, we need to make the ADRs highly available.

163
00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:13.490
So for that we need to create a multi easy deployment.

164
00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:15.530
So let us go to the this.

165
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:24.550
And from the of we want to.

166
00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:30.080
Modify it and create a multi-agency deployment.

167
00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.440
So currently it is not among the easy.

168
00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:39.540
Because it's only operate in US East.

169
00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:45.790
One could also look to the configuration here and in the configuration you get more details about the

170
00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:52.450
DB and as you can see, a multi easy is no go to the modify.

171
00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:04.370
And from the fight we will go to the availability and the durability and we will select.

172
00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:09.380
To create a stand by not.

173
00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.880
And this is the dbi will be.

174
00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:24.120
In our case, it will be DB three.

175
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.930
DB .3. small and a set of micro.

176
00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:37.290
And allocated to storage will be.

177
00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:42.030
Ten instead of 2010.

178
00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:43.050
Innocent five.

179
00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:55.750
And select, continue and then select apply immediately and then modify.

180
00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:01.750
So this is now we'll take action to modify the artist.

181
00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:04.810
And the artist now will create a stand by note.

182
00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:12.140
Now then that gateway that we used before.

183
00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:21.250
It hasn't only nots gateway and public subnet twin and if X is on when fails, we want to make sure

184
00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:23.620
that our gateway is highly available.

185
00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:25.420
So we need to go to the VPC.

186
00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:31.820
And from the VPC, we go to the Nat Gateway.

187
00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.900
And we select and create, communicate with.

188
00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.520
We will select a public subnet to.

189
00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:53.320
And this is going to be public and allocate an elastic IP.

190
00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:57.650
And then create.

191
00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:00.010
And a gateway.

192
00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:03.370
In a private roundtable.

193
00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:03.730
Two.

194
00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:10.050
Let's go to the roundtable and a private roundtable.

195
00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:15.220
Which is this about table?

196
00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.670
Or create a new table.

197
00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:22.030
Sorry.

198
00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:29.470
And this will be contemplated throughout table two and this is will be in the lab we see and create.

199
00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:35.040
And in this round table, we need to.

200
00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:41.290
Go to the results of that roundtable, and you can see that it's only one crowd.

201
00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:47.080
So let us add another out for the fine arts gateway that we just created.

202
00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:50.100
Now.

203
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:59.700
Maybe it will be much better if you go back to your VPC from another tab and just check that gateway

204
00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:00.000
ID.

205
00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:06.300
The new one, which is a52, could copy it here.

206
00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.860
And let me see if I can see this 152.

207
00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:11.250
Yes.

208
00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:12.570
And see changes.

209
00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:17.820
In the subnet association.

210
00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:21.570
Now we need to edit the subnet association.

211
00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:25.200
We select also private subnet two to be associated with this.

212
00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:36.740
In you, our table within you, that gateway that we choose could go back, double check.

213
00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:42.190
You can see now the application load balancer still working from AC two.

214
00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:50.260
I could see on maintaining the number of inventory app and the one I terminated just replaced by a new

215
00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:50.470
one.

216
00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:52.570
And that will be all for the slam.

217
00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:55.300
You can submit it and thank you for saying this with you.
