1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,320
Another service that we can use is called a WAC Cloud Train.

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:12,270
It is a service that enables us to governance, compliance and audit of our A WAC account with the Cloud

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:12,780
Israel Trail.

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:20,380
You can monitor and retain account activity that is related to actions across your enterprise infrastructure.

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,970
With Cloudtail, it provides us with an event history or an account activity, including actions taking

6
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,530
through the ideal assignment console as the key or the command line interface.

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:38,850
This event history simplifies the security analysis and the resource change tracking and troubleshooting.

8
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:44,820
You can discover and troubleshoot security and operational issues by capturing a comprehensive history

9
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,350
of changes that happened in your address account.

10
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:57,120
You could also use Amazon even to bridge with Event Bridge, and that's no known before as Amazon iCloud

11
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:57,840
Watch Event.

12
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:05,210
You can define workflows that run, you can define workflow that run when it detects event with a cloud

13
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,410
literally records.

14
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,680
You can basically integrated with an Amazon event bridge.

15
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:16,710
You can define workflows that run when in the events that can result in security issues.

16
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:22,830
For example, you can create a workflow to add specific policy to S3 bucket when a cloud display logs

17
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,970
an API call that makes the public bucket the bucket public.

18
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:32,940
With a cloud trial, you can record important information about each action, including who made the

19
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:39,540
request to services, use the action platform and the parameters for the action and the response elements

20
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,030
that were retained by the end of this service.

21
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:49,410
The service also helps organization to meet the compliance and any auditing requirements that they must

22
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,470
adhere to with organizing users.

23
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:58,500
You can create an image group and we see once we put all users in the group, we can assign the same

24
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:06,420
permission to all members of the group to create a group that reflect a job function, for example,

25
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,900
like the advocacy group, the developer group.

26
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:15,360
You can basically put all users there and you assign the same permission to all of them.

27
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:21,240
With I Am, you can use a resource based policy, as we can see here in this example.

28
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:26,880
And based on that, you can see that this bucket has two main directories.

29
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:33,240
The home has a subdirectory for each user where they can store individual work, and the shared directory

30
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,560
has a subdirectory where a different team can store content.

31
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:44,820
If a new team member joins the organization as a developer, for example, you can take three action

32
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:51,720
to grant them the open access you need to add the new user to the item in group for developers, and

33
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:58,260
this group has an IAM policy already attached to it which can grant access to the example bucket.

34
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,000
Share the developer folder.

35
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:06,690
Then you need to create the US directory for that user and you attach and I am policy that you grant

36
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:11,380
access to the directory for and then you use it.

37
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:18,690
In this case, the new user will access both the right that actually is granted from the group and his

38
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,990
own personal directory with I role.

39
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:29,970
You can enable to define a set of permission to access the resources that are a user or a service needed.

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,750
However, the permission are not attached to an employer or a group.

41
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:41,760
The permissions are attached to a role, and that role is assumed by the user or by the service.

42
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:49,710
When a user assumes all the user prior permission are temporary forgetting address returns, temporary

43
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:58,080
security credentials that the user or application can then use to make a problematic request to a using

44
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,650
IAM role.

45
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:06,100
You don't need to share a long term security credentials for each entity that requires access to a resources

46
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:14,490
for service like Amazon, etc. Applications or services can be assuming the role to get access to a

47
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,540
specific service.

48
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,370
For example, to read or write assist.

49
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:24,980
Oh, let us show you how you can create an easy to profile and you will assign a role for an security

50
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,780
that's a create a democracy to and this is your tool.

51
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:33,480
I will use it mainly to access a necessary bucket, to list the bucket, to list the object inside the

52
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,230
bucket, and also to copy a demo file to that associated bucket.

53
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,170
I will keep everything to the settings, to the default.

54
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,190
I will add the tag.

55
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:47,790
I will call this demo of easy to to assign three and then I will configure a security group I need only

56
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:53,010
to enable the search part because I would access this easy to from my computer.

57
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,510
Now the easy two is ready.

58
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:57,000
So let us go now and create a bucket.

59
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,610
It is go to SS3 and we will create another.

60
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:07,420
Just to show you guys how the AC two could have a read and write access to unnecessary books to create

61
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,220
a demo market.

62
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:12,130
Again, this is will be a demo and to give it a unique name in this region.

63
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:16,090
So I'm going to call this cut photos, for example, too easy too.

64
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,220
And they will put the date of today.

65
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,140
And Happy New Year to you all.

66
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:27,400
I will keep that ACL to be enabled for the package owner and that will enable versioning as well because

67
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:33,190
I'm going to use and show you in the future video how versioning could be used to protect accidental

68
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:33,580
damage.

69
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:35,290
Now we have the bucket created.

70
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:41,530
So let's go back now to our 82 and we will download the PIM file and that being five, we will use it

71
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,710
mainly to access the easy to avoid search.

72
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:48,550
And from the AC two, I want to copy a file to the AC three.

73
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,020
Lets me download the PIM file.

74
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:56,140
If you are using a which account to do this demo, just to create a new PIM file for your AC two and

75
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,940
download it and give it to permission.

76
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:04,150
Search Mode 400 or you is Potti the link for my pocket video for the Windows user.

77
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:10,780
Let us go to the easy to and get the public IP address again for Potti user, it's the same.

78
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,410
You will use the same IP address in Potti click on yes.

79
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:20,560
Now we have access to the AC to what we want to do now is to check that we have access to the bucket

80
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,140
list secret file before touch demo.

81
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,620
This is we create a file and I will open the file in Nano and this is like file a demo file.

82
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,090
I will put some, some text in.

83
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:38,760
This is like this is a file to show the easy to to AC three and we will save now let us do now an Andreas

84
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:45,100
etc. copy copy them on the text to AC three and we will specify the bucket name.

85
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:49,600
You could go back to us three and copy the bucket name at this stage if you don't have it.

86
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,530
So let me open necessary in a new tab and this is my demo bucket.

87
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,870
I will copy the name and be careful here guys.

88
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,790
It's the name of the bucket not to the air.

89
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:00,220
And you can see there is a permission error.

90
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:06,760
We don't have the correct permission to be able to write to this bucket, even if we do a WC S3 unless

91
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,660
this means we don't even have a permission to S3 as a service.

92
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:17,230
Not only that bucket in a specify so let us go now to I am in I am there is a role created it's called

93
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:22,630
my activity role creation of the role is above the level of the cloud practitioner.

94
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,480
So we will show you this later on in the solution architect.

95
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:32,320
You can see here we are giving an easy to in a sense a full permission over and SS3 from the JS.

96
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,800
All we need to do now is to go to the AC to and from the ACTU.

97
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,390
We will basically modify the IAM role and we will assign the My AC three role to it.

98
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:43,690
It's the last one there in the menu and click on Save.

99
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:50,560
Now let us try to copy the demo file again to AC three and you will be able to see that this file is

100
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,840
obviously copied successfully.

101
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,080
It has been uploaded to us.

102
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,020
Three can go back to us three and check.

103
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:00,010
So the file is there and we can view it as well in the console.

104
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,370
Let us upload now a cat photo from my computer.

105
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:09,820
And the point here, I just want to make sure not only I can write to this activity, I could also list

106
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:10,900
any new object.

107
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:18,280
Remember AC three, give you give you half consistency for a new object and read after right consistency

108
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,900
for updated object.
