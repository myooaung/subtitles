1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,500
So the workload for the cafe are increasing in a very complex way.

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:09,570
The architecture must support connectivity between multiple devices and be highly available and salt

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:10,050
tolerant.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,450
So we are going to look at how we can connect your remote network with a side to side VPN on either

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:23,700
side to find a highly available solution that can enable you to a security connect on a premise network

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,110
with your VPC.

7
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:31,770
You can use Internet protocol, security, IPV six, and you can also use encrypted virtual private

8
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:32,460
networking.

9
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:40,290
We're going to provide you with encrypted tunnels, better VPN connection and you will be charged per

10
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,340
connection hour.

11
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:47,730
You could also use with that configuration two times of routing that is dynamic understood.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,690
So with dynamic routing there is a software control how that bucket going to be traveled from one point

13
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:01,590
to another with this static routing, the buckets have a fixed the static they need to jump from one

14
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:02,700
place to another.

15
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:08,990
When you connect Libyans, you can create an virtual private gateway and then you will have multiple

16
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:16,380
connections connecting a customer gate with no connection to your remote network with a direct connect.

17
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,360
This is another choice.

18
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:25,170
If you have an on prem datacenter and you want to connect directly to the address region in the country

19
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:33,090
where you are located, then you can provide you with a physical connection, a physical wire between

20
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,490
the enterprise region data center and you datacenter.

21
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:46,720
It is dedicated in the private connection with a capacity with that one gigabit per second or thing

22
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:53,850
gain gap per second, which is extremely fast, especially when you have, for example, your backup

23
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:54,990
solution storage.

24
00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:01,240
They are in the on premise and you have services in the cloud.

25
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,900
Then you want them to speak with each other.

26
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:10,980
When you can use direct connection, you can use it in a hybrid environment where you have part of your

27
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:16,290
infrastructure on prem, part of your infrastructure on the cloud, when you want to transfer large

28
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:22,500
data set, when you have any working performance predictability, and when you have a security and compliance

29
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:29,640
feature, you could also extend on a premise network using disconnects where you can create multiple

30
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,590
VPN location, and those are locations where you connect your own aircraft.

31
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:40,530
This is a way to make your infrastructure highly available because you can also create a direct connect

32
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:48,770
backup VPN connection so that if the main connection fails down, you have a standby or above can one.

33
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:55,950
You can also make sure to have a critical workload distributed around multiple on a premise data center

34
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:03,210
using direct connection when you have multiple connection connecting your cloud with the on premise

35
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,050
center.

36
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:11,340
Now when we create the BBC, we speak already and we say this is a virtual private network and you need

37
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,650
to transfer data between those two resources that you have in your bio certified.

38
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:23,940
But that's how you can do that if you have, for example, multiple VPC and there was one for production,

39
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,520
one for testing, one for that.

40
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,980
How you will do that, you can use what we call a VPC appearing.

41
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,640
So in this recipe we are going to do the same.

42
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:42,180
We have a 1 to 1 networking connection between two bases without any gateway, without any VPN connection,

43
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,120
and the other with a separate network allocation.

44
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:53,190
And we have a highly available connection without having a single point of failure or a bandwidth bottleneck.

45
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:58,340
When you have multiple devices are connected with the same gateway, that's good.

46
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,730
We need to process everything.

47
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,320
So this is going to create a bottleneck.

48
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:08,130
Now you have all sorts of like always a stage on the global backbone, which is an advanced feature

49
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:15,240
because this means the traffic between two BBC will happen in a private connection, not in a secure

50
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,660
connection.

51
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:21,540
You can establish a recipient by going I'm going to into that all the time and so have, for example,

52
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:26,080
the destination within the same VPC will be going to the telco.

53
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:30,760
And if you want to go to the second VPC, you are going to use that.

54
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:39,600
So on this dimension, which can be the parent connection, beefy x1, DC X1, now you could also have

55
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,570
multiple being in connection which are restricted.

56
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:50,730
So amongst the thing, so what you can do is you have also very busy guys, you can also pin them together.

57
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:56,700
But remember peer to peer connection is between two bases at a time.

58
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:57,540
They are not.

59
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,910
This is not the actual connection and this is.

60
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,590
Like a famous examiner question.

61
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:09,220
So if you want to be an easy one with a BBC, one with the BBC to visit with the production, if you're

62
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:15,390
really busy with the press, this does not mean that you have access between there and the production.

63
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:20,670
We are two totally separate or maybe two totally separate connections.

64
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:25,530
When you connect monthly, really busy, consider those networking design only connect.

65
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:29,890
Essential really is a mixture of your solution and scale.

66
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,460
This is an example of a building on my side and resources and this guy would love.

67
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,630
We will create every recipient and connection.

68
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:43,560
So if you recall what we did in Lab six, we actually create VPC and then we have like also the shared

69
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:48,840
APC and we have told In Love six that we are going to use the option VPC later on.

70
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:54,060
So in this particular map, we want to create a picture and connection and that we visited and in connection

71
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,260
will happen between love, privacy and the shared beauty lab.

72
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:03,000
So as you can see here in the diagram, we have my sequence instance in the set of the APC and want

73
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,360
to pair it with our application server in the lab APC.

74
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:13,560
So it is now installed on the task and we will do in number five, we will go to the this and in my

75
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:20,610
interview this account, I would like to access the VPC console and from there we to create everything.

76
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:25,800
Right now I would like to move this to TAB so I can navigate easily between them.

77
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:31,560
So let's go to the beginning connection and you want to create a fitting connection following the dummy

78
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,750
territory called the lab.

79
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:39,610
Now the VPC that we want to request is going to be the lab and this is the IP address of the lab.

80
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:45,540
BBC We want to select another VPC in my account, or you can also add another VPC.

81
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,500
And I don't know that I can.

82
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,740
If you have better machine do so the acceptor will be the shared VPC and you can see that it has a different

83
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,330
idea of I can address and just create that connection.

84
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:03,690
Now after this finished, we want to go and select an up here and from the action we want to exit the

85
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,570
request so we are going to go to the connection.

86
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,610
The next is from action.

87
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:14,440
We want to exit the request because basically we have the requester and the ex that are from the same

88
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:14,730
account.

89
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:20,490
So we need to do this a step here now we need to configure tunnel active and this now will take us to

90
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:26,760
the round table and in the last public routing and for the last UPC, we want to send that out.

91
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:33,930
So we add about for the IP address of the shared with the and this is basically going to be the path

92
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,990
that we take every time we want to communicate with the share.

93
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:43,170
So in the last public image, double check guys, because it is very important to do this correctly,

94
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,250
we go to drag.

95
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:50,460
It is and we add to this IP address and this is going to be the destination for this.

96
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:56,130
It should be the connection that we just created, the lab and a change in this step.

97
00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:03,480
Number 14, we want to select the shared VPC announcement and in that VPC about and we want to edit

98
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:03,930
that out.

99
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:06,510
And now we put Path to the last VPC.

100
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:10,410
So it's going to be the other direction of the communication.

101
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:16,290
So in the shared the BBC about they have been quoted around it is an add around and make this pointing

102
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:21,510
to the lab privacy and this is also will be the connection that will just be in the three.

103
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:25,380
And then I want to test the VPC pairing.

104
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:30,770
So we need to go to the easy to and from the easy to we have our application server.

105
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:38,250
As you can see, the applications that is in the instances is located in the lab, VPC in the public

106
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:38,700
subnet.

107
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:44,430
And we want to check that this love ABC is basically enabling us to access that.

108
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:49,830
So if you go back to the network section, they are going to give us a few configuration settings for

109
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:50,670
the database.

110
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,850
So we need to go and open the obvious as well.

111
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,820
That's all going to mutate and fund that a new tab.

112
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,450
We want to go to the obvious and basically retrieve the endpoint.

113
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:06,690
So to go to the and then to the to the select and eventually now go back to your database server.

114
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:12,690
And in the settings we want paste the inventory disappears now that this is his name is called inventory

115
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:17,760
and the username is going to be admin and the password is going to be lab.

116
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,670
So click save and you can see I have access.

117
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,670
So basically by this we finished the lab.
