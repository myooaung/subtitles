00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.360
Come back to another video about Guided Lab of Module 11 streaming and dynamic content using Amazon

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:06.720
iCloud.

3
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.870
From now in this lab, we are going to use two services.

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:17.370
We will use the cloud, different distribution in order to feed video to multiple playback engine to

5
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.350
customers like with handheld device.

6
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:27.360
Mobile devices with different format are used using a service, which is the NWS cloud code.

7
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:36.060
Now this is will basically use the cloud code to create an up energy to be livestream HLS protocol which

8
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:42.750
can be played back in multiple different type of browser that supported S protocol.

9
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.820
So the first thing we need to do in this lab is to check the preparation for the lab are correct.

10
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.620
So we need to go to a city and from a city we should have a bucket.

11
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.640
And that bucket is basically containing an input file.

12
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:03.510
It's called Amazon S3 Sand and before and the idea we are going to use the cloud to to cast this content

13
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.250
in the edge location and the stream and wants to build different type of devices using the cloud front

14
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.040
distribution.

15
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.210
So the first thing after we visit the city is to go to cloud to front, and from cloud to front we are

16
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.570
going to create a distribution and if you click here, you will find that there is an origin for the

17
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.520
distribution from Amazon SC three.

18
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:34.140
So we like that which is a three bucket access, which we meant allow public access and then we will

19
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.010
basically create distribution.

20
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.940
Now in the next step we want to create an Amazon elastic transcode that a pipeline.

21
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:49.590
So the transcode that here is going to be used be to stream the content to multiple different devices.

22
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.460
So we are going to go to services and different services.

23
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.130
We want to go to the elastic, it transcode and then we create a pipeline we will call the pipeline.

24
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.770
Here is the input pipeline and this is what read from this bucket.

25
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.020
So three buckets, which is the one with the wizard training and that role is going to be the Amazon

26
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:16.750
Elastic Transcode that role because we need to give the transcode a better machine to read and to write

27
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:17.010
to us.

28
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:24.480
Three Now we will also have a transcode there for the bucket to save the playlist and the classic audit

29
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.900
file.

30
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.850
And this is going to be the same bucket with the start of this class as standard, and we will also

31
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.660
select the same bucket for thumbnail with reduced redundancy and then we create a pipeline.

32
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.700
The next thing is to create a job.

33
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:46.260
And in the job creation here, guys, we went to basically select the pipeline as our input pipeline

34
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:54.510
and all the files generated by the input pipeline, they will be generated under the prefix output.

35
00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.480
So basically inside a three, all everything generated by this pipeline is going to appear inside the

36
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.600
folder outputs and now the input key is going to be the input to slash Amazon SS3 sample.

37
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:15.240
And now for the output we are going to select multiple of we are going to select the output detail where

38
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.050
we need to configure different type of future list format.

39
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:26.400
So we will select the first one, which is that picture this it to him and you can find it here from

40
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.940
the menu.

41
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.210
Segment in duration then.

42
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:36.930
And this is basically the segment that we created in each out with records of the value between one

43
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.920
and 260, which is the duration in second.

44
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.900
So 10/2.

45
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:50.340
And the output key is going to be for this kind of format, we will call it pitch close to zero.

46
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:57.480
Now, we could also now add another output and this is will deal with the other format that we want

47
00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.490
to support it, which is less one five.

48
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.320
And this is going to be the second format.

49
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.510
We will support one five and the duration is going to be 10/2.

50
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:20.130
And the output key when we give it the is as 1.415 and then we add another output and this time is going

51
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:27.240
to be the last one and the same duration ten and 21.

52
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.420
And after we finish this brief without going further, we need to create a playlist.

53
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.010
So we need to add a playlist.

54
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.660
And here the playlist we are going to call it based on the instruction to be primary.

55
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:47.310
And this playlist is going to be the link that we need to use to feed all different formats.

56
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:54.300
Now in that playlist, when the US within the master playlist, we are going to have the playlist format

57
00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:00.470
in Hitler's V three and he is now in the output because we have configured the three output.

58
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.470
We could click here on the plus sign to add the three different output.

59
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:10.770
So select them in the same way we create them and then we need to create a new job.

60
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:18.330
This is output to select and click on create and now the jump is successfully created.

61
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.960
So we want now to test the playback.

62
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:27.990
Now before you go and you try to find that you are look below into step 32 because this will show you

63
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.460
how you can obtain these.

64
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.800
You are also the first thing we need to go back.

65
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:39.000
It's me open until the front and then you tap and select the find and in the origins you will find the

66
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.920
domain name that we can use.

67
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:48.570
You can use and copy this to a text editor now in your RC three bucket to go back to your S3 bucket

68
00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:56.580
in the new tab, well, you will find there is a multiple output generated by the Transcode as well.

69
00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:02.940
So if you go to output, there is a playlist called the primary emissary you a.

70
00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:12.330
So basically going now to back to my good friend distribution you are and it's going to be output slash

71
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:19.980
this file you could open this in and you private window for example to view the video as you can see

72
00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:25.690
successfully I managed to view and receive that with sight from the bit, the stream from the cloud

73
00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.570
front and this is pretty much what you need to do for the step.

74
00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.320
Thank you for seeing this video and see you in the next one.
