00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:07.020
Welcome back, guys, to another video about a kind of club of mutual fan in the academy now protecting

2
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:07.680
their class.

3
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.760
Now, in this club, we are going to focus in deploying an infrastructure based on the concept of infrastructure

4
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:15.420
as a code.

5
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.720
And we will use the service of a cloud formation.

6
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.730
So we are going to use.

7
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.890
Templates to deploy and supply with the cloud.

8
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.410
Then we will deploy an application layer and we will explore that template in the confirmation design

9
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.980
and we will also delete the stack as well.

10
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:41.740
So the first thing we need to do in the first task is basically to create a VPC and a database application

11
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:42.160
layer.

12
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:50.770
And this is will basically using a lab desk network and find it is a file we will use in order to deploy

13
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:51.940
the BBC.

14
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.410
So the first thing we need to do is to download this file into our computer.

15
00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:58.730
And that's fine.

16
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.800
We will use it with the clot formation and we will load it as one.

17
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.650
So if you download this form to your computer and you open it in ethics editor, as we can see here,

18
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:16.850
and this is clean, this file is mainly going to create a cloud formation template where we have basically

19
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:27.950
a VPC as a resource and that KPC will be used mainly to deploy an infrastructure resources.

20
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.890
As you can see, and it will print out the VPC I.D. and the public subnet ID.

21
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.220
Now, let's go now to cloud formation.

22
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.630
And from the cloud formation, we will basically create a new stack using the scripts that we have.

23
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.550
So in a cloud formation, we need to go and create a stack.

24
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.090
Now you kind of create a stack using different methods.

25
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.300
Here you can use the template, which are the samples provided by us.

26
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.020
So Lambda Stack, you can also deploy Rock on Rails.

27
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.470
We have a simple one or a multi easy deployment.

28
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:17.810
Now, in our case here, we are going to use our find that we just upload download to our computer could

29
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.810
also create a cloud formation template in the cloud designer.

30
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.110
So basically that has many choices, how you can proceed with this.

31
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.800
So we are going to upload the template file that we have in our local computer, which is the one we

32
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.210
downloaded from the lab sheet.

33
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.770
You could also view within the designer.

34
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:43.950
So if you open it in a new tab, you will find that this file is containing the resources that will

35
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.510
be created in the cloud formation template.

36
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:55.350
It will create a VPC and create a real table and a public subnet as well, an Internet gateway.

37
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.570
So these go back and click next.

38
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.000
Now we need to call this a stack based on the lab sheet.

39
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.100
It will be called based on the lab sheet.

40
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.110
It will be called a lab network.

41
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.250
And then we need to put a tag.

42
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.160
And these tags are very important in the future.

43
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.680
When you have an auditing process or to distinguish which resources are used, for example, for production,

44
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.600
for testing, for environment.

45
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.830
These tags will be very useful.

46
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.160
Also, they are very useful for course exploration and cost management.

47
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.210
So they are very useful tool for auditing later on.

48
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.420
So we call this resources.

49
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.430
We will be tagging them as application inventory and we will to click next.

50
00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.530
So the stock failure option, this is basically what will happen if the templates fail.

51
00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:56.540
So if the templates fail, we can keep successfully creating the resources or we can roll back and delete

52
00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.130
all the successful resources that we create if there is any issue in the template.

53
00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:07.670
So these are very useful choices, especially when you have a migration or a disaster recovery site.

54
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:14.040
Now once you click on the create, this one puts the static creation in the progress.

55
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.900
You can check this from the events.

56
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:23.850
Tab could also go to the resources tab and in order to see which resources are currently created or

57
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.320
under creation as well.

58
00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.780
Then you can look to the stack as well, which give you a look at the stack.

59
00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:38.990
And for the idea of the stack, the process of the stack, the status, and we need to wait until we

60
00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.580
manage to see the output.

61
00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:48.560
And as we saw in the template file, this should print a VPC and it should the print as well a subnet

62
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:49.160
ID.

63
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.610
So give us a few minutes, guys.

64
00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.950
And until this completely finished.

65
00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:03.670
Now, if you go back now to the resources, you can see that the fewer resources has been created like

66
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:08.020
the Internet, gateway shows and it complete.

67
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:15.070
And also you could go to the VPC and in that VPC, you could basically check which of the sources has

68
00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.990
been created by the cloud formation.

69
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:22.690
By the way, these labs that we use in the academic cloud architecting, once you click on a start,

70
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:28.890
basically you are running or creating the lab environment based on a transformation template.

71
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.700
So what is the process of the confirmation execution finished?

72
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:43.650
You will find in the outcome of the confirmation, the public subnet ID and the idea that was created

73
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.400
using this template could also explore the resources.

74
00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.420
You could also explore the whole stack.

75
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.680
You could also go to the VPC and check whether those resources are there.

76
00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:02.020
Plus, the output from the cloud formation is going to be more than enough in order to confirm that

77
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.880
there is a successful execution of this template.

78
00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:14.190
Now, in the future, you could also use the class automation output to keep track of your configuration

79
00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.990
and if your of deployment in that info.

80
00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:26.760
So in task to know we need to look to the client application layer and this is will happen as well by

81
00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.960
downloading a separate FONTELLA computer called slapdash application.

82
00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.760
And that's fine.

83
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:39.420
If you open it, you will find that this is going to be used to create a web server and that's what

84
00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.380
is going to be used as well with.

85
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:49.680
And just to test inside the VPC, we create just with this our application where we load a demo application

86
00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:54.120
and that's that we've said in an instance we are going to pass basically.

87
00:06:55.370 --> 00:07:01.190
A specific configuration for it as a standard application and the use of data, we would specify the

88
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:07.070
product is likely to my crew and am I we are going to use the script we are going to load in the use

89
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:13.700
of data and what kind of security group afterwards we are going to open the same way we are going to

90
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:18.710
load this to the cloud formation and the stock cloud application.

91
00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:26.660
And you will notice that this will take the network stock name, not network, which means this dependent

92
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.810
on the laughing stock to be created successfully.

93
00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:35.150
And this means it will be created inside the BBC and we will take it in the same way as application

94
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:35.870
inventory.

95
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:40.540
And then we click next and then we create the stock.

96
00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:44.200
Once this happens.

97
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:51.910
Now, this is basically will give us a few minutes until the confirmation completes the execution of

98
00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:55.360
the script and load the web server.

99
00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:00.700
So again, as I said, this time it's very important to tag all the results that you create and enter

100
00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.830
the future you will use on it and to delete.

101
00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:07.420
And also for cost exploration and cost reduction.

102
00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:09.080
So it's a very good effect.

103
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:16.690
Now, this lab application is going to be in creation and in a process, and we will wait for this claim

104
00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:26.880
that you are in the public DNS name of the website in the output tab of the clouds formation system.

105
00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:34.790
Now, once the applications are finished, the execution you will find in the top.

106
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:41.780
That is you are in that we can use to access the main website of the web server.

107
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:45.470
The sample application that we just load inside is of data.

108
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:52.100
Inside the cloud formation is stuck in task number three.

109
00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:57.270
If you look back to the best application, you will find that the security group configured there,

110
00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:59.390
it just only opened for 80.

111
00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:07.460
And now we want to update the stack in order to open for 22 and that updates will happen by uploading

112
00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:15.080
another version of the application and that we will download it instead of 26 to our computer.

113
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:23.380
And now we go back to our cloud formation with the stub club application and then we click update the

114
00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:23.750
update.

115
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:31.150
You can use the current template or you can basically upload it using and you find that we will load

116
00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.490
from our this.

117
00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:40.490
So in our case it's going to be upload file and that file is going to be the file application too and

118
00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:47.390
then click next in the configuration and then click on Update the Stack.

119
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:53.510
So you could wait now for the commission to finish the update on the current stock and you check the

120
00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:56.090
resources and the output as well.

121
00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:00.470
Or you can go to the C2 itself inside.

122
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:07.700
If it's a console, you go to the security group and to check the security group and to confirm that

123
00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:11.140
there is a new update for the inbound code.

124
00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:17.780
The next thing is going to be in this lab after you finish this is to open a class formation designer.

125
00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:26.450
And you can achieve this by going to the left navigation and go to the design of the and from the design

126
00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:33.620
I go to the open local file and you open one of the files that we just downloaded to our computer.

127
00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:40.640
And you can see it will integrate with any other file or adjacent format, and you can also drag and

128
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:47.300
drop the component, all the resources that you need to add in the cloud designer or the information

129
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:48.200
designer.

130
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:55.160
So it's it's up to you to decide how you are going to build the transformation template, whether by

131
00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:01.760
writing the script or by configuring it using the cloud designer tool.

132
00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.700
This is pretty much what we need to do for the slap.

133
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:09.860
The client in the step is going to be to select the stacks that you just created and you delete them

134
00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:10.490
all.

135
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:12.710
You can update them as well.

136
00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:19.250
So physically, after you finish the losses task and the slap to submit the log for to grading.

137
00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:20.450
Thank you for seeing this.

138
00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:20.900
Will do.

139
00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:23.420
And see you and the next one.
