00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:07.920
But guys we really do want to slap the guy did love introduction to another NASA system just to explain

2
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:08.970
a few things here.

3
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.050
In the South, we will do access to management control.

4
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.330
We will create an Amazon elastic phone system.

5
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:23.100
And then we will try to mount that elastic phone system into Amazon, etc. and then we will test the

6
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:30.990
performance of the phone system so that the first thing in the club is to go to the AC to console and

7
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.700
from the AC to console.

8
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.700
We want to go to that security group before doing that.

9
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.430
Just let me show you exactly why we need to do this.

10
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.240
We have a running elastic file system, a client.

11
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.210
You will find that there is a security group for the easy to investors.

12
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.280
That security group.

13
00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.550
What is it you see too?

14
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.680
It will be the source of the communication into our security group that we will attach to the elastic

15
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.400
phone system.

16
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:17.630
So going back to step number eight, step number seven, asking us to copy the security group I.D. So

17
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:24.080
I'm going to copy that ID and say it here and my text editor.

18
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.310
Now, I want to go back and some security group.

19
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:41.340
I need to create a new one and security group should have the targets, which means I'm going to use

20
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.870
it for managing the target.

21
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:50.550
I copied the description and most importantly, don't forget to select that this is going to happen.

22
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:51.100
In the latter.

23
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.860
VPC will add a route and this story is going to be the first.

24
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.160
Now the source of the traffic is going to be that easy to security group.

25
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.500
It will be easy to climb to the front.

26
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.010
Have all your copy.

27
00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.170
Security group that we just copied from that previous.

28
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.860
Just clear the security group and that security group will be used once we cleared the phone system.

29
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.170
Now, in the next task, we will create an elastic phone system.

30
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.640
So we are going to go to the elastic five system console.

31
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.480
And then we created a phone system.

32
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.850
Click on Customize.

33
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.780
Now this is will be original by default.

34
00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.850
You can also selected to be in one.

35
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.810
So on made for the slap but against selected original.

36
00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:04.320
In the state it was $13 asking us to uncheck automatic backup and none for the transition or the lifecycle

37
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.170
policy.

38
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:14.630
Then we need to put a tag in the name here and the tag will be in my best in class system made.

39
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:16.990
Make copy this from here.

40
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:25.120
Just to make sure I put to the right in which VPC is going to be in our lab.

41
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.720
VPC.

42
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:33.640
So in our lab VPC, as we did in the previous class, it has a public and private subnet, one and two.

43
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.930
And we have our public and private subgroup.

44
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.800
I'm going to select a loud VPC to be in a private subnet.

45
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.770
And this is where we normally mount the elastic filesystem unless our application is something.

46
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.840
To access the file system from our public subnet.

47
00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:02.950
However, in this scenario here, I need to make sure that I select the correct security.

48
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.370
And this is with confusing Kim in this slot.

49
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.770
So whether you are going to mount it as a closed system client, which is basically that easy to a security

50
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:17.440
group, which is not correct in this case, but we are going to say that's the closest target.

51
00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.520
And we are going to use it in both.

52
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.740
Mount.

53
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.310
Now click in next.

54
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.340
And then next.

55
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.530
And then it clicked at this step here.

56
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.040
My first file system is created successfully.

57
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.130
I should be able to carry on with up.

58
00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.880
Now in the next step, we are going to connect to the AC too.

59
00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:05.720
So feel free to follow the system if you are using windows or if you are having a mac.

60
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.910
However, I'm going to add this terminal.

61
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.820
To connect.

62
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:16.600
As I show you before, the last user carrying the key is located in this folder CD.

63
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.470
Ended up as a search folder.

64
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.550
So if you do Alaska, you'll find that this lab used them five.

65
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.110
It already existed.

66
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.460
In our system.

67
00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.600
To connect to it, to our AC to we need to go back to our AC to console.

68
00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:44.420
And from our instances we have a running AC to here.

69
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:47.650
Copy the public IP.

70
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:52.670
May I ask the name of the file?

71
00:05:53.120 --> 00:06:02.150
Easy to use that which is the default is a mental organics and I try to click and paste the IP address.

72
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.950
Click, enter, click.

73
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:06.250
Yes.

74
00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.270
And now I am able to connect to the AC to machine.

75
00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:19.080
So you can skip all these steps all the way to the core where we need to create a new directory to mount

76
00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.210
the public system into our system.

77
00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:27.150
So the first thing we need to go in a step 40 is to go to the file system again.

78
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:36.310
And look at the fire system we want to mount and then attach the attach for your DNS is going to give

79
00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:37.360
us a few.

80
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:47.660
Basically if you commenced to run in this particular scenario here, they are going to ask us to install

81
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.700
some elastic for system utility.

82
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.590
However, these should be installed by default in Amazon's index too.

83
00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.820
But just to be sure based.

84
00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:06.250
Now instead of 42, we need to create a new folder called Elastic Cloud System.

85
00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:07.930
You could call this folder anything.

86
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:14.230
But for the sake of this scenario, I'm going to make it the default, which is to make directly elastic

87
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:14.950
close to ten.

88
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:24.420
I'm now going back to the instruction we can use on this client, not in this mountain.

89
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.760
So we copy this command and we paste it again and.

90
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:35.080
Now this it should take a few minutes.

91
00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:42.490
And once we finish, we can get a summary of the available disk space that we have, including the amount

92
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:52.150
targets we just cleared of our system to verify this using the command, the minus page p.

93
00:07:55.670 --> 00:08:02.150
We would like to also to run an excellent i o, which is like a benchmarking tool for Linux just to

94
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.060
see how our client system is behaving.

95
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:10.730
So we want to copy this command here and based it in the new terminal here.

96
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:21.320
And this is would basically generate some output through the file system so we can catch the performance

97
00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.720
of our cloud system from the cloud.

98
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:34.910
The next thing is to basically go back to the services in our system which copy this and now we need

99
00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:37.580
to monitor the performance of our system.

100
00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:45.710
So you can see Mars and Cloud, which is sort of take us to the phone system monitoring page or if the

101
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:53.240
love and affection you need to go to the elastic file system here and select the system for all the

102
00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.760
metrics and we get the system performance.

103
00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:03.360
And we need to select the permitted throughput, which is this idea.

104
00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:09.140
And this is will show us the current performance of our file system.

105
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:19.410
You could also finish the navigation in the Cloud Watch based on step number 56.

106
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:27.660
And you can also check the books and submit all of them and change the graph or examine the stack,

107
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.900
the area or numbers or even box.

108
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.090
Based on your needs.

109
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:34.840
Based on your.

110
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.190
So that's it for the staff.

111
00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:40.310
Thank you for watching this video and see.
