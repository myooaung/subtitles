00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,470
Welcome to Edelweiss.

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:02,910
Cloud Architecting.

3
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:07,860
In this module, we are going to have a look to the course objectives and to the overview.

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:14,940
And then we will study the cafÃ© business case that we will use in our practical lab and challenge labs

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:15,760
to begin.

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:22,410
It is very important to have an understanding of the period exquisite for this course you should complete

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:28,830
by now the eight of us, the cloud practitioner course or similar level of knowledge of Amazon Web Services

8
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:35,160
such as you pass the Edelweiss Certified Cloud Practitioner Certificate Exam, or you completed the

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,290
Canada Practitioner Essential Course, or you completed the Edelweiss technical essential course.

10
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:47,640
In addition to that, we would like you to have a generic I.T. knowledge and I.T. business knowledge

11
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,570
in this course.

12
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:49,950
The solution architect.

13
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,890
We are going to study 15 modules.

14
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,600
We will start by an introduction about a cloud architecting.

15
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,460
Then we will study how we can add to the cafe business a storage layer, a compute layer, a database

16
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:09,450
layer, and how we can create our networking environment in us and how we can manage to connect multiple

17
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,950
VCs in the cloud.

18
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:17,520
Then we will look to securing user and application access, implementing and elastic and highly available

19
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,680
architecture and automate your architecture using a cloud formation.

20
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:29,160
Then we will look to caching content and building decoupled architecture and microservices and serverless

21
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,820
computing.

22
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:35,640
In module 14, we are going to do a planning for this massive and we will take multiple exercises and

23
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:42,660
labs in order to study how we can build highly available and highly scalable, fault, tolerant architecture.

24
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,860
In the last model, we are going to look at the certification process.

25
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:54,690
So the cafe business use case that we are going to use to build all the exercises now and guided and

26
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:58,200
challenged are based about a fictional business case.

27
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:04,500
This business case provides us a way to explore the cloud computing services and to build for real in

28
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,010
the keynote.

29
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:11,730
This scenario is intended to provide an example of the real world application of technical concept that

30
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,020
you will learn.

31
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,980
Frank and Martha opened the cafe and the bakery that they had.

32
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,500
It's a start from a retirement dream.

33
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:25,200
They were not yet ready to live out their retirement around the house, and instead they wanted to do

34
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,820
something that included their love of baking and supplemented their income.

35
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:34,920
They enjoy interacting with people in their neighborhood, and they also like to support the community

36
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,720
events across town with their baked goods and cafes.

37
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:46,980
Frank and Martha recently decided to open their cafe at the base of their flat, their daughter Sophia,

38
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:52,530
and a local school student, Nicole, help out and work at the cafe.

39
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:58,860
Since they opened the cafe, they have experienced an increase in local businesses and they also sometimes

40
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,430
receive inquiries from people who travel through the area.

41
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:08,640
So the cafe owner and stuff, we have a frank the owner, we have the Martha, the owner of the cafe.

42
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,880
We have Sophia, the daughter of a Frank and Martha and Nicole.

43
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,740
We have the cafe employee.

44
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:20,010
We have also Olivia, which is an A.W. Solution architect who recently moved to the downtown area,

45
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:23,850
and she frequently visit the cafe and enjoying talking with Sophia.

46
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:30,630
And they will start to elevate the technical architecture of the cafe based on adding multiple layers

47
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:35,100
to make the cafe website and store highly available and highly scalable.

48
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:40,230
We have also Matthew, which is a system administrator and an engineer, and we have faith, which is

49
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:47,090
a developer experience with this programming interface in the coming lab and exercises, you will gain

50
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:54,630
a hands on practice of building and ADA US services and they will have two different types of lab.

51
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:58,680
We will have the guided lab and the challenges in the guided lab.

52
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,960
They provide you with a step by step instructions.

53
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:06,030
We will provide you with a step by step instruction to help you gain experience in creating and configuring

54
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,210
resources in the different services area.

55
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:14,070
And the Challenge Lab will present you with a new business requirement that are based on the evolving

56
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,840
needs of the cafe.

57
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,810
Both loves the challenge and the guided lab.

58
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,880
They will enhance your technical skills.

59
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:28,290
You will be able to explore more about our services and you will train yourself to build in the cloud.

60
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,140
This course helps you to prepare for the ADA Certified Solution Architect Associate Exam.

61
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:39,780
So after you did to the foundational level, the cloud, the practitioner and you must have for example

62
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:45,480
by now the cloud, the practitioner, it is the time for you to move forward and to study for the solution

63
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,800
architect exam.

64
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,020
Let us move now to study the will.

65
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,430
Architect architected the framework.
