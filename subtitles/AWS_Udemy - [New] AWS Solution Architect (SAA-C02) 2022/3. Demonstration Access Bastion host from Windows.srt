00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,090
Another video about cloud computing.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:09,090
And now in this video, I'm going to explain the process of accessing abortion hosted from a Windows

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:09,750
machine.

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:15,840
So the first thing we want to do is to go and search for putty, a software that we need to download

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,950
to our computer.

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:19,910
Now.

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,370
Then we need to install putty.

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,180
And the process of an installation.

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,760
Just click next, next, next and then finish.

10
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,210
Then we want to go and open potty.

11
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:39,160
Just to see if it is working in a proper way.

12
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:40,720
Now go back to a w.

13
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:45,280
S and copy the public IP address of your version host.

14
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:51,970
Now, if you notice that this partial host is using a keypad name called FOC Key.

15
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:57,820
Now, this is for the people who are using the aquarium labs in the academy.

16
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,470
You need to go to the details and download a PPK file.

17
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,960
Now go back to your party.

18
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:15,640
And what's the username easy to use at the public IP of the bastion host of the easy to in the sense

19
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:22,660
that you want to connect to the go to connection increase the keep alive just basically to keep the

20
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:31,170
session alive for 60 seconds if you are away and in the off now we go to cross and get the baby care

21
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:38,350
fine that we just download to our download folder click open and now click accept.

22
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,180
You are now connected to the bus host.

23
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:50,790
So this is the process that we normally use to access any easy to machine with the public IP address

24
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,910
from policy in Windows.

25
00:01:54,660 --> 00:02:01,200
Now if we want to access a private instance which is in a private subnet similar to what we have in

26
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,630
the Capstone project, what we need to do, the process is very simple.

27
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,300
We need to get again the Bulgarian key or the PPK file for that that you see through.

28
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:18,090
And you notice here that the web server and the Bastion host both use the same key.

29
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,600
Then we need to go to our project.

30
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,660
And download the key.

31
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:36,490
If you did not download the key before or in the previous step, you could go back to the AWOL details

32
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,050
and download the key.

33
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,260
Once we have the key downloaded to our computer.

34
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:54,750
Now we need to go to page and software that should be installed by this tool and we open it.

35
00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:00,680
It will appear to the lower right corner beside the time in view of machine.

36
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:10,650
Now the process to connect to the private server will be simply done by configuring what we call such

37
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,100
passes.

38
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:17,370
So right click on the agent, add a key and then select that up user.

39
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:18,720
A fine.

40
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,410
No, it didn't go to potty.

41
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:29,660
And now from 40, we want to get the IP address of the bus in hospice because this is the only easy

42
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:33,020
to innocence with a public IP address that we can access.

43
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:39,130
Then we will put DC to use it at the public IP address.

44
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:44,930
You could also save that session, so you don't need to keep configure it every time you open 40.

45
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,190
Then go to assess it.

46
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:50,980
Now, this time we're not going to select the PPK file from here.

47
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,690
Only we need to allow Agent 40.

48
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,390
So check that.

49
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:05,820
And now this will allow the patient to pass the keys to the police session and you will be able to connect

50
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,600
to the question.

51
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,080
Host.

52
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:14,970
Now the next step is to access the web server, which basically has only a private ip address.

53
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,200
We need to go and copy the private IP address of the web server.

54
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:29,610
Then we go to the potty session and we put the command as us head, you see to the shooter at the private

55
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:36,420
IP of the web server in the private subnet and click enter.

56
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,640
Now you'll notice here that this is not going to work.

57
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,140
Why?

58
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:46,830
Because if you go to that web server and you check the security group, you will find that we never

59
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:51,870
opened the SSA to traffic to arrive to this.

60
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,140
Easy to understand.

61
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:59,760
So we want to basically create and add the new rule and then we will only allow the traffic to come

62
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:08,520
from the bus host to add an extra layer of security to our private instances in the cloud.

63
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:16,530
Now press control C and now repeat the command again and you will be able to connect successfully to

64
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:17,790
your private instance.

65
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:20,940
You could do alerts and you could do many things here.

66
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,480
Thank you for seeing this video and see you in the next one.
