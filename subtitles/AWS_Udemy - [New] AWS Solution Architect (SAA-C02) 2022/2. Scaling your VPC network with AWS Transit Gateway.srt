1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,520
As you grow the number of work load that's done in the US, you must be able to scale your network across

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:13,290
multiple accounts and VPC to keep up with that growth, you can use VPC peering to connect pairs of

3
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,040
the bases.

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:21,270
However, it can be operationally costly and difficult to manage a point to point connectivity specifically

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:26,610
that each the pieces need to make a specific point to point connection.

6
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:34,020
The same IP address that you use for BBC A is not going to be repeated in the same in the second VPC,

7
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,700
which is BBC me.

8
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,220
If you cannot centrally manage those connectivity policy, it will be very, very difficult to keep

9
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,380
up with multiple connection.

10
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:49,620
So when you have an unappealing connectivity, you must attach your VPN to each individual VPC and this

11
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:56,370
solution can be time consuming to build and very difficult to manage when the number of the pieces grows

12
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,110
into the hundreds.

13
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:04,860
So it is very important to consider how large your environment might become over time and how will it

14
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:09,210
in the scale and how you will organize your VPC to solve this problem.

15
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:16,140
You can use the as a transit gateway, which can simplify your networking margin.

16
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,770
So what is the U.S. Transit Gateway?

17
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:27,660
Transit Gateway is a service that enables you to connect your VPC and on premises and networks to a

18
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,680
single gateway.

19
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,110
So it will be a single hub of connection.

20
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,820
It is a fully managed, highly available with the flexible routing services.

21
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:41,640
It can act as a hub for all traffic to flow through between your networks.

22
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:49,050
You can connect up to 5000 VCs and on a premises in 30 minutes with a single gateway.

23
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:54,880
So let us look to a scenario where we have to connect multiple VPC to connect multiple PS.

24
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,500
VPC is using LW as a transit gateway.

25
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,270
Consider this scenario You want to fully connect three devices in your network.

26
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:11,400
You learn how to deploy the transit gateway and the three VPC with non-overlapping IP address and make

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:19,440
sure to remember that guys in the exam, those non-overlapping IP addresses must be in a single region.

28
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,920
You then attach the transit gateway to these VPC.

29
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:27,510
So the first step for connecting multiple PCs is to create a transit gateway.

30
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:33,450
That is, transit gateway will act as a hub that you can use to interconnect your PCs.

31
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:41,430
And on premise data center is a transit gateway in this case will need an elastic network interface

32
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,790
which are deployed into that subnet.

33
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:53,940
So as you can see here in each VPC, when VPC two and VPC three, we have a specific network interface

34
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,290
that we are going to use.

35
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:02,160
You must ensure that every availability zone that is part of the VPC has that.

36
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:09,720
E and I now after you do attach DE and I, the next step is to add a route to the VPC roundtable to

37
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,420
send the traffic which can be destined for other devices in the network.

38
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,550
To that, it's on that gateway.

39
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,510
So you can see here VPC three routing.

40
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:26,970
We are saying the IP address in the 0.0.0/8.

41
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:31,650
The target is the GW Transit Gateway.

42
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:39,390
If you notice here that this network, the ten 20.068 included in it everything we need for the others

43
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:49,830
to either block it has the IP ten .2.0.0 and in the 1.0.0 you must now configure the transit gateway,

44
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,070
our table to routed traffic to the connected VPC.

45
00:03:53,070 --> 00:04:00,510
In this table, when you create a transit gateway in that default transit gateway routing in each note

46
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:08,040
in the transit gateway must enable the transit gateway to send this traffic distance for one of the

47
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,830
VCs to a corresponding attachment.

48
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:18,060
So you can see now in the transit gateway at all table, we are saying if you want to reach ten .1.020

49
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:26,070
slash 16, then you need to go to VPC, attach one if you want to reach standard 0.23.0.0.

50
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:31,710
With this nice 16, the VPC will be in the VPC attach three.

51
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:36,930
You can use the ABC Transit Gateway to connect to multiple, multiple VPC.

52
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:41,610
You can also use it to achieve isolation in your VPC environment.

53
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:47,940
In this particular scenario, you want to connect your VPN source to your VPC environment.

54
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:54,540
You want also to prevent your VPC from directly connecting to each other, leaving the VPN to decide

55
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:59,850
if this traffic from one DBC has to be forwarded to another by sitting.

56
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:07,370
Up the table in a proper way, the transit gate where you can prevent information sharing between those

57
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,150
the ABC.

58
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:14,810
So as you can see here in this diagram, we have a VPN connection and we want to update the rail table

59
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:20,220
in the transit gateway to send to send all unknown traffic to that VPN connection.

60
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:26,420
In this particular scenario, we are going to put in the transit gateway at our table for any other

61
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,160
IP.

62
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:30,090
The target will be the VPN connection.

63
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:37,450
So this is how you create an area as a transit gateway and achieve a VPC isolation.

64
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:43,490
In this activity, you have finally PCs that you want to connect to each other through a transit gateway.

65
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:50,270
You can go and start to think what routes are necessary to add each of the VPC at our table to enable

66
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:56,600
for connectivity and what routes are necessary to add to the transit gateway are all table to enable

67
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:02,660
full connectivity, and you will find that in the VPC three, for example, we are going to say any

68
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:12,200
traffic, the distance to the ten 000/a goal to to to the transit gateway because this IP is the address

69
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,160
summarization for all the peaks that we have in this diagram.

70
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:23,510
You can also look that in the transit gateway at all table, we are going to specify each VPC subnet

71
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:29,990
IP and we specify the VPC attachment to be the target of that traffic.

72
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:35,690
Now what about if we want to connect our RBCs to a supported US services?

73
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:40,700
The first thing you want to think of is VPC endpoints, and this is really important.

74
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:45,770
For the example, they would love to ask about BBC endpoint all the time.

75
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:54,830
A VPC endpoints enable you to privately connect your VPC to supported services and to VPC endpoint services

76
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,700
that are powered by a US private link.

77
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:06,860
The endpoint, which are powered by the private link, include some services, and those services might

78
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:13,100
be hosted by either a customer or even as part of the VPC.

79
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:21,080
Endpoints do not require an internet gateway or not device or a VPN connection or ADX direct connect

80
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,770
connection.

81
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:28,070
In instances in your VPC do not require a public IP address to communicate with resources in the service,

82
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:34,010
and the traffic between your VPC and other service does not leave the Amazon network.

83
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,920
Those endpoint are virtual devices.

84
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,870
They are horizontally scaled, redundant and highly available endpoint.

85
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:49,850
Allow communication between instances in your VPC services without imposing availability, risk or bandwidth

86
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:54,260
constraints in your network traffic in either use.

87
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,840
There are two types of VPC involved.

88
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:04,760
There is the interface endpoint, which is an elastic network interface with a private IP address.

89
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:13,130
That IP address serves as an entry point for the traffic that is distant to a supported service interface.

90
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:18,070
Endpoints enable you to connect to services that are powered by a WAC private.

91
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:26,030
You normally the owner of the service is the service provider and there is the principal who basically

92
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:28,190
create the interface endpoint.

93
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,080
You are the service consumer.

94
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,900
The second time is the gateway endpoint.

95
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:40,130
The gateway endpoint is a gateway that you specify as a target for a route in your table, and the route

96
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:48,830
is for the traffic that is distant to support the services like Amazon Acidity and Amazon Dynamo, which

97
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:54,110
are supported both by Gateway, End Point and VPC endpoint.

98
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:58,430
Guys, there is no hourly or data processing charge.

99
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,890
You will be billed for each hour of that.

100
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:08,060
Your VPC endpoint remain a provisioned in each of these zone regardless of the state of its association

101
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,020
with the service.

102
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:15,140
The hourly billing for your VPC endpoint will stop when you delete it, and the hourly billing will

103
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:23,120
also stop if the endpoint service owner rejects your VPC endpoints attachment to their services.

104
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:30,170
For doing this, make sure you understand the two types of BBC endpoint and make sure to remember that

105
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:38,300
Amazon AC three and Amazon Dynamo TV are supported by a gateway endpoint, not an interface endpoint.

106
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:43,520
How you set up an interface and want to set up an interface endpoint.

107
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,290
Follow these general steps from the Amazon VPC console.

108
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:55,250
Specify the name of the service endpoint services or the NWS marketplace service you want to connect

109
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:55,490
to.

110
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:59,710
Then choose the VPC where you want to create the interface endpoint you.

111
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:03,610
Specify more than one subnet in different zone.

112
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:11,020
Doing so helps you to ensure that your interface endpoint is resilient to availability zone failures.

113
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:18,820
Choose a subnet in your VPC that will use the interface endpoint enabled by domain name system for the

114
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,360
endpoint.

115
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:25,060
If you are going to use a gateway and this will enable you to make a request to the service by using

116
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,680
its default DNS name.

117
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:32,680
Specify the security group to associate with the network interface and that security group rules will

118
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,620
control the traffic to the endpoint network interface.

119
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,570
Primary sources in your VPC.

120
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:45,610
If you do not specify a security group, the default security of the BBC remember that it will be the

121
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:51,370
VPC itself security group which will be implemented to the BBC.

122
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,550
End Point.

123
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:58,210
This is an example about how you can use the VPC when you create an interface endpoint.

124
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:03,580
The endpoint is specified DNS hostnames which are generated that you can use to go in, engage with

125
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:11,650
the services and either a service and as marketplace partner services and also a private DNS option

126
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,570
which can be enabled by default.

127
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:20,080
In this example, you will see that the hosted zone contains a record set for the default DNS name.

128
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:24,100
Now just remember here the hostage zone is the Route 53.

129
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:30,500
So if you are not familiar with the concept of hostage zone, go back and see the demo doing the Route

130
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:35,020
63 and how you can create a hostage zone and configure DNS record.

131
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:40,570
So in this particular scenario, the hostage zone will create a record set for the default DNS name

132
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:41,630
for the service.

133
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:48,580
For example, you can call it a kinesis built us east one, but Amazon did com which resolves to the

134
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,910
private IP address of the endpoint network interface.

135
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:58,630
And this enables your application to make requests to the service using its default DNS hostname.

136
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:04,990
And this allow your existing application to make requests done either a service through the interface

137
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,980
endpoint without requiring any configuration changes.

138
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:16,570
In this example, there is an interface in endpoint for Amazon Kinesis data stream and an endpoint network

139
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,490
interface in subnet.

140
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:24,780
Number two, private DNS for the interface endpoint has not been enabled and in instances in either

141
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:30,520
subnet can send a request to Amazon Kinesis through the interface endpoint.

142
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:38,770
Using the endpoint is specific DNS hostname in instances in subnet, one can communicate with Amazon

143
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:43,090
Kinesis HCM over that public IP address.

144
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:49,030
There is also another example where you can use a private DNS for the endpoint, which can be enabled

145
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:56,920
by the same way any instances in either subnet can use either the default DNS hostname or the endpoint

146
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:05,440
the specific DNS hostname to send request Amazon Kinesis data stream through the interface endpoint.

147
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,170
