00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.400
Now let us look to the cost optimization of Amazon.

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.730
Easy to know when.

3
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:06.470
Easy too.

4
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.850
We have multiple pricing model.

5
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.860
We have the on demand instance where you pay by the hour or the second.

6
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.580
If you are using a Linux operating system which are not suitable for long term commitment or a steady

7
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.520
workload, they are more suitable if you have, for example, Adventist environment where you want to

8
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.760
create a machine to do a little bit of experiment.

9
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:37.830
We have also the reserved instance and those are very good if you want to have a long term commitment

10
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:44.700
for one year or three year, specifically, if you have a steady workload that is to do with a cloud

11
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.570
like a customer.

12
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.420
He come to you and he is in business for ten years and you want to create move to the cloud.

13
00:00:51.690 --> 00:01:00.360
In this case, a reserved instance will be very suitable because he can get up to 75% discount off the

14
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.710
on demand price.

15
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.550
But it is a startup company and that they want to trial the product and they will see whether the product

16
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.260
is going to be successful or not.

17
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:16.550
In this case, the spot instance or the on demand instance are more suitable.

18
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:25.800
Spot instances are more useful if you are looking to have emerging compute need for a few hours or a

19
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.670
few days and you don't need those images to be or the those easy to innocence to be for long term.

20
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.490
Those spot instances can be interrupted and your price for those is both.

21
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.090
In a sense, it's good to be outbid by another customer of a W for dedicated host.

22
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:52.890
You are going to get a physical server with easy to instance capacity fully dedicated to your use.

23
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.980
Now normally we use dedicated host to meet a compliant and the regulation requirement.

24
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.670
Specifically, if we have a sensitive data like we are dealing with data science information, you could

25
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:14.580
also create dedicated instances and those are going to run in your own VPC in educated hardware, not

26
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.900
as shared hardware.

27
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.290
You could also make a reserve this casualty instance where you can purchase the capacity for one year,

28
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:29.700
but you want those instances to be available in a specific day like you one day in instances from 9

29
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.320
a.m. into 5 p.m. every Monday of that week.

30
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:41.220
So every week you'll have the machine available to you and you don't need it in the last days of the

31
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.520
week.

32
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.880
Now we have to understand that an on demand instance is more suited for low cost and the flexibility

33
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.860
spot instances are very good.

34
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:56.460
When you have a large scale dynamic workload reserve instance, you normally need them.

35
00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:04.410
If you can predict and you have a defined capacity you need that you want to meet and the dedicated

36
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:11.460
host, you can basically use it to save money in licensing or you want to meet a compliance and regulatory

37
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:12.480
requirements.

38
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.690
Keep in mind the use cases for on demand.

39
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.860
They are a short term spiky or unpredictable workload.

40
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.000
Spot instances are more suited for application with the flexibility.

41
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.210
Where do you want to start and stop at any time?

42
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:33.720
You reserved an instance when you have a steady state or a predictable usage that indicated, in instance,

43
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:40.820
when you want to have and to bring your own license, for example, you have already purchased a sequence

44
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:47.220
server license and you want to have a dedicated instance so you can install your own license.

45
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:54.210
And this is the only choice where you will be able to access the course of the actual instances and

46
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.960
the socket.

47
00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:04.140
And also you can have pair VM software licenses if needed and you can also address specific corporate

48
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.420
compliance and regulatory requirements in interview us.

49
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.970
There is four pillars, of course, optimization having the right size where you choose the right balance

50
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:21.240
between the instance type and the application need, and you have the ability to increase and decrease

51
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:27.260
the elasticity, as we will see later on in the last module when we use ultra scaling.

52
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:34.830
You want also to recognize the available price option and analyze your cost and usage pattern in order

53
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.680
to have the right mix of repricing option.

54
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:47.640
I always prefer to have a 20% of my capacity met by an on demand instance and 80% of my capacity needs

55
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.410
met by ED.

56
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:57.090
You could also look to optimize this storage choice and this is very important to reduce the use storage

57
00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.400
or the overhead as possible.

58
00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.480
Me.

59
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.340
You can choose a less expensive storage option.

60
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.000
You can have a storage option that met your requirements.

61
00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.790
And the this is stored its performance.
