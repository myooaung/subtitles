WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.760
Now go to the Council of Aid, WIC, and from the council we want to go to the cloud formation.

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.010
In the cloud formation console, you have multiple choice of how you want to create a new start.

3
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.500
Whether you want created from a template that you have already or you want to create it from a quick

4
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.560
start guide, or even you can use the designer.

5
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.820
So let me show you first.

6
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:28.020
The designer is basically a graphical user interface where you can map resources or drag and drop resources

7
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.330
from the left side of the NWC.

8
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.520
Resources here likes to, for example, I want an easy to understand so you can basically create a launch

9
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.230
template you can recreate and network around depending on your need.

10
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.600
Now remember, you have to be very careful about how you create those.

11
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.050
So for example, here I create the VPC and that VPC will be used for my easy to in instances and so

12
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:49.200
on.

13
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.730
I'm not going to show you how to use the UI of the cloud formation.

14
00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:02.190
I just want you to know how it look like if you have a so let me go back now to my s cloud formation

15
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.760
console.

16
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.450
I will click on Create I Resources and I have two resources or I have two options here with a new resources

17
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.760
from scratch or with the existing resources.

18
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.950
This is a click on the new resources.

19
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.410
As you can see, we have multiple options.

20
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.780
We can use the template in designer we created there and then this is will be used to build the stack

21
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.090
or we can use a sample template which is the quickstart or we have a template ready and this can be

22
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.060
uploaded from our computers or from Amazon.

23
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.350
S3 You are.

24
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.980
And so you only need pass that you are not described.

25
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.130
If you click here and use sample template, you will find multiple template there.

26
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:44.250
There is the Lambda Stack, which we used for deploying the dynamic website for the cafe query our Ruby

27
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.050
on rails going to create WordPress and there is also multi easy deployment for this.

28
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.510
And even if you are looking for something running on Windows, you can run cloud formation templates

29
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.080
for Active Directory in Windows or some Windows features.

30
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.210
And for this demo I'm going to select the WordPress blog and then I will click next.

31
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:10.170
However, you can also view this in and the designer in the graphical user interface just to see exactly

32
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.420
what this thing is going to create for you.

33
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.700
You can see here we have a web server.

34
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.280
It's an obvious easy to understand and we have a web server security group assemble as that below.

35
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.500
It can show you the Jason output of this template or that YAML file of this template.

36
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.280
So this is how it looks like the cloud formation in the template.

37
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.650
For example, here we have a parameter which we need to provide the key name and that name.

38
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:41.160
It will be a name of an existing easy to keep here in sense instances time we are looking also for a

39
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.050
parameter for the instance side.

40
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.480
So we want the user to give us what is this side of his easy to in a sense when we create that we've

41
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.600
said about if the user provided no value, the default will be use.

42
00:02:53.610 --> 00:03:00.630
If you scroll down, you can see also some description that you can use for that parameter of the instance

43
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.990
type.

44
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:07.260
No, the assistance location this is will describe the IP address range that can be used to us and said

45
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.820
to this easy to understand.

46
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.260
So you can see here and the IP you could also specify the DB name.

47
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.690
So the DP name values it's going to be, which are basically the resource that we are going to create

48
00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:19.980
in this template.

49
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.660
So let me just move this a bit or make it a big ask now about other things.

50
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:32.880
We have the DB name value the DB use the DB password, the root password, and now we do the mapping.

51
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.950
Now this mapping, we can use it depending on which environment we are running this.

52
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.290
Are we running this in a production or in.

53
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.510
And here they are using just to map the architecture of the easy to in essence, it's nothing really

54
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.310
more than mapping between the different type of architecture that we have.

55
00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:56.280
If you go even further, you can also run this template in multiple region.

56
00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.330
And for each region we are basically providing a mapping.

57
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:06.240
So if we are running this in EFA South one, this is the idea that you want to use, you know, that

58
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.170
the employee IDs, they are different from region to another.

59
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:16.380
If we look for example, in EU West one, which is the Irish region, you can see we are using this

60
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:23.550
I but in the US East we are using different -- I.D. Now the resource in the resources section, we

61
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.160
are just specifying what kind of resources we are going to build using this term.

62
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:34.920
So we have a web server security group, the type of it is a security group and now we specify the property.

63
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.380
What is the description of this security group and what are the security group?

64
00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.070
Ingress or inbound?

65
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.290
So ingress refers to the inbound route.

66
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:49.890
We are saying we want to open for 80 for any IP and we want to open port as a search from as a search

67
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.870
location, which is the parameter we define in the previous section in the previous block.

68
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.060
The second resource is the web server.

69
00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.910
We say type the easy to understand and the.

70
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:06.310
The data of it is only a script we are going to load, which is a cloud formation in it or any issues.

71
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.410
And we will I will show you now where is this?

72
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.280
This kind of script is located for the configuration sits.

73
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.140
We want to install a WordPress a using the cloud formation.

74
00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:23.260
So we will install the cloud formation template, install WordPress and we want to configure WordPress.

75
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:29.020
If you keep going, you can see the template is very large, but most of these blocks you we need to

76
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.480
build them in excavated manner so you don't need to build everything from scratch all the time.

77
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.760
So in the services here we are just specifying the services that we are going to use.

78
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:46.480
Once we do install the cloud formation, then we have installed WordPress and then this is what we need

79
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.930
to do.

80
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:53.830
Once we start to enter the stage of configuring WordPress, we want to set the password, want to create

81
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:59.530
a database and finally we want to configure the WordPress using this command.

82
00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.700
And already this command is referring to a script inside the C2 machine.

83
00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:10.090
Once the easy to is successfully vanish and to create the properties here we are passing the image ID

84
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:16.240
so we need to find in my being in the above when I show you the image ID which does depend on the region.

85
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.530
So we need to map that.

86
00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:22.990
We also want to map the instance target from the upper meters and the security group and the key name.

87
00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.810
And finally, we have the output section.

88
00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.810
In the output section we want to print the public.

89
00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:32.170
You are in the WordPress that we just to create.

90
00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:36.700
So this is going to display in the cloud formation and stack the result of the declaration.

91
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:43.060
So let me go back now and I just selected WordPress blog and I click on the next no in the parameter

92
00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.440
here they want to ask are they asking us about WordPress DB name.

93
00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.460
You can change this.

94
00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.440
That's one the first parameter we have.

95
00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:54.580
We also asked to enter the stack name, so I'm going to create a demo here.

96
00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:55.810
The DB password.

97
00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:00.760
You can use any password that you want, but you have to remember this password because you will use

98
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:07.030
it later on to tell WordPress how to connect to the ADRs or to the DB that you create.

99
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:13.330
So I'm going to put Love Dash password to hopefully this will work for this demo and for the DB password.

100
00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.330
We are going to put the same lab dash password.

101
00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:22.090
Now the DB user, you can use the admin account so you can create an admin account.

102
00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.500
This is going to be the user for the DB or you can choose a route.

103
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:31.510
Now you can see here from the instance time in the parameter, I could select any instance type that

104
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:31.900
I want.

105
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:35.170
So I'm going to select you to medium and the key name here.

106
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:38.500
It will give me a list of all the key pairs that I have.

107
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.580
And in this particular scenario, add the I have the aquarium key.

108
00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:50.440
I have also the options to change this from any IP maybe to my IP or to a specific subnet depending

109
00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.830
on how I want to deploy this cloud formation.

110
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:55.180
Simply click on the next.

111
00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:58.390
Now in the next to you can configure a stock option.

112
00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:00.920
These are for the cloud formation stack.

113
00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:02.410
It's not for the template.

114
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:06.250
You can specify the name, you can call this, for example, demo.

115
00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.240
Now the permission.

116
00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:13.750
If you need any specific role, a name or you can pass the role Amazon resource name, which is the

117
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:14.590
unique idea.

118
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:21.760
Now what what will happen when we do a have a stack and that the stack will be filled you have to behavior

119
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:27.340
once the creation of this stack the first one you roll back also create a stack resources, which means

120
00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.890
you don't need to create anything with a to create everything.

121
00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:37.360
And if you fail to create this second option, you preserve those resources that they were created successfully

122
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.140
in rollback.

123
00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:44.440
You won't have the whole cloud formation stack, if any of the resource, the creation fail in the second

124
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:44.710
one.

125
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:50.230
If for example, you are building a web server to an there the creation of the RB as fail, you are

126
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:56.290
going to see the easy to along and later maybe you can fix and modify the class formation template in

127
00:08:56.290 --> 00:09:01.600
order to build the idea successfully, just give it to the default and then we click on the next.

128
00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:05.500
No in the last step is going to show me the demo.

129
00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:11.950
We specify a template and that template you are only as the description of the template and sometimes

130
00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:17.370
in the root account you are doing this from a root account or from an IM admin user.

131
00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:23.020
It can give you the total estimated cost here using the easy to cost optimization service.

132
00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:28.870
And these are the parameters that I just passed and all the configuration, all I need to do is to create

133
00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:29.370
this that.

134
00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:34.690
So once you do create a stack, this is will create the stack and that is stack.

135
00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:41.530
You can see I have an error here in the DB passport because you need to use only alpha and numeric characters

136
00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:42.850
in a very simple way.

137
00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:47.080
You can create a change set for your configuration and that changes it.

138
00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:53.890
You can basically have it nested or if you don't want it to be nested, which means v111, overview,

139
00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:59.860
1.2 and so on, you can just to create a gen set and in the chance that you can go back and provide.

140
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:01.660
Modification to the pyramid.

141
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:07.850
So I'm going to go in the previous stop here in the DB password and iPod dash password.

142
00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:14.510
So we need to put only love password because this is only alpha matlab and we will try now to create

143
00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:15.980
again this stack.

144
00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:19.310
And if we have an error, the class automation is going to tell me here.

145
00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:23.960
Now the class formation template is any creation as you can see from the status.

146
00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:29.120
So you can see here there is multiple things, there is the stock demo information, the events, what

147
00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:29.870
is happening.

148
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:31.970
So now it is creating the observer.

149
00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:37.520
It managed to create the Web security group successfully and you can verify this by just going to the

150
00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.170
security group in another top.

151
00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:45.440
So go to VPC in a new tab now and you will be able to see if you go to security group that the security

152
00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:50.690
group, which is the security group for the demo, is already created with inbound rules.

153
00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:56.210
Go back to your cloud formation and you can see now in the resources it will print out the resources

154
00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:58.640
that it was managed to create it successfully.

155
00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:04.370
So here we have a easy to security group created create complete and we still have the alias easy to

156
00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:10.460
in this sense the output is the section where you want to wait to see that you are in or of the world

157
00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:16.460
of the press in the parameters you are going to see what you have has as part of meters to the cloud

158
00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:17.630
formation template.

159
00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:22.400
In the template itself, you are going to read the template that you just used to create.

160
00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:27.230
This is back and whether you want to use it in designer or to see it in the designer or you can just

161
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:35.000
see it the chance it is the one you can going to create to provide different modification for this template

162
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.880
depending on your need and in the update.

163
00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:43.910
So if you look here to the main event, this is will take a few minutes to launch and the easy to configure

164
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:49.580
it and also install and configure the WordPress based on the template system step that I described just

165
00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:51.050
a few minutes ago.

166
00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:53.030
So we need to wait for all of this to finish.

167
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:55.730
So let us pause now until this event.

168
00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:58.790
Give us all of the output print out there.

169
00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:01.010
Want to place your or the event here?

170
00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:06.950

171
00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:12.830
