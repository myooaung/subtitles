00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.840
Welcome back.

2
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.080
We are going to speak today about relational database.

3
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.500
In this lesson, you will learn and understand the different database services in the cloud and you

4
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.060
will discover the differences between and managed and managed database solution.

5
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:21.060
Then we will understand the difference between structured query language and no sequence database.

6
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.420
Then we will compare the availability differences of alternative database solution in use.

7
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.280
You can have two types of category of database system.

8
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:37.260
Whether you choose unmanaged or managed services in unmanaged services, you will be responsible for

9
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.170
scaling fault tolerance and availability of the database system in many services.

10
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.430
Scaling tolerance and availability are typically built in into this EMRs, or we call them a platform

11
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.600
as a service.

12
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:58.500
So let us look to the challenges of running a relational database system on a premises data center.

13
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.110
When you run your own relational database, you are responsible for several administrative tasks, such

14
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.030
as server maintenance, software, installation and patching database backups.

15
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.670
You are also responsible for ensuring high availability and the planning for the scalability.

16
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:21.510
The data security and operating system on installation and batching all of these tasks is your responsibility.

17
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:29.520
Amazon Ah, this is a managed service that systems and operates a relational database in the cloud.

18
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.690
You manage the application optimization and NWS manages the OS installation and the PATCHES database

19
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.810
software installation and patches database backup, high availability, scaling the power and racking

20
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.320
and stacking of the servers and the server maintenance in the process are this you have multiple option

21
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.600
to create a database instance.

22
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.200
Your database instance is an isolated database environment that can contain multiple user to create

23
00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.860
a database.

24
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:06.010
It can be accessed by using the same tools and application that you use with a standalone database instances.

25
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.230
The resources in a database innocence are determined by its database.

26
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:17.700
Instance, a class and the type of a storage is dedicated for you database instance, database instances

27
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.210
and the storage different performance characteristics and the pricing model of them which enable you

28
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.530
to customize your performance and cost to the needs of your database.

29
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.710
When you choose to create a database instance, you must first specify which database engine to run.

30
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:41.820
Amazon Autodesk currently supports six databases in my sequel Amazon, Aurora, Microsoft Sequel Server,

31
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:49.890
Postgres, Maria, DB and Oracle database you can create an art is a highly available database multi

32
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:50.910
A-Z deployment.

33
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:57.150
One of the most powerful features of Amazon out of this is the ability to configure your database instance

34
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.480
for high availability with a multi easy deployment.

35
00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:07.860
After multi edit deployment is configured, Amazon orders automatically generates a standby copy of

36
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.720
the database instance in another availability zone within the same VPC.

37
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:19.080
After seeding the database copy transaction are synchronously replicated to the standby copy.

38
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:25.650
Running a database instance in multi easy deployment can enhance the availability during a planned system

39
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:32.070
maintenance and it can help protect your database against database instance failure and availability

40
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.180
zone distribution.

41
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:40.590
It is very important to understand when we need to use and when we don't need to use an artist's.

42
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.410
You use Amazon orders when your application requires a complex transaction or a complex a query, which

43
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:52.410
means it's dealing with a structured query language with a relational database system where there is

44
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.300
relationship between entity.

45
00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:03.240
When you have a medium to high query, alright, rate up to 30,000 or 15,000 reads plus 15,000.

46
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:09.040
Tonight when you have more than one single worker node or SHA, you are not using shard.

47
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.920
In this case you can use all of this.

48
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.720
If you are using SHA, then you have to go and install your own database system and win.

49
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.930
Hide your ability is a must in your application.

50
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.460
You don't use Amazon orders when your application requires a massive read write.

51
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:30.690
For example 150,000 writes per second when sharding is mandatory in your application because you have

52
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:36.510
to use your own sharding technique with your database system when you need to deal with your data using

53
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:43.860
a simple gate or portal request and the queries, the data with no sequel database system or a relational

54
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.190
database management system, which is very customized.

55
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.320
So if you have a customized version of a database engine that you need to install, in this case, you

56
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.470
have to go and install your own database system.

57
00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.850
Amazon Aurora is another product of a WAC, so what is?

58
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.450
Is Amazon, Aurora.

59
00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.970
Amazon.

60
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:08.230
Aurora is a sequel and Pulse Cigarettes sequel compatible relational database that is built for the

61
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.650
cloud.

62
00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:14.950
It combines the performance and availability of high end commercial databases with the simplicity and

63
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.110
cost effectiveness of open source database.

64
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:24.700
You can use Amazon order to reduce your database cost while improving the reliability and availability

65
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.340
of the database as a fully managed service.

66
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:32.800
Aurora is designed to automate time consuming tasks like a provisioning patching, backup recovery,

67
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.310
failure detection and.

68
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:35.290
Amazon.

69
00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.340
Aurora has several features.

70
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:43.570
In Amazon, Aurora is a highly scalable performance and cost effective managed relational database.

71
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.300
Aurora offers a distributed, high performance storage subsystem using Amazon.

72
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:53.260
Aurora can reduce your database costs while improving the reliability of the database.

73
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.990
Aurora is also designed to be highly available.

74
00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.530
It has fault, tolerant and self-healing storage built for the cloud.

75
00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:06.880
Aurora replicates multiple copies of your data across multiple availability zone, and it continuously

76
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.910
backs up your data to Amazon as city.

77
00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:16.000
In Amazon, Aurora, you have multiple levels of security which are available, including network isolation,

78
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:23.280
your own Amazon VPC encryption for the data at risk by using keys that you create and control it through

79
00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.150
a key management service.

80
00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.350
And you can also encrypt of the data in transit by using a secure socket.

81
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:36.040
Amazon Aurora database engine is compatible with existing Ms. Equal and Postgres Open Source database

82
00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.230
and adds compatibility for new releases inadequate basis.

83
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:46.390
Amazon Aurora is a fully managed by Amazon are the Aurora automates database management tasks such as

84
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:51.640
hardware, provisioning, software, patching, set up configuration or backup of the database.

85
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:58.180
Now let us look to Amazon Dynamo DB in Amazon Dynamo DB, which is a no sequel database.

86
00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:03.940
So what is the difference between relational and non relational databases?

87
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:10.930
Relational database are these works with structured data that is organized by table records and columns.

88
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:17.470
Are these establish a well-defined relationship between database table like a teacher to many students,

89
00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:24.040
as students are taught by one teacher, we use nonlinear structure the query language to query the database,

90
00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:29.170
which is the standard user application and provide a programming interface for that data.

91
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:35.530
With relational database, you might have difficulty scaling out horizontally or working with semi-structured

92
00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:39.910
data, which means you have to think about another religion.

93
00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:44.170
And another relational database is any database that does not follow.

94
00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:48.910
The relational model that is provided by traditional relational database management assistant.

95
00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:55.120
Non relational database have grown in popularity because they were designed to overcome the limitation

96
00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:59.890
of relational database for handling the demand of variable structured data.

97
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:06.370
Non relational databases scales out horizontally and they can work with any structured and semi-structured

98
00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:07.930
data in Amazon Dynamo.

99
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:15.880
DB We can create a flexible and fast, highly scalable with virtually unlimited storage, where a team

100
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:22.270
can have differing attributes with low latency creating, where you have the ability to scale the read

101
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:25.390
and write is the core component of Dynamo.

102
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:28.650
DB Are tables, items and assets.

103
00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:35.770
Items are a group of attributes that is uniquely identifiable among all other items.

104
00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:41.200
Attributes are fundamental data element, something that does not need to be broken down.

105
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.510
Any fear of this dynamo?

106
00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.970
Do we support two different kinds of primary keys?

107
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:51.820
The partition key, which is assembly primary key, which is composed of one attribute called the solid

108
00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:52.240
key.

109
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:59.200
And the partition key and the source key are also known as composite primary key, which is composed

110
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.550
of two attributes.

111
00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:03.130
Now let us look to Amazon Redshift.

112
00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:08.590
Amazon Redshift is our first fully managed data warehousing that make it simple and cost effective.

113
00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:14.440
To analyze all your data by using standard sequel and your existing business, intelligence to analytics

114
00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.210
is important for business today.

115
00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.960
Building a data warehousing is a complex and expensive data warehouse.

116
00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:24.340
It can take months and significant financial resources to setup with Amazon.

117
00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:30.310
Redshift is a fast and powerful, fully managed data warehousing that is simple and cost effective to

118
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:32.050
set up use and scale.

119
00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:38.410
It enables you to run complex analytics securely against beta microstructure data by using sophisticated

120
00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:44.380
the query optimization column and out of storage on high performance, local disk and massively parallel

121
00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:45.310
data processing.

122
00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:47.920
Most results come back in second.

123
00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.040
Amazon Redshift contains two types of node.

124
00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:56.620
We have the leader node which manages communication with the client to programs and all communication

125
00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:57.970
with compute nodes.

126
00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:59.800
The compute nodes pass and.

127
00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:05.870
Develop the plans to carry out database operations, specifically this series of steps that are needed

128
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:06.800
to be obtained.

129
00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.510
The result of a complex.

130
00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:15.560
It queries leader and it compiles code for individual elements of the plan and assigns the code to individual

131
00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:22.070
compute nodes, compute and run the compile code and send an intermediate results back to the leader

132
00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:24.230
node for final aggregation.

133
00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.500
Like other services, you only pay for what you use.

134
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:35.690
You can get a started for as little as $0.25 per hour, and at scale, Amazon Redshift can deliver storage

135
00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:40.700
and processing of approximately $1,000 per terabyte per year.

136
00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:48.140
So Amazon Redshift is a fast, fully managed data warehousing service, easily scale with no downtime.

137
00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:54.410
It's support column in our storage and parallel processing architecture and automatically and continuously

138
00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:58.460
monitor the cluster and decryption is a built in feature.

139
00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:01.040
Thank you for seeing this video and see you in the next one.
