1
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:07,680
So we can go into this lab which has a scale and load balance your application.

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:15,000
And we know from the previous classes or from Lab five, the last thing we did was basically to create

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,810
the scenario.

4
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:22,380
We create a web server with a security group that is speak with a multi easy deployment of an art of

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:22,740
this.

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,290
Now we want to basically make this architecture beside it is highly attainable.

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,270
We want it to be load balancing and auto escape.

8
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:39,960
So this means we are going to add application load balancer because this is our server and we will add

9
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:47,970
as well and a scanner and then we will move the chipset of about a from the public subnet to the private

10
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:51,120
subnet to give it more and excellent air of security.

11
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:58,350
So the first thing we need to do, guys, in this lab is to create an am I from the current AC two that

12
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:58,770
we have.

13
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:05,580
So if you look here, we have our we've said about that we create in lab five and that web server is

14
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,950
offering demo application.

15
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:16,690
So that demo application is used by our end user and we have an of the ask as well.

16
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:21,820
And in the past we connect from this out of the S to from this web server to the audience.

17
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:28,960
So the first thing we need to do, guys, is in task one is basically to create an M and that's M I

18
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,280
will be passed to the auto to.

19
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:37,330
So basically every machine created by the auto scanner will offer the same application that we can see

20
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,480
here in that with Sarah.

21
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:48,150
So to create an am, I select the which said about itself, go to action and then from action, go to

22
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,760
image and template and to create an image.

23
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,460
We need to call this image that would say, what am I?

24
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,240
And the description which is the love I.

25
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,410
Am I?

26
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:07,790
Four.

27
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,540
With seven.

28
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,230
Now this is will take a few minutes.

29
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,800
So I'm going to click Create and I will move to the next stuff.

30
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:23,110
So in Tasks two, we want to create a load balancer and we see from the class that there is a three

31
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:27,130
times of load balancer because we are a load balancing application.

32
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,730
Then we need to create an application load balancer.

33
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:33,310
So click on to create a load balancer.

34
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,660
Selector and application load balancer.

35
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:42,510
Now, this application load balancer, as you see from the diagram, is going to be an intermediate

36
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,360
facing because it will operate in the public subnet.

37
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,300
So we call this a lab PLB.

38
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:56,050
And it will be an idea for now in which the BBC wants to operate.

39
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:00,310
This will be operated in the lab, VPC in the lab, BBC.

40
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:04,870
We have two availabilities on one A and one B.

41
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:12,040
Now, this should be the public subnet one, and this one should be public suddenly two, because we

42
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,030
are saying that this is a Internet facing yield bonanza.

43
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,960
Now we need to remove the default security group.

44
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:27,780
From the security group dropdown box, we select the Web security group, which means that load balancer

45
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:35,700
is going to accept the traffic at Port 80 and it will be forwarding it to this target group.

46
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,610
So we need to create a targeted group.

47
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,000
And this is will open a new tab for us.

48
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,270
Now, this targeted group is going to be called.

49
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,960
Choose a targeted group.

50
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:53,890
It will be an easy to in a you select in instances to target a group name.

51
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:56,260
It will be basically a lab.

52
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,410
A group.

53
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:07,490
And then we need to operate that automated group in the lab, VPC within a CTP one, and it will send

54
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:10,070
a health check my step as well.

55
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:16,450
And the last thing we need to do is to click next.

56
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:23,680
Now these are not going to be registered or available because this is the web server one and this is

57
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,680
the bastion host.

58
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,200
We don't need any of them.

59
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,720
So we click on it, create a target group.

60
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,230
Now go back to the load balancer page refreshed.

61
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:38,530
And this is now we show you the guitar group that we just created.

62
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:43,400
Now the next step is to create a load balancer.

63
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,850
So once you click at this stage here, you will find that you have created an application load balancer

64
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,720
and a targeted group for that load balancer.

65
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:55,960
Okay.

66
00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:01,150
Now, the next thing is to create a challenge configuration and auto scaling.

67
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:04,990
So we want to go to the lunch configuration.

68
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:13,300
We click on it, create a launch configuration that will be the lab.

69
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,880
Config.

70
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,420
Now which image?

71
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,300
We are still waiting for our army to be ready.

72
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,070
So as you can see, that's sad.

73
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,730
But am I the one I just decree?

74
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:29,470
It is that you can verify this as well from going to the senses.

75
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,840
And there is an MRI and this is the aim.

76
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:39,940
I just decree it myself, which is a copy of the content of the etc. that offers this application here.

77
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:47,290
Now the instant start is going to be in this exam, but it's going to be three medical.

78
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:55,260
So I'm going to select t three dot micro here and choose.

79
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,610
Now we do not have any spotting instances or a profile role.

80
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:07,020
We only need to worry about the security group because this is offering us our servers.

81
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,820
So we need to make sure we open.

82
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,840
With a security group.

83
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,870
We are going to select the Web security group.

84
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,290
For the security group.

85
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,260
And then we need to choose.

86
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,540
And existing keypad.

87
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:32,280
It will choose the aquarium key click knowledge and then create.

88
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,210
But we have now a lab configuration for the O2 scaling.

89
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:46,070
The next thing is to create basically or two skin and you can select the last configuration or you could

90
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,490
go to auto scan any group from this tab.

91
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:48,860
Both.

92
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,620
They will work from action.

93
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,820
Just click on to create an auto scaling.

94
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:58,650
We will call this a lab or to scanning a group.

95
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,890
Click now next.

96
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,440
Now this will operate in the lab.

97
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,950
VPC So make sure you are not selecting the default.

98
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:15,810
VPC Now when which availability zone we need to select or to create those or to scan in Google.

99
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,190
Now go back to the diagram, guys.

100
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,180
Once you are also scanning in a practice solely for practicing and creating more easy to an instance,

101
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:30,460
we want an easy to in a sense created body that we're just going to be a group to be placed on the private

102
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:30,910
subnet.

103
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:34,840
We don't want it to be too placed in here in the public subnet.

104
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,930
We so we need to be careful about our choice.

105
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:44,930
So let's go now back and we select the private subnet.

106
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:46,990
One.

107
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:51,190
And the private subnet to and the next.

108
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,820
So now with the next step, we need to attach it to a load balancer.

109
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:58,540
And we have an existing load balancer, which is the last LP.

110
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:06,270
So we need to select that and then we make sure that that LP is activated.

111
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,680
And then we have to enable the group metrics.

112
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:14,020
Then the next that is that capacity is going to be two, the minimum is two and the maximum is going

113
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:14,620
to be six.

114
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:25,340
And now we need to basically select the target group which the target type utilization, 64, 300 seconds,

115
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,320
which means one minute.

116
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,490
Then no notification for the tag.

117
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:38,540
We need to put a tag name, love and then a click mask next and then create an auto scaling.

118
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:45,980
The next thing you will see now, the auto scaling will start to basically put and create the designer's

119
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,560
capacity to make sure that we have two instances.

120
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:56,000
So you could go now and see that the easy to will have two instances and initialization.

121
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:04,790
So if you go to the instances and refresh this page, you will see that there is a new instance created

122
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,560
by the scalar called love.

123
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,960
In a sense, one and two.

124
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:14,750
You could now stop the observer just to make sure that the load balancer is not getting any traffic

125
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,450
from the web server.

126
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:20,910
And now let's go and just the load balancer.

127
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:29,030
So select the load balancer and this and lift the DNS name and then put the DNS name into any browser

128
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:33,020
and load that to be this which will basically create.

129
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,460
The demo application that we have.

130
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:44,020
And at the location we can load tests which basically run a script on the web server to generate some

131
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:44,800
secure load.

132
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:52,600
And then you can see from the auto scaling activity that it will start to create more AC two instances

133
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,230
to meet.

134
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,420
The demand.

135
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,420
As you know, that this will get all the information from iCloud.

136
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:09,320
So if you go to the cloud, you will find that there is a new alarm just to raise any green.

137
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:14,640
And that alarm is basically showing that the target.

138
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,000
Group of goats.

139
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,580
Getting a group is an okay status and the capitalization in greater than 60.

140
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:33,370
So you could keep monitoring between loading that this closed the page of the load balancer basically

141
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:41,170
to check that there is a new AC two instances or deleting any situation instances when there is no no.

142
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:44,740
So this is pretty much what we need to do in lab six.

143
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,020
Guys, just keep it running for a few minutes and monitor the cloud.

144
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:52,060
And that's all for the Cloud Foundation class.

145
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,390
Thank you for seeing this video and see you in the next one.
