Goes to another video about hosting a website in Amazon.

00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:09,060
Seth Rogen The idea here that you have a static website and you want just to put it in, etc., in order

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,650
to serve your customer.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,050
So let us get into it.

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,700
We really first create a bucket.

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:23,280
Now let me get this bucket, any website, and I will give it the date of today just to give it a unique

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,360
name in the database region, USA East.

8
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:33,030
Now the new changes in the zone, etc. a console is basically this object ownership.

9
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,580
So in the previous version, we don't have access list enabled or object ownership.

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:45,360
So we need to make sure to finish this up successfully to enable access lists for the object.

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:53,850
And we give that the ownership of the bucket to be able to change the object ownership and then we will

12
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,880
block all public access.

13
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:02,070
We would disable that, then we acknowledge and then we can enable the bucket versioning from here.

14
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:07,200
It could also add tag if you want, and you could also add a server side encryption.

15
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,830
If you are storing sensitive data in this bucket.

16
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,870
Now click on Create Bucket.

17
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:20,870
The next thing is to select the budget you just created and then go to the properties and all the way

18
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:21,350
down.

19
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:25,430
Go to static website hosting and enable.

20
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:32,030
And once you enable this, you can basically point out that this is to host a static clip site and the

21
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:36,260
name of the index document that you are going to use.

22
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,880
And this website in my case is going to be a history.

23
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:44,840
You could also specify an error page just in case.

24
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,910
If there is any issue on your website, you can't extend to your customer an error message.

25
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,460
Click on Save Changes.

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,930
Once you do that, you will be able to get a new.

27
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:05,740
Link for your website and you can see now it's give me 4034, which means we don't have permission to

28
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:10,180
view the website content as of yet then existed.

29
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:16,930
We have like a demo application, a demo static website that I'm going to share with you in the description

30
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,240
to try to slap out.

31
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,250
You just click on upload.

32
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:26,810
Add phones and let me select a small index of three seven.

33
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,290
Fly with JavaScript and a styling file.

34
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,040
Just a click open and then click on upload.

35
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:41,300
The next thing is going to be after you upload the files you need to select them and then you go to

36
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,380
action and then make public via ACL.

37
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:53,720
Now, if you did not select an object in the creation of the bucket, you would find this option not

38
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,350
available.

39
00:02:54,770 --> 00:03:00,920
So what you could do is to make it happen is basically to go to the bucket itself.

40
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,210
And from the packet there is a permission and the permission that is an object ownership here.

41
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:15,000
You can edit that in order to basically be able to make your object public.

42
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:19,230
The next thing is to go now to the bucket to set it to the.

43
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:27,270
You are told that we well, it's given to us in a three at first page and you will see now I have a

44
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:36,690
nice static website with a nice map where I basically offer for my customer to visit my business.

45
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:40,570
Thank you so much for seeing this video and see you in the next one.
