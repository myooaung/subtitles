WEBVTT
1
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:04.530
How you doing?

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.550
Guys will come back into another video about creating a virtual private cloud.

3
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.600
In this lab, we are going to create a VPC, and this time we are not going to use the wizard.

4
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.040
We are going to start building the PC component by a component.

5
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:27.150
So this is will enable us to basically understand the VPC structure in a WAC.

6
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.870
So the first thing I will do is to go to a W, you can see here I have my adobe console and now let

7
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.520
us go and create the first task which is creating the VPC.

8
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.510
So we want to go to the VPC console from here and we can see we have two pieces now.

9
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.190
This is the default VPC.

10
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.750
And this is going to be clear from the IP address, which is one 72.30 1.0.0, which is basically enable

11
00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.390
you to create and to have a default VPC So you can create your resources and you start doing some work

12
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.270
in a WAC without creating of ABC, especially when you want to do some testing and experiment.

13
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.460
Now there is a shared VPC and this shared VPC.

14
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:18.570
We will use it later on in the coming task in order to create a peer to peer connection.

15
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.650
Now let us go and click on Create of ABC.

16
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.740
Now the name of this VPC is going to be Lab.

17
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.300
VPC and the IP address.

18
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:38.900
The key idea, it's going to be ten 000 with the slash 16.

19
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.090
Now we want to choose create from here.

20
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.460
And this is going to create a VBAC.

21
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.210
Now, once this VBAC is created, you will select it.

22
00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:02.340
And now we want just to make sure that any resources we create in this VBAC will get a domain name system.

23
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.610
And with this is will be happening by enabling a DNS.

24
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.180
So we are going to edit a DNS hostname and enable.

25
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.300
Now after we do this, we want just to close this.

26
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:27.130
I love ABC and then we go back to create subnets in this VPC following to the diagram that we can see

27
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.580
here.

28
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.460
Now, we're now in this love VPC.

29
00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.850
We want to end the public subnet and a private subnet.

30
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:41.890
So we are going to create a subnet and this will be in the lab VPC and we will select it as a rename

31
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.050
as public subnet.

32
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:52.900
Now this is going to be in the first availability zone and this is going to be ten 0.0.0.

33
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:59.470
Now, this is going to be a segment of the IP address of the virtual private cloud, our VPC.

34
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.660
And so we will get it like a slash 24, click on it, create.

35
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:12.400
The next step, guys is to create another subnet and this is will be basically.

36
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.660
To select a public subnet.

37
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.560
Okay.

38
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.970
And from that public subnets, we want to go to action.

39
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:31.480
And from action we want to modify or to assign IP sitting and we want to select or to assign IP before.

40
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.310
So this is basically will enable us to have.

41
00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:47.120
Any resources in this VPC to get basically an IP address from the recipe server click save.

42
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.350
Now we need to create another subnet.

43
00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.300
This is will be another VPC.

44
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.740
This time it will be called the private subnet.

45
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:06.400
Now in the same advertisement zone which is the first US East when a and the IP block is going to be

46
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.350
ten 0.2.0 with a slash 23.

47
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.660
So you can see here we allocate more spaces for the private subnet.

48
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.720
And click on Create.

49
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.290
Now we want to create an Internet gateway in Tasker three.

50
00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.640
So in Tasker three, you want to go to the Internet gateway and click.

51
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.340
On create.

52
00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:41.840
Now the name of this Internet gateway is going to be let AGW create an Internet gateway.

53
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:48.470
Now the next step is going to basically go to the Internet gateway going back.

54
00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.510
Select the Internet gateway.

55
00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.110
And from action we want to attach it to a VPC.

56
00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:02.690
We are going to select the cloud VPC from this text field and this that the Internet gateway, which

57
00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:10.550
means now any resources we create in our public subnet will be able to access the Internet and they

58
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.380
will be accessible from the Internet.

59
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:14.290
In Tusk.

60
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.620
For now, we want to create a round table.

61
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:23.140
Now you could see from hand that you have only in this particular lab.

62
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.740
You have only lab VPC with men equal.

63
00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.120
Yes.

64
00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:31.470
And this is pointing to one destination because we haven't added an AIDS gateway.

65
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.870
Yes.

66
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:33.100
Before.

67
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:38.560
So we need to before we add that as the gateway, we need to create a public cloud table.

68
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:40.840
And we will call this now.

69
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:47.700
Private.

70
00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.360
Round table.

71
00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.570
I know Celeste allowed BBC.

72
00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.510
And this will create a drought table.

73
00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:08.860
Oh, sorry.

74
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.510
Just let me go back 1/2 in step number 21.

75
00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.720
We want to select the last VPC.

76
00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.910
So this is with the main equal.

77
00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:19.270
Yes.

78
00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.460
And this is from the previous class.

79
00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.660
We call this private.

80
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.760
Round table.

81
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:33.570
Click Save now after you save this as a private roundtable.

82
00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.440
Now we need to go and create a public roundtable.

83
00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:41.010
So we're going to cause this public round table.

84
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.990
Now this is going to be in the lab VPC.

85
00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.440
So create an output now from this crowd table.

86
00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.400
We need to go to the roots that we have.

87
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.180
So this is our.

88
00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:02.070
Public roundtable and both they are in the same love ABC So you could verify your work from drought.

89
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:11.970
We edit droughts and we add and now we say for any other IP which is 0.0200, go to the AGW or to the

90
00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:13.050
internet gateway.

91
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:21.290
So if you select Internet Gateway, this is the Internet gateway that I just create Click Save.

92
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:27.780
Now go back into that public roundtable.

93
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.250
We want to do a subnet association.

94
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:35.720
Of course, we want to link with the public subnet because it is a public roundtable.

95
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.330
Now we want to create.

96
00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:43.290
That public roundtable.

97
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:50.650
It's now giving us an Internet access because we link it to the Internet gateway.

98
00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.220
The next thing in Task four is to go to security group.

99
00:07:55.930 --> 00:08:01.090
We create a security group, and this security group is going to be an app security group

100
00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:11.350
which will allow an initiative to be traffic to our public subnet resources.

101
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.700
So you need to delete the default one and select allow VPC.

102
00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:19.300
We need to add a role for his keep.

103
00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:24.460
And this is will be from anywhere.

104
00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:32.670
Click now in create a security group.

105
00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:39.110
Now we want to launch an application server in that public subnet.

106
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:42.080
So we are going to go to the easy to.

107
00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:46.450
And from the ACTU we will lunch and instant.

108
00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:50.170
It will be with the next two.

109
00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.530
It's going to be T2 Micro.

110
00:08:54.950 --> 00:09:00.830
Now we want it to be in our lab, VPC in our public subnet.

111
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:03.000
As well.

112
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:10.920
And we want to basically and you can see now we have auto assigned IP enable.

113
00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.020
Now in the user today in the role section.

114
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.800
So we want this easy to to assume a role.

115
00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:20.000
So there is a role we need to attach to it.

116
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.740
And this is can be done by this option here.

117
00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:34.150
And select an inventory role now in the user data.

118
00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:40.540
We want to copy the script, which is basically to install Apache Web server and put a demo application

119
00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.340
in our web server.

120
00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:50.240
No the storage at TAG and we need to call this name.

121
00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:53.950
Observers.

122
00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:03.450
And now in configure security group, we are going to select the existing security group we just created,

123
00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:05.040
which is the ARB security group.

124
00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:08.640
If you continue and launch.

125
00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:24.070
Now, this is the an instance it should be running.

126
00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:36.400
We need to open this web server here and we paste the URL or the public IP of the app server.

127
00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:40.480
So this is pretty much what we have done in this lab.

128
00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:47.410
We create a VPC and then we attach to it and two subnets and one of them is an Internet gateway.

129
00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:53.470
You could also carry on if you want to practice more, you can carry on in that.

130
00:10:53.470 --> 00:11:00.460
VPC You create another gateway and then you link it to the private subnet, and in your private subnets

131
00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:01.810
you could do many things.

132
00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:06.850
Thank you for seeing this video and I would see you in the next one.
