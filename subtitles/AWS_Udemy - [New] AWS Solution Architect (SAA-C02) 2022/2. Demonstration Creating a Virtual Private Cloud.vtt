1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:05.190
So let us look how we can create a VPC in the NWS management console.

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.580
So the first thing I want to do is to go to my services.

3
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.620
Then I will select the VPC.

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.860
Now you could use the BBC wizard similar to what we did in the Cloud Practitioner class, but now I

5
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.710
want to do this VPC creation columns.

6
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.670
Can I just to understand most of the VPC component that we are using to build our own private network

7
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:27.500
in the US?

8
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:33.180
Understanding the VPC is very important to pass the solution architect exam.

9
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.110
So I will click now in the your VPC from the virtual private clouds in our click on Create a VPC.

10
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.280
I'm going to create a VPC and I will give it a name.

11
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.700
And in this name I'm going to call it demo VPC know the C idea ought to block that I want to use is

12
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.590
going to be ten 0.0.0 with this nice 16.

13
00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:02.670
This means that this VPC is going to have about 65,536 available IP.

14
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.110
So I could segment that VPC further into more subnet.

15
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.360
Now let me create a VPC.

16
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.490
Now about the default tenancy.

17
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.490
You can use a dedicated tenancy or a default one.

18
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.090
This means you are going to build a dedicated VPC, especially if you want to meet a regulation requirement

19
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.980
or a licensing requirements.

20
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.640
Now for this demo, we're going to use default.

21
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.390
Click on to create a VPC.

22
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:35.070
Now, once you create a VPC, the VPC will appear here in your VPC console, select the VPC.

23
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.130
And now from the Actions menu, I want to enable DNS hostnames.

24
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.500
This will give any AC to a lunch inside this VPC a DNS name.

25
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.520
Now lets me create in that demo VPC unless we create a new subnet and I will call this my public subnet,

26
00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:01.830
so I'm going to create a subnet, select the demo VPC, give this subnet name public subnet and let

27
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:10.020
me place this in the first ability zone of us east one e you can see I have six of these on which means

28
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.900
I could create six available public subnet for each easy for this subnet.

29
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:23.940
I'm going to give this IP address ten 0.0.1 with a slash 24, which means I'm going to get up to two

30
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:31.800
to the power eight available IP minus five, which are the five IP is reserved for us.

31
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.050
Now let me create this subnet.

32
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:43.140
Now I want to select my subnet and from the action menu I want to do modify oh to assign IP address.

33
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:51.420
So from action added subnet setting enable or to assign public IP address, then click on save.

34
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.090
Let me next create a private subnet.

35
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.280
So I'm going to select the demo VPC.

36
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.670
I will call this subnet a private subnet.

37
00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.340
And this is will be also in my fears ability zone and I will give it the IP address.

38
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.830
Ten .0.2.0 with a slash 24 click on create.

39
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.840
Now let's create another gateway because I want now my public subnet.

40
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.170
If I launch an easy to instance in my public subnet, I want those easy to, in a sense to have both

41
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.680
connection to the Internet, inbound and outbound.

42
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:26.990
So let me click on it.

43
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.710
Create an Internet gateway.

44
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.600
I will call it demo ise GW and create an Earth gateway.

45
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:40.800
Now if we go back, we will see from the action menu of the Internet gateway that I just created that

46
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.830
I can attach this to a specific VPC.

47
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.690
So from actions attached to a VPC, you can select the demo VPC.

48
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:55.050
You could also use that command line interface if you are using the CLIA to attach a specific VPC to

49
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.220
this Internet gateway.

50
00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.440
Now let's go to the road table and we want to configure that out it.

51
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:07.170
Now be careful when you go to the round table, you must be sure that this table belongs to the demo

52
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:13.580
VPC because most likely you will have a default VPC created in your region by us.

53
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.390
So I'm going to select the round table with main equals.

54
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.140
Yes, in the VPC.

55
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:26.130
The VPC ID with demo VPC now lets me edit this and I will call this public row table.

56
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.760
Now it's a good practice and I always prefer to use the main equals for my private trout table.

57
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:38.070
But if you want to use it for your public allow table similar to this demo, feel free to do so.

58
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:45.210
Now in the routs you will find that this table is telling my VPC that any easy to wants to communicate

59
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.280
inside the VPC network.

60
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.560
They need to go and use the destination.

61
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.600
Look, if I want them to use my internet gateway for anything else, because this is a public cloud

62
00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.140
table, I need to select any IP.

63
00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.730
No, the destination will be in.

64
00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:06.440
Turn it gateway and I will be able to select my dim i g w and save the changes.

65
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.740
Now in the subnet association.

66
00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:17.150
I want to point now my public subnet to my public cloud table, and this is from now on this subnet

67
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:23.480
will be act as a public subnet because it has a destination for out to the Internet gate.

68
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:30.230
Now let's let's go back and create an Earth gateway, because I want my NAS gateway to be used by my

69
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:31.370
private instances.

70
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:38.480
When you click on Create that gateway, give it the name demo and t now this that will be placed on

71
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:44.630
my private in my public subnet and it will be used for my private instances.

72
00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:51.980
So I'm going to allocate an elastic IP for the interface that I will place on the public subnet and

73
00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:57.340
it will have also a private IP use by my private instances.

74
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:04.070
Now if you go to the round table, click on Create Table and I will call this a private round table.

75
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:11.840
And let me now put it in demo VPC and create now in the route of this private allowed table, I need

76
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.350
to edit add another route for any IP.

77
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:21.080
Now this should go and take the traffic to my net gateway, which is the one I just created.

78
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.100
Then one act and then I save the change for subnet association.

79
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:32.480
I need to edit the subnet associations and I will select now the private subnet, which means any easy

80
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:38.450
to instance running in the private instance will use the net gateway in order to reach the internet.

81
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:40.490
Now let me create a bastion.

82
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.450
Host Before I create a version host I need to create a security group.

83
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:48.200
And this is where most the student make a mistake when they create a security group.

84
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:53.840
When you click on to create a security group, you need to specify where this security group in which.

85
00:06:53.840 --> 00:07:01.220
VPC So I'm going to call this demo security group and this is will allow us to search to my private

86
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.610
easy to in instances in private subnet.

87
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:11.300
Now here where most students make mistakes they select the default because by default W as console will

88
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:19.070
give you the default VPC and select the demo VPC add a new rule and this is will be as a switch and

89
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:25.010
let me make it anywhere because I want to show you one simple thing here before we carry on, create

90
00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:26.960
a VPC security group.

91
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.510
Now let's go to the easy tools.

92
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:30.890
And this is what I'm going to do.

93
00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:37.490
I'm going to launch a private server in this private subnet, and I will show you that we have no way

94
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:41.060
to access it from our personal computer or from the interview.

95
00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:44.300
We need to do something else which is creating a question.

96
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.390
Host So let us see why you need aversion lunch.

97
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:50.360
Now in this tense, I'm going to select Linux two.

98
00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:58.370
I will keep it with a three tier T two micro and no, I will place it in my demo VPC in my private subnet.

99
00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:05.210
And I even if you auto assign public IP, this is going to be useless because that public IP won't be

100
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:11.210
reachable because it's act and work behind init gateway click add now for security group.

101
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:18.500
I'm going to select the Demo Security Group Review Lunch and I will launch this with a new keypad.

102
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.630
I'm going to call this keypad demo.

103
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.900
If you are using Linux and Mac, RSA will be good.

104
00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:32.270
If you are using Windows d25519 is better because this is will give you not APM file a public fine download

105
00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:33.050
the key pair.

106
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:35.660
This is where you go to my download folder and lunch.

107
00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:42.350
There you see two instance if I open my terminal or even potty for windows and they want to access that

108
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:45.140
easy two instance, I want to be able to do so.

109
00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:46.250
Why go to that?

110
00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:54.440
Easy to you will see that this is to now after it became running, it will get only a private IP address.

111
00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:59.840
It won't get a public IP address even if it does get a public IP address.

112
00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:05.420
This is placed on a demo of ABC in the private subnet so I can reach it from the internet.

113
00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:07.400
So what is the solution for this lunch?

114
00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:14.840
And you bastion host it will be t two micro this is will be in my demo VPC in my public subnet.

115
00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:20.900
I don't have anything here to specify no user data because this is will be only like a jump books.

116
00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:26.270
I want to connect to it for you as I said and from that machine host I want to use that bastion host

117
00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:34.940
to access my easy to an instance in the private subnet click attack put name here and call this bastion

118
00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:36.830
host now for security group.

119
00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:41.090
I'm going to select the creation of a new security group.

120
00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:47.000
I will call this bashing host because I want this security group to be the source of the traffic.

121
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:56.960
Allow my pc to access bastion host and here I will not only my iPad that is the view launch I will use

122
00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.540
now different keypad and I will call this.

123
00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:06.730
Host to access because this is where you give me more control and more security that if I get the bastion

124
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:13.680
house key leaked or hacked, still, the key for my private instances is not going to be affected by

125
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.350
that and launch an easy to innocence.

126
00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:23.580
If you view your inner senses now, you will be able to connect to this bastion host from your PC.

127
00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:27.500
But then you need to access from the bastion host.

128
00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:30.420
You need to access the private server.

129
00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:37.710
Let me call this private server, for example, so we can understand how Bastion Host What now?

130
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:45.960
If I open my terminal now and I go to my download folder where I put where I put my bastion host files,

131
00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:49.740
I need to do the following see hatch mode 400.

132
00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:54.360
And the first thing I need to do is bash and host the term file to give this permission.

133
00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:58.920
And now if I want to connect to my bastion host, I could use multiple things.

134
00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:04.740
I could use the easy to access disconnect user as the station manager or the as such a client.

135
00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:07.110
So the access as a client will look like this.

136
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:14.820
The command it's assets minus IP person hold the term the user at the public DNS of this easy to know

137
00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:22.110
I want just to verify that I can access the bastion host verify that this is yes and now I can access

138
00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:27.930
the bastion also I could know that if you go back to your bastion host in your Bastion host, you can

139
00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:33.030
see that I am inside the private IP address of the Bastion.

140
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:41.280
Host Now from here, if I have at this machine, if I have the other key, which is that demo, that

141
00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:47.850
PIM file key, I could basically access the private web to from the Bastion host, I could access the

142
00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:48.870
private twitch server.

143
00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:51.480
However, there is a better way to do this.

144
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:58.710
Now for Windows, there is another video you need to see how to configure a party and the agent in Linux

145
00:11:58.710 --> 00:11:59.550
and Mac.

146
00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:00.960
Things are really simple.

147
00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:10.260
You merely need to add those keys to your search agent and as a search agent will pass those keys to

148
00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:15.780
the Bastion host and the Bastion host will be able to use them to connect to the private server.

149
00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:22.380
To do that, all you need to do guys is search minus ad minus K and let me add the two keys.

150
00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:24.690
So I don't need to specify as I search minus.

151
00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:31.700
I know I need to keys, I need SSL to minus add minus k and lets me add first the bastion host key now

152
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:31.860
list.

153
00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:38.850
We also add the other key which is the demo key segment and now demo key file.

154
00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:39.960
I will add it.

155
00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:48.240
And now if I do RSA search easy to bash users at the public IP or the public DNS of my bastion host,

156
00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.830
I will be able to connect.

157
00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:54.810
So let me just use the public DNS so you can see that it is the same command that I used before, but

158
00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:57.390
without minus E, I had a typo there.

159
00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:01.110
So instead of having as a search, I have a switch it.

160
00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:09.390
So let me change the hatch now and we will be good as a search minus a easy to user at the public DNS

161
00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:10.770
name of my best.

162
00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:14.520
So I am now inside the Bastion host from the Bastion Host.

163
00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:21.000
If I want to connect to my private web server now, I need to get the private IP address of the server.

164
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:28.560
So all I need to do is, as I said, easy to use it at the private IP of the server and I will be able

165
00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:35.610
now to access the private to observe how I can verify this look to the easy to use are at the hostname

166
00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:42.210
is the IP the private IP name of this easy to in essence so go to the private web server you can see

167
00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:45.930
that now I am inside the private web server in the private.

168
00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:51.660
So this is why we need a bastion host and this is how we build and create a BBC.

169
00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:54.120
Thank you for seeing this demo and see you in the next one.
