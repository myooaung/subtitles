00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.080
<v Instructor>Moving along in our development process,</v>

2
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.760
in this video we'll cover step three,

3
00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.310
modifying the computeCartTotals

4
00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.930
to call the new method persistCartItems.

5
00:00:21.042 --> 00:00:22.410
All righty, so let's kind of move up

6
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.307
to our computeCartTotals method

7
00:00:24.307 --> 00:00:26.943
'cause that's what we currently have in place.

8
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.010
And what we'll do is the last call here,

9
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.720
we'll make a call to this new method.

10
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.803
So we'll persist the cart data.

11
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.670
And we'll accomplish this by calling persistCartItems.

12
00:00:51.124 --> 00:00:54.620
All righty, so that's pretty much it for the coding.

13
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.030
Now I'm getting a little excited.

14
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.133
I want to go through and test this out.

15
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.780
So let's make sure that our backend is up and running.

16
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.653
If not, go ahead and start it now.

17
00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:15.560
And then swing over to Visual Studio Code

18
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.953
and we'll go ahead and start up our Angular app.

19
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.190
Now I'm moving to the browser and visit my application.

20
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.010
And I'll just add some items to the cart and I'll make sure

21
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.550
that things will survive after the refresh.

22
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.790
So right now we have four items in our cart.

23
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.083
Go ahead and test the browser refresh.

24
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.420
And yes, success. Look at that.

25
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.880
So we still have our four items

26
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.870
in the cart with our correct price.

27
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.870
So it did survive the browser refresh. A sigh of relief.

28
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.240
And now one other scenario was testing the login, right,

29
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.620
because once we do the login and this whole Okta

30
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.377
OAuth thing, they do a redirect, effectively doing

31
00:02:22.377 --> 00:02:24.290
another browser refresh.

32
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.790
So let's basically just test the login piece here.

33
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.420
So now we're logged into our application and yes,

34
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.040
we still have our four items in our cart.

35
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.873
Okay, good.

36
00:02:37.873 --> 00:02:40.660
So I'm happy this browser refresh thing

37
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.380
is working as desired.

38
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.213
Good job.

39
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.240
But one thing to remember is that we're using

40
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.880
sessionStorage so it's only in the browser's memory.

41
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.830
So once a browser tab is closed

42
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.620
then the data is no longer available.

43
00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.760
So if we were to exit out of our browser

44
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.610
and start it again, then it'll lose everything

45
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.350
and our shopping cart will start at zero.

46
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.150
So let's go ahead and test this out.

47
00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.120
So I'll just do a quick log out here

48
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.870
and then I'll quit the web browser.

49
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:19.500
And I'll start it back up again

50
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.153
and I'll go visit my application.

51
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.180
And I notice here, the data's lost.

52
00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.250
Everything's back to zero because we're using

53
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.610
sessionStorage so the data's only in the browser's memory.

54
00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.610
Once the browser tab goes away or the browser is exited,

55
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:38.713
we lose everything.

56
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.660
Now, if you'd like for your cart data to persist

57
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.970
on browser restarts, then we can simply change the type

58
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:49.803
of storage we're using.

59
00:03:49.803 --> 00:03:51.440
So instead of using sessionStorage,

60
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.252
we can make use of localStorage.

61
00:03:53.252 --> 00:03:54.952
So let's go ahead and do that now.

62
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.270
So I'll just set it up here where for the storage

63
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.217
I'm making use of localStorage.

64
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.500
And this is a reference to the browser's local storage

65
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.600
and we get access to this object for free.

66
00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.910
And remember, with localStorage the data is persisted

67
00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.093
and it survives browser restarts.

68
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.860
All right, so just swing back into my application.

69
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.330
Let's just add some items to our shopping cart.

70
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.850
So at the moment, we have X number of items,

71
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.950
five items in our shopping cart right now.

72
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.690
And let's go ahead and exit the browser.

73
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.560
And then back into our app. And then success.

74
00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.410
Look, this is great. So it remembered our data.

75
00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.790
So the data's persisted and it survives

76
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.213
the browser restarts.

77
00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.070
So we can just do some other testing here with localStorage.

78
00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.230
We see that the refresh works out just fine.

79
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.270
So it keeps track of all that information.

80
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.100
And also just going through the process here

81
00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.780
of just doing a login here to make sure

82
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.863
that this all works for localStorage.

83
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.460
And then as expected, you know,

84
00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.010
everything works out as we would like.

85
00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.863
Good job.
