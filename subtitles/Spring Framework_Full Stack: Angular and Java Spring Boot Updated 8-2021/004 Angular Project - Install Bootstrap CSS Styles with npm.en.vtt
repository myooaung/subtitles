00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:02.210
<v Instructor>All righty, so taking a look</v>

2
00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:03.470
at our development process,

3
00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.010
so now we'll focus on step two

4
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:10.010
of installing the Bootstrap CSS styles locally using npm.

5
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.763
Okay, so let's go ahead and swing in here.

6
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.743
Let's open up Visual Studio code,

7
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.363
and let's also open up a new terminal window.

8
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.303
And so make sure you're in the angular-ecommerce directory.

9
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.463
Let me expand my window here for a second.

10
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.390
And so I'll go through and do an npm install on Bootstrap.

11
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.303
So this will install the latest version of Bootstrap.

12
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.890
And notice here it said it found

13
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.690
three moderate security vulnerabilities.

14
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.050
Interesting.

15
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.260
You may see this, you may not.

16
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.080
This changes on a daily basis or a weekly basis

17
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.010
because these are all fast-moving projects.

18
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.760
But the nice thing here is that in my case,

19
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.380
it says, hey, there's an issue,

20
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.270
and then here's how to fix it.

21
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.933
So I can fix this by saying, npm audit fix.

22
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.810
And again, you may see this issue, you may not,

23
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.070
depending on the actual version of Bootstrap

24
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.570
that's available at the time

25
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.723
that you perform your installation.

26
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.520
Okay, great, so if you look at the bottom here,

27
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.440
it says that it fixed three of the three vulnerabilities

28
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.710
in those given packages.

29
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.733
So those issues are resolved, good job.

30
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.520
And there's one more thing I want to do.

31
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.840
I want to install the font awesome locally using npm.

32
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.260
Now, this one's a little bit tricky

33
00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.060
'cause the spelling's a little different.

34
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.570
So when you install font awesome,

35
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.030
you have to say at fort awesome.

36
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.460
So that's F-O-R-T, fort awesome.

37
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.503
That's not a typo, all right?

38
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.900
Then slash font awesome.

39
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.610
F-O-N-T.

40
00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.543
Again, make sure you get the spelling just right.

41
00:02:19.676 --> 00:02:20.940
fontawesome-free.

42
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.580
So they simply have a unique entry in the npm registry.

43
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.173
So they use @fortawesome/fontawesome.

44
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.830
Let's go ahead and verify the entries

45
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.380
in the node_modules directory.

46
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.890
So this is where npm installs

47
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.600
all of those dependencies for you.

48
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.623
So we'll kind of explore a bit.

49
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.210
So I have my project here.

50
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.543
I can move onto the node_modules folder,

51
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.060
and scroll down a bit, and I should see

52
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.803
a folder called bootstrap.

53
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.023
So that's where the Bootstrap files were installed.

54
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.280
So there's bootstrap, dist, css,

55
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.490
and then you can give a reference

56
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.763
to the appropriate Bootstrap CSS.

57
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.290
And then also, we have a reference up top

58
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.067
for this @fortawesome.

59
00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.290
F-O-R-T, slash fontawesome-free.

60
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.610
And then we can see the appropriate CSS files.

61
00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.610
And I'll show you how to get this all hooked in in a second.

62
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.020
We can also verify the entries in the packge.json.

63
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.520
So the package.json is almost like your Maven pom.xml file

64
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.473
for you Java types out there.

65
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.370
So this lists all of the dependencies

66
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.653
that your Angular project requires.

67
00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.700
So in this package.json,

68
00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.400
let me kind of scroll down a bit.

69
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.003
All of our dependencies here.

70
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.010
And then we'll see that we have two new entries here

71
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.197
on lines 22 and 23.

72
00:04:10.197 --> 00:04:12.900
@fortawesome and also bootstrap.

73
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.500
Now, your version numbers will most likely differ

74
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.050
because new versions of these projects

75
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.893
are released on a very frequent basis.
