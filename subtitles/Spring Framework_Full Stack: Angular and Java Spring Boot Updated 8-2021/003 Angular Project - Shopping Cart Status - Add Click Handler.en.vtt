00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.270
<v Instructor>Alrighty, so moving along</v>

2
00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:03.700
with our development process.

3
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.900
So in this video, we'll cover steps three and four

4
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.630
of adding a click handler for the Add to cart button,

5
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.360
and also updating the product list component

6
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.993
with the click handler method.

7
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.210
Alrighty, so let's move in here

8
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.070
and let's update the code here

9
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.343
for our product list grid component dot html.

10
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.010
Let me expand this window here.

11
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.840
And I want to move down to the area

12
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.050
where we have the buttons for our Add to cart.

13
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.570
So this is the loop for our collection of products.

14
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:51.950
All right, let's scroll down a bit.

15
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.123
Okay, great, so on line 20,

16
00:00:54.123 --> 00:00:57.430
this is where we have the button for Add to cart.

17
00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.850
And I'm going to change this from an href to a button

18
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.100
because href is for normal links,

19
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.350
and here we're going to use a button

20
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.480
and we'll make use of a click handler

21
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.253
and also add some nice styling to the button.

22
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.040
So I'll change the styles here.

23
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.440
So instead of primary button,

24
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.403
I'll make use of some native bootstrap styles.

25
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.130
All right, so button primary, button small.

26
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.980
All right, so that's the button part of it.

27
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.640
Then I'll add the click handler event.

28
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.853
So here I'll say on click,

29
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.160
and then I give the actual methods to call.

30
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.653
So I'll call addToCart and I'll pass in tempProduct.

31
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.680
And now the ID will actually tell me,

32
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.752
hey, there's an error here, mister.

33
00:01:54.752 --> 00:01:56.030
(chuckling)

34
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.990
This method is not defined.

35
00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.070
I know that, we're going to in the next step,

36
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.960
but just for now, this is the basic layout here

37
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.123
for our button.

38
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.280
All right, so now we'll do the work

39
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.850
of updating the ProductListComponent

40
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.823
with the click handler method.

41
00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.590
So let's go ahead and move

42
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.293
into our product-list component dot ts.

43
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.200
Expand my window here and scroll to the top,

44
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.440
so we're in ProductListComponent right now.

45
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.290
And I'll move all the way down to the end

46
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.107
of this class and I'll add a new method.

47
00:02:45.714 --> 00:02:49.513
And so this method is addToCart and I'll pass in a product.

48
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.580
And right now, just to keep things simple,

49
00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.673
I'll simply log the product name and price.

50
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.900
And then I know I have more work to do

51
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.920
as far as all the real heavy work,

52
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.700
but we'll do that in some of the later videos.

53
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.430
Right now I'm just getting the basics in place

54
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.013
just for logging the addToCart.

55
00:03:40.182 --> 00:03:44.099
So let's go ahead and run this and test it out.

56
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.440
Alrighty, swing into our browser,

57
00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.580
and since we're doing the console dot log,

58
00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.083
I need to open up my Developer Console.

59
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.560
And so at the bottom, we should see

60
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.350
some logging messages here, so good.

61
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.970
So add in the cart Crash Course in Python,

62
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.380
let's add in the Guru JavaScript.

63
00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.170
Great, that looks good.

64
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.600
We move over to our mouse pads,

65
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.210
we add a mouse pad for Sweeper,

66
00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:21.850
okay, great, and for Aspire, great.

67
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.990
All right, so we know that the functionality

68
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.300
for Add to cart is working, kind of working.

69
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.320
(chuckling)

70
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.790
It's not really updating yet,

71
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.060
because our status component hasn't really changed.

72
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.050
But we'll add code for this in the next set of videos.

73
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.500
But don't worry, a lot of good things are coming.
