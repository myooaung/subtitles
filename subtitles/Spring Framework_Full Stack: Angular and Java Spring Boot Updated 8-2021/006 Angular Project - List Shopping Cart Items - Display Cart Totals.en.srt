1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,320
<v ->Okay, so this code looks really good.</v>

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,492
I'm getting excited, I'm getting anxious.

3
00:00:05,492 --> 00:00:06,440
(chuckles)

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,010
And let's go ahead and run it.

5
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,373
And let's test it out.

6
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,120
So go ahead and start the application.

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,703
Swing over to my browser here.

8
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,523
And let's add some items to our cart.

9
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:37,740
Coffee mug, and let's view our cart.

10
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,050
Yay, awesome, this is great.

11
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,960
So we see that we're looping over each one of our cart items

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,620
and displaying information about the image details

13
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,460
and quantity.

14
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,223
Cool, I like it, I like it.

15
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,930
And let's swing back in here.

16
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,000
And let's add some code to display

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,500
the subtotal for our cart item.

18
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,970
So just moving into this section

19
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:02,773
here where we have quantity.

20
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:08,493
And we'll add a new paragraph right below that div.

21
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,433
So we'll have our subtotal.

22
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:27,840
And now our subtotal is really a math expression.

23
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,763
So it's really the quantity times the unit price.

24
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,763
So I can actually do math expressions here.

25
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:41,739
Then I'll pipe it all through the currency.

26
00:01:41,739 --> 00:01:43,906
(mumbles)

27
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,100
Okay, so for each one of our line items or cart items,

28
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,343
the subtotal is the quantity times the unit price.

29
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,563
I'll save this and I'll swing back over and test it out.

30
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,693
So add some items to the cart.

31
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,100
And yes, awesome.

32
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,740
So we have our subtotal for each one of our cart items.

33
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,573
Good.

34
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,820
So that's only one item

35
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,990
as far as quantity let's

36
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,650
increase the quantity here a couple of times.

37
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,480
And now move over and great.

38
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,300
It actually is computing the subtotal so four times x,

39
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,310
and that's our actual subtotal.

40
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,513
Okay, good. I like it.

41
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,950
Now, there's one other thing we have to do here

42
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,970
is actually give the grand total

43
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,990
at the bottom of our ShoppingCart list.

44
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:45,760
So we'll have the total quantity and also the total price.

45
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,943
So I'll set up a new table row here for this information.

46
00:03:05,328 --> 00:03:07,720
So just add an empty colspan here of two

47
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,630
just to kind of take up those first two columns in the table

48
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,730
and make those empty and then we'll give our

49
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,893
total information or make this information bold.

50
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,470
And then I'll add the code here for total quantity.

51
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,590
So I simply access the Total Quantity property

52
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,533
on our component.

53
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:48,896
Free Shipping for all of our valued customers.

54
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:51,010
(chuckles)

55
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,853
And then also we display the total price.

56
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:15,310
Alright, so this code looks pretty good.

57
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,020
Let's go ahead and save and swing back over

58
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,570
and test it out on our browser.

59
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:21,970
And okay, good.

60
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,400
So starting out total quantity of zero,

61
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,730
shipping free total price is zero.

62
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,730
That's great because our cart is empty.

63
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,030
Let's go ahead and add some items to our cart.

64
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,390
And swing over and look at our cart details

65
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:45,390
and okay good, good. Scroll down.

66
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,250
And yes.

67
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,083
Okay great.

68
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:50,140
So we have a total quantity of six

69
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:54,710
and total price of 111 dollars and 94 cents.

70
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,240
It should match what we have up top for our

71
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,683
cart status component and yeah, looks good.

72
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:01,970
Okay, this looks great.

73
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,130
I'm really happy with the work

74
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,520
that we've accomplished so far.

75
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,353
Good job.
