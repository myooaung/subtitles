00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:02.083
<v Instructor>All right.</v>

2
00:00:02.083 --> 00:00:03.770
So let's get started with that development process.

3
00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.690
In this video, we're going to cover step 1.1

4
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.923
of injecting the CartService into the CheckoutComponent.

5
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.873
Alrighty. So just swinging into my IDE here.

6
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.417
The first thing I want to do is move over to IntellJ

7
00:00:18.417 --> 00:00:20.720
and make sure I have my Spring Boot application

8
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.603
up and running.

9
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.070
And now I'll swing back over

10
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.010
to my Visual Studio Code

11
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.443
and I'll get my Angular app up and running.

12
00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.070
Now swinging to the browser real quick,

13
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.060
I'll just take a quick look at my application.

14
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.653
I'll just add some items to the cart real quick.

15
00:00:58.896 --> 00:01:01.750
And so here I am on that checkout form

16
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.430
or CheckoutComponent.

17
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.810
Scroll down to the bottom

18
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.520
and I'll see review your order.

19
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.590
And notice here that we have the problem.

20
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.080
The total quantity is zero and the total price is zero

21
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.193
and we need to add codes to fix this.

22
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.530
And then let's just swing back

23
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.190
into our IDE real quick and Visual Studio.

24
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.620
And I actually want to just go ahead

25
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.280
and just take a look at something real quick

26
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.440
with this given Component for our CheckoutComponent.

27
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.440
And I want to look at the HTML here for this given file.

28
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.110
So this is my HTML template.

29
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.220
And just want to scroll down to the bottom

30
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.220
of this given file where I have the cart details

31
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.130
or whatever the order details says review your order

32
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.630
and then the total quantity and total price.

33
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.723
So that coding's in place.

34
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.260
But right now we're not really subscribed to anything

35
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.570
so that's why the data's zero.

36
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.490
If I look at my CheckoutComponent Class,

37
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.720
I see I have the two fields here

38
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.840
for total price and total quantity

39
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.280
but we're not really doing anything with them yet.

40
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.270
So, we eventually need to write some code to subscribe

41
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.920
to items on the cart service.

42
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.780
But the first thing we need to do is step 1.1

43
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.620
and inject the Cart Service.

44
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.453
So let's go ahead

45
00:02:32.453 --> 00:02:34.773
and just kind of move down to the constructor here.

46
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.813
And then I'll simply inject the CartService.

47
00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.093
Okay, great.

48
00:02:58.093 --> 00:02:58.930
So that looks pretty good.

49
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.870
Our CartService has been injected

50
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.483
and we're set up and ready to go with this part.
