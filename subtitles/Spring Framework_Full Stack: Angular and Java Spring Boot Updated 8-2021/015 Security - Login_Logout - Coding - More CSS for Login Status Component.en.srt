1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:02,163
<v Instructor>All right,</v>

2
00:00:02,163 --> 00:00:03,890
So we're still in our login-status.component.CSS.

3
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:05,970
We're going to copy over some more items,

4
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,830
just to make a quick little comment to myself

5
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,923
to keep myself on track.

6
00:00:19,837 --> 00:00:22,820
So we'll copy another style from styles.CSS.

7
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,933
We'll grab the one call form-header.

8
00:00:24,933 --> 00:00:26,360
Then we'll bring you back over here

9
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,810
and we're going to rename it as login-status-header.

10
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,550
So let's go ahead and find it first.

11
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,973
So we're looking for form-header.

12
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:40,493
Okay, there it is.

13
00:00:40,493 --> 00:00:42,050
We found it.

14
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,653
Let's go ahead and copy this.

15
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,160
Swing over here to our login-status,

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:50,993
we'll paste it

17
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,600
and then we'll simply rename it as login-status-header.

18
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,420
And again the reason that we're copying

19
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,820
and pasting these items that we may need to

20
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,390
make slight changes to them

21
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,060
or we just want to keep them localized

22
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,863
so in event that we do make any changes,

23
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:07,190
we don't impact the entire application only just

24
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,133
this login-status.component.

25
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,753
So it just gives us a little bit of flexibility here.

26
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,330
Alrighty, so we just have one more style

27
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,130
to copy and this'll be the last one.

28
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,070
So we're going to copy this .au-input

29
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:30,153
and then rename it as a login-status-user-info.

30
00:01:35,351 --> 00:01:36,330
And we'll make some changes

31
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,303
to this style by removing solid, font-size and color.

32
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,130
All right, so let's go ahead and find a au-input.

33
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,770
All right, so let's copy that,

34
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,550
swing back over to our login status CSS

35
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,370
we'll paste it

36
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,400
and first off rename it

37
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,963
login status user info.

38
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,650
So we'll remove

39
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,740
lets see the solid

40
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,453
and then we'll also remove the font size and color.

41
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,453
Okay.

42
00:02:48,453 --> 00:02:50,060
So that's it, as far as the modifications here

43
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,143
for our log in status user info.

44
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,133
Alrighty.

45
00:02:56,133 --> 00:02:57,214
So that was a fun exercise copying over those a CSS styles

46
00:02:57,214 --> 00:03:00,913
and making the slight mods and renames.

47
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,760
So we need to do one more thing.

48
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,020
We need to kind of add this

49
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,453
to the main app component .HTML file.

50
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,653
I have app component HTML open.

51
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:20,240
And let me expand my window here for a second.

52
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,020
So let's move down to that header desktop section.

53
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:27,530
And so we currently have our search component

54
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,810
and we also have our cart status component.

55
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:30,840
That's fine.

56
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,160
Now let's go ahead and add our new log-in status component

57
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,200
that we just created.

58
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,763
We're going to add it here to this header section.

59
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,820
So we'll squeeze it in right here

60
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,503
between the search and the cart status.

61
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,590
So now we have some real estate here

62
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,240
for our login status components,

63
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,920
so we can welcome back a user

64
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,230
and have the log out button,

65
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,530
or if they're not logged in,

66
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,360
then we give them the log in button

67
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,033
and we coded all that logic in the previous set of videos.
