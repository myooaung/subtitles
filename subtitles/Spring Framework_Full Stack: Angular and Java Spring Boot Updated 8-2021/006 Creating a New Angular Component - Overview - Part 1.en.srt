00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:02,230
<v Instructor>In this video,</v>

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:04,203
we'll create a new Angular component.

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,220
Our goal is to create a new Angular component

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,180
to display a table of data,

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,800
so we'll have information for our sales team.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,910
So we'll create this custom component

7
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,870
that'll have an HTML table,

8
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,810
and will provide the first name, last name,

9
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:24,643
email, and sales volume for our given sales team.

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,000
Let's look at our development process.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,833
So the first thing we'll do is

12
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:32,860
we'll create a new project.

13
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,820
Then we'll update the main template page.

14
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,610
Next we'll generate a new component,

15
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,480
and then we'll add the new component selector

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,193
to the app template page.

17
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,290
Next we'll generate a salesperson class.

18
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,390
Next, in the SalesPersonListComponent,

19
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,520
we'll create some sample data.

20
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,530
And then finally, in our sales-person-list template file,

21
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,643
we'll build the HTML table by looping over the data.

22
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,390
All righty, so starting here with step one,

23
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,670
creating a new project.

24
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,360
So we simply use the Angular CLI,

25
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,963
we say ng new sales-project.

26
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,720
And then once the project's created

27
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,773
then we simply cd into that directory.

28
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,800
And remember, this generates all of the Angular

29
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,210
starter files for our project

30
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,890
and we saw an overview of those files

31
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,523
in some of the previous videos.

32
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,510
All righty, in step two, we'll update

33
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,820
our main template page.

34
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,290
I'll move into the file and remove

35
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,610
all the Angular placeholder content

36
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:32,220
that they give us at the start

37
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,380
and just to keep our page simple and clean

38
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,063
for our custom project.

39
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,950
Then in step three, I need to generate a new component.

40
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,550
So I use the Angular CLI again.

41
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:48,480
So I'll say ng generate component sales-person-list.

42
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,630
It'll go off and create some files for us

43
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:53,423
and also perform an update on our module file.

44
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,710
And on the next slide, we'll actually

45
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,453
discuss these generated files.

46
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,150
All righty, so more information about

47
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,810
those generated files.

48
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,400
So the sales-person-list.component.ts,

49
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,960
that's the actual component class,

50
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,373
the typescript class,

51
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:14,563
The .html is the component template HTML file.

52
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,490
The .component.css is the component private CSS

53
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,523
specific for this given component.

54
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:25,820
And then a .spec.ts, that's the unit test

55
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,470
specifications for this component.

56
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:32,350
And then we saw the line about update the app.module.ts.

57
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,390
This is where it actually adds the component

58
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,503
to the main application module.

59
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,910
So here's a bit more about that main application module.

60
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,160
So that command here, basically what they did

61
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,830
is they modified the app.module.ts

62
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,680
and they added an import statement here to the module

63
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,020
and also a declaration for the module.

64
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,260
So our new component here, SalesPersonListComponent,

65
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,520
they automatically updated this file.

66
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,130
And this is actually a really nice feature.

67
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,500
In the early days of Angular,

68
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,980
you had to manually add this code to the app module

69
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,800
and it was a common pitfall for new developers,

70
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,040
so I'm really happy now that the Angular team

71
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,740
has incorporated this feature into the Angular CLI.

72
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,923
It makes life much easier for us developers.

73
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,710
Now looking at step four of adding

74
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,570
the new component selector to the app template page,

75
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,600
so on our app.component.html, we'll add a new reference

76
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,990
there for app-sales-person-list.

77
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,670
Now this is the actual name of the selector

78
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,667
from that new component that we just created.

79
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:36,630
Now we can verify that by looking at the @Component

80
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,840
definition here, selector: 'app-sales-person-list'.

81
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,390
So that's the actual custom tag that we'll use

82
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,520
for this given component here.

83
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,680
And for template URL, that's the location

84
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,163
to our actual component HTML file.

85
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:53,650
Now later on in our component class,

86
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,143
we'll actually add sample data here.

87
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,210
And then over on our template file,

88
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:03,450
our component.html, we'll add our HTML table here.

89
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,450
And you'll see how this'll all come together

90
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,843
later in the video.
