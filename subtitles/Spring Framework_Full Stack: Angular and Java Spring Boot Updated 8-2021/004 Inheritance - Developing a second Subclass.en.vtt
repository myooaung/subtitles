00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.110
<v Chad>All righty, so let's go ahead and zoom in here,</v>

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.063
and let's create a new file for our Rectangle.

3
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.850
All right, so let me kind of clean up

4
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.370
my windows here for a second.

5
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.173
Give me one second here, close that off.

6
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.070
Okay, great, so let's go ahead

7
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.040
and define our Rectangle class.

8
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.910
So I'm going to copy paste some stuff

9
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.700
from one of my other files.

10
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.363
So I'll copy paste from Circle.

11
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.130
I'll move to Rectangle, I'll do a paste,

12
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.453
and I'll simply change the class name.

13
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.270
So instead of Circle it's Rectangle.

14
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.920
So I'm in Recatangle.ts,

15
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:47.960
I just did a little copy paste

16
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.983
from Circle over to Rectangle.

17
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.850
So now what I'll actually do is define my properties

18
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.053
for _width and _length.

19
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.890
And then I'll go through the normal drill

20
00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.973
of generating the get and set accessors.

21
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.126
And I'll just kind of space things out a bit,

22
00:01:14.126 --> 00:01:15.730
between those methods,

23
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.310
and I'll actually move down to line 15,

24
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.610
and I'll cut that private property for _length, move up,

25
00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.060
and then paste it at the top.

26
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.020
I just like to keep my properties close together,

27
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.993
and my accessors near the bottom.

28
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.463
And then I'll move in here and I'll define my constructor.

29
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.020
So I'll have two regular parameters coming in

30
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.523
for theX and theY.

31
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.640
And then I'll also define those private properties here

32
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.190
for _width and _length.

33
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.663
So a little cut paste exercise here.

34
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.690
And I'll just do a little clean up here at the top.

35
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.550
Okay great, so the first line there,

36
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.480
those are the regular parameters, theX and theY,

37
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.490
and then _width and _length,

38
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.273
those are the parameter properties.

39
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.290
Okay, that looks good.

40
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.760
So now I'll simply make a call here

41
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.660
to my super class constructor,

42
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.060
and I pass in theX and theY.

43
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.620
Okay great, so our Rectangle class looks pretty good.

44
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.870
So let's go ahead and move down here to the bottom

45
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.740
and what I want to do is actually override the getInfo.

46
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.980
So I'll just kind of copy the version

47
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.823
of getInfo from Circle class,

48
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.610
and I'll paste it here into Rectangle.

49
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:47.920
There are some other ways we can do this

50
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.830
but for right now I'm just doing it the manual way.

51
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.100
I'll show you some automated ways to do this

52
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.623
in some other future videos.

53
00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.250
But anyways, we have getInfo in the Rectangle class,

54
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.100
and we have super.getInfo calling a superclass method,

55
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.810
and then we simply override it

56
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.130
and we add our _width and our _length.

57
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.150
All righty, so that's the getInfo method here

58
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.173
for our Rectangle class.

59
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.420
Okay, so let's swing back over to our Driver,

60
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.060
and let's add support here for our Rectangle class.

61
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.460
So we simply create a new instance of Rectangle.

62
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.573
So we pass in theX, Y, and the _width, the _length,

63
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.400
and it's giving me an error

64
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.560
saying hmm, can't find Rectangle.

65
00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.513
Oh, okay, I need to just simply do an import up top.

66
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.390
So we just do a Rectangle, from Rectangle,

67
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.550
and again in some later videos

68
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:03.840
I'll show some additional tricks

69
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.850
on how to make this process a little easier,

70
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.210
but for now we'll just kind of do it manually.

71
00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.663
And then finally console.log, and I say myRectangle.getInfo.

72
00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.110
Okay, so I just move into my Terminal window here.

73
00:04:22.306 --> 00:04:24.220
And just make sure I'm in the correct directory here

74
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.703
for 05-inheritance.

75
00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.900
I just compile the code, and then I run the code.

76
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.833
So I run that Driver.js.

77
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.570
And then there's our output,

78
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.233
so the first line's for myShape,

79
00:04:36.233 --> 00:04:37.803
and then myCircle, and then myRectangle.

80
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.190
All right, this looks great.

81
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.170
So we set up an inheritance example here using TypeScript.

82
00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:46.983
I'd like to say, good job!
