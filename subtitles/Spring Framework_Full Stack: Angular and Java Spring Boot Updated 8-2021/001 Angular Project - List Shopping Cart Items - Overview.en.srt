00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,450
<v Narrator>In this video we are going to cover</v>

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:04,913
Shopping Cart - List Items.

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,230
Alrighty, so we've added items to the cart,

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,160
now we'd like to be able to click on the cart icon here

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,013
and see the items in the cart.

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,440
Okay, so these are the items in our cart.

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,580
So, we have each row here for the cart item,

8
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,400
so the product image, product details

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,290
and the quantity and the subtotal.

10
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,470
Same thing for the next cart item.

11
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,960
And then finally in the bottom right

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,520
we'll have the actual total as far as

13
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,423
the total quantity and also the total price.

14
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,190
And it also accomplishes what actually creates

15
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:42,350
this new component, this Cart Details Component.

16
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,470
That'll be a table that'll simply list up

17
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,393
all of our cart items for us.

18
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,220
Okay, so let's go and look at the development process.

19
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,997
So, the first step is creating the new component,

20
00:00:52,997 --> 00:00:54,683
Cart Details Component.

21
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,410
Then we'll add a new route for the Cart Details Component.

22
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,560
Next we'll update the link for the Shopping Cart icon.

23
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,490
We'll modify the Cart Details Component

24
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,800
to retrieve the cart items.

25
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,020
And then finally, we'll add the HTML template

26
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,003
for the Cart Details Component.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,460
Okay, step one is creating

28
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,510
the new component for cart details.

29
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,740
So, we simply make use of that Angular command, right?

30
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,500
Ng generate component

31
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,653
and then we give components/cart-details.

32
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,430
And then in step two we'll add a new route

33
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,170
for the Cart Details Component.

34
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,860
So in our app.module.ts file I'll add this new route here.

35
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,900
Cart details and it'll map over

36
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,113
to our Cart Details Component.

37
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,360
Then in step three, we going to update

38
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,210
the link for the Shopping cart icon.

39
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:47,700
So, this is our cart-status.component.html.

40
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,690
So, we'll make use of our router link for cart details.

41
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,800
So, basically, when the user clicks

42
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,940
the Cart Status Component, then we going to use the new route

43
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,480
that we just created, cart details to view

44
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,393
the Cart Details Component.

45
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,160
Step four of modifying the Cart Details Component

46
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,710
to retrieve the cart items.

47
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,120
So, we'll have this class here, Cart Details Component.

48
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,320
We'll set up some properties

49
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,240
for cart item, total price, total quantity.

50
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,460
We'll inject cart service

51
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,571
and then in our ngOnInit

52
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:18,753
that we'll call this.listCartDetails.

53
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,610
And then here is the code here for listCartDetails.

54
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,240
We'll go through and we'll get a handle to the cart items.

55
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,690
Then we'll subscribe to the cart total price.

56
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,160
And we'll also subscribe to the cart total quantity.

57
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,320
Now, this code will look very familiar to you,

58
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,110
because we created a similar piece of code

59
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,130
for the Cart Status Component.

60
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,770
Subscribing to information on the cart service.

61
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,300
And then finally here, we'll compute

62
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,603
the cart total price and quantity.

63
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,210
And then finally in step five,

64
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:55,510
we'll add the HTML template for the Cart Details Component.

65
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,950
So basically we're building an HTML table.

66
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,530
So I'll set up my table headers here

67
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,693
for product image, product detail.

68
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,330
And then I'll simply loop through the cart items.

69
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,230
So that I'll have this temp cart item.

70
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,960
I'll display the image URL

71
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,443
and the also the name and the unit price.

72
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,460
And then we'll display the quantity

73
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,873
for the the cart item and also the subtotal.

74
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,160
And notice here for the subtotal

75
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,660
we're doing some quick math here

76
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,983
where the subtotal is the quantity times the unit price.

77
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,220
And then we have to kind of give

78
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,050
our grand total here at the bottom.

79
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,620
So, the total quantity and the total price.

80
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,110
And so this HTML code here will help us

81
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,160
with that part of it.

82
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,630
And so that's basically it.

83
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,980
So, we'll go ahead and dive into our IDE

84
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,343
and then we'll start writing the code.
