00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.000
<v Chad>In this video, we're going to get an overview</v>

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.943
of our Full Stack project.

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.050
For our project, we're going to build

4
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.500
a real-time e-commerce application,

5
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.080
and it'll be a Full Stack application.

6
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.970
We'll have an angular front-end,

7
00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.310
and we'll have a Spring Boot back-end.

8
00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:19.990
The front and back-end will communicate

9
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.590
using a REST API, and also on the back-end,

10
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.210
we'll have a database setup,

11
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.243
and we'll have full CRUD support for our given database.

12
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.770
All righty, and so here are our project requirements

13
00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.120
from the boss, so we'd like to be able

14
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.820
to show a list of products.

15
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.470
We'd also like to be able to add products

16
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.720
to the shopping cart and have CRUD support

17
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.220
on that shopping cart, and then also perform

18
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.000
shopping cart checkout,

19
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.470
and also add user login/logout security,

20
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.223
and finally track the previous orders for logged in users.

21
00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.950
Let's go ahead and look at the wireframes for this project.

22
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.270
Here's our home page.

23
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.220
At the top, we'll have our luv2shop application.

24
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.170
We'll have a search bar along the top.

25
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.730
And also over on the far right,

26
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.030
we'll have a shopping cart status.

27
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.270
Over on the left-hand side,

28
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.790
we'll have some categories where we can shop by category.

29
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.390
And then the main content panel will show all

30
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.170
of the list items of the actual products

31
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.470
for our application, and then in the bottom right,

32
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.570
we can do some pagination and play around.

33
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.773
That's the basic layout here for our home page.

34
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.970
And then moving forward, once the user selects

35
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.910
a given product, then right here in the center,

36
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.480
we'll have the actual product details,

37
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.840
information about the product,

38
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.450
the title, the subtitle, price, an option to add to cart,

39
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.220
and then more detailed product description

40
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.713
for this given item.

41
00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.200
And then here's a view of the Shopping Cart Details page.

42
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.840
We'll show a list of all of the items

43
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.330
in the shopping cart.

44
00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.410
Over on the right-hand side,

45
00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.440
they could perform some operations on the shopping cart

46
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.010
like increase the quantity or decrease, remove something.

47
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.290
We'll see the subtotals.

48
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.710
And then at the bottom, we'll have totals for everything,

49
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.460
and then a button there to actually perform a checkout.

50
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.280
Here's our Checkout page.

51
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.870
We collect the standard information,

52
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.080
write the customers name, email address,

53
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.450
their shipping address, their billing address,

54
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.690
also collect their credit card information,

55
00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.660
and then finally we have a section

56
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.730
where they can review their order,

57
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.380
and finally here there's a Purchase button

58
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.293
to actually complete the checkout.

59
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.460
Those are all the wireframes.

60
00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.630
Here's our release plan for releasing our product.

61
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.340
We'll release it in multiple versions.

62
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.790
In the release version 1.0, we'd like to be able

63
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.410
to show a list of products, and then in release 2.0,

64
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.600
we'll add products to our shopping cart

65
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.600
and also perform the shopping cart checkout.

66
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.410
And in release 3.0, we'll add user login/logout security

67
00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.790
and also support the track previous orders

68
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.193
for logged in users.

69
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.950
This looks like a really good release plan.

70
00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:04.783
I like it.
