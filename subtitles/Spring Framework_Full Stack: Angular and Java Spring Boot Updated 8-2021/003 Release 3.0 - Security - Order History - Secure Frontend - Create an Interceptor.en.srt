1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,790
<v Instructor>Okay, so let's go ahead and get started</v>

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,710
with our development process.

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,050
In this video we'll cover step one

4
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:07,403
of creating an interceptor.

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,500
Okay, so let's go ahead and move

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,193
into a terminal window here.

7
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,363
Move into our appropriate directory,

8
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:33,400
and let's use the Angular CLI for generating the service.

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,893
So NG generate service, services slash auth interceptor.

10
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,260
All right, so that's been generated.

11
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,080
We can look into our services directory

12
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,040
and see that there's an auth interceptor service dot CS.

13
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:52,873
Okay, great.

14
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,240
Okay, so let's go ahead

15
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,493
and implement the interceptor interface.

16
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:20,910
All right, so that's in place.

17
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,770
Now notice here we have an error on this class.

18
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,670
Kind of just hover over it for a bit,

19
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,430
and it says that it incorrectly implements the interface,

20
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,560
'cause a property's missing of intercept.

21
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,230
All right, so that's the method that we have to implement

22
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,290
for this given interface.

23
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,083
So we just use the IDE to kind of help us out with that.

24
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,020
Now go ahead and add some of my coding here.

25
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,980
I'll say returned from this dot handle access,

26
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,993
and we pass in the request comma next.

27
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,580
So I'll just use some of these IDE tips here.

28
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,963
So I'm going to go ahead and clean up

29
00:02:33,963 --> 00:02:34,810
the params for this handle access.

30
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,940
I'll come back to this in a second.

31
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,523
Let's get this lined up just for a moment.

32
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,363
And I'll set this up as private async.

33
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,663
Async function here or method.

34
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,140
We pass in those parameter types here,

35
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,710
request of HTTP request.

36
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:06,103
Next HTTP handler.

37
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,090
And this is going to return a promise.

38
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,683
Alrighty, so this looks pretty good.

39
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:29,420
I still have this error message up top

40
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,083
regarding the request.

41
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,080
Oh yeah, simply have to just use the right parameter name.

42
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,910
There we go, request.

43
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:38,743
Easy fix.

44
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,550
So now we have the basic stuff in place for this one.

45
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,700
So you can just use this as a checkpoint

46
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,900
for your coding for now.
