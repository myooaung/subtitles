00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.300
<v Instructor>Alrighty, so getting started</v>

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.370
with our development process.

3
00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.050
In this video, we'll cover steps one and two

4
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.440
of updating a CartService to read the data

5
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.410
from session storage and also adding that new method

6
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.733
in CartService, that new method, persistCartItems.

7
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.490
So I'll just move into my coding here to my service

8
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.563
and my cart.service.ts.

9
00:00:38.824 --> 00:00:40.010
And I'll move down here,

10
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.313
and I'll set up this storage variable.

11
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.593
I'll assign it to sessionStorage.

12
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.930
So that's a reference to the web browser's session storage,

13
00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.030
and we get access to this object for free.

14
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.790
So now I'm moving to my constructor here.

15
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.940
I'll read a little quick comment to myself.

16
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.033
So I'm going to read the data from storage.

17
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.630
So here I have let data equals JSON.parse,

18
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.230
this.storage.getItem, cartItems,

19
00:01:30.531 --> 00:01:32.230
so cartItems is the key.

20
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.790
And, remember, you can use any name.

21
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.333
Just stay consistent throughout your application.

22
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.260
And so, the JSON.parse, it basically reads that JSON string

23
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.710
and converts it to an object.

24
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.730
Okay, now I'll just do a check

25
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.453
to make sure it's not equal to null.

26
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.680
And then I just make an assignment here,

27
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.673
this.cartItems equals data.

28
00:02:12.571 --> 00:02:14.230
And then I'll just compute the totals

29
00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.513
based on the data that's read from storage.

30
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.193
So I'll make use of this.computeCartTotals.

31
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.300
All right, so that covers everything

32
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.280
for reading the data from storage.

33
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.580
Now we're going to move ahead to step two

34
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.761
of adding the new method in CartService

35
00:02:36.761 --> 00:02:38.593
for persistCartItems.

36
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.390
So I'll just scroll down a bit,

37
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.140
and I'll add in this new method here, persistCartItems.

38
00:03:01.124 --> 00:03:05.464
And so now I make use of this.storage.setItem.

39
00:03:05.464 --> 00:03:07.631
I give the key, cartItems,

40
00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:13.389
and then I make use of JSON.stringify, this.cartItems.

41
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.340
So, remember, cartItems is the key,

42
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.940
and then this.cartItems is the value.

43
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.650
And we take this value and we stringify it,

44
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.590
so JSON.strinify will convert the object to a JSON string,

45
00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.020
because, remember, the API only works for strings

46
00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.833
for the keys and the values.
