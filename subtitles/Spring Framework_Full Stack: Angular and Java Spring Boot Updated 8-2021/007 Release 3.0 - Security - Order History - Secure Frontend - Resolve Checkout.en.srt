1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,770
<v ->Now, there's one thing that I want to talk to you about</v>

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:07,860
or show you that we still have an issue in our application

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,320
by making use of this security work.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,960
And primarily when we go through and do a checkout.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,760
Let's go and add a couple of items to our shopping cart.

6
00:00:22,296 --> 00:00:23,660
So right now I have a couple of items.

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:24,883
I'll do a Checkout.

8
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,613
We'll go ahead and fill out our Customer information here.

9
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:55,750
And now we can go ahead and Purchase or Checkout

10
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,153
and notice that we'll get a Failure.

11
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,030
So the error message says

12
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:05,827
failure response for /api/checkout/purchase:403.

13
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,130
It says, Okay, but that's not okay.

14
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,810
Let's find out exactly what's going on here

15
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,623
so I can go into my developer Console here.

16
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,533
All right.

17
00:01:20,533 --> 00:01:24,290
So it says Failed to load resource status 403.

18
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:25,123
Okay.

19
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,130
Swing back over to my application

20
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:44,730
and take a look at my Security Configuration.

21
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:45,563
So that's there.

22
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,080
And also let's take a look

23
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,853
at our controller for the purchase, or for the checkout.

24
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,270
So our CheckoutController here

25
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,260
"/api/checkout" PostMapping("/ purchase").

26
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,760
Ah, okay, got it.

27
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,593
Got it.

28
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:24,663
All right.

29
00:02:24,663 --> 00:02:27,210
So this fails because we're sending the checkout requests

30
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,860
with the HTTP POST.

31
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,720
By default CSRF is enabled.

32
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,700
Remember CSRF is for the Cross Site Request Forgery.

33
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,510
So basically this is a protection

34
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,390
for your given application.

35
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,376
And the way CSF works is that it performs checks

36
00:02:42,376 --> 00:02:45,900
on HTTP requests that can modify the data.

37
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,530
So like a post or put or another feature there.

38
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,620
So in this case was sending over a POST

39
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,970
and they perform this check by making use of cookies.

40
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:58,410
And our scenario here, we're not using cookies

41
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,900
for session tracking.

42
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,100
So then the CSRF protection says

43
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,493
the request is unauthorized.

44
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,470
We can resolve this by disabling CSRF in our application.

45
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,150
This technique is commonly used for REST APIs

46
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,180
because of state lists.

47
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:17,020
We're not using making use of session cookies and so forth.

48
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,513
So this is totally okay for this scenario.

49
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,430
Let's go ahead and move into our security code here.

50
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,070
And we're going to disable CSRF

51
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,620
since we're not using Cookies for session tracking.

52
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,550
Okay. So the coding is in place for this.

53
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:05,713
Let's go ahead and save this and run our application again.

54
00:04:16,593 --> 00:04:17,910
Now we can swing back to our app

55
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,710
and we can kind of just pick up where we left off.

56
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:22,250
Cause we have all the data set up here

57
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,570
for the form and hit Purchase

58
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:26,700
and Success.

59
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,530
So the order has been received

60
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,580
and they gave us an Order tracking number.

61
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,413
So this was awesome.

62
00:04:31,413 --> 00:04:34,010
So we were able to resolve that issue

63
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:37,980
by disabling CSRF primarily here for this scenario

64
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:42,140
since we're not using session cookies for tracking

65
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,600
and all of our order stuff works.

66
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,050
And we can see that new order that just went in.

67
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,960
We know it's actually saving that order

68
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,270
on the backend and processing it successfully.

69
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,103
All right.

70
00:04:53,103 --> 00:04:54,090
So this is some really good work

71
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,473
and I'd like to say good job, my friend.
