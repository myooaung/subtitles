00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.210
<v Instructor>Okay, so moving along</v>

2
00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:03.550
with our development process.

3
00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.640
In this video, we'll cover steps three and four

4
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.780
of adding the Member button to the login-status component,

5
00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.660
and also defining a protected route

6
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.503
for the members-page component.

7
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.240
Alrighty, so let's go ahead and move over

8
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.140
to the login-status component

9
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.593
and open up this login-status.component.html file.

10
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.050
So this is where we have our buttons,

11
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.663
and we're going to add one more button for the Member button.

12
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.010
And I'll just move down here

13
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.053
and I'll actually copy one of the previous lines.

14
00:00:54.698 --> 00:00:56.248
Just doing a little copy paste.

15
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.080
And this snippet of code here for the ngIf,

16
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.930
let's remove this for right now.

17
00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.170
We'll actually add it back later,

18
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.680
but I want to just show you how the application will work

19
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.113
if we don't have this piece of code there.

20
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.620
I want to also remove the click portion of the code

21
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.943
and we'll add a router link here.

22
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.093
So this will be a router link to /members,

23
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.563
and the actual button will have the text of Member.

24
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.710
And there's one small thing I want to do here,

25
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.510
just a cosmetic item here.

26
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.860
I want to add a bootstrap CSS style

27
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.340
just to give us some margin space on the left.

28
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.623
So ml-1 for one px.

29
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.710
All right, so that's our new Member button

30
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.523
that we've just added to this login-status component.

31
00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.640
Alrighty, so now we're up to step four

32
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.260
of defining a protected route

33
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.000
for the members-page component.

34
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.113
This is probably the most important part of this demo.

35
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.223
So I'll move down to my app.module.ts file.

36
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.320
And I'll move down to the section

37
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.853
where we define our routes.

38
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.390
And I'll copy one of the previous routes

39
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.460
and just kind of paste it here

40
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.010
to have something to work with.

41
00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.603
And this path will be members.

42
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.650
The component will be the reference to that new component

43
00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.563
that we just created, the MembersPageComponent.

44
00:03:02.963 --> 00:03:04.770
And now for the important part is setting up

45
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.623
our route guard, so we make use of that canActivate.

46
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.933
And then we give a reference to the OktaAuthGuard.

47
00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.270
So remember, this is our route guard that we've set up here.

48
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.880
And basically, if authenticated,

49
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.370
will give access to the route,

50
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.813
else will send the user to the login page.

51
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.460
And one other thing I need to do here,

52
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.350
I need to make a code update into this oktaConfig.

53
00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.030
I need to add one more parameter here.

54
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.360
I'll just call it oktaAuth, and we have the injector.

55
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.870
So just make sure you add this new entry here

56
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.343
for this oktaAuth.

57
00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.460
Alrighty, so we're in good shape here.

58
00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.490
We defined this new route here for members

59
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.670
and we set up our route guard accordingly.

60
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:03.970
So this looks really good.

61
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.193
I think I'm ready to test this out.
