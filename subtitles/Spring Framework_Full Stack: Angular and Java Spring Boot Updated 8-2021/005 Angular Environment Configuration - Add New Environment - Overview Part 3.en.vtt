00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:03.660
<v Instructor>Now, I know that you've had this question</v>

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:04.990
sitting in the back of your mind,

3
00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.010
like why production false, production true?

4
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.700
What's the purpose of those entries,

5
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.480
and kind of what's up with that?

6
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.873
So let's discuss it.

7
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.680
So we saw environment TS had production false,

8
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.403
environment Prod, TS had production true.

9
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.470
So in our main application,

10
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.420
so this is part of our Angular project.

11
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.880
If you look into your source code,

12
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.990
there's a file called Main.cs.

13
00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.140
This is already provided for you by the Angular framework,

14
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.960
whenever you create your Angular project.

15
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.653
So you have access to this file.

16
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.430
In Main.ts, there's a reference here that says,

17
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.410
if environment.production.

18
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.020
So basically here we're saying

19
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.570
if the environment production value is set to true,

20
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.600
then we'll enable Prod mode or enable Production mode.

21
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.700
So what exactly is Prod mode?

22
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.350
Well, Prod mode reduces the internal logging messages,

23
00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.020
disable file checks for auto reloading,

24
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.470
minifies your scripts and styles, eliminates dead-code,

25
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.270
inline critical CSS and fonts,

26
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.773
and a number of other performance optimizations.

27
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.290
And now if you'd like to get additional information

28
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.010
about Prod mode, you can go to the link

29
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.330
that I have here on the slide.

30
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.250
It'll redirect you to the official Angular documentation,

31
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.460
and you can learn more details

32
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.663
as far as the Angular optimization configuration.

33
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.030
Alrighty, so this looks pretty good.

34
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.370
Let's go ahead and move into the next video

35
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:28.823
and let's get started.
