00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:02.640
<v Instructor>All righty, so I'm getting</v>

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.770
a bit excited here,

3
00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:04.940
I'm ready to test it out,

4
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.930
I want to see this code running.

5
00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.400
All right, so back in my browser here,

6
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.970
billing address section,

7
00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:11.803
swing down

8
00:00:11.803 --> 00:00:12.636
and hit purchase.

9
00:00:12.636 --> 00:00:13.650
Swing back up to the top,

10
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.530
and all right, success.

11
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.270
So all of the fields here

12
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.260
have an entry here,

13
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.870
that country is required.

14
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:21.880
Good, good, I like it.

15
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:22.713
I like it.

16
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.570
And we can also add data

17
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:27.403
and everything kind of

18
00:00:27.403 --> 00:00:29.563
works out as desired.

19
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.900
Well, not exactly as desired,

20
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.070
because I've seen a bug.

21
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.240
Look at this,

22
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.840
the only inner one character

23
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.170
near this blank error message.

24
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.150
Hmm!

25
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.863
What's up with that?

26
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.430
I think I know.

27
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.670
So some of the fields

28
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.630
had a requirement for min length.

29
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.580
But we didn't add any displays

30
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.940
or error messages

31
00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.690
to handle the case for min length.

32
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.440
So we need to make the updates for that

33
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.490
right here in this section.

34
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.200
So that's why we had the issue.

35
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.830
So it knew it was an error.

36
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.210
But it didn't display the message

37
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.043
because we didn't have

38
00:01:10.043 --> 00:01:13.210
the appropriate code, ooh, yikes,

39
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.043
but no problems,

40
00:01:14.043 --> 00:01:14.960
we can fix it.

41
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.653
We know how to solve this.

42
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.370
So we simply need to check

43
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.153
for the error code of min length.

44
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.053
So billingaddressZipCode.errors.mainland.

45
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.150
And then I need to say, hey,

46
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.983
we need a minimum

47
00:01:42.983 --> 00:01:44.150
of two characters

48
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.873
for blah, blah, blah.

49
00:01:51.815 --> 00:01:55.148
So at least two characters are required.

50
00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.093
And now if I swing back over,

51
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.170
and now if I only type one character,

52
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.003
it is okay,

53
00:02:06.003 --> 00:02:07.020
at least two characters are required.

54
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.853
Okay, good.

55
00:02:07.853 --> 00:02:08.763
So that's my bug.

56
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:10.600
So that works.

57
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.433
We fixed it.

58
00:02:11.433 --> 00:02:14.730
But we need to apply this same thing

59
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.680
to all of the other fields

60
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.110
that had the min length item on it.

61
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.943
But no problems,

62
00:02:20.943 --> 00:02:21.790
just a matter of just doing

63
00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.810
a little quick copy-paste on that

64
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.350
to get things up and going.

65
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.183
But I want to make sure

66
00:02:27.183 --> 00:02:30.210
I'm using the same text here

67
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.770
for the length.

68
00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:33.730
So let's see here.

69
00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.250
Okay, so last name must be

70
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.453
at least two characters.

71
00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.963
So I'll use that same thing down here.

72
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.020
So here, I'll say zip code must be

73
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.910
at least two characters long

74
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.150
just to have the same messaging

75
00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.580
across the board.

76
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.150
So I'll just kind of take this item

77
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.350
and I'll use it

78
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.113
in the other fields.

79
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.230
So just kind of follow along with me

80
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.100
and we'll make

81
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.770
the appropriate updates.

82
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.070
So pretty much on any field

83
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.960
that has regular text

84
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.110
that the user can enter

85
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.540
as far as typing

86
00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.403
than we need to handle for this.

87
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.000
So that's for city,

88
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.553
something here for streets.

89
00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:43.783
And let's see,

90
00:03:43.783 --> 00:03:44.690
country is okay

91
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.290
because that's a drop-down list.

92
00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.840
And, up to the top of shipping address

93
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.370
and so we'll apply this for

94
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.340
street, city

95
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.283
and zip code.

96
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.233
So this is shipping address,

97
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.503
so shipping address street.

98
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.150
Add the code here for city

99
00:04:45.444 --> 00:04:46.873
and also for zip code.

100
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.140
All righty, so those are the updates here

101
00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.210
to handle for min length

102
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:09.360
as well as the error messages.

103
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.980
So now all of the other fields

104
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.090
on the forms are A-okay

105
00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.240
and we're good to go.

106
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.210
So we can do just a quick test here.

107
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.173
So street.

108
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:20.643
Shows us that message.

109
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.760
Zip code, we're in good shape.

110
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.970
So that bug fix worked out

111
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.700
just fine for us.

112
00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:29.550
So I like to say,

113
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.683
good job, my friend.
