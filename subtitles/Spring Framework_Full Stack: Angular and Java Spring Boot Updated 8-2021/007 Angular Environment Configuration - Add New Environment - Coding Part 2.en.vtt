00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.520
<v Instructor>Okay, so in this video,</v>

2
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.820
we'll cover steps one and two of our process.

3
00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.820
We'll create the environment file:environment.qa.ts

4
00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.040
and define the configuration

5
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.663
in the angular.json"build"section.

6
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.900
Okay, let's get started.

7
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.263
So step one, creating an environment file environment.qa.ts.

8
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.890
So we'll move over here to our

9
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.120
source environments directory,

10
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.130
and I'll simply copy paste an existing file.

11
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.893
So I'll copy environment.ts and then paste it.

12
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.373
And I'll simply rename it.

13
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.583
So I'll rename it as environment.qa.ts.

14
00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:04.950
All right, so I'll close the environment.ts

15
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.970
and I'll make sure that I'm in environment.qa.ts.

16
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.960
So just kind of do a little checkpoint here,

17
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.330
make sure you're in the right file,

18
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.453
you're editing the right file, environment.qa.ts.

19
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.070
And now for the qa environment,

20
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.900
we know that our Spring boot app is running on port 9898,

21
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.163
so we need to update this URL value accordingly.

22
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:32.663
Now, in step two,

23
00:01:32.663 --> 00:01:35.670
we need to define our configuration in the angular.json file

24
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.223
for the build section.

25
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.163
So I moved down here to angular.json.

26
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.050
And then remember this is a large file here

27
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.990
so when you go to the path, projects,

28
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.630
angular-ecommerce, architect, build, configurations.

29
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:54.463
So, it's really important

30
00:01:54.463 --> 00:01:57.230
that you make it to the right location within this file.

31
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.330
So projects, angular-ecommerce,

32
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.050
architect, field, configurations.

33
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.450
Okay, that's where we're at.

34
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:10.880
And then as a checkpoint,

35
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.313
you can see there's the existing entry here for production.

36
00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.030
And so we'll kind of roll down a bit

37
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.380
just to kind of see where we're at in the file.

38
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.420
And also just kind of moving up

39
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.150
to make sure these things are lined up just right.

40
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.140
So production,

41
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.040
so this is where we want to add

42
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.490
a new entry here after production.

43
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:34.640
And then also up top,

44
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.860
I have a little highlight here

45
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.030
where your path should be similar

46
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.430
to the path that we have here.

47
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.400
So again, projects, angular-ecommerce, architect, build

48
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.500
in this case configuration.

49
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.950
And we'll add this new configuration here for qa.

50
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.763
So it's our configuration name.

51
00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.943
And then we add the entries here for file replacements,

52
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.170
and we say replace and so we give the original file,

53
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.063
environments/environment.ts,

54
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.150
and then we tell it which one to replace with.

55
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.053
And so this is going to be our environment.qa.ts.

56
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.880
And so remember it doesn't actually replace the file

57
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.713
on the file system,

58
00:03:31.713 --> 00:03:33.150
it simply tells angular to

59
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.180
load the environment.qa.ts file,

60
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.733
as opposed to the regular environment.ts.

61
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.980
Okay, so we can kind of use this as a checkpoint

62
00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.410
just to see where we're at

63
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.513
and make sure everything is lined up okay.
