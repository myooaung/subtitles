1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:03,620
<v ->Alrighty, so that covers how it works behind the scenes,</v>

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,720
and also how the filenames are mapped to an environment.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,590
The next question is, well, how can I add a new environment.

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,760
So going beyond the default, beyond the dot prod,

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,253
how can I add a brand new environment.

6
00:00:21,044 --> 00:00:23,360
So we have our angular application.

7
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,630
We already have the dev default set up.

8
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:27,880
We already have prod set up.

9
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,600
We see how that part works.

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,270
I like to add a new environment here called QA,

11
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,150
and I'm going to run the Spring Boot back in

12
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,450
on a different port in the QA environment.

13
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,840
So those would be on localhost:9898,

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,050
so running it on a different port.

15
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,620
So at the bottom here, I'd like to say,

16
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,520
npm start configuration equals qa,

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,860
and then that should have the angular app

18
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:52,020
use the URL for the given QA application,

19
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,463
or the QA environment.

20
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,760
Okay, so here's our development process.

21
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,790
So in step one, we're going to create an environment file

22
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,330
called environment.qa.ts.

23
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,140
And then we'll define a configuration in the angular.json

24
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,700
for the build section.

25
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,400
And we'll also define a configuration in angular.json

26
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,450
for the serve section.

27
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,590
And then finally we'll run our application

28
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,473
with the environment configuration.

29
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,490
Okay, step one of creating the environment file

30
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,400
for environment.qa.ts.

31
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,590
So know that our Spring Boot app

32
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,060
is running on a different port, port 9898.

33
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,283
We'll create this file here, environment.qa.ts.

34
00:01:32,614 --> 00:01:35,623
We'll add our custom environment configurations here.

35
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,890
And so we had this luv2shopApiUrl,

36
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,200
So be sure to use the same name for that entry.

37
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,470
And then we give the value here

38
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,180
that we'll use for the QA environment,

39
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,500
because we know that our Spring Boot app

40
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,603
is running on port 9898, in the QA environment.

41
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,633
And then in step two,

42
00:01:54,633 --> 00:01:55,466
we're going to define the configuration

43
00:01:55,466 --> 00:01:58,150
and the angular.json for the build section.

44
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:01,040
Now the angular.json file is a really large file

45
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,660
with a lot of nested entries here.

46
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,670
So this is kind of the path on how to

47
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:07,330
navigate into the angular.json file.

48
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:11,220
So we'll move to the path projects&gt;angular-ecommerce&gt;

49
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,740
architect&gt;build&gt;, and then configurations.

50
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,270
And that's how we'll add our work here

51
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,723
for this build section.

52
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,470
So here's a snippet here of the angular.json file.

53
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,320
So under configurations,

54
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,490
then we'll add this new entry here for qa.

55
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,273
So that's our configuration name,

56
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,820
and we can actually use any configuration name.

57
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,360
I could call it qa, I could call it beta test,

58
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,410
I could call it west coast.

59
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,560
You can give any name here that you'd like.

60
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,730
And then I'll set up the fileReplacements here.

61
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:49,453
So I'll say replace environment.ts with environment.qa.ts.

62
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,750
And so remember again,

63
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,100
during processing for the qa configuration,

64
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,400
it's going to load the file environment.qa.ts.

65
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,130
So again, we're not really changing anything on

66
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,420
the file system, we're simply telling angular, hey,

67
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:05,233
when you load the environment, load environment.qa.ts.

68
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:10,480
And then you can actually use any file name here,

69
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,460
the best practice is to stay consistent

70
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,890
with the configuration name, or use a name that's similar.

71
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,110
This simply makes it easy for other developers

72
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,660
to understand your process.

73
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,563
If you kind of keep things simple for the developers.

74
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,090
Okay. So moving ahead to step three,

75
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,940
defining the configuration angular.json

76
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,800
for the serve section.

77
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,100
So again, this is this big long angular.json file,

78
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,220
and here's the actual path for it.

79
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:40,740
We have projects&gt;angular-ecommerce&gt;architects&gt;serve&gt;

80
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,430
configurations, so the serve section.

81
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:46,040
So here's a little snippet of the angular.json file.

82
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,260
We're in the serve section,

83
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,660
we set up the configurations here,

84
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,413
and I give the actual configuration name of qa.

85
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,770
And this is actually referenced from the command line,

86
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,110
when we start the application.

87
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:01,140
So when I say npm start configuration equals qa,

88
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,833
that's the configuration name that they're going to use.

89
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,220
And then I set up a browser target,

90
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:10,990
angular-ecommerce:build:qa, referencing the configuration

91
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,750
defined on the previous slide.

92
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,690
So in that angular.json file that other section there

93
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,560
a qa that has the fileReplacements.

94
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,110
And then that's it as far as mapping the files together,

95
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,560
and setting up the build section,

96
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,460
and also setting up the serve section.

97
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,830
So then step four, we simply run the application

98
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,030
with our environment configuration.

99
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,050
So here I'm going to run with the qa configuration.

100
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:38,630
So I'll say npm start configuration equals qa.

101
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,660
And then, based on these configs that we just added

102
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,940
to the angular.json file, then it will know,

103
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,080
oh, okay, great, I need to use

104
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,600
the appropriate file replacements.

105
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,050
And here it'll load up environment.qa.ts.

106
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,220
And that'll give us the luv2shopApiUrl.

107
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,770
That'll connect to our Spring Boot backend,

108
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:58,113
that's listening on port 9898 for the qa environment.
