00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:02.840
<v Narrator>Alrighty, so we're moving right along here.</v>

2
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.400
So in this video we'll cover steps three and four:

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.730
defining the router outlet,

4
00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.810
and also setting up the router links that pass

5
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.633
the category id param.

6
00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.680
Alrighty, step three of defining the router outlet.

7
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.240
Let's go ahead and move over to our file AppComponent.html

8
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.603
Let me zoom out a bit and expand my window.

9
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.090
So here, for the main content,

10
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.590
instead of using the app product list directly,

11
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.430
you want to make use of that router outlet.

12
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.560
So let's just go ahead and comment out this code

13
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.300
for right now, or you can delete it.

14
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.473
It's totally up to you.

15
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.340
And in this location, we'll actually make use of

16
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.733
the router outlet.

17
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.730
So remember, the router outlet acts as a placeholder.

18
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.750
It's going to render the desired component

19
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.840
based on the route.

20
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.463
And I'll do it at this given location.

21
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.760
And, now that I think about it,

22
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.730
this little commenting code,

23
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:19.770
let's just go ahead and delete it,

24
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.020
we don't need it anymore.

25
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.440
All right, so let's scroll up a bit

26
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.903
to the section for menu side bar.

27
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.710
And this is for step 4,

28
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.630
setting up the route links to pass category id parameter.

29
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.240
So that little left-hand menu bar here,

30
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.930
we're going to set up some links to actually

31
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.380
perform some operations here.

32
00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.370
So moving down to this section

33
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.030
where we have books, coffee mugs,

34
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.920
and mouse pads, and luggage tags.

35
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.773
So that's our little menu side bar here.

36
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.010
I'm going to get rid of mouse pads and luggage tags,

37
00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.910
because right now I simply want to focus on

38
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.980
books and coffee mugs, for right now.

39
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:02.813
But don't worry,

40
00:02:02.813 --> 00:02:05.350
we'll get all of our categories in a little bit later,

41
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.123
in some of the other videos.

42
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.730
So for this href, I'm going to remove this

43
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.283
and replace it with a router link.

44
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.520
And so I'm going to reference

45
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.250
category slash the category id.

46
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.883
So the category id in this example is one.

47
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.440
And then I'll set the router link active,

48
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.863
and I'll give a reference here to a CSS style.

49
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.000
So again, the param name is id,

50
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.120
so we're going to pass the value of one

51
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.623
for this given parameter.

52
00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.940
And this is all based on our routes configuration

53
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.230
that we set up earlier.

54
00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.063
So in this case,

55
00:03:01.063 --> 00:03:02.920
we're going to use the product list component

56
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.823
and we path in a given id.

57
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.890
And once the user clicks the link,

58
00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.010
then we apply a custom CSS style,

59
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.073
so active dash link.

60
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.240
So I just did a little quick copy and paste here.

61
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.740
I'll update the actual categories.

62
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.593
So category of 2 and then it's for coffee mugs.

63
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.300
All right, so that's the basic layout here

64
00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.350
for our menu links,

65
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.650
so our menu links are set up at the moment,

66
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:42.800
so this is pretty good.

67
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.854
But actually, if you notice like hmm,

68
00:03:53.854 --> 00:03:56.527
at the moment we're hard coating the categories.

69
00:03:56.527 --> 00:04:00.310
And so, in later videos we'll make this more dynamic,

70
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.410
and we'll read the category information from

71
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.210
the REST API, and actually read the categories

72
00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:06.630
from the data base.

73
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.700
But for now let's get it working with the basics.

74
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.340
Then, later on, we'll add more advanced, dynamic features.

75
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.590
So don't worry, I've got you covered on this.
