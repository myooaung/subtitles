00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:04,150
<v Instructor>In this video, we'll cover user registration.</v>

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,970
So let's configure the sign-in widget for user registration.

3
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,010
So we'll have our page,

4
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,260
and we'll have this new entry here at the bottom.

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,110
Don't have an account, sign up.

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,450
They click the link to sign up,

7
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,010
and then we'll give them this form.

8
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,250
They can give their email address, password,

9
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,900
first name and last name, and then they can register.

10
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,580
So with email activation during the registration process,

11
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,100
the user is required to provide an email address.

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,610
So Okta will send the user an email.

13
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,340
Now we have the option to configure the email activation.

14
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,560
One is that we can make the email activation mandatory.

15
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,760
So that means that the user must click the link

16
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,370
in the email for their account to be active.

17
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,610
Or we can make the activation optional.

18
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,050
So here the user is not required

19
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,000
to click the link for activation.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,303
They can still log in.

21
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,140
Now, I like to say that email activation mandatory,

22
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,550
this is good for production

23
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:01,830
because you're going to make sure that they give you

24
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,440
a valid email address.

25
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,400
And then for activation optional,

26
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,670
this is good for dev or testing when you're starting out.

27
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,180
So this allows you to make use of fake emails

28
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,842
so you can make use of like user1@luv2code.com,

29
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:17,950
user2@luv2code.com, or whatever.

30
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,260
Just give fake emails

31
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,600
just to see that the whole user registration process works.

32
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,330
But again, once you go to production,

33
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,653
you can flip the switch and make the activation mandatory.

34
00:01:31,548 --> 00:01:33,320
All right, so let's look at the development process.

35
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,850
It's a really short process.

36
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,020
The first step is enabling user registration

37
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,720
in the Okta Dashboard.

38
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,280
And then we simply configure the code

39
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,400
in the login component.

40
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,713
So it's really short, really sweet.

41
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,010
All right, so step one of enabling the user registration

42
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,170
in the Okta Dashboard.

43
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,400
First, we log into the Okta Dashboard.

44
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,740
Then we select Users, Registration,

45
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,340
like you see here on the screen.

46
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,620
And then we simply enable the registration.

47
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,380
We set up the activation requirements

48
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,440
as far as enabling or disabling.

49
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,520
And I'll get into all the details in the upcoming video,

50
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,760
all the different things you need to click and set up.

51
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,853
We'll cover that in the upcoming video.

52
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,910
All righty, step two of configuring the code

53
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,380
in the login component.

54
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,800
So when we create our Okta sign-in

55
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,200
inside of the constructor,

56
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,530
we simply give this new item here.

57
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,720
We make use of features registration true.

58
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,390
So this will allow us to have that actual item there

59
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,950
on the login widget,

60
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:36,633
where we can have the actual sign up or registration link.

61
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,460
For developer documentation,

62
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,180
you can get additional details on user registration.

63
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,790
See this link I have on the slide.

64
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:49,323
It'll redirect you to the official Okta documentation.

65
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,200
Okay, I'm excited.

66
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,660
Let's go ahead and move into the next video,

67
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,800
and let's go ahead and get this set up and configured.

68
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,043
I'll see you in the next video.
