00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:02.220
<v Instructor>All righty, so we're making</v>

2
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.220
some really good progress here.

3
00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.760
So in this video, we'll cover step five

4
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.800
of adding the event handler for the checkout component.

5
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.650
So we'll read the selected country

6
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.820
and retrieve the list of states based

7
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.383
on that selected country.

8
00:00:22.534 --> 00:00:26.201
So let's kind of swing back into VS Code here.

9
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.320
And I'll close the terminal here

10
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.770
just to get myself some more space on the screen.

11
00:00:37.884 --> 00:00:39.984
I'll open up this checkout.component.html.

12
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.033
And then I'll move

13
00:00:42.033 --> 00:00:44.653
into the section here for shipping Address.

14
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.020
And so for this formControlName of country,

15
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.090
I'm going to add a event binding.

16
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.850
So for the change event,

17
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.073
I'll call this method here getStates

18
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.050
and then I'll pass in the actual name

19
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.960
of the formControl here.

20
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.283
So I'll say this'll be shippingAddress

21
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.990
because I'll use that to determine do I need

22
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.550
to get the states for shipping address

23
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.780
or getting the states for billing address.

24
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.810
And it's mainly for making the appropriate assignments

25
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.453
once that data is returned from the REST API.

26
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:24.920
All right so that's a new entry there

27
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.770
and of course, it says that there's an error

28
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.150
because it doesn't know about this method, getStates.

29
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.100
Well, no problem,

30
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.600
we'll create this in our component.ts file.

31
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.320
I'll simply copy that name getStates

32
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.693
and then I'll move over to my checkout.component.ts.

33
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.340
And just as a checkpoint,

34
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.177
make sure you're in the checkout.component.ts right now.

35
00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:54.880
And I will move down to the bottom here

36
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.673
and we'll create this new method.

37
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.093
getStates and they'll pass in the formGroupName.

38
00:02:16.911 --> 00:02:18.800
Now, let's zoom in here for just a second

39
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.140
and I'll actually get a handle

40
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.980
to the formGroup using the formGroupName.

41
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.070
So I'll say this.checkoutformGroup.get

42
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.658
and then formGroupName.

43
00:02:27.658 --> 00:02:29.420
So that'll pass in either shipping address

44
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.490
or they'll pass in billing address.

45
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.830
So just to make sure that it get the actual country

46
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.607
from the right formGroup.

47
00:02:37.995 --> 00:02:39.150
So I'll retrieve the country here

48
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.150
by saying countryCode equals formGroup.value

49
00:02:48.637 --> 00:02:50.173
.country.code.

50
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.632
So that would give me the countryCode

51
00:02:53.632 --> 00:02:54.670
and I'll do a similar thing here

52
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.663
for getting the countryName.

53
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.530
Now, the countryName is not required

54
00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.340
for calling the REST API

55
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.390
but I will use this mainly just for debugging

56
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.900
and logging purposes.

57
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:07.910
But it's not required.

58
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.583
A REST API only uses the countryCode.

59
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.210
So I'll just write some code here real quick

60
00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.763
to log the countryCode and also the countryName.

61
00:03:48.167 --> 00:03:49.600
All righty, I'll zoom out here for a second.

62
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.033
Now make a call to the FormService to get the states.

63
00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.940
So when I get the states,

64
00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.283
I pass in the appropriate countryCode.

65
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:00.670
I'll do a subscribe

66
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:01.810
and then once the data's returned,

67
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.123
I'll make an assignment.

68
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.480
But it depends on if I'm making an assignment

69
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.610
for shipping or making an assignment for billing.

70
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.150
So I simply check the formGroupName.

71
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.400
If the formGroupName equals shippingAddress,

72
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.850
then I'll assign it to the shippingAddressStates.

73
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.460
But I don't have shippingAddressStates defined yet.

74
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.950
I need an array

75
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.820
but I don't have it defined in this class.

76
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.020
Oh gosh, okay, so give me a second here.

77
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.110
Let me scroll up to the top of this class

78
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.147
and define that array.

79
00:04:49.147 --> 00:04:50.200
I actually need two separate arrays,

80
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.250
one for shippingAddress and one for billingAddress.

81
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.933
So let's go ahead and do this now.

82
00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.527
So I'll have shippingAddressStates.

83
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.993
It's an array of state objects.

84
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.733
Okay, that's taken care of.

85
00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:14.743
And then I'll just do

86
00:05:14.743 --> 00:05:17.863
a little copy, paste here for billingAddress.

87
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.320
So billingAddressStates.

88
00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.830
We're going to keep those separate

89
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.380
because when a user chooses their different countries,

90
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.590
we simply want to update the appropriate states

91
00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.170
for that given section

92
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.083
for shippingAddress or billingAddress.
