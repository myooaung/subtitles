00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:02.400
<v Instructor>Okay, so let's get started</v>

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.840
with our development process.

3
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.500
So in this video, we're going to cover three steps

4
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.470
of generating the checkout component,

5
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.580
adding a new route,

6
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.963
and also creating a new checkout button.

7
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.720
All righty, so swinging into our IDE here,

8
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.370
what we'll do is we'll actually open up

9
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:26.410
a new terminal window

10
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.013
to generate that component.

11
00:00:39.237 --> 00:00:42.240
So then I use that ng generate command.

12
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.820
So I generate component,

13
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.453
and then it's in components/checkout.

14
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.840
And then we can go check on those generated files

15
00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.163
under app components/checkout.

16
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.380
So let me just exit out of the window

17
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.510
just to clean it up

18
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.560
to give me some extra space to work with.

19
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.313
So in step two,

20
00:01:13.313 --> 00:01:16.070
we're going to add a new route for the checkout component,

21
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.213
and we do this work inside of our app.module.ts file.

22
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.980
So I'll just move down here to my routes,

23
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.420
I'll zoom in for asecond,

24
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.120
and I'll just a do a little quick copy-paste exercise.

25
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.943
And then I'll update the entry here for checkout,

26
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.970
and it'll link over to our new component,

27
00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.513
the checkout component.

28
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.963
All righty, so that looks pretty good so far.

29
00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:58.603
So in step three,

30
00:01:58.603 --> 00:02:00.000
we're going to create a new checkout button

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.773
and link to the checkout component.

32
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.440
So we'll do this work in our cart details component,

33
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.473
so in our cart-details.component.html file,

34
00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.890
let me expand the window here.

35
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.970
So cart-details.component.html,

36
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.730
and we'll kind of scroll down a bit

37
00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.453
to where we have our order information,

38
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.670
and right down here,

39
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.510
so right after the Qantiy, Shipping, and Total Price

40
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.093
we'll add this new button for checkout.

41
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.020
Okay, so that coding looks pretty good.

42
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.670
Okay, I have one small thing I want to do.

43
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.530
I want to modify the checkout.component.html,

44
00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.000
add some appropriate CSS styles to it

45
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.223
just so we can see it when we actually test our application.

46
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.463
So let's go ahead and move to checkout.component.html.

47
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.450
We'll set up a div in class=main content,

48
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.450
and here we simply place that checkout works

49
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:34.400
inside of that div.

50
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.540
All righty, so now we can go ahead and test this out,

51
00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.940
so let's go ahead and open up a terminal window,

52
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.190
and we'll start our application,

53
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.630
and also make sure that your spring boot application

54
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.383
is already running on the back end.

55
00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.433
All righty, so our app is up and running.

56
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.760
We'll just go through and add a couple of items to our cart.

57
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.500
See the cart details,

58
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.400
and I'll scroll down and there's our new button, checkout.

59
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.150
And then be sure to scroll up a little bit

60
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.510
so you can see the results there,

61
00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.010
but there we go, checkout works.

62
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.790
So we know that we have the basics in place

63
00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.227
or the mechanics in place for this checkout button,

64
00:04:26.227 --> 00:04:28.560
and now we need to add a bit more functionality,

65
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.360
and we'll do that in the next video.
