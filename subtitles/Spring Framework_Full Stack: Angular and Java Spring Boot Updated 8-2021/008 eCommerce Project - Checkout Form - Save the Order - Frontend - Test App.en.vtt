00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:04.540
<v Tutor>Alrighty, so I'm getting really excited here.</v>

2
00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.960
But let's go ahead and run this thing.

3
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.323
And let's test it out and see if it works.

4
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.320
So I'll just open up a new terminal window here.

5
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.850
And also, I'll swing over and check

6
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.390
on my Spring Boot application

7
00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:21.723
to make sure it's running.

8
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.560
If it's not running,

9
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.193
go ahead and start it now.

10
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.930
And now swinging back into Visual Studio code,

11
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.530
go ahead and run my Angular app.

12
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.350
All right, so let's go ahead

13
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.183
and move into our web browser.

14
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.300
Let's visit our app,

15
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.513
let's add some items to our shopping cart.

16
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.463
I'll add a coffee mug,

17
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.180
mousepad and two luggage tags.

18
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.320
Right. So that's what's in my cart.

19
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.970
Let's go ahead and do a checkout.

20
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.000
So this takes us to our form.

21
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.453
Let me enter some data here for this form.

22
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.253
So this is for John Doe.

23
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.493
Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

24
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.900
All right, so this looks pretty good.

25
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.940
Let's go ahead and purchase.

26
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.490
And oh, yeah,

27
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.770
your order has been received

28
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.220
and order tracking number.

29
00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.000
Ah! our order tracking number

30
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.883
that random UUID, Ooh.

31
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.763
Let's check the database and see what's out there.

32
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.820
So I cleared out my database previously,

33
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:18.980
before I started this video,

34
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.420
so I don't have anything initially.

35
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.590
But now I should have some new data.

36
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.530
And there we go.

37
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.900
Order tracking number 5cef.

38
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.750
Yes. That's the same one.

39
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.000
Success, success.

40
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.990
All right. So we are getting data

41
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.360
to the backend all the way to our database.

42
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.313
Yes.

43
00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.130
And let's go look at some other tables here for address.

44
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.963
Okay, great.

45
00:02:44.963 --> 00:02:46.130
There's Philadelphia.

46
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.963
Excellent.

47
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.070
Look at the customer's information.

48
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.513
John Doe. Awesome.

49
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:54.873
And order items.

50
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.350
Great. So there's three order items.

51
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.000
But remember, we had to have those luggage tags.

52
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.380
So quantity's working.

53
00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.400
So, Wow, this is pretty good.

54
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.233
I like it.

55
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.470
And now if I hit OK,

56
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.630
on this alert,

57
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.170
then it takes me back to the main page,

58
00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.330
it resets the cart,

59
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.680
so everything is fresh

60
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.200
and the user can start the whole process all over again,

61
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.130
if they'd like.

62
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.490
So our reset cart method works also.

63
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:27.323
Nice.

64
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.980
Okay, so this is kind of where you can stand back

65
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.080
and admire your work.

66
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.080
So we built the Angular front end,

67
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.380
and the Spring Boot back end for storing orders

68
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.150
in the database.

69
00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.153
Good job.
