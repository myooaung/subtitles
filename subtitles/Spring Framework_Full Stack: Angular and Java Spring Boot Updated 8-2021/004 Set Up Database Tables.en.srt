1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:02,240
<v Lecturer>All righty, so let's go ahead</v>

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,330
and get started with our development process.

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:05,660
So we'll focus on step one,

4
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,663
of setting up our database tables.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,210
Let's go ahead and open up a web browser.

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,210
And we're going to download some starter files for us,

7
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,510
so go to the website on the screen to download

8
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,453
the e-commerce starter files.

9
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,670
All right, so we have the files downloaded.

10
00:00:38,648 --> 00:00:39,920
I'm just swinging over to my file system

11
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,670
and look at my Downloads directory.

12
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,920
And I'll just do a quick unzip of that file.

13
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,173
And I'll open up a new window.

14
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,950
And what I'll do is I'll create a new folder

15
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,500
here on my file system, I can use any folder name,

16
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,170
but in this example I'll call it ecommerce-project,

17
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,170
this is where I'll place all of my e-commerce project files.

18
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,060
I'll just move into this folder real quick.

19
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:34,150
And I'll just move these starter files

20
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,050
down to this ecommerce-project folder.

21
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:45,350
Any starter files are for images, database scripts

22
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,010
and spring boot application properties,

23
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,810
we'll get into all that stuff later.

24
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,923
So let's go ahead and swing over to MySQL Workbench.

25
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,583
And I'll go ahead and connect into my system using root.

26
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,853
And I'll open up one of those SQL scripts.

27
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,030
So in my starter-files directory,

28
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,173
I'll open up create-user.sql.

29
00:02:31,559 --> 00:02:32,890
And so this file basically just creates

30
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:36,480
the user ecommerceapp with the password ecommerceapp.

31
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,880
You can feel free to change those if you'd like.

32
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,593
All right, let's go ahead and run this script.

33
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,970
All right, so I can go and look at my users

34
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,210
over here on the side in the Management tab.

35
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,970
So if it's not open you can just click

36
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,010
that Management tab there and it will expand it,

37
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,450
click on your Users and Privileges

38
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,550
and there should be a new user here

39
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,730
that we just created, ecommerceapp.

40
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,533
So let's open up one more script here.

41
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,657
And we'll open up the script 02-create-products.sql.

42
00:03:19,872 --> 00:03:20,705
And so at a very high level

43
00:03:20,705 --> 00:03:22,960
this script here will create our schema,

44
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,440
full-stack-ecommerce,

45
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,310
it will create our tables for product and product category

46
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,383
and also load sample data.

47
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,883
All right, let's go ahead and run this script.

48
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,180
And move over to the schemas here

49
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,210
and just do a refresh all and we should see the new schema.

50
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:48,020
Full-stack-ecommerce, looks good.

51
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:52,330
And the schema has two tables, product and product category.

52
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,600
And we can run some queries on these tables here real quick,

53
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,780
just to see the data.

54
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,580
So at the moment we only have one category for books

55
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:02,290
and then we have five products

56
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,653
in our database table.

57
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,643
All right, this looks pretty good so far.
