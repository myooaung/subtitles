00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:01,943
<v Instructor>In this video,</v>

2
00:00:01,943 --> 00:00:05,163
we'll cover shopping cart decrement and remove item.

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,570
So we have our shopping cart details,

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,080
so we'll have the button here to decrement,

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,593
and also a button here to remove.

6
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,600
Here's our development process.

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,640
In the first step, we'll add the click handler

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,260
for the decrement button on the HTML template,

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,500
then we'll update the CartDetailsComponent

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,100
with the click handler method,

11
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,820
then we'll modify the CartService

12
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,030
with the supporting method,

13
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,960
and then finally, we'll repeat the process

14
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,253
for the Remove button.

15
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,270
Okay, step one of modifying

16
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,040
the CartDetailsComponent HTML template.

17
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,770
So we have our quantity section,

18
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,690
we have this FA minus button.

19
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,910
We saw some of the coding for that in the previous video.

20
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:51,850
Now we'll simply add some event handlers for it.

21
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,240
And for the on click event,

22
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,580
we'll call the method decrementQuantity,

23
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,483
and we'll pass in that tempCartItem.

24
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:03,160
Okay step two of updating the CartDetailsComponent

25
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,310
with the click handler method.

26
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,230
So here's our method decrementQuantity,

27
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,653
they pass in the CartItem, and then we'll make a call

28
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:12,300
to this.cartService.decrementQuantity,

29
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,433
and we pass in theCartItem.

30
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,340
So in step three, we need to modify our CartService

31
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,070
with a supporting method.

32
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,359
So in our cart.service.ts, we had this method

33
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:27,210
decrementQuantity, and then we simply just decrement it

34
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,160
by using minus minus, and then we check the quantity

35
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,140
to see if it's zero.

36
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,100
If it's zero, then we'll actually want to remove it

37
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,173
from the cart.

38
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,663
Else we simply called this.computeCartTotals.

39
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,520
All right, so a bit more on the remove method.

40
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,380
So we'll pass in the cart item.

41
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,620
So we basically want to find out where is this cart item

42
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,160
in the array, and let's remove it.

43
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,460
So the first thing we need to do is get the index

44
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,180
of the item in the array,

45
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,330
we can make use of this.cartItems.findIndex

46
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,090
and then we pass in the actual expression.

47
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,520
So similar to what we did earlier

48
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,270
by using other finder methods, here in this example,

49
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,300
we're simply finding the index.

50
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,300
So we're making use of tempCartItem.id = theCartItem.id.

51
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,610
That'll give us the index and it will return it.

52
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,760
So we have itemIndex, then if found,

53
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,960
let's remove the item from the array at the given index.

54
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,670
So if itemIndex is greater than minus one,

55
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,800
that means it found it, if it didn't find it,

56
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,440
the value would be minus one.

57
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,910
So if itemIndex is greater than minus one,

58
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:37,910
then we say this.cartItems.splice, the itemIndex comma one.

59
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:42,070
So we're basically removing the item from the array

60
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,730
at that given index.

61
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:48,060
The comma one means remove one item from the array.

62
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,710
You can have larger numbers if you wanted to,

63
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,170
but for our scenario, for our use case,

64
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,383
we simply want to remove that one cart item.

65
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,930
And then we go ahead and call this.computeCartTotals.

66
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,880
And that's basically it for the remove.

67
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,900
Now, if you'd like to get more details

68
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,980
on that splice method, go to the link

69
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,270
that I have here on the slide,

70
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:13,420
we'll simply redirect you to the official documentation,

71
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,930
and you can read all the details there

72
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,513
about the splice method.

73
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,530
All righty, so in step four, we have the Remove button.

74
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,610
So we basically just kind of repeat the process

75
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,443
for the Remove button.

76
00:03:24,443 --> 00:03:27,290
So we have this button here called Remove,

77
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,810
and then we set up our on click handler,

78
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,350
so we call the method remove,

79
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,550
and we pass in tempCartItem.

80
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,230
And a lot of this coding is very similar

81
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,580
to what you've seen before.

82
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,860
And so in our cart-details.component.ts,

83
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,420
we have this method remove,

84
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,940
and it will make a call to this.cartService.remove,

85
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,440
we pass in theCartItem.

86
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,160
And we'll simply reuse that method that we just wrote

87
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,040
in the previous step for the cart service.

88
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,110
So we're pretty much done here

89
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,663
as far as the coding for Remove button.

90
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,070
All righty, I'm getting excited.

91
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,590
So let's go ahead and move into our IDE

92
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,883
and let's get started.
