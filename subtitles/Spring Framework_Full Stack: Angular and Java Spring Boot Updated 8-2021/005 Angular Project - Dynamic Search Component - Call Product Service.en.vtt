00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.003
<v Instructor>So, in this video,</v>

2
00:00:02.003 --> 00:00:03.680
we're going to cover steps four and five

3
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.490
of enhancing our menu components to read data from a service

4
00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.170
and also updating our service to call the URL

5
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:10.573
on the Spring Boot app.

6
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.250
So, in our component we had this error

7
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.890
that I mentioned in a previous video,

8
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.850
and so, we'll actually fix this error now.

9
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.180
And the reason we had this error

10
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.350
is because the method didn't exist

11
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.950
in the actual product service.

12
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.940
So, we'll simply have the IDE

13
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.123
create or declare that method for us.

14
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.280
Alright, so if we swing over to our product service,

15
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.820
then, the IDE generated or declared that method for us.

16
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.970
So, we should see it right here at the top.

17
00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.310
So, let me grab this little placeholder

18
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.420
getProductiveCategories and do a quick little cut paste,

19
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.763
like to move our methods down to the bottom of the class.

20
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.240
So, I'll just drop it in right here.

21
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.840
And I'll also do some quick refactoring

22
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.090
on our interface here.

23
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.010
So, for our interface instead of GetResponse,

24
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.318
I want to call it GetResponseProduct,

25
00:01:23.318 --> 00:01:24.700
just to give it a unique name,

26
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.660
because we're actually going to have

27
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.463
something very similar here for productCategories.

28
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.200
Let's copy this interface, GetResponseProducts,

29
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.293
and then we'll paste it and we'll give our copy of new name.

30
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.473
So, we'll call this GetResponseProductCategory.

31
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.980
So, instead of products, it'll be ProductCategory,

32
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.917
and then, we'll have an array of productCategory.

33
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.650
Alrighty, so this coding here looks pretty good

34
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.980
and we'll use this GetResponseProductCategory

35
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.883
for calling that REST API.

36
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.980
So, let's move up to our getPoductCategories method.

37
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.543
We'll set it up that it returns observable,

38
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.860
of ProductCategory array

39
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.063
because we're returning a list of product categories.

40
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.670
And I'll just do a little copy paste from above,

41
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.670
paste it down here, and instead of GetResponseProducts,

42
00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.773
we're going to GetResponseProductCategory.

43
00:03:00.974 --> 00:03:03.180
And so, instead of dot embedded products,

44
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.030
it'll be dot embeddedproductCategory.

45
00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.140
And then, instead of searchUrl here,

46
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.863
I'm going to make use of my category URL.

47
00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.930
So, I'll put some dot, dot, dots here for right now

48
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.313
and I'll move up top and I'll actually define that URL.

49
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.163
So, I'll say categoryUrl equals,

50
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.080
and it's very similar to this

51
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.253
but instead of products, it's product dash category.

52
00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.910
So, that's the REST API that we used in a previous video

53
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.000
for looking at our data.

54
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.530
So, I'll just simply do a copy paste in that URL

55
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.610
and put it here.

56
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:51.500
And oh, yes.

57
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.600
I need to say this dot categoryURL,

58
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.363
since it's a property of this class.

59
00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.300
Alrighty, so this looks pretty good here

60
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.940
for our get product categories method,

61
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.483
so, we're in good shape here.

62
00:04:13.512 --> 00:04:16.500
So again, we simply call the REST API,

63
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.850
it returns an observable,

64
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.110
we map that JSON data from the spring data REST

65
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.293
to ProductCategory array.

66
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.680
And then, moving down to the bottom,

67
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.720
we make use of that interface to unwrap the JSON

68
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.360
from the spring data REST,

69
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.863
using an underscore embedded entry.

70
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.963
It's a similar pattern to what we did earlier.

71
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.710
Alrighty, and so that takes care of our errors

72
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.850
in our product category media component.

73
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.070
So, now when we call this product service,

74
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:50.900
we have a method getProductCategory,

75
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.970
so, the issue is resolved.

76
00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.563
So, we're in really good shape right now.
