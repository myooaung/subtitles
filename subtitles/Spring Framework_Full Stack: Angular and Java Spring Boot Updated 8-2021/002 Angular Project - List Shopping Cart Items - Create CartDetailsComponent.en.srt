00:00:01,206 --> 00:00:02,039
<v Instructor>All righty,</v>

2
00:00:02,039 --> 00:00:03,760
so looking at our development process.

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,020
In this video, we're going to focus on steps one through three

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,130
of creating the component, adding the route,

5
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:12,833
and also updating the link for the Shopping Cart icon.

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,900
Okay, let's go ahead and swing into our IDE.

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,833
And let's open up a new terminal window.

8
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,140
And so I'll create this component

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,433
by saying ng generate component,

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,673
and then components/cart-details.

11
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,343
Okay, great, it created some files for us.

12
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,800
We can just verify this over here

13
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,763
in our angular-ecommerce project, source app,

14
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,630
components, cart-details.

15
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,080
Okay, this looks really good.

16
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,740
And let's move to our app.module.ts file

17
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,900
because this is for step two

18
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,073
of adding the new route for the cart details component.

19
00:01:17,246 --> 00:01:21,060
So I'll move down to the routes section here.

20
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,060
And I'll just zoom in, and I'll just do a little copy paste

21
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,390
on one of the previous routes,

22
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,293
and I'll just make some mods to it.

23
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,920
So just a quick copy paste here.

24
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,483
And now this route is going to be called cart-details.

25
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,033
And it'll map over to the component CartDetailsComponent.

26
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,720
And just scroll up to make sure it imported properly

27
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,790
the CartDetailsComponent.

28
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:00,043
And yes, that's great, looks good.

29
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:12,810
And now with step three,

30
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,670
we're going to update the link for our Shopping Cart icon.

31
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,473
And so this is in our cart status component.

32
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,210
So I'll move moved to the cart-status.component.html.

33
00:02:28,344 --> 00:02:31,910
Okay, so let's set up a link to our Angular route here,

34
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:36,207
so we'll make use of routerLink ="/cart-details."

35
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,950
And so now when they click on our Shopping Cart icon,

36
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,213
it'll actually go over to our cart details component.

37
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,870
And I want to do one small change here.

38
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:56,380
So in our CartDetailsComponent.html,

39
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,650
right now they have the basic generated code

40
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,550
of cart-details works, I'm just going to add

41
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:04,840
a little styling around here, some divs,

42
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,163
just to help us with running a quick test.

43
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,590
So I'll basically wrap this into a div for main content,

44
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,320
just to help us with placement

45
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,413
of this information on the screen.

46
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,653
And now I think I'm ready to run it or ready to test it.

47
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,390
And before I start the Angular code,

48
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,550
let's just kind of swing over

49
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:52,180
and make sure we have our Spring Boot application running.

50
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,610
So in our IntelliJ IDEA, the Spring Boot app

51
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,660
should be already running,

52
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,603
if not, go ahead and start it now.

53
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,083
Now I can go and start my Angular application.

54
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,720
All righty, so my app is up and running,

55
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,603
I can access it here in the browser.

56
00:04:17,595 --> 00:04:20,150
And now I want to check the link here for our cart status.

57
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:21,440
I simply want to click this

58
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,483
and see what I get as far as the output.

59
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,590
And okay, this looks good, cart-details works.

60
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,480
So we know that our basic framework

61
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,060
for our component is in place,

62
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,400
now we'll add some more features to it

63
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,803
in the next set of videos.
