00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,390
<v Narrator>Alright, so we're making some</v>

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:04,920
really good progress, we're almost done,

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,420
we have just a couple more fields to take care of.

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,550
So I'll just copy this section here,

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,433
I'll move down to the security code section.

6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,910
Now drop this in, make the appropriate updates

7
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:23,853
for credit card security code.

8
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,720
And for credit card security code pattern,

9
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,893
the security code must be three digits long.

10
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,970
All right, so that's it for our validation rules so far

11
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:02,053
so I think we can go ahead and test this out.

12
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,210
So we'll move down to the credit card section here,

13
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,060
we'll kind of keep all of the defaults.

14
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,350
Swing down, hit the purchase button

15
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,130
and move back up and success.

16
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,310
This looks great so we have the validation rules

17
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,013
being applied to these fields here for the credit card.

18
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,490
And we can even test some of the things out here

19
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:36,230
like for credit card number requires 16 digits,

20
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,403
so make sure you enter 16.

21
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:48,650
And then also for security code, requires three digits.

22
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,360
So you can also just test those validation rules

23
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,373
out for that one.

24
00:01:58,490 --> 00:01:59,440
So this looks pretty good.

25
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,210
So we added the validation rules here for our checkout form.

26
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:03,370
This is really good.

27
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:04,910
There was a lot of work involved,

28
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,720
but I'm happy with what we've accomplished so far.

29
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,020
And we have a lot of other really, really cool things to add

30
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,230
to this application, in particular,

31
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,650
the checkout form as far as form processing and so on

32
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,253
and we'll get into that in the next set of videos.
