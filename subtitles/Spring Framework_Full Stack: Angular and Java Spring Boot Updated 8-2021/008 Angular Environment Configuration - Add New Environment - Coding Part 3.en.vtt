00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:02.163
<v Narrator>Alrighty,</v>

2
00:00:02.163 --> 00:00:03.420
so we're making some really good progress,

3
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:04.253
so in this video,

4
00:00:04.253 --> 00:00:05.440
we'll cover steps three and four

5
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.870
of defining the configuration

6
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.490
in the angular.json "serve" section,

7
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.590
and then finally running our application

8
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.483
with the environment configuration.

9
00:00:22.891 --> 00:00:27.474
So let's go ahead and move down to the "serve" section,

10
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.820
and we'll add a new configuration here,

11
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.340
and so as a quick checkpoint,

12
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.890
make sure you're in the correct location

13
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.140
in this angular.json file,

14
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.290
so make sure you're in the "serve" section.

15
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.460
Then here, I'll give the configuration name of "qa",

16
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.250
and then I'll give the "browserTarget"

17
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.307
to reference our "angular-ecommerce:build:qa".

18
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.930
Remember, that references the configs

19
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.633
that we just set up in the previous section.

20
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.060
Then also, as a checkpoint,

21
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.630
just making sure you have the code or configurations

22
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.560
in the correct location within the file,

23
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.573
so it's in the "serve" section, serve configurations.

24
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.200
Okay, so make sure all your files are saved,

25
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.890
then we can go ahead and cover step four

26
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.490
of running the application

27
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.633
with the given environment configuration.

28
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.723
Okay, so let's go ahead and open up a new Terminal window.

29
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:49.733
Alrighty, so let's go ahead

30
00:01:49.733 --> 00:01:51.540
and run our application with the configuration,

31
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.953
so we'll do an "npm start -- --configuration=qa",

32
00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.400
and that's the configuration we defined

33
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.873
in the "serve" section of our file.

34
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.690
Okay, let's go ahead and swing back over to our web browser,

35
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.190
and we can simply just do a reload here

36
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.643
on that previous URL.

37
00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.790
Now, success,

38
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.080
we can retrieve data from the Spring Boot backend,

39
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.090
and we're using the QA environment configuration,

40
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.780
so we're getting data,

41
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:27.780
and we can confirm

42
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.440
that we're getting data from the QA environment

43
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.404
by looking at our logs here,

44
00:02:31.404 --> 00:02:33.880
"localhost:9898".

45
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.820
All right, that's where my Spring Boot app is running

46
00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.060
for the QA environment.

47
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.250
Excellent, so this is great,

48
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.750
so we have everything up and running as desired.

49
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.673
I'd like to say good job, my friend.
