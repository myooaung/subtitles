00:00:01.293 --> 00:00:02.200
<v Instructor>All right, so moving along</v>

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.040
with our development process in this video,

3
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.138
we're going to modify our

4
00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:07.793
ProductListComponents to call the CartService.

5
00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.700
Alright, so let's go ahead and move over

6
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.100
to our ProductListComponent.

7
00:00:25.129 --> 00:00:27.379
So ProductListComponent.ts.

8
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.680
And let me expand my window here.

9
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.130
And just as a checkpoint,

10
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.130
let me move to the top of this file,

11
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.060
just to make sure we're all at the right location.

12
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.493
So we're ProductListComponent right now.

13
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.690
And I move down to the bottom to that addToCart Method.

14
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.320
And so we had a little comment here

15
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.230
TODO, do the real work.

16
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.084
Well, now's the time we're going to do the real work okay?

17
00:00:49.084 --> 00:00:49.917
(laughs)

18
00:00:49.917 --> 00:00:51.810
This is where we get our hands dirty.

19
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.550
So in our ProductListComponent,

20
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.490
we need to call the addToCart Method on the CartService.

21
00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:58.740
And so we'll do that now.

22
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.080
Alright, so based on a product,

23
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.330
we need to create a CartItem.

24
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.690
So I'll create the CartItem equals new CartItem

25
00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.233
based on the product.

26
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.630
And now I'll call this .cartService.addToCart.

27
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.473
And I pass in the CartItem.

28
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.170
And says does not exist on Component.

29
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.600
Oh, gosh, I need to inject my cartService, silly me.

30
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.600
So let's move up here to our constructor.

31
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.703
And let's inject the cartService.

32
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.010
Okay, great so that's the code

33
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.990
for injecting our service.

34
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.890
Alright, good job.

35
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.730
And so now if we scroll back down to the bottom,

36
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:11.343
that error should go away.

37
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.170
And yep, everything's good.

38
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.603
We're good to go here, all right.

39
00:02:31.333 --> 00:02:34.270
All right, so I want to run this application

40
00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.780
and test it out real quick just to see how it works

41
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.303
now with this cartService,

42
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.740
so let's go ahead and fire it up and get it running.

43
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.290
And then just swinging into the browser here.

44
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.840
Let's load the app.

45
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.200
Make sure you have your console window open.

46
00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.240
And let's add to cart Crash Course in Python.

47
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.370
Okay, good, so that's the contents of the cart.

48
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.160
We have the name of the item,

49
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.830
the total price and the quantity.

50
00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.100
So it's just one item in there right now.

51
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.003
And it's 14.99, which is that one book.

52
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.930
Now let's add another item here,

53
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.500
coffee mugs, cherokee mug, 18.99.

54
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.560
Okay, great, so now look at our contents of the cart.

55
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.460
So we have two items in our cart, and the total price.

56
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.593
Good, I like it.

57
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.228
Add the coffee mug three more times.

58
00:03:31.228 --> 00:03:32.990
(laughs)

59
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.780
So now we see that the Course in Python quantity of one,

60
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.980
the coffee mug quantity of four and notice the total price

61
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.550
and the total quantity.

62
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.310
So the logic for our cartServices working out as desired.

63
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.470
It's actually keeping track of everything

64
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.790
based on price and quantity.

65
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.653
So I like to say, good job my friend.
