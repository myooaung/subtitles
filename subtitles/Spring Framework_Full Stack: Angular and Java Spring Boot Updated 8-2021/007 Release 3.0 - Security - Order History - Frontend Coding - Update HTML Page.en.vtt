00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.530
<v Instructor>Okay, so we're more than halfway done here.</v>

2
00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.410
So in this video, we'll cover step five

3
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.763
of updating the template text in the HTML page.

4
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.080
And let's go ahead and move

5
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.803
over to our order-history.component.html.

6
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:24.230
And so this is the fun part.

7
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.588
So this is where we build the HTML page, the HTML view,

8
00:00:27.588 --> 00:00:30.860
we did a lot of the backend behind the scenes work.

9
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.160
Now let's kind of make everything look pretty.

10
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.530
So I'll just remove any existing code we have here

11
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:37.873
in this HTML page,

12
00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.530
and I'll set up some of my divs.

13
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.770
Okay, so now that our divs are in place,

14
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.920
we're actually going to build an HTML table

15
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:24.960
to display the orders.

16
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.786
So we'll have a header first and then the actual table

17
00:01:27.786 --> 00:01:31.190
along with this headings and actual contents.

18
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.190
So we'll start here with the first header,

19
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.243
h3, your orders,

20
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.400
then we'll check to see

21
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.770
if the orderhistory.length is greater than zero.

22
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.250
Just to see if we have data to display

23
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.450
and then I'll go through and set up my table,

24
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.440
go through and set up the table headings here,

25
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.130
the first table heading of order tracking number.

26
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.720
I'll just kind of copy paste that X number of times,

27
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.720
make some slight changes here on the web

28
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.020
and also make some updates here on the headings,

29
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.313
the total price,

30
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.283
total quantity, and also for date.

31
00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:10.453
Okay, great.

32
00:03:10.453 --> 00:03:12.860
So that's the table headers there in place.

33
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.010
Now let's go ahead and move in

34
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.480
and let's write the code to loop over

35
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.630
our order history list.

36
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.400
So do the ngFor,

37
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.273
let tempOrderhistory of order history list.

38
00:03:41.144 --> 00:03:43.510
And remember, order history list is defined

39
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.470
as a field in our order history component class.

40
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.320
And we created that class in some of the previous videos.

41
00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.330
Now let's go through and display the data.

42
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.213
So I'll have tempOrderHistory.orderTrackingNumber.

43
00:04:13.237 --> 00:04:14.780
And then I'll go ahead and copy this section

44
00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.963
of code and paste it, X number of times for the other items.

45
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.253
So I'll change this to total price,

46
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.930
and I'll send it through my currency pipe.

47
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.683
I'll update this item to total quantity,

48
00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.700
and then finally, this'll be the date created

49
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.490
and I'll send this through the date pipe

50
00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.563
using the medium format.

51
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.190
Alrighty, so all of that coding is in place

52
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.893
and this all looks pretty good.

53
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.020
Alrighty, so I also want to handle

54
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.340
for the case where there's no orders.

55
00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.400
So if the order history is empty,

56
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.243
then let's display a message.

57
00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.170
So I'll set up this div,

58
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:49.330
then I'll make use of this ngIf orderHistory.lenghth

59
00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:50.890
equals zero,

60
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.000
I'll go ahead and add my CSS styles

61
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.503
for alerts and also set the role.

62
00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.850
And then the main item here is displaying the message,

63
00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.063
no orders found.

64
00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:28.970
And so now, kind of scroll back up and take a look

65
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.390
at everything and it's all looks pretty good.

66
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:31.590
So this is the coding in place

67
00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:35.142
that will actually display our table of orders,

68
00:06:35.142 --> 00:06:36.433
the order history.

69
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.490
Alrighty, this looks really good.

70
00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:40.323
I like it.
