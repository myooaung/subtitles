00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,690
<v ->Alrighty, so let's go ahead and move into our IDE,</v>

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,490
and we'll go ahead and write some code here

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,113
for our basic for loop.

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,220
So let's go ahead and create a new folder here.

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,193
I'll call it 03-loops-and-arrays,

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,363
and then I'll just create a new file in this folder.

7
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,290
I'll call it loops.ts.

8
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:42,250
I'll set up a very basic for loop here,

9
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,520
I'll say (let i=0; i &lt; 5; i++)

10
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,187
console.log(i).

11
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,113
Open up a terminal.

12
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,093
Then make sure I move into that appropriate directory.

13
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,753
Just go through and compile the code here, using tsc,

14
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,010
and then I'll run it using the node,

15
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:26,173
so loops.js.

16
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:30,960
And then there's our output.

17
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,990
It's 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

18
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,170
All right, so just a very basic for loop.

19
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,170
You may have seen this

20
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,560
in other programming languages before,

21
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,100
but just wanted to do a quick run of it using TypeScript.

22
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,243
So, looks good.

23
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,810
Alrighty, so let's go ahead

24
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,063
and look at another for loop example.

25
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,063
So let's create a new file here,

26
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,743
and I'll give the name reviews.ts.

27
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,623
And so I'll set up an array for these reviews.

28
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:21,160
Then I'll give the initial values here,

29
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,473
square brackets.

30
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,430
And then I'll set up a little for loop here

31
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,453
to loop over those reviews,

32
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:39,007
so i=0; i &lt; reviews.length i++

33
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:47,593
and then I'll do a console.log.

34
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:58,290
And then we can see that the IDE found an error,

35
00:02:58,438 --> 00:03:02,170
(laughs) typo in my coding here, which is good.

36
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,190
I'm happy about that.

37
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,033
That's why I like using TypeScript.

38
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,300
All right, so trying to compile,

39
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,350
but actually, let me fix these errors first, so

40
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,753
reviews.length;

41
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,657
and then reviews[i].

42
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,050
So I can even use the little Quick Fix option

43
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,173
here on the IDE.

44
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,093
Cool, I like it.

45
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:40,450
Okay, so I've saved this updated file.

46
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,633
Now I can compile it.

47
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,173
Okay, that works and now I can run it.

48
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:51,820
And there's our output for this little for loop example.

49
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,653
Pretty good.

50
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,130
And then I can also compute the average.

51
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,393
So I'll set up a total here and initialize it to zero,

52
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,310
and then inside of this for loop,

53
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,823
I just update the value of the total.

54
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,923
So total +=

55
00:04:14,594 --> 00:04:15,511
reviews[i].

56
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:23,463
And then I can compute the average.

57
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,293
So this'll be total / reviews.length,

58
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:37,610
and then I'll simply just do a little console.log

59
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,613
on that value.

60
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,590
And then I'll move down here to my terminal

61
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,393
and I'll compile it one more time,

62
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,040
and then I'll run it.

63
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:16,440
And there's our output and also Review average = 3.7.

64
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,340
So that's the average of the reviews there.

65
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,430
Okay, great, so this is good.

66
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,970
So a nice little example here of using loops

67
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:28,700
and also using some math operations to compute the average.

68
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,533
Good job.
