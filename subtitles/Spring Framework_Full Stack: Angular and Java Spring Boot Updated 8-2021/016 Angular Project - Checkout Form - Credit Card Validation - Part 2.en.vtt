00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:02.820
<v ->Alrighty, so moving right along here,</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.830
so in step three, we're going to update the HTML templates

3
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.863
to display the error messages for the Credit Card section.

4
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.793
So I'll just move down here to our Credit Card section,

5
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.220
and again, just more of the same as far as grabbing

6
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.980
those error messages and placing them

7
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.490
in the correct location

8
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.083
and updating the references accordingly.

9
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.000
So I'll just grab this information

10
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.040
and move down to the Credit Card section

11
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.683
for the Card Type section,

12
00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.350
and I'll put this here right after the dropdown list,

13
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.223
the select,

14
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.060
and then I'll update the references accordingly

15
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.093
for creditcardType.

16
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.650
All righty, so I'll just grab this information

17
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.530
and then I'll move down to the next section here

18
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.263
for Name on Card.

19
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.460
So I'll pick the reference here

20
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.353
for creditCarNameOnCard.

21
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.240
And I'll be sure to add the code here for a minlength,

22
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.570
because remember we forgot that

23
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.320
in some of our previous work,

24
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.800
so I'll learn from my mistakes here, minlength.

25
00:02:54.645 --> 00:02:56.395
All right, all right.

26
00:03:03.905 --> 00:03:05.810
And I'll just grab this section and copy it

27
00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.063
and move down to Card Number,

28
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.843
and paste it here, be sure that add a div,

29
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.403
here we go, to match up all the divs.

30
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.470
Just make sure all your divs are lined up

31
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.713
and match up accordingly.

32
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.390
And so we'll update the reference here

33
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.043
for creditCardNumber.

34
00:04:11.411 --> 00:04:14.080
And then we also need to add an error message here

35
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.080
for the pattern, the pattern didn't match for the 16 digits.

36
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.670
Okay, that looks pretty good

37
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:37.853
I like it, I like it.
