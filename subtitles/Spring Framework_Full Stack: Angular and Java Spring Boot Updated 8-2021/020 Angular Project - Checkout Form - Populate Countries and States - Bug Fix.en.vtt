00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.500
<v Narrator>Okay, so one thing I need to let you know about</v>

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.640
is that we have a bug in our application.

3
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.880
Yes, a bug.

4
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.650
And let's take a look at the bug

5
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.490
and let's figure out how we can resolve it.

6
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.210
So in our checkout form,

7
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.670
if we go through and we add items here

8
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.970
or select items here for our shipping address,

9
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.800
so we select the country and then we select the state

10
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.290
and then we enter the information here for the city.

11
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.890
And then if I move down here and I check the box

12
00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.390
billing address same as shipping address,

13
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.360
it should copy everything

14
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.600
over to the billing address section.

15
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.530
So I'll scroll down a bit

16
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.530
and notice here that the state is not populated.

17
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.260
All right, so if you choose that item there, it's empty.

18
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.830
There's nothing there.

19
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:55.663
And you're probably wondering,

20
00:00:55.663 --> 00:00:59.390
wow, what's going on or why is that

21
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.563
and what's the problem?

22
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.120
Well, the problem is that in our HTML template,

23
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.630
our dropdown list or list of options are populated

24
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.970
based on billing address states,

25
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.020
but our code is not in sync

26
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.270
or our code is not set up to have that data,

27
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.520
so we actually need to update the array in the component

28
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.680
with the appropriate data.

29
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.690
So we need to make an assignment here

30
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.430
for billingAddressStates and copy over

31
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.500
or assign the values of shippingAddressStates here

32
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.720
so this will kind of work out.

33
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.820
So it's mainly just with the populating

34
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.143
of the dropdown list options.

35
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.040
And this is a fairly easy fix.

36
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.350
So let's go ahead and swing into our IDE

37
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.263
and into our checkout.component.ts file.

38
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.610
And then let's move down to that method

39
00:01:50.461 --> 00:01:53.461
copyShippingAddressToBillingAddress.

40
00:01:57.392 --> 00:02:01.420
And then I'll kind of zoom in here for a second.

41
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.253
And then we'll add in this bug fix code.

42
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.210
And so basically what I need to do here

43
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.210
is I need to assign shippingAddressStates

44
00:02:18.083 --> 00:02:19.233
to billingAddressStates

45
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.140
because at the moment that value is not assigned

46
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.290
and that's why we get an empty selection error

47
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.213
or empty dropdown list for the billingAddressStates section.

48
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.340
All right, so that code's in place.

49
00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.680
And then also down in the else block,

50
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.580
that's where we uncheck that copy item.

51
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.510
So here we do a reset,

52
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.860
but we also want to clear out the billingAddressStates

53
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.383
for this scenario too.

54
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.410
So here, I simply say

55
00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.660
billingAddressStates equals square brackets,

56
00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:00.993
just an empty array.

57
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.080
And that'll take care of this item here

58
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.103
for that given bug that we have in the app.

59
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.113
So I'll just kind of save that, swing back over,

60
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.660
and then I'll test this one more time in my application.

61
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.313
So I'll select the country,

62
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.830
choose a state and then I'll enter the city

63
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.940
and then I'll move down here and I'll check the box there

64
00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.940
for billing address same as shipping address and success.

65
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.180
All right, so state is populated,

66
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.640
so that kind of works out as desired.

67
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.200
So I'm happy about that.

68
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.070
And then if I go here and uncheck the box

69
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.710
and everything is cleared out as desired,

70
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.390
check it back on and we copy everything from shipping.

71
00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:51.223
So this is great.

72
00:03:51.223 --> 00:03:54.530
So we found the bug, we saw the bug,

73
00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.160
and we added code to resolve the bug.

74
00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.593
Alrighty, good job.
