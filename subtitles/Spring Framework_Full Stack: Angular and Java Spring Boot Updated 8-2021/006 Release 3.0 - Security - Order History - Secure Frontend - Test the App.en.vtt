00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.073
<v Instructor>Let's go ahead and run our application.</v>

2
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.760
And our app is up.

3
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.760
Oh, actually, it's not up and running.

4
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.670
We have a problem, another error.

5
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.370
Okay, so an auth-interceptor service dot ts on line four,

6
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:34.943
import requests from http.

7
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:36.773
Okay.

8
00:00:36.773 --> 00:00:39.170
So it tells us which file to go look at.

9
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.980
And also tells us which line number to go look at.

10
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.823
So line number four.

11
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.533
Right, scroll up a bit.

12
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.190
And I got it.

13
00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.820
Yes, so this request, yeah, this is a bad import.

14
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:54.980
So I shouldn't have this here.

15
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.950
So, basically,

16
00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.980
this line import requests from http,

17
00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.360
you can actually delete this line.

18
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.680
We don't need that.

19
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:03.593
That's incorrect.

20
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.100
Because we're getting the import up top on line one.

21
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.253
So for the request.

22
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.143
So if I save that, then we should be okay.

23
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:20.463
Okay. Excellent.

24
00:01:20.463 --> 00:01:22.060
Yep, yep. So we're good now.

25
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.893
Awesome.

26
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.230
All right, so now it's compiled successfully

27
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.390
and now our app is up and running.

28
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.263
Okay, good.

29
00:01:32.882 --> 00:01:36.040
Let's go ahead and swing into our web browser

30
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.620
and visit our application

31
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.493
and let's go ahead and log in.

32
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.330
And so now, we're logged in.

33
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.410
Okay, that's great.

34
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.760
So it says, "Welcome back Demo Darby".

35
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.683
We're logged in.

36
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.650
Now let's check to see

37
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.723
if we're passing that token correctly.

38
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.010
So we select orders and success.

39
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.190
All right, so we're getting our orders now.

40
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.170
So remember, we created that interceptor

41
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.590
that would basically check the end API

42
00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.590
for like slash API slash orders

43
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.720
and then I want to add the token.

44
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.193
And we use that OktaAuthService for that.

45
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.550
And let's just verify that the end point

46
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.810
still is really secured, right?

47
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.520
So at this moment, I'm going to simply open up Postman

48
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.900
and attempt to send a request over

49
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.393
and see how things work out.

50
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.680
And so, I'm sending over just a regular request.

51
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.640
So I'm getting 401 unauthorized.

52
00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.840
So our back-end service really is secured

53
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.400
and our angular front-end is really sending

54
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.903
over the proper access token.

55
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.930
So we could even verify this in our browser

56
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.490
just dropping in the end point directly.

57
00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.083
And again, we get this 401 unauthorized,

58
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.210
and again, we're not passing over the token at this part.

59
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.490
The only place where we're passing over the token

60
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.000
is part of our angular application using that interceptor

61
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.210
that we already have created.

62
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.850
Okay. So this is up and working.

63
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:32.683
Good job.
