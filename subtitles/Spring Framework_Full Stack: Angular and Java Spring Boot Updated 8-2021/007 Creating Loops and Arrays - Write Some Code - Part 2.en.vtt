00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:02.660
<v Instructor>Alrighty, so let's go ahead</v>

2
00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.523
and let's add one more program here using for loops.

3
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.000
So I'll create this new file

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.113
and I'll call it sports.ts.

5
00:00:23.218 --> 00:00:24.770
And what I'll do up top, I'll just define

6
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.903
an array for the sports, an array of strings.

7
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.250
Alrighty, so we have this array of strings for our sports:

8
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.650
golf, cricket, tennis and swimming.

9
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.720
So just to start, I'll do it the traditional way

10
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.000
of just using an i index here.

11
00:00:56.861 --> 00:01:01.861
And so I'll do a for loop, console.log(sportsOne[i])

12
00:01:15.677 --> 00:01:16.780
and then down in my terminal window

13
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.970
I'll simply compile the code, sports.ts.

14
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.940
And then I run it, sports.js

15
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.290
and then we see the output for the array.

16
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.280
Alrighty, so in this example here

17
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.220
I'm going to use the simplified for loop.

18
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.677
So here I'll say, let tempSport of sportsOne,

19
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.130
okay note of.

20
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.303
And now I can simply do a console.log on tempSport directly.

21
00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:57.840
Okay, so that looks pretty good.

22
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.260
So again, just move down here,

23
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.910
compile the code once again

24
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.913
and then run it.

25
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.170
And then we'll see the sports displayed

26
00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.410
and we'll actually see two batches.

27
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.270
So the first batch is primarily using

28
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.860
the traditional approach

29
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.080
and then the second batch is

30
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.193
the simplified for loop approach.

31
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.930
So I'll just comment out the first batch up top

32
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.170
just so I don't see that again

33
00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.070
just kind of use the simplified version.

34
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.910
And so now what I'll do is actually

35
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.210
add in support for conditionals here,

36
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.680
so if tempSport equals Cricket

37
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.403
then I want to tell them hey this my favorite sport.

38
00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.543
And else we simply just print the sport.

39
00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.030
Alrighty so that's our array

40
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.370
and actually let me delete this code that I had up here.

41
00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.943
So the old code, let's just get rid of it.

42
00:03:21.977 --> 00:03:23.720
And so then we simply go through compile

43
00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.003
and run our code again and check the output.

44
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.433
And we see for cricket it says hey my favorite sport,

45
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.290
small little cosmetic issue there.

46
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.780
I didn't add the white space,

47
00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.430
let's add the white space up top.

48
00:03:41.841 --> 00:03:43.541
And then just do it one more time.

49
00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.360
There we go so it looks pretty now, okay.

50
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.950
Anyways nice example here of using

51
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.193
for loops, arrays and also conditionals, so good job.

52
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.090
Okay, so let's go ahead and move in here

53
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.813
and let's work on a coding example using growable arrays.

54
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.893
So I'll create a new file here.

55
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.343
I'll call it growable-arrays.ts.

56
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.560
So first I'll setup the initial array,

57
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.683
so sportsTwo and I'll just add three sports to the array.

58
00:04:35.982 --> 00:04:39.310
And now add some additional items to the array,

59
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.270
so this growable array, I say sportsTwo.push

60
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.680
and I'll do a push on baseball

61
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.563
and also a push on futbol.

62
00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.740
And then I'll simply setup a for loop

63
00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.490
and just print out each one of the sports in the array.

64
00:05:15.195 --> 00:05:17.120
And then I just simply move down to my terminal window

65
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.153
and I just compile and run.

66
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.910
And so looking at our output, we have our sports.

67
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.640
So the first three are the initial sports

68
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.570
that were in the array and then also

69
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.900
the other two were the ones we added to this growable array.

70
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.633
This looks pretty good, I'm happy.
