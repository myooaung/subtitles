1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:03,510
<v ->Okay, so let's go ahead and update this file</v>

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,803
to use the HTML template CSS styles.

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,260
So, this is kind of what we had before.

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:15,535
We had our ngFor, we did a loop over those products

5
00:00:15,535 --> 00:00:18,820
and we would display information about the given product.

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,790
We'll do a similar thing, but we'll kind of do it

7
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:25,090
in the context of the actual CSS styles.

8
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:27,810
So I'll just go ahead and remove all of this information

9
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,623
from this given file and make this file empty.

10
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,403
So I'll go ahead

11
00:00:37,403 --> 00:00:40,320
and use the HTML from the HTML template files.

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,083
I could simply just copy-paste it,

13
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:45,013
but for here, I like to just type it out myself.

14
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,520
All right, so this is just a collection

15
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,610
of CSS styles from our local style sheet

16
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:23,400
and also some bootstrapped styles

17
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,500
and then I'll add a little comment to myself

18
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,620
just to keep myself on track.

19
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,000
So, in the middle here, this is where I need

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,720
to loop over the collection of products

21
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,833
and do some work,

22
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,510
but just for sanity's sake, let me just add

23
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,630
a little string here, just so I can see some

24
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,893
of this on the actual page.

25
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:47,773
So, I have work to do.

26
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,740
I'll just save this and swing over

27
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,853
to the browser and see what I have, and,

28
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:59,500
okay, this looks pretty good.

29
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,020
So notice right here it says, "I have work to do."

30
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,901
So this is where that component will show up

31
00:02:03,901 --> 00:02:05,680
on the actual page

32
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,800
and now I'll swing back into Visual Studio Code

33
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,400
and I'll start writing the code.

34
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,213
So, I'll just remove

35
00:02:15,213 --> 00:02:16,960
that little place holder that we had

36
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,860
and then we'll make use of a div

37
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,240
and we'll make use of an ngFor

38
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,563
to loop over our collection of products.

39
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,932
All righty, so we have our ngFor set up for looping.

40
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:48,830
We'll set up a product box where we'll display information

41
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:52,031
about the image URL, the actual product name,

42
00:02:52,031 --> 00:02:54,993
and some other details for the product.

43
00:03:42,114 --> 00:03:44,120
All right, this looks good so far.

44
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,790
Let's just test this part out real quick,

45
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,363
the image and the product name.

46
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,380
Swing over to our browser, and, cool,

47
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,420
this looks pretty good.

48
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,980
All right, so we're seeing information being displayed

49
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,510
in a grid fashion, that's nice.

50
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,370
That's based on that bootstrap style

51
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,100
for the container fluid in different rows

52
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,949
and it will simply build and wrap accordingly,

53
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:07,683
and that's just great, I like it.

54
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,020
And then we'll kind of just do more

55
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,770
of the same here of adding information

56
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,014
about the actual price

57
00:04:15,014 --> 00:04:16,080
and then we'll play

58
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,380
around with some add to car buttons and so on.

59
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,480
And so for our add to cart button, we'll

60
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,120
just set the href equals to just #,

61
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,650
we're not going to do anything with it yet.

62
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,680
We'll add that functionality in some of the later videos

63
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,513
but at least you'll want to have

64
00:04:57,513 --> 00:04:59,380
the button being displayed here.

65
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,900
So that's the main portion here of our given product.

66
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,290
So, for each one of the products that we loop over,

67
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:08,313
we'll have a product box with that give information.

68
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,730
Now if we save this and swing back to our browser,

69
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,070
and, cool, looks great.

70
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,400
So we have our image place holder,

71
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,550
we have the actual product name, the price,

72
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,370
and a button, add to cart.

73
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,213
So this is starting shape up nicely.

74
00:05:27,213 --> 00:05:29,430
I'm kind of getting excited.

75
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,688
I have a huge smile on my face

76
00:05:30,688 --> 00:05:33,396
and we're making some really good progress

77
00:05:33,396 --> 00:05:35,830
but we have a lot more things to do.

78
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,710
So stay tuned and we'll continue

79
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:40,700
to add more functionality to this application.

80
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,373
All right, I'll see ya in the next video.
