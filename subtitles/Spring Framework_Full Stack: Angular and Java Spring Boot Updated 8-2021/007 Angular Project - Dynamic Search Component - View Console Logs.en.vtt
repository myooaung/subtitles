00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.253
<v ->All righty.</v>

2
00:00:19.253 --> 00:00:20.930
So one thing that we've seen so far

3
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.580
is that we saw the console.log.

4
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.173
But how can I see the logs?

5
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.530
You can view the logs in the web browser.

6
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.745
So for Chrome, they have one set of instructions.

7
00:00:31.745 --> 00:00:33.890
For Firefox, another set.

8
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.980
And Microsoft Edge another set.

9
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.803
I'll show you how to view the logs using Chrome and Firefox.

10
00:00:42.914 --> 00:00:45.070
So again, just as a refresher,

11
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.820
in our ProductCategoryMenuComponent,

12
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.520
we made use of the log method.

13
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.220
So down in the ListProductCategories,

14
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.840
we had console.log and we logged the product categories

15
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.460
that we received from the rest API.

16
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.223
We'd like to see these logs in the web browser.

17
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.620
So let's go ahead and move into Chrome.

18
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.810
So our application is up.

19
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.403
So in Chrome we make use of More Tools, Developer Tools.

20
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.450
So from the top right we hit those little three dots here.

21
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.163
And then we choose More Tools, Developer Tools.

22
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.010
And so this brings up the console.

23
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.070
So if we zoom in here, we'll see the product categories,

24
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.623
and then we'll see ID 1 category name of Books.

25
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.640
And if we slide over,

26
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.640
we'll see ID 2, category name of Coffee Mugs, and so on.

27
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.253
So this is how we can see the logs in Chrome.

28
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.453
And so let's do a similar thing in Firefox.

29
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.880
So in Firefox, we make use of Web Developer, Web Console.

30
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.093
So again, starting in the top right here,

31
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.773
just go to Web Developer, Web Console.

32
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.920
And then a similar thing here.

33
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.980
So there's the console.

34
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:31.813
We can zoom in.

35
00:02:31.813 --> 00:02:33.530
We can see the product categories,

36
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.760
and all those different categories,

37
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.580
for ID 1, category name of Books,

38
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.796
and so on and so forth.

39
00:02:37.796 --> 00:02:40.313
So this is how we can view the logs in Firefox.
