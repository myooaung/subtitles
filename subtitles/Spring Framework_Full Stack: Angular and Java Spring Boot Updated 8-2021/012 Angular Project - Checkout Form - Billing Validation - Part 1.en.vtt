00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:02.850
<v ->Alrighty, so now in this section,</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.443
we'll cover billing address.

3
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.210
And again, it's just more of the same.

4
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.000
We've already did the work for shipping address,

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.843
and we'll do a similar thing here for our billing address.

6
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.780
Alrighty, so step one is specifying

7
00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.010
the validation rules for the form controls,

8
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.503
and we'll do this for billing address.

9
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.800
So our focus here is for billing address.

10
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.380
Right now there are no validation rules

11
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.900
and we're going to add some,

12
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.330
and we'll simply copy the same rules from shipping address,

13
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.230
and this is really easy because they have the same fields.

14
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.000
And just give me a quick second

15
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.843
to kind of fix the formatting here.

16
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:20.960
Okay, so this is in place

17
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.910
and this coding here looks pretty good.

18
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.800
So now in step two we'll define the getter methods

19
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.223
to access the form controls.

20
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:39.350
So this will be really easy,

21
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.110
we can just copy the shipping address methods

22
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.110
and we'll rename them, and use them for billing address.

23
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.340
Alright, so be sure to update the method names

24
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.773
and also the field names.

25
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.730
Alright, so this looks pretty good here

26
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.080
as far as the updates for those methods.

27
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.913
Good job.
