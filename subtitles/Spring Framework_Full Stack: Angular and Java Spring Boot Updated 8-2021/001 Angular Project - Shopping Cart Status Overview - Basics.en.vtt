00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.040
<v Instructor>In this video,</v>

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.623
we'll cover adding products to the shopping cart, part one.

3
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.050
So for adding products to the shopping cart, right,

4
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.600
we'll make use of our button their add to cart,

5
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.620
they click on the button,

6
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.490
and it will actually

7
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.990
update our shopping cart status components.

8
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.200
So we'll actually keep track of the total price,

9
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.203
and also the total number of items in the shopping cart.

10
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.340
So just an overview of the entire shopping cart process.

11
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.520
So the first thing that we'll do is

12
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.280
we'll make use the card status components

13
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.970
so on the main page will display the total price

14
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.670
and the quantity.

15
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.520
And then we'll have the cart details page

16
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.140
where we simply list the items in the cart.

17
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.730
We'll add some functionality to the cart details page

18
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.300
where we can add and remove items.

19
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.510
We'll also have a checkout button and a checkout form.

20
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:50.700
And what we'll do is we'll break this up

21
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.593
into multiple videos in this series.

22
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.023
And what we'll do now is

23
00:00:57.023 --> 00:00:58.970
we'll focus on the the cart status component

24
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.490
where we'll keep track of the total price

25
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.993
and also quantity for the shopping cart.

26
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.680
Alrighty, so here's our development process part one.

27
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.140
So we're going to create this new component

28
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.080
for the cart status component.

29
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.260
We'll add the HTML template for the component.

30
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.840
Next, we'll add a click handler

31
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.630
for the Add to Cart button.

32
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.650
And then we'll update our product list component

33
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.403
with the click handler method.

34
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.130
Already step one of creating the new component

35
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.166
for cart status.

36
00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:30.900
Again, this card status component

37
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.520
will keep track of the total price

38
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.323
and quantity for our shopping cart.

39
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.150
And so we can create the component by making use of that

40
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.870
ng generate component.

41
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.373
And then we give components slash card status.

42
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.620
Now step two of adding the HTML template

43
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.490
for the card status component.

44
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.560
So we add this HTML content here

45
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.560
making use of div and spans.

46
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.840
And so here we have the actual total price for the cart,

47
00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.420
and then the actual quantity.

48
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.040
Right now we're hard coding it

49
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.880
but later on, we'll update this dynamically

50
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.743
based on actions from the user.

51
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.870
And then also, we'll make use of the

52
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.310
Font Awesome shopping cart icon.

53
00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.400
So remember Font Awesome from earlier

54
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.590
collection of icons here.

55
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.113
So we make use of this icon here for a given shopping cart.

56
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.990
Alrighty, step three of adding a click handler

57
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.320
for the Add to Cart button.

58
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.320
So for our buttons on our product list grid,

59
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.280
we'll have this button here for Add to Cart.

60
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.650
And then we'll add the click handler here.

61
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.197
So on click event, we're going to call this method,

62
00:02:34.197 --> 00:02:35.030
addToCart.

63
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.263
And then we'll pass in the product.

64
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.720
Already, step four, updating the product list component

65
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.380
with a click handler method.

66
00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.130
So here's the method addToCart,

67
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.400
they pass in the product.

68
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.770
And right now, all we'll do is

69
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.540
we'll simply log the information.

70
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.930
So I'll say console dot log,

71
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.360
I'll say product dot name, product dot unit price.

72
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.515
We have some more real work to do later,

73
00:02:57.515 --> 00:03:00.160
as far as actually adding it to our cart service.

74
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.100
But for now, we'll just kind of focus on this

75
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.300
and getting this part working.

76
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.400
Alrighty, so this looks pretty good.

77
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.350
Let's go ahead and move into our IDE and let's get started.
