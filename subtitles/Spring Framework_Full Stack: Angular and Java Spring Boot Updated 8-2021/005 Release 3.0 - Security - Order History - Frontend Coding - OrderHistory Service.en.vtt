00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:02.240
<v Trainer>Alrighty, so moving along</v>

2
00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.760
with our development process,

3
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.320
in this video, we're going to cover step three

4
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.133
of developing new OrderHistory service.

5
00:00:20.373 --> 00:00:21.990
All right, so let's go ahead and zoom in here

6
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.160
to our terminal window and let's go ahead

7
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.920
and generate this OrderHistory service

8
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.490
using the Angular CLI.

9
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.053
So ng generate service services/OrderHistory.

10
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.140
And now swinging over to our services directory,

11
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.750
we see that there was a new entry here

12
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.513
for OrderHistory service.

13
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.870
I'll just exit out of this terminal window

14
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.493
just to give myself some space to work with.

15
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.720
Let's go ahead and move into our OrderHistory service.

16
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.330
The first thing that we want to do is define the orderUrl

17
00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.927
so that's the actual end point to our REST API.

18
00:01:20.836 --> 00:01:22.600
And then I'll move into my constructor

19
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.902
and I'll actually inject the httpClient.

20
00:01:25.902 --> 00:01:29.152
I'll use that for making REST API calls

21
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.750
and just to make sure we have the correct imports

22
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.380
up top for the httpClient.

23
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.363
That looks good.

24
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.023
And now to find this method here, getOrderHistory,

25
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.180
for a given user so they'll pass in

26
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.873
the user's email address,

27
00:02:09.607 --> 00:02:11.210
and then we'll return an Observable

28
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:12.560
for GetResponseOrderHistory

29
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.630
and we'll define the GetResponseOrderHistory interface

30
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.633
a little bit later, so just hang tight.

31
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.780
Now the first thing I need to do in this method

32
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.040
is I need to build URL based on the customer email

33
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.630
so that orderUrl need to append the customer email.

34
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.953
So I'll go ahead and set this up here, so OrderHistoryUrl,

35
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.270
and give the base Url/search/findByCustomerEmail

36
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.840
and then I set up that parameter, email equals,

37
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.300
and then I use the actual parameter

38
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.427
that's passed into this method, theEmail.

39
00:03:08.852 --> 00:03:13.685
And then I make the REST API calls so I use httpClient.get

40
00:03:19.906 --> 00:03:23.156
and then I pass in the orderHistoryUrl.

41
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.173
So this effectively calls the REST API.

42
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.030
Now what about this GetResponseOrderHistory?

43
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.970
All right, so this is a special interface that we'll use

44
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.133
to access the JSON data that's being returned.

45
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.843
So let's go ahead and define this now.

46
00:04:13.725 --> 00:04:16.020
So effectively, here we're going to unwrap the JSON

47
00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.070
that comes back from the Spring Data REST API

48
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.760
in particular the _embedded entry

49
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.580
and we'll basically map those to an array

50
00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.683
of OrderHistory items.

51
00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.010
And then let me just fix the imports here

52
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.163
for this observable,

53
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.730
and I think that's it.

54
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.743
So this all looks pretty good so far.
