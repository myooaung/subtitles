1
00:00:00,607 --> 00:00:02,210
<v Instructor>Alrighty so let's go ahead</v>

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,210
and run our application and test it out.

3
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:15,950
So we have the app running.

4
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,623
Let's go ahead and test this with Postman.

5
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,100
And if you remember, in some of the previous videos

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,860
we had some sample JSON

7
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,503
that we would use to test the checkout.

8
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:30,910
So you may already have the sample request still set

9
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,020
up and Postman, if not

10
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,513
I'll show you how you can download this sample JSON file.

11
00:00:42,419 --> 00:00:44,700
So just swing over to your browser

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,200
and go to this link that I have here on the slide.

13
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:58,160
And this will download a zip file that has

14
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,053
that sample JSON in there for you.

15
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:05,670
So in a zip file,

16
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,430
there's a file called sample-purchase.json.

17
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,210
So it's just a plain text file.

18
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,730
You can just go ahead and open up with any one

19
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:15,010
of your text editors and just copy that information.

20
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,180
And then you can paste that

21
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,450
into the body of a given POST request.

22
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,283
So be sure you put

23
00:01:20,283 --> 00:01:23,783
in a body, choose raw and make sure the type is JSON.

24
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,150
So in this example, I'll go through

25
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,880
and change some of the customer information.

26
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,960
So I'll set up a reference here

27
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,423
for John Doe and then his email is john.doe@luv2code.com.

28
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:47,090
Alrighty, that looks pretty good.

29
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,380
And before I run it, I actually want go through

30
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,810
and just double check some things in my database

31
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,670
just to make sure my database tables are empty.

32
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,010
So I'm moved back over to my SQL work page

33
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:00,193
and I will go through and check my customer table.

34
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,273
All right.

35
00:02:02,273 --> 00:02:03,106
So that's empty, good.

36
00:02:05,026 --> 00:02:07,740
I do a similar thing here for the orders table.

37
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,573
Okay, great.

38
00:02:08,573 --> 00:02:10,410
So you can check all the others too

39
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,540
but everything's empty right now

40
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,030
because we ran those truncate commands earlier.

41
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,830
So let's go ahead and send this over

42
00:02:17,311 --> 00:02:20,210
and then we get our order tracking number.

43
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,598
All right.

44
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:22,431
That part looks good.

45
00:02:22,431 --> 00:02:24,280
And then go over to my database

46
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,310
do a query here for customer, right.

47
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,140
That's John Doe fine.

48
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,780
And we should have an order there.

49
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,613
Okay, great.

50
00:02:31,613 --> 00:02:32,640
So that's in place.

51
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,473
That part works.

52
00:02:33,473 --> 00:02:35,510
It's mapped to customer ID of one

53
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,350
and John Doe is customer ID of one.

54
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,183
Okay, cool.

55
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,223
Now let's go through and send that again.

56
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,760
And so hopefully we only have one customer entry here.

57
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,990
Okay. Good success.

58
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,290
So there's only one customer.

59
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,480
We don't have multiple customers

60
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,300
with the same email address.

61
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,990
So we're reusing that existing customer.

62
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,690
All right. That's good.

63
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:00,240
Now under orders, we should have a new order.

64
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,840
That's tied to this given customer ID and okay good.

65
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,434
Here's our new order tracking number

66
00:03:06,434 --> 00:03:07,950
and tied to customer ID of one.

67
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,120
Excellent. So that's all tied to John Doe.

68
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,953
Good, good.

69
00:03:10,953 --> 00:03:11,786
I'm happy so far.

70
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:15,830
Do one more send, actually two more sends.

71
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,890
So we should have just one customer here

72
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,973
and should have a total of four orders.

73
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,793
Okay, great.

74
00:03:21,793 --> 00:03:24,870
And then all these orders are tied to customer ID of one.

75
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:25,973
Okay. Good stuff.

76
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,590
Now let's duplicate this tab

77
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,970
and we'll keep all of the same data

78
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,490
except for we'll change the customer information.

79
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,820
So we'll change the first name,

80
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,220
last name and email address.

81
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,723
So we'll set up susansmith@luv2code.com.

82
00:03:55,471 --> 00:03:58,138
And then we'll send this across.

83
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,753
All right.

84
00:04:01,753 --> 00:04:02,890
So we have this, order tracking number.

85
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,980
Great. Go over here and do a query.

86
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,813
Hey good,

87
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:09,470
so we have this new customer, Susan Smith ID of two.

88
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,303
That's great.

89
00:04:10,303 --> 00:04:11,583
Check the orders here.

90
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,980
We have this new order that came

91
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:20,100
in and that's where customer ID of two for Susan Smith.

92
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,950
Okay. So this is looking pretty good.

93
00:04:24,595 --> 00:04:26,290
We can swing back over

94
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,893
and do one more send for John,

95
00:04:34,718 --> 00:04:36,110
customer data

96
00:04:38,676 --> 00:04:40,970
and then orders

97
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,223
and then we see this order,

98
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,930
this is for customer ID of one.

99
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,980
So, all that part is working.

100
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,080
So the data's coming together as desired.

101
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,930
So our feature is up and running

102
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,094
and it looks pretty good.

103
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:55,927
I like it.

104
00:04:55,927 --> 00:04:56,760
Good job.
