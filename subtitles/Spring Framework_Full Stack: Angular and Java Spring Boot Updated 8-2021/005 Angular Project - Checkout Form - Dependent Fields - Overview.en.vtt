00:00:01.488 --> 00:00:03.060
<v Instructor>In this video, we're going to make some updates</v>

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.373
to our checkout form to support dependent fields.

3
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.130
So currently we have our credit card form,

4
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.370
we our expiration month and year,

5
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.570
so we've populated that code already,

6
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.290
but now the field should be dependent.

7
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.723
So the values of the month should depend on the year.

8
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.920
Okay, so a bit more details.

9
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.720
So if the current year is selected,

10
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.280
then we should only show the remaining months for the year.

11
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.730
So we should start at the current month and go to month 12,

12
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.120
because this is for credit card expiration dates.

13
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.750
Doesn't make any sense to show a previous month

14
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.630
if you're in the current year.

15
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.430
If it's a future year,

16
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.860
then we'll go ahead and show all of the months, right?

17
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.000
Because it's 2025, or 2028, we can show all of the months

18
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.193
regarding credit card expiration months and years.

19
00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.140
Okay, so here's our development process.

20
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.310
So we're going to update our HTML template.

21
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.760
So for the expiration years drop-down list,

22
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.350
we're going to add an event binding for the change event.

23
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.200
So basically, we'll add a trigger.

24
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.970
If they change the year, they would need to do some work.

25
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.760
So that's in step two of updating our checkout component

26
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.110
and adding an event handler.

27
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.120
So what we'll do is we'll read the selected year,

28
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.880
and then we'll update the list of months based

29
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.410
on the selected year.

30
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.660
So in a nutshell, if we're in the current year,

31
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.450
we're going to use the current month to the end, 12.

32
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.940
If we're in a future year,

33
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.063
then we'll give all 12 months, one through 12.

34
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.960
Alrighty, step one of updating the HTML template

35
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.950
for event binding.

36
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.740
So on our form, our formControlName of expirationYear,

37
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.500
we're going to add an event handler here.

38
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.090
So for the change event,

39
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.503
we're going to call the method handleMonthsAndYears.

40
00:01:53.888 --> 00:01:55.490
And then this method will actually define

41
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.493
on our component that TS file.

42
00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:02.570
All right, so here is step two

43
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.290
of updating the checkout component

44
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.350
to add that event handler.

45
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.220
So we'll have this method, handleMonthsAndYears,

46
00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.400
we'll get a handle to the creditCardFormGroup,

47
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.570
we'll get the current year

48
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.260
and we'll also read the selected year from the form.

49
00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.110
So whatever the user selected in the UE or in the form,

50
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.873
we're going to read that actual year.

51
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.230
And then we'll do a comparison.

52
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.960
If the current year equals the selected year,

53
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.163
then we'll start with the current month.

54
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.390
So we'll set up a variable here for startMonth

55
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.212
and say if current year equals selected year,

56
00:02:35.212 --> 00:02:38.610
startMonth = new Date getMonth + 1.

57
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.910
Remember, everything is zero-based for months.

58
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.133
Else will say the startMonth = 1.

59
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.460
And so then based on this data,

60
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.380
then we can actually use our luv2ShopFormService

61
00:02:52.646 --> 00:02:54.240
to get the credit card months.

62
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.120
So we passing the value of startMonth,

63
00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.720
and it'll give us that array of the appropriate data.

64
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.750
And we simply assign it accordingly

65
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.430
inside of our coding here.

66
00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.190
So this.creditCardMonths = data.

67
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.730
So the key is here is determining what's the start month,

68
00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.330
is it going to be the current month

69
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.563
or we're going to start at month equals one.

70
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.110
Alrighty, so this code looks good.

71
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.470
Let's go ahead and dive into our IDE

72
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.233
and let's write some code.
