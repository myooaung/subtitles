00:00:01.152 --> 00:00:01.985
<v Instructor>In this video,</v>

2
00:00:01.985 --> 00:00:05.013
we'll cover the online store template integration.

3
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.420
So here's our release 2.0 plan from the boss.

4
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.840
So we need to add the online shop template integration.

5
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.040
Search for products by category.

6
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.180
Search for products by text box.

7
00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.850
Add a master detail view of products.

8
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.250
Add pagination support for products.

9
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.760
Also add products to the shopping cart with CRUD.

10
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.653
And finally, a shopping cart checkout.

11
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.660
Okay, so this is more functionality

12
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.220
that was originally planned with 2.0.

13
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.700
This is known as feature creep, but don't worry,

14
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.060
you'll see this on real time projects,

15
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.040
this happens in the real world.

16
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.950
But our current task right now is the,

17
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.503
online shop template integration.

18
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.720
Alright, so the current status of our application

19
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.090
is that we have a very basic front end.

20
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.580
It was really just a proof of concept

21
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.690
for listing the products

22
00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.280
to make sure that we could get Angular

23
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.330
and Spring Boot working together.

24
00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.650
So it's really just a table with products,

25
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.633
but it's very basic, doesn't look like a real application.

26
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.820
And so we actually need more, so we need a website

27
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.390
that looks like an online shop, more than just a table.

28
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.630
So, this is what our website will look like, love2shop.

29
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.520
So we'll have products.

30
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.443
We'll have images and they can add to cart and so on.

31
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.530
So in the center section here

32
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.633
we'll show a list of products in a grid.

33
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.090
Over on the left hand side,

34
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.263
they can search for products by category.

35
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.213
Along the top we can search for products by text box.

36
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.530
And then also at the bottom we'll have pagination support

37
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.360
for products in case we have a lot of products

38
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.680
in our inventory.

39
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.830
And then also in the top right

40
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.380
we'll have shopping cart support,

41
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.550
so current status of the shopping cart,

42
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.010
checking out and so on.

43
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.763
And, we'll build this functionality in the upcoming videos.

44
00:01:59.129 --> 00:02:00.780
I already wireframes to Web template.

45
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.600
So, I sent the wireframes to a friend,

46
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.780
so these are just my wireframe mock ups.

47
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.470
And then he took that information

48
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.530
and he created a web template.

49
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.260
And so he delivered a zip file that had .HTML files and CSS.

50
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.170
So this is just a collection of pages that show the layout,

51
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.010
it's dummy data.

52
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.650
There's no real database integration,

53
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.760
just standalone HTML pages,

54
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.143
along with supporting CSS styles.

55
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.390
And so, what we'll do,

56
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.740
is we'll actually integrate that HTML template

57
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.180
with our Angular startup component HTML files.

58
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.730
So, we'll add the CSS files to our project,

59
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.250
and so we'll actually have an Angular application

60
00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.930
that uses that template, but we'll get real information

61
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.763
from our Spring Boot back in.

62
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.150
And then just a note about Cascading Style Sheets.

63
00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.000
The template uses CSS for styles, layouts and colors.

64
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.970
Teaching CSS is beyond the scope of this course,

65
00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.230
but if you'd like a tutorial on CSS,

66
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.610
they're free online tutorials that are are available.

67
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.350
Simply go to the links here,

68
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.750
w3schools CSS is a really good one

69
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.700
and also w3schools Bootstrap,

70
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.480
a really good tutorial on Bootstrap

71
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.103
to kind of get you up and running with those given CSS styles.

72
00:03:15.216 --> 00:03:17.000
I already started development process.

73
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.730
We'll download the HTML template starter files.

74
00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.000
Then we'll install Bootstrap CSS styles locally using NPM.

75
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.620
And then we'll add a local Custom CSS style

76
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.740
to our Angular style CSS file.

77
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.560
Next we'll integrate the template files

78
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.000
into the Angular app.

79
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.220
We'll add support for icons and logos.

80
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.120
And then finally we'll enhance our application

81
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.190
with product images.

82
00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.760
So this is great, I'm kind of of excited,

83
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.790
actually I'm really excited about this.

84
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.500
So let's go ahead and move in to the next video,

85
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.323
and let's get started.
