00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.650
<v Instructor>Alrighty so a quick overview</v>

2
00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:03.960
of our development process.

3
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:04.793
So in this video,

4
00:00:04.793 --> 00:00:06.619
we're going to cover the first five steps

5
00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:08.903
of the development process.

6
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.189
Alrighty, so moving individual studio code

7
00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:18.093
step one is creating a new project.

8
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.223
So I'll open up a new terminal window here.

9
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.340
And I'll expand the window,

10
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.890
I'll do a collapse over here on the left hand side.

11
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.203
Just check my directory here, angular training.

12
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.563
And then I'll do an ng new sales project.

13
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.133
And then I'll say no for angular routing.

14
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.223
And then I'll select CSS for the style sheet format.

15
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.780
It'll start creating your project.

16
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.010
You can safely ignore the warnings.

17
00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.190
And at the end, your project will be set up

18
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.183
and ready to go.

19
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.110
So we can look at the files here on the left hand side

20
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:05.990
and we'll see that it created

21
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.493
a new directory for me, sales project.

22
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.930
And if I expand that directory,

23
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.970
I see all the files that were just created

24
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.453
for this angular project.

25
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.840
And I'll go ahead and move into this project directory.

26
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.110
And I'll go ahead and start up the project real quick

27
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.963
using ng serve with the open option.

28
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.270
And we'll see the default page here,

29
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.123
sales project app is running.

30
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.363
In step two, we're going to update the main template page.

31
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.110
Over on the left hand side,

32
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.780
I'll open up app component .html

33
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.420
and remember, this is the file that has

34
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.040
all of the default content, the placeholder content.

35
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.540
I'll go ahead and clean-up this file

36
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.670
by simply selecting everything and deleting it.

37
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.410
And now that this file is empty,

38
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.400
I'll make use of some very basic html here.

39
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.903
I'll make use of h1 and say sales team.

40
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.790
And then I'll swing over to my browser

41
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.440
just to verify that that's there.

42
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.673
And it looks good.

43
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.070
So I'll move back to my terminal window

44
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.050
and stop the server

45
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.600
because I want to perform some other operations here.

46
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:45.700
So in step three,

47
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.400
I'm going to generate a new component.

48
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.743
So I give the ng generate component command.

49
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.530
So I'm creating this new component

50
00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.420
for my salesperson list

51
00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.920
and it shows me the new files that I just created.

52
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.470
And so in step four I'm going to add the new component

53
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.163
selector to our app template page.

54
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.110
So the first thing I do is I'll look

55
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.763
at my component.ts file, my TypeScript file.

56
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.380
And I'll make note of the selector app salesperson list.

57
00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.450
I'll copy this and I'll add this

58
00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.863
to my app component.html page.

59
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.860
So I'll move down here

60
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.860
and I'll make it a tag, angle bracket

61
00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.670
at salesperson list and then a slash app salesperson list.

62
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.300
All right, great so I have my new selector

63
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.253
here on my app component html template page.

64
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.240
And then I move back to my terminal window here.

65
00:04:06.111 --> 00:04:07.660
And then in step five

66
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.873
I'm going to generate a salesperson class.

67
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.670
And oops I have a small typo here

68
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.303
I have class with too many s's.

69
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.940
Just get rid of that one.

70
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.313
Okay, this looks good.

71
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.370
Okay, excellent, so it created my salesperson class.

72
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.623
So I'll open up this file salesperson.ts.

73
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.170
And as we saw in the slides,

74
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.123
it's a very basic class, there's nothing here.

75
00:04:54.875 --> 00:04:56.700
And so now I'll define a constructor

76
00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.920
and I'll make use of parameter properties.

77
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.160
So remember we declare these parameter properties

78
00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.330
by giving the access modifier

79
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.620
and then the actual parameter name.

80
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.970
So here I have public first name

81
00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.174
and then I'll do a similar thing here for last name,

82
00:05:10.174 --> 00:05:13.347
email and also sales volume.

83
00:05:26.376 --> 00:05:27.220
Okay, this looks good.

84
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.960
So there's my constructor along with parameter properties

85
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.667
and so these properties are automatically defined

86
00:05:32.667 --> 00:05:35.113
by making use of this technique.
