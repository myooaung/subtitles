00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.750
<v ->Alright, so moving along with our development process.</v>

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.330
In this video, we'll cover step four

3
00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.560
of enhancing the Product Details Component

4
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.783
to retrieve the product from the Product Service.

5
00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.170
Alrighty, so when our IDE,

6
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.170
I'll actually move down here, to the Terminal.

7
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.670
I'll actually stop my application from running

8
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.550
and I'll close the Termial window,

9
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.810
just so I can have more real estate on the screen,

10
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.243
to actually write code.

11
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.033
And I'll open up the file, Product Details Components.ts.

12
00:00:41.897 --> 00:00:44.270
Alrighty, so let's move into this file here,

13
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.170
Product Details Component.

14
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.410
And the first thing I want to do is,

15
00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.703
define a property for our product.

16
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.590
And then, I'll inject dependencies

17
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.460
for the actual product service

18
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.823
and also for the activated route.

19
00:01:23.782 --> 00:01:25.090
And then also, just scroll up top,

20
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.300
just to make sure we have the correct imports.

21
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.550
Alright, that looks good.

22
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.880
Alrighty, so in my ngOnInit method,

23
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.042
I simply want to do a subscribe on the params

24
00:01:41.042 --> 00:01:45.792
and then make a call to a method, Handle Product Details.

25
00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:05.316
And this, Product Details method's not created,

26
00:02:05.316 --> 00:02:10.066
so I'll actually have the IDE declare this method for us.

27
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.333
Okay, so in this method,

28
00:02:21.333 --> 00:02:23.841
I actually want to get the ID parameter string

29
00:02:23.841 --> 00:02:26.091
and convert it to a number.

30
00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:49.339
Sorry, that parameter, by simply saying, paramMap.get id.

31
00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:50.970
And now that I have the ID,

32
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.700
I can simply use the product service

33
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.603
and I can call, getProduct.

34
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.710
Pass in the product ID, do a subscribe

35
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.670
and assign the results of this call

36
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.670
to my product property that I have to find in this class.

37
00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.163
So that will be, this.products = data.

38
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.830
And hmm, there's an error.

39
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:23.930
Hmm, interesting.

40
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:24.763
What's going on?

41
00:03:24.763 --> 00:03:25.640
Product, product.

42
00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.290
That looks good up top.

43
00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.560
Down here, it's an error, product array.

44
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.100
Oh!

45
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.880
Typo, typo.

46
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.040
Alright, this really should be, getProduct,

47
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.567
not, Productlist.

48
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.740
There we go, getProduct.

49
00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.240
And that's going to be a new method that's not created yet.

50
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.040
We'll create it in a second.

51
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.890
We'll actually create it in the next video.

52
00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.830
So, we need to make a modification there.

53
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.330
So, productService.getProduct.

54
00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.440
And that'll take care of that one error that we had

55
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.550
with our assignment, but we still need to create that method

56
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.050
and I'll take care of that in the next video.

57
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.150
So I'll see you there.
