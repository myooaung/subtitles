00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:02,320
<v Narrator>Alrighty, so moving in here</v>

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,600
with our development process,

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,130
we'll cover step one of creating the model class

4
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:07,403
for our cart item.

5
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:16,303
Alrighty,

6
00:00:16,303 --> 00:00:17,780
so moving into our IDE,

7
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,630
let's go and moving to our terminal window

8
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,903
and let's go ahead and generate or create that new class.

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,670
So I can make use of this ng generate class

10
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,603
and give common/card-item.

11
00:00:41,376 --> 00:00:43,130
And let me just clean up some of these windows here

12
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,533
just to close all just to get rid of those items there.

13
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,790
Close off this terminal window real quick.

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,643
And move over here to common,

15
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,830
and there is a new file cart-item.cs.

16
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:00,663
All right,

17
00:01:00,663 --> 00:01:01,663
just a very basic shell right now.

18
00:01:01,663 --> 00:01:04,423
And now add the fields here for this CartItem.

19
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,680
And remember, we simply hold the essential fields

20
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,243
for our product along with the actual quantity.

21
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:18,383
So I'll have fields

22
00:01:18,383 --> 00:01:19,540
here for ID,

23
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,373
name,

24
00:01:20,373 --> 00:01:21,230
and image URL

25
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,423
and unit price.

26
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:26,830
And also that new item here quantity

27
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,133
for this Cart item.

28
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,240
And I'll also create a constructor

29
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,630
where you pass in a product

30
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,283
and then we'll simply make the appropriate assignments here

31
00:01:36,283 --> 00:01:38,343
for these properties.

32
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:20,763
Alrighty,

33
00:02:20,763 --> 00:02:22,080
so that's the basic coding here

34
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,913
for the Card item.

35
00:02:22,913 --> 00:02:25,200
So we simply just have that constructor,

36
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,250
we assign over the appropriate values

37
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,370
and then we initialize the quantity at one
