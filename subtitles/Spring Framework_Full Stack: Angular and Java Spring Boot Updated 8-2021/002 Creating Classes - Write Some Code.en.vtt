00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.300
<v Instructor>All right-y, so let's go ahead</v>

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.350
and move into our IDE.

3
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.140
The first thing I want to do is we're going to take care

4
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.490
of some housekeeping items.

5
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.630
So let me kind of zoom in over here on the left hand side

6
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.340
and I want to create some directories that we'll use

7
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.503
for the next set of videos.

8
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.653
So let's just go ahead and create a new folder here.

9
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.633
And I'll give it the name of 04-classes.

10
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.540
So that'll be our main folder

11
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.173
and we'll create some subfolders underneath 04-classes.

12
00:00:40.944 --> 00:00:44.255
So let's create a new folder here.

13
00:00:44.255 --> 00:00:45.587
So this'll be a subfolder.

14
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.053
And the name will be 01-class-definition.

15
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.870
Okay, this looks really good.

16
00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.980
So now, let's go ahead and create a new file

17
00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.350
and we'll create this new file Customer.ts

18
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:05.810
and that's the file that we'll use to create

19
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.263
our customer class.

20
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.413
All right-y, so let's go ahead

21
00:01:12.413 --> 00:01:14.203
and define our customer class.

22
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.670
Just create our class customer

23
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.840
and then we'll go ahead and define our properties.

24
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.783
firstName: string, lastName: string.

25
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:31.783
And that's it.

26
00:01:31.783 --> 00:01:34.220
Now remember, be default, all properties are public.

27
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.363
So now let's go ahead and create an instance of our class.

28
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.470
So let myCustomer equals new Customer

29
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.720
using the new key word to create an instance.

30
00:01:51.641 --> 00:01:53.390
And now let's go ahead and set some properties here.

31
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.763
So firstName equals Martin.

32
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.533
And I set the lastName equals to Dixon.

33
00:02:09.928 --> 00:02:14.047
And then I simply display those values using console.log.

34
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.610
Okay so that looks really good.

35
00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.060
Let's go ahead and open up a new terminal window.

36
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.900
And now let's move into our correct directory here

37
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.900
so 04-classes slash 01-class-definition.

38
00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.000
And now let's go ahead and compile our code here

39
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.723
using tsc Customer.ts.

40
00:03:05.377 --> 00:03:09.794
And now let's go ahead and run our code, Customer.js.

41
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:11.713
And there we go.

42
00:03:11.713 --> 00:03:12.546
Martin Dixon.

43
00:03:12.546 --> 00:03:14.620
So that's the desired output based on the code

44
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.570
that we created in this sample program.

45
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:22.860
All right-y so let's go ahead

46
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.700
and move back into our code here.

47
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.030
And now what I want to do is actually make use

48
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.863
of a constructor so I want to define a constructor.

49
00:03:39.335 --> 00:03:40.660
So remember when we create a constructor,

50
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.470
we use a constructor key word,

51
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.373
we set up the constructor arguments or parameters,

52
00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:59.650
we simply make the assignments

53
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.010
and remember we use this.firstName

54
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.473
to refer to this property in this class.

55
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.210
And so now I can make some updates

56
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.800
so I can actually delete some of this old code

57
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.990
and I'll make use of my new constructor now.

58
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.030
So I can create the constructor and I can pass in

59
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.843
the first name, last name right here in the constructor.

60
00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.260
All right so this looks pretty good.

61
00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.543
I like it, I like it.

62
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.510
All right-y so I can move back into my terminal window here

63
00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.853
and just compile the code and run it again.

64
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.870
And we'll get the exact same output right

65
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.330
but here, we're simply using the constructor

66
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.580
for our customer class

67
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.720
as opposed to setting the properties directly.

68
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.993
So good job.
