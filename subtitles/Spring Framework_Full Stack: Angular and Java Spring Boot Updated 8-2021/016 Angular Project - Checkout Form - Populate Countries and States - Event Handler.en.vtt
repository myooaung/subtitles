00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:02.490
<v Instructor>Okay, so moving along</v>

2
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:03.930
with our development process

3
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.730
in this video we'll cover steps three and four

4
00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.930
updating our checkout components to retrieve countries

5
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.460
on the service and also updating the templates

6
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.443
to populate the drop down list for countries.

7
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.970
Open up my checkoutcomponent.ts

8
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.910
Expand my window here for a second.

9
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.670
And I'll zoom in here and I'll create this array countries

10
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.585
so it's an array of country objects,

11
00:00:47.585 --> 00:00:49.903
and initialize it to an empty array.

12
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.710
And now I'll move down here a bit

13
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.400
into this ngOnInit method.

14
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.410
So we do our normal work

15
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.430
of populating credit card months, credit card years

16
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.590
and then we'll also populate countries.

17
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.490
So in the forms initially displayed,

18
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.490
we'll be able to populate the countries.

19
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.510
Okay, so zooming in here then I'll call my service,

20
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:30.980
luv2shopforservice.getcountries

21
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:37.880
add your subscribe

22
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.190
and then once we receive the data

23
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.720
and do a console.log on it

24
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.363
and then I also assign that data to the country's array.

25
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.670
Alright, so that's the coding there right now

26
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.900
for the checkoutcomponent.ts

27
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.750
and now need to move our checkout component at HTML.

28
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.620
This is for step four of updating the HTML templates

29
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.773
to populate the dropdown list for countries.

30
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.120
So I'm inside of this HTML template right now

31
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.423
And I'll move down to the shipping address section.

32
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.550
So this is for shipping address right now

33
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.380
and we see that we have a to do section for the countries.

34
00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.013
Alright, that's on line 49.

35
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.410
So I'll move over here and kind of zoom in a bit

36
00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.580
and I'll get rid of all the to do stuff

37
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.030
because now I'm actually ready to do my work,

38
00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.593
I'll get down and dirty and write this code.

39
00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.460
And so we make use of our ngFor,

40
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.760
and then we loop over the countries.

41
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.320
So we let country of countries

42
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.833
and then we set the ng-value equals country.

43
00:03:37.478 --> 00:03:39.160
And then I make use of the ng-value

44
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.790
just to keep a hold or a handle

45
00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.450
of that country objects so I can use it later.

46
00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:45.460
Because we'll need that

47
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.060
when we actually need to get the actual country code.

48
00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.810
But right now we're simply displaying the country name.

49
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.130
And then inside of this element here, option element

50
00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.710
then I make use of the curly braces here,

51
00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.230
the double curly braces and I say country.name

52
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.080
And let's test it out.

53
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.590
First, make sure my Spring Boot app is up and running

54
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.740
if not, go ahead and start it a real quick.

55
00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.480
Then back in my Visual Studio Code,

56
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.260
just open up a new window here

57
00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.393
so I can run that application.

58
00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.610
Already, so my Angular app is up and running

59
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.620
this move over to my browser, access my application

60
00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.360
and then we simply just add

61
00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.310
a couple of things to our shopping cart

62
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.430
and move down to that checkout section

63
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:07.703
or the checkout button.

64
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.970
And now, we should be able to look at shipping address

65
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.210
and for countries if we select that,

66
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.750
then success!

67
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.080
The countries are populated and this is great.

68
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.760
So this is all populated with information

69
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.250
from the rest API that's coming from our database.

70
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.163
Oh yeah!

71
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.500
And we can even go and look at the actual logs

72
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.000
because we did some console.log work earlier.

73
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.860
So over here, close off some of this stuff,

74
00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.690
console and then zoom in

75
00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.730
here at the bottom and, oh yes, great!

76
00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.950
So these are all the countries that we have.

77
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:51.253
So Brazil, India, Turkey, cool, great.

78
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.240
So now we simply need to do

79
00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.110
the same thing for Billing Address.

80
00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.420
Right now billing address still has the, to do section

81
00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.040
but no problem, we know how to write the code for this now.

82
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.713
So, just move over here and knock this out.

83
00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.010
Alright, so right now I'm in shipping address.

84
00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.990
Let's just go ahead and copy

85
00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.390
the option coding for right now

86
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.970
and then we'll move down

87
00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.060
and we'll use that same coding

88
00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.813
down in the billing address section.

89
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:33.223
So let's see where I'm at.

90
00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.340
Somewhere in shipping right now, keep moving down.

91
00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.593
There we go, Billing Address, okay, cool.

92
00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:44.450
And then down in this section here

93
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:45.850
where I have the little to do,

94
00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:48.573
then I'll just paste what I had previously.

95
00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.580
Great, so that does the whole country of countries

96
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.880
and blah, blah, blah, country.name

97
00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.300
Okay, good.

98
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.820
Let's save that,

99
00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:00.270
swing back into our application and check it out.

100
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:05.740
And so now for a billing address and, alright success!

101
00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.320
So the countries are populated for shipping address

102
00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.440
and they're also populated for billing address.

103
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.320
Cool, I'm excited, I'm happy.

104
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.253
Good job my friend.
