00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:02.450
<v Chad>Okay, so let's go ahead and get started</v>

2
00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:03.750
with our development process.

3
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:04.583
The first thing we'll do

4
00:00:04.583 --> 00:00:07.940
is we'll enable the User Registration in the Okta Dashboard,

5
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.823
and then we'll configure the code in our login component.

6
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:19.830
Okay, so let's go ahead

7
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.670
and just log in to our Okta Dashboard,

8
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.410
and it's using the account that we've already created.

9
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.483
So in my example, I have Demo. Demo Darby.

10
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.893
And then here, I go to Users and then choose Registration.

11
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.877
And so, we'll move over to the top right corner here,

12
00:00:48.877 --> 00:00:52.373
and I'll click on Edit for this Registration section.

13
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.620
And so we see that Self-Service Registration is disabled.

14
00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.283
We'll go ahead and enable it.

15
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.290
And then also make sure that this checkbox is selected

16
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.083
to show the Sign Up link.

17
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.040
We'll go ahead and keep the other defaults here

18
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.720
for this section.

19
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.440
Moving down to Registration Form,

20
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.010
we see the label they'll use for email, for password,

21
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.160
and some of the other items,

22
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.660
and I'll just go ahead and keep the defaults here.

23
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.250
Moving down to Post-Registration,

24
00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.160
we see this area here for Activation requirements.

25
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.880
And so this is where you can enable or disable

26
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.580
the activation requirements.

27
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.550
And so remember, I said earlier,

28
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.480
mandatory activation, that's good,

29
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.390
when can go to production,

30
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.640
to make sure they have a valid email address.

31
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.670
And then the optional activation, that's good for DEV.

32
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.570
So for testing, so you can make use

33
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.970
of fake email addresses or test email addresses

34
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.330
just to kind of test things out.

35
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.390
So it's really up to you which approach you want to use here,

36
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.323
but I recommend mandatory for production use.

37
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.960
And then also, we have this Default redirect,

38
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.030
basically saying once they log in,

39
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.053
then this is the actual URL that we'll send them to.

40
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.063
So I'll make use of our home picked URL, localhost:4200.

41
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.293
And then we'll go ahead and save these settings here.

42
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.290
Okay, great. Everything is set up at this point.

43
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.723
Let's go ahead and sign out of this account.

44
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:37.610
And now what I'd like to do

45
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.970
is just kind of switch over to my IDE

46
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.270
and go ahead and take care of the coding work.

47
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.500
So I'll move down to my src, app, components,

48
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.043
to my login.component.

49
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.463
I'll open up my login.component.ts.

50
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.230
And so what I need to do here

51
00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.090
is just add an additional configuration in my constructor

52
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.523
when I'm creating this OktaSignIn widget.

53
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.873
And so I'll add this entry here for features.

54
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.043
And I'll have registration: true.

55
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.830
All right, I'll just kind of highlight this for a second.

56
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.310
So this is the one entry here that you need to add

57
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.833
for this portion of coding.

58
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.113
So let's go ahead and test this application out.

59
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:53.720
So the first thing I want to do

60
00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.470
is make sure my backend code is running.

61
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.440
So I'll swing in to IntelliJ,

62
00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.690
make sure our SpringBoot app is up and running.

63
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.563
If not, go ahead and start it now.

64
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.100
Swing back in to Visual Studio Code

65
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.000
and go ahead and start my Angular app.

66
00:04:21.342 --> 00:04:26.192
All right, so I can swing in to my web browser now.

67
00:04:26.192 --> 00:04:29.620
And what I'll do is I'll open up a new incognito browser,

68
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:30.940
or a new private browser,

69
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:31.900
just to make sure I don't have

70
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.743
any previous sessions out there.

71
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.923
I'll go to my luv2shop application.

72
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.333
I'll choose this Login button over here.

73
00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.050
And so in this case, I want to sign up a new user.

74
00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.820
So, I'll kind of move to the bottom here

75
00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.110
and I'll choose Sign up.

76
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.470
So that's nice. We have this feature enabled now.

77
00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.450
And then I'll simply go ahead, and enter an email address.

78
00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.870
And so I'll just kind of play around with a test email address

79
00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.230
or a fake email address, snoopy@luv2code.com.

80
00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:04.820
I'm just totally making this up right now,

81
00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.633
because we're not verifying the email address here.

82
00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.193
Now I go ahead and register this user.

83
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.390
Okay, great. So now this user's registered in the backend.

84
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.100
I can go ahead and sign in to the application here.

85
00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.853
So I'll enter that same information, snoopy@luv2code.com.

86
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.830
All right, so now I'm successfully logged in.

87
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.370
And if we swing it to the top right,

88
00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.680
we can see Welcome back Snoopy Darby!

89
00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.830
So we know that this user is really stored

90
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.210
in the Okta system.

91
00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.910
So this is great. I'm really, really happy about this.

92
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.730
But I always like to kind of verify things, right? (laughs)

93
00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.533
Double-check, so let's go ahead and log out right here.

94
00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.203
And let me kind of zoom back down for a bit.

95
00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.900
And I'll actually just log in with my regular account.

96
00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.100
So here I'm going to log in

97
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.660
as my original developer account, my demo@luv2code.com.

98
00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.880
That's the one that I created

99
00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.870
when I set everything up at first.

100
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.070
So not the new account,

101
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.400
but the one that we've always used before.

102
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.360
All right, so I'm logged in as my demo account.

103
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.420
I can go in to Users, People,

104
00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:38.760
and I can see the list.

105
00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.060
Demo Darby, that's the one that I started with,

106
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:42.640
and then Snoopy Darby.

107
00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.350
Great, so that's that new user account

108
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.103
that was just created, awesome.

109
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.240
And then I can go ahead and check on the Profile

110
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.320
for this account,

111
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.800
and I can see the information, Snoopy Darby.

112
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.633
So this is great.

113
00:06:53.633 --> 00:06:57.730
So, we were able to allow users to register themselves,

114
00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:59.180
and they could do it automatically

115
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.430
by setting up those configs

116
00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:01.940
that we created a little bit earlier.

117
00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.913
So this is great. Good job.
