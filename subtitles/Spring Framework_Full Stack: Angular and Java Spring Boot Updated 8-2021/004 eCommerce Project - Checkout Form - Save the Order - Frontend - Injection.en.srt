1
00:00:00,874 --> 00:00:01,707
<v Chad>All right.</v>

2
00:00:01,707 --> 00:00:03,030
So we have our CheckoutService finished.

3
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:04,680
Let's go ahead and work on our CheckoutComponent.

4
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,510
So we'll update it, we'll inject the CheckoutService,

5
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:10,480
and we'll also make use of a router

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,743
for helping us with some of our navigation.

7
00:00:28,938 --> 00:00:32,938
So let's move down to our checkout.component.ts.

8
00:00:40,876 --> 00:00:43,240
And let's move down to our constructor,

9
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,773
so we can inject the checkoutService and the router.

10
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:59,567
So I'll inject the checkoutService,

11
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,233
and also inject the router.

12
00:01:14,611 --> 00:01:15,630
All right.

13
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,610
So let's see checkoutService.

14
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,230
No quick fixes.

15
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,800
Okay, that's interesting.

16
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,293
I may have to do this manually for the import.

17
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,800
So you may have better luck than me,

18
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,630
but I'll just manually do the import here, so...

19
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,860
Here I'll say checkoutService,

20
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,640
and then checkout.service.

21
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:45,703
Okay, that's great.

22
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,330
That takes care of that issue.

23
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,163
Okay, good.

24
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,430
Now we'll spend the rest of our time

25
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,040
down in the onSubmit method.

26
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,690
So let's scroll down to onSubmit.

27
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,720
So inside of this if statement checking for form validation,

28
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,170
if it's invalid, we do all the mark as touched,

29
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,700
but we also want to just do a return,

30
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,910
meaning, hey, don't execute anything else in this method.

31
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,753
We're done processing.

32
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,100
So be sure to put that return statement there in that if.

33
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,160
Also, I'll clean up all of these console.log statements.

34
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,680
You can keep them if you want.

35
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,433
I'm simply trying to just save screen real estate here.

36
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,530
Now I'll go ahead and write some quick comments to myself

37
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,353
just to keep myself on track.

38
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,770
Alrighty, so that looks pretty good here

39
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:56,560
as far as all of our comments, as far as populating data.

40
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,670
Now we can make a call to the REST API,

41
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,803
based on all this form data we've collected and populated.

42
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,810
Alrighty, so that's the big game plan

43
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,240
of what we're going to do.

44
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,550
In the next video, we'll start adding the code for it.

45
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,000
Alrighty, I'll see you there.
