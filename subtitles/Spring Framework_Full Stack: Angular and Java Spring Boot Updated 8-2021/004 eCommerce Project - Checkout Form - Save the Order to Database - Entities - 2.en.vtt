00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:02.030
<v Instructor>Alrighty. So let's go in</v>

2
00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:04.973
and create another entity here for order item.

3
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.780
And I'll use the similar approach here.

4
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.243
I'll just grab some items from the other class,

5
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.373
paste them here,

6
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.110
and then I'll update the table reference

7
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.570
to say order_item.

8
00:00:48.182 --> 00:00:52.432
And then I'll move down here and define the fields.

9
00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:16.500
All right. So we'll keep everything here except for order.

10
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.483
We'll add the order relationship later.

11
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.930
Just grab the ID generation

12
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.273
annotations.

13
00:01:27.273 --> 00:01:29.320
So I'll just kind of copy those from address

14
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.480
and then I'll paste them here in order item.

15
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.113
Just make the updates here for column.

16
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.253
And then I'll create my final entity here for order.

17
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.683
So just a new Java class.

18
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.363
And I think you know the drill by now.

19
00:03:01.624 --> 00:03:02.930
And then the one thing to notice here

20
00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.200
is the actual table name is orders, with an S.

21
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.913
So note the orders with the S plural at the end.

22
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.443
Let's go through and define the fields here for the order.

23
00:04:14.618 --> 00:04:16.000
All right. So those are the fields.

24
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.370
Let's go ahead and just grab some

25
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.263
of the ID generation annotations.

26
00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.600
And now, you know, the drill with the column

27
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:35.520
and then we'll come back through

28
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.893
and we'll update those column names accordingly.

29
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.410
And one more item I want to do is make use

30
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.610
of this special annotation from Hibernate

31
00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.320
called CreationTimestamp.

32
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.420
So it'll basically add, it'll automatically add

33
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.910
the timestamp that this entity is created,

34
00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.250
which is really nice.

35
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.810
And then also Hibernate has an annotation

36
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.710
for UpdateTimestamp.

37
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.730
And again, this is from Hibernate

38
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.030
and they'll basically provide the support there.

39
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.130
So just a little bit of tracking there for you,

40
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.780
for tracking the orders when they're created

41
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:35.680
and updated and so on.

42
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.883
So just a nice feature to add to your application.

43
00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.430
Alrighty. So there we go.

44
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.000
So we had the order class taken care of.

45
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.833
Good job.
