1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:02,230
<v Instructor>All righty, so let's go ahead</v>

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:04,190
and get started with our development process.

3
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,860
So in this video, we'll cover steps one and two,

4
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,550
fixing the deprecated method

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,663
and also configuring the CORS mapping for Spring Data REST.

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,320
All right, so let's move in here

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,693
and let's open my MyDataRestConfig.

8
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,640
And you may have noticed here,

9
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,935
there's this one method,

10
00:00:35,935 --> 00:00:38,190
configureRepositoryRestConfiguration.

11
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,133
It's deprecated and we need to change that and clean it up.

12
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:45,733
So you may wonder,

13
00:00:45,733 --> 00:00:48,310
well, how can I find a good replacement here?

14
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:52,110
Well, one tip that I use if the IDE can't help me

15
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,800
is I'll simply just copy the method name

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,083
and I'll do a search for it online.

17
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,540
So I'll just copy that name, open up my browser.

18
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,230
I'll drop in the method name

19
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,410
and I'll also use the word deprecated

20
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,773
just to see if I can find any hits on this given issue.

21
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,420
And this will take me to the documentation,

22
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,463
which is great because this is the definitive source.

23
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,933
And we see that we have this method here,

24
00:01:26,933 --> 00:01:31,390
configureRepositoryRestConfiguration that's deprecated.

25
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,460
And drill in here and get some details.

26
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,973
And they'll even tell us which method to use.

27
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,310
So we should use this method here.

28
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,190
Same method name.

29
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:47,640
Simply has a new parameter being passed in.

30
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,473
CoreRegistry.

31
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,740
And this is good because we can actually just copy this

32
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,440
and then move over to our source code and paste it in.

33
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,870
So now the method's no longer deprecated.

34
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,370
Now let's go ahead and use this new parameter

35
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,870
that we just added.

36
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,903
Let's use it.

37
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,810
So this will help us with step two

38
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,763
of configuring CORS mapping for Spring Data REST.

39
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,363
I can just move down here and configure the CORS mapping.

40
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:41,920
So I'll just do an addMapping here and api/**.

41
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,883
The **'s for recursing for all sub-paths.

42
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,240
And then we also give allowedOrigins

43
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,450
and we give the actual origin that we accept.

44
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,897
In our example, localhost:4200.

45
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:04,903
And so that's pretty good.

46
00:03:04,903 --> 00:03:06,530
So we're able to use this new parameter

47
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,280
that we gained access to

48
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,050
by uploading this deprecated method.

49
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,200
Pretty good, I like it.

50
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,820
Now we have this here,

51
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,743
we can actually remove the @CrossOrigin from JpaRepositories.

52
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,770
So let's move over to our repository,

53
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,260
so this CountryRepository.

54
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:41,073
Let's open this and we can remove the @CrossOrigin

55
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,423
because now we have this

56
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:45,313
in our Spring Data REST configuration.

57
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,960
Our CustomerRepository, there's nothing there.

58
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,053
Our ProductCategory, same thing.

59
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,980
Similar item here for our ProductCategory

60
00:04:04,476 --> 00:04:07,457
and then also a similar thing for StateRepository.
