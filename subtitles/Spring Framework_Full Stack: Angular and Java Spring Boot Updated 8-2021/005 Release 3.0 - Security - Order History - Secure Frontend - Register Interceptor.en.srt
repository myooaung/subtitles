00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:02,300
<v Instructor>Alrighty, so moving along</v>

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,460
in our development process,

3
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:04,840
in this video we'll cover step two

4
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,123
of updating the app module TS to reference the interceptor.

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,430
And actually, before we leave this screen,

6
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:22,810
we have a problem.

7
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,070
We have a typo,

8
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,200
and there's an extra semi-colon here

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,830
that should not be here.

10
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:32,503
So simply remove this semi-colon to resolve the typo issue.

11
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,590
And so now we can safely move to app module TS

12
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,540
and add a reference to our interceptor.

13
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,363
Alrighty, so we have the file open.

14
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,430
Let's go ahead and move down

15
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,723
to the providers section of the file.

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,150
And so here's the one line we're going

17
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,883
to make our modifications on.

18
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,590
So I simply do a comma

19
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,763
and I make use of curly braces here.

20
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:30,273
So we're setting up providers for HP interceptors.

21
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,990
We use the class that's the name of our interceptor

22
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:39,210
that we just created, our auth interceptor service.

23
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,293
So that's our class, our code.

24
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,263
And then multi true.

25
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,140
And the reason we have multi-true

26
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,430
is because with interceptors you can have

27
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,560
zero to many interceptors, and so you could

28
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,253
have multiple interceptors here.

29
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,430
Let's go ahead and fix the reference here

30
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,610
for our auth service.

31
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:07,083
I'll just move up here and do an import.

32
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,557
I have to manually do it.

33
00:02:12,557 --> 00:02:15,890
It may work out better for you on your system,

34
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,983
but mine I have to type it in, but no worries.

35
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,940
So I'll interceptor service from services slash auth

36
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,173
interceptor dot service.

37
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,993
Now moving back down and okay, great, that's resolved.

38
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,573
And that looks pretty good.

39
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,010
So again, just a quick recap here.

40
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,413
That's our token for the HP interceptors,

41
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,840
and then we register our auth interceptor service

42
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,623
as an HP interceptor,

43
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,210
and finally the multi-true informs Angular

44
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,840
the HP interceptors is a token for an injection

45
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,723
of an array of values.
