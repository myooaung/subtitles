00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:02,143
<v Instructor>In this video,</v>

2
00:00:02,143 --> 00:00:04,393
we'll add support for the credit card.

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:08,110
And so mainly just laying out the controls

4
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:09,293
for the credit card.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,100
Alright, so moving into our checkout component at HTML,

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,750
let's add a little quick comment here

7
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,003
where we're going to place the credit card info.

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,340
So we'll drop it in this section here.

9
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,313
So I'll set up this form group name, credit card.

10
00:00:45,161 --> 00:00:48,263
It's the same group name from our dot TS file.

11
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,010
And now I need to add some controls

12
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,363
in here for credit card.

13
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,660
So I just kind of grabbed some controls

14
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,280
from some of the previous work we did.

15
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,540
So I'll just move up to a billing address,

16
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:19,313
and I'll just grab everything from billing address down to,

17
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,250
let's see here down to street.

18
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,080
And I'll just copy those controls

19
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,410
and I'll moving to credit card and paste those controls.

20
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,260
Alright, so for our credit card,

21
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,683
we'll update this piece to credit card.

22
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,160
The drop down item here

23
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,320
will actually be the credit card type,

24
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,410
some say card type

25
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,530
and update the form control name, card type.

26
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,500
Again, this matches with the actual code

27
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,163
from our dot TS file.

28
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,020
And then for options, our store

29
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,650
will only support two credit cards.

30
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,860
So we'll support Visa and MasterCard.

31
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,060
We'll put that in there.

32
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,150
And then also, if you're worried about credit cards

33
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,510
and security and TLS SSL,

34
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,580
we'll cover those features in the future

35
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,810
So don't worry gotcha covered,

36
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,440
at the moment here we're just covering

37
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,940
form layout out, but we'll get to that good stuff.

38
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,563
So name on card,

39
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:38,003
and then form control name, name on card.

40
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,180
So let's just swing over here and okay,

41
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,510
the basics are in place.

42
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,328
So we have our card type, and then name on card.

43
00:02:53,328 --> 00:02:55,178
All right, so this looks good so far.

44
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,310
So now it's just kind of more than same

45
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,363
for those other fields for this card.

46
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,070
So I just grabbed that row here for name on card,

47
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,170
and I'll just copy it.

48
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,313
And just paste it here.

49
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,430
So we have name on card up top,

50
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,303
this one is going to be card number.

51
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,790
And I update the form control name accordingly.

52
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,063
Then just do another paste.

53
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,793
So this will be for security code,

54
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,730
the low three digit code

55
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,680
that you have on the back of your card.

56
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,253
All right, that's good.

57
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,810
Alright, so lets just swing over

58
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,460
and just take a look at what we have in the browser.

59
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,130
All right, name, card number, security code.

60
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,893
Okay, cool, I like it.

61
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,570
Alright, so we have a couple of other things

62
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:12,663
we need to do here for expiration month and year.

63
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,320
So we'll just kind of grab that row for card type.

64
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,870
And just copy that and we'll use that

65
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,133
for our month and year.

66
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,430
So we just paste,

67
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,343
so we'll call this expiration month.

68
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,213
And then I'll just copy this one more time and paste it.

69
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,090
And then we'll have expiration year.

70
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:20,130
All right, so let's swing back into our browser

71
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,423
and check things out.

72
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,470
And just moving down to the bottom.

73
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,300
Okay, looks good, right?

74
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,650
Expiration month and year.

75
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:28,933
All right, I like it.
