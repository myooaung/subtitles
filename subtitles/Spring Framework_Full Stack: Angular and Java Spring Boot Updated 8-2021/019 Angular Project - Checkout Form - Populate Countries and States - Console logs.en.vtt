00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560
<v ->All righty,</v>

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.790
so all of our development work is done.

3
00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.640
I simply want to add some consult.logging here

4
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.970
when the user clicks on the purchase button

5
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.093
on our checkout form.

6
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.070
All righty, so let's swing back into our IDE.

7
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.870
Let's open up checkout component.ts.

8
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.120
I'll just scroll to the top.

9
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.470
Make sure that you're in this checkout component

10
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.303
at the moment.

11
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.940
Then I'll move down here to the on submit button

12
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.390
and I simply want to add some new logging statements here.

13
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.230
I'm going to log out the actual selected country code,

14
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.973
and also the country name.

15
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.323
So I'll do a little simple copy paste here.

16
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.990
And I'll say the shipping address country is,

17
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.680
and so I'll just do a get

18
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.680
on that shipping address form group.value.

19
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.230
Okay, not state name, .country name.

20
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.380
Simply displaying the country on this line.

21
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.170
And then I just did a little copy paste on this line

22
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.260
and so the shipping address state is...

23
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.500
Okay, and so now I can say state.name.

24
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.333
Okay.

25
00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:41.166
Got it.

26
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.273
Excellent.

27
00:01:43.273 --> 00:01:46.050
So right now we do a submit or a purchase,

28
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.763
it'll display the country name and also the state name.

29
00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.350
So I'll just swing back into my app here,

30
00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.590
so for shipping address

31
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.800
I'll choose a country, Turkey,

32
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.043
and I'll choose a state,

33
00:02:07.707 --> 00:02:09.360
and then I'll simply move on down

34
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.253
and choose the purchase button.

35
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.220
And then I can go look at my console log

36
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.040
and we see the shipping address,

37
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.530
country is turkey, and the shipping

38
00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.420
address state is Aksaray.

39
00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.643
All right.

40
00:02:29.643 --> 00:02:30.476
So that part is good

41
00:02:30.476 --> 00:02:31.309
but, oo!

42
00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:33.210
I noticed up top there is a bug

43
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.203
form group name country code TR

44
00:02:38.203 --> 00:02:39.560
group name TR,

45
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.230
but where did the form group name happen?

46
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.063
Hmm?

47
00:02:43.063 --> 00:02:44.272
Weird.

48
00:02:44.272 --> 00:02:45.272
What's up with that?

49
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.870
And that happens in the method down here for get states.

50
00:02:53.444 --> 00:02:54.277
Oh!

51
00:02:54.277 --> 00:02:55.110
Typo!

52
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.943
Gosh.

53
00:02:55.943 --> 00:02:57.920
I forgot the dollar sign so that's why

54
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.230
it was doing form group name in curly braces

55
00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.940
'cause it didn't know it was anything special.

56
00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.110
Ah!

57
00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.334
Okay, great.

58
00:03:04.334 --> 00:03:06.000
Let's save that,

59
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.820
go back over to our app

60
00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.473
and just test this one more time.

61
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.843
So country of India,

62
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.220
okay good, good, good.

63
00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.060
So, we're in good standings here.

64
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.620
That issue's been resolved

65
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.450
and we're A-OK.

66
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.283
Good job.
