00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:02.500
<v Instructor>Alrighty, so what we're going to do now</v>

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.200
is take a quick tour of the HTML file,

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.010
look at the actual HTML source code for the template,

4
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.780
just so we can get a little bit familiar

5
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.833
with how the file is created or constructed.

6
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.670
So let's go ahead and open up the home.html

7
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:19.863
in a text editor.

8
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.060
So we know here at the head section,

9
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.060
they have a reference to CSS frameworks

10
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.293
like Bootstrap and Fontawesome.

11
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.490
They're loading them from the web.

12
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.530
We'll change text and load them using NPM.

13
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.080
And just in case you're not aware of Fontawesome,

14
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.440
it's a collection of glyph icons.

15
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.800
We are using it for the shopping cart icon

16
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.280
in our application and we may use more icons in the future

17
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.893
depending on our requirements.

18
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.670
And then also, here is a reference here

19
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.230
to our local custom CSS styles

20
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.843
specific for our given application.

21
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.030
And then we also have a reference to our fav icon.

22
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.410
The fav icon's a little logo that shows up

23
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.690
on the browser tab.

24
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.100
So we'll have our own custom fav icon

25
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.283
for this Luv2Shop application.

26
00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.350
So then moving down a bit, we can see the menu side bar.

27
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.000
So it simply has our logo image and then it has a list

28
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.970
of categories, books, coffee mugs, mouse pads,

29
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.523
and luggage tags.

30
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.530
And then moving down a bit we're in our page container.

31
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.680
We see the header desk top.

32
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.020
That's the little search form we have at the top

33
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.410
of the application along with the search button.

34
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.520
And then in the far right, we have the shopping cart area.

35
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.670
And notice here, we're making use of fa shopping cart,

36
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.810
that's the Fontawesome shopping cart, that's the glyph icon

37
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.883
for that given shopping cart.

38
00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.550
Alrighty, so moving down here to our main content section.

39
00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.350
This is where we actually have our list of products

40
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.433
in that grid.

41
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.750
So we set up our divs, and these are a lot

42
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.300
of Bootstrap styles here,

43
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.643
so the main content where we display each product.

44
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.940
So we have the actual product name, description, price,

45
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.763
a link to add to cart.

46
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.610
And we kind of just repeat the process

47
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.310
and also if you click on the actual product image,

48
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.800
it lets you go to the product details page.

49
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.050
All right so just kind of more of the same.

50
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.850
It's a template, so it's just a lot of copy paste there.

51
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.570
Then near the bottom, we have the pagination controls.

52
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.690
So if our database has a large number of products,

53
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.313
we'd like to be able to show that data in different pages.

54
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.260
And then moving down a little bit farther,

55
00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.480
we end the page container,

56
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.220
then we have our footer section.

57
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.080
So that's what you see at the bottom of the web page,

58
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.570
just links to About Us, Contact Us, Help,

59
00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:58.403
so on and so forth.

60
00:02:58.403 --> 00:03:00.333
Just very basic stuff there.

61
00:03:03.098 --> 00:03:04.710
All right, so that's kind of the basics here

62
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.280
on the actual home.html template file.

63
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.580
In the following videos, we'll learn

64
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.190
how to take this information and integrate it

65
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.993
into our angular application.
