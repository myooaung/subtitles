<v Instructor>In this video, we're going to take a look</v>

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.933
at the behind-the-scenes action with Angular.

3
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.910
Now, when we run the Angular application,

4
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.067
you've probably wondered, "Well, how is it loaded?

5
00:00:13.067 --> 00:00:15.137
"I mean, what happens in the background?"

6
00:00:15.137 --> 00:00:16.677
"How does it get started?"

7
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.740
So when the Angular app is first loaded,

8
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.440
it starts with the index.html file,

9
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.887
and then you see this tag here,

10
00:00:25.887 --> 00:00:27.797
&lt;app-root&gt;. Now you're probably thinking,

11
00:00:27.797 --> 00:00:31.790
"Well, that's not a normal HTML tag," and that's fine.

12
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.270
This is really a custom tag that's used by

13
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.460
Angular and what'll happen is that it'll actually

14
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.940
replace this tag or selector with the

15
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.980
template of the given component.

16
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.450
And you can kind of think of this as like an include.

17
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.403
So it's going to include some content at this given location.

18
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:50.387
So then you're probably wondering,

19
00:00:50.387 --> 00:00:52.360
"Well where's the &lt;app-root&gt; defined?"

20
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.250
Well, it's defined in a component.

21
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.130
So note here we have this file

22
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.150
and we have an @ component.

23
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.130
So in the Angular world this is called a decorator,

24
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.310
it's very similar to an annotation in the Java world.

25
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.090
So we have @ component and then one of the attributes

26
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.610
for this @ component is selector.

27
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.120
So that's the actual name of that tag

28
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.160
or custom tag that Angular recognizes.

29
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.840
And you could give any name here

30
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.390
as long as you're consistent between the two files.

31
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.783
So this selector app-root, then what content will it use?

32
00:01:26.783 --> 00:01:28.550
Well it will actually use the content here

33
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.650
at this template URL so this template URL

34
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.550
points to a file app.component.html

35
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.470
so that's the content that it's going to include

36
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.223
at that given location.

37
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.860
And then also notice we have a double curly brace

38
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.700
with a given property, so basically here

39
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.970
it's actually going to read this property

40
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.830
from the typescript class or from that related component

41
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.763
and include it here as rendered output.

42
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.700
So when you see this page in a web browser

43
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.340
then it's going to say my first angler project app

44
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.360
is running, yes, yes, success.

45
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.010
Based on what we have here in the component.html

46
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.560
and also the property that it reads

47
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.323
from the actual component class.

48
00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.970
So this is kind of the big picture here

49
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.170
on how things work together.

50
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.650
Now there's a lot of other moving parts in the background

51
00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.690
but this is just a high level of how this process works.

52
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.000
All righty, so in the next video

53
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.460
we'll actually move into our source code

54
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.310
and we'll explore this a bit further.
