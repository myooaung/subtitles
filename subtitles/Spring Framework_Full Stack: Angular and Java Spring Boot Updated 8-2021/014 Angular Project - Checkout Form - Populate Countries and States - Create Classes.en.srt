1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,410
<v Instructor>Alrighty, so let's get started</v>

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,120
with our development process.

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,230
In this video we're going to cover step one and two

4
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:08,990
of creating the TypeScript classes for country and state,

5
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:10,410
and also adding methods

6
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,063
to the form service for countries and states.

7
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,610
Alrighty, swinging into our IDE here.

8
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:22,600
Let's go ahead and open up a new terminal window.

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,870
And we'll move into the appropriate directory

10
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:26,863
for our project.

11
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,250
And I'll make use of the ng generate command

12
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,433
to create those classes for me.

13
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,810
So I generate the country class,

14
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,670
and then I do a similar command here

15
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,653
for generating the state class.

16
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:53,540
Okay, this is great,

17
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,040
so I can swing back a bit,

18
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,400
look into my source, app, common directory

19
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,910
and I should see country.ts and state.ts.

20
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,710
Okay, great, so that was successful.

21
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,300
I'll do a quick clean up here on this terminal window,

22
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:12,980
so I can have some space, some room to work with.

23
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:16,020
Zoom in here on my country class,

24
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,530
and I'll create three fields here.

25
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:20,803
I'll have the id, the code and the name.

26
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:30,960
Alrighty, that looks good.

27
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,410
Let's do a similar thing here for the state class.

28
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:38,623
So, I'll zoom in here.

29
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,913
And I'll have the state id and the state name.

30
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:49,880
Alrighty, so that's great, I like that.

31
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,430
Now let's go ahead and move to step two

32
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,370
of adding methods to the form service

33
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,873
for countries and states.

34
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,400
So, I'll swing down here to my service

35
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,803
for our luv2-shop-form service.

36
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:12,090
And so, I'll start off by simply setting up

37
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,590
the country's URL,

38
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,663
and also the states' URL.

39
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,460
So that's the country's URL.

40
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,713
I'll do a quick, little, copy paste on this,

41
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,823
and then I'll just update for states URL.

42
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,633
And that's /api/states.

43
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,010
And then I'll inject the http client,

44
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,460
because I know I'll need to make some rest calls.

45
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,940
Alrighty, so that looks pretty good so far.

46
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,730
Make sure my imports are correct up top

47
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,593
for the import on that client.

48
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:09,883
Okay, great.

49
00:03:09,883 --> 00:03:12,000
So, we're in good shape with this coding so far.
