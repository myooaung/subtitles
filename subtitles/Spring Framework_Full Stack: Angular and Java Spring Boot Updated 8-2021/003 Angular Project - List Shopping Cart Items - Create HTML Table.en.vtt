00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.020
<v Instructor>In this video, I'm going to make a</v>

2
00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.010
Quick Digression.

3
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.763
I'll go through the code of creating the basic HTML table.

4
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.490
So at this point, we have cart-details works!

5
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.140
But lets go ahead and just kinds stub out

6
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.323
the basic HTML table for our shopping cart.

7
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.033
So I'll swing back into Visual Studio Code.

8
00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.020
And I'll make some mods here

9
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.943
in this cart-details component.html file.

10
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.243
So I'll set up two div's here for the section and container.

11
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.070
And then for the real work in setting up our table...

12
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.380
I'll set up the CSS styles here

13
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.113
for table and table bordered.

14
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.670
I'll create a table row

15
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.400
and this will basically have a collection

16
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.583
of our table headers.

17
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.820
So we'll have a header here for product image,

18
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.550
and then I'll just copy this line,

19
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.543
and paste it x number of times.

20
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.593
So this will be product detail.

21
00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.410
And then the last one there is no header.

22
00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.133
We'll just kind of leave it blank.

23
00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.780
All right, so that's pretty good.

24
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.690
Let me swing over to the browser

25
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.653
and just test it out to see what this looks like.

26
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.190
Not what I expected.

27
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.570
(chuckles)

28
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.240
The table should have colors and borders and stuff,

29
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.720
and that's not it.

30
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.580
Okay, so I have typo somewhere.

31
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.280
Lets swing back into the code and see what's going on.

32
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.000
And so it should have something to do

33
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.323
with the CSS styles, and ah!

34
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.270
It should be table-bordered.

35
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.820
So I have an extra, "D," in there.

36
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.160
So table, with no "D," bordered.

37
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.820
Okay, so let me fix that.

38
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.390
Remove that.

39
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.457
Remove the "D."

40
00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.750
Okay, that looks good.

41
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.143
And so now lets save it, and swing back over.

42
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.580
And voila!

43
00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.680
Okay great, so this is exactly what I was looking for.

44
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.610
Okay, good.

45
00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.160
So we have the basic table in place.

46
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.110
There's no real data there,

47
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.200
but at least we have the basic template

48
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.760
of the basic structure set up and ready to go.

49
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.840
So just make sure you fix that one little typo that I had

50
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.900
and from there, you're good to go.

51
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.573
Alrighty, so I'll see ya in the next video.
