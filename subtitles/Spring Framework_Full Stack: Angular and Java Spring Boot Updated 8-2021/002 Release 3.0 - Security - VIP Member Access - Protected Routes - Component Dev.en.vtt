00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:02.440
<v Instructor>Okay, so let's get started</v>

2
00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:03.840
with our development process.

3
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.110
In this video will cover steps one and two.

4
00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:07.920
Generate the members page component

5
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.713
and also update the template text in the HTML page.

6
00:00:22.406 --> 00:00:23.460
All right, so the first thing we'll do here

7
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.850
is open up a new terminal window

8
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.200
and generate our component.

9
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.370
And I make use of the angular CLI,

10
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.653
the NG generate component,

11
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.623
components/members page.

12
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.440
All right we can swing over here

13
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.090
and take a look at the new files that were generated.

14
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.750
So under our components we have this member page

15
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.330
and the appropriate files.

16
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.163
Alrighty.

17
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:06.610
And over here in the terminal window

18
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.083
I can go ahead and exit out of this window.

19
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.450
All right, so step two we need to update the template text

20
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.203
in the HTML page.

21
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.643
So I'll open up this member's page component at HTML.

22
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.520
And now I'll simply write the HTML here

23
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.213
for this member's special page.

24
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.913
And now we'll simply

25
00:02:06.913 --> 00:02:09.120
just give the text here members special.

26
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.720
Thank you for being a member

27
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.520
and member discounts are coming soon

28
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.240
Okay, so that takes care of all the work here

29
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.723
for the component in the HTML page.

30
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.753
There's also a members page component.ts.

31
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.670
We're not going to do anything in this file.

32
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.073
We'll simply leave this file as is.
