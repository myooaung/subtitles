00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:03.420
<v Instructor>Alrighty, so we're making good progress here.</v>

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.063
In this video we'll cover the order details.

3
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.330
So let's go ahead and swing into our checkoutcomponent.ts.

4
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.200
And we're going to add two new properties,

5
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.173
one of for the total price and also for total quantity.

6
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.090
Let's go ahead and swing into our HTML page

7
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.633
so we can reference these new properties.

8
00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.060
And I'll do a slight cleanup there on that div

9
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.660
just to tighten it up a bit.

10
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.653
And I'll add my new work here right above the submit button.

11
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.060
So I'll just add a comment here for order details

12
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.260
and this is where we'll add the HTML

13
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.503
for this given section for reviewing our order.

14
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.580
So I have the h3 here for review your order

15
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.510
and now I'll just add in some paragraph items here

16
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.570
for a total quantity, shipping, and total price

17
00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.170
and I'll also references those properties

18
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.563
that I just created.

19
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.813
So in this case here, total quantity.

20
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.283
And then the last entry here for total price.

21
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.050
Alrighty, so let's go ahead and swing over

22
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.000
into our browser and take a look at it.

23
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.150
So right below credit card there's our new section here,

24
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.200
review your order, quantity, shipping, and price!

25
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.863
Looks good, I like it!
