1
00:00:01,171 --> 00:00:02,760
<v ->Alrighty, so let's move in here.</v>

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,990
So one update I'd like to make to the application,

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:08,380
is I'd like to display a list of products in an HTML table.

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,110
We have the basic functionality in place,

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,890
so let's go ahead and spruce it up a bit

6
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,133
and make it look pretty.

7
00:00:20,471 --> 00:00:21,910
So, I'll swing over to my file system

8
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,090
and do a copy paste on our .html file.

9
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,903
So I copy the product-list-component.html.

10
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:29,150
And I simply paste it.

11
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,480
So here's the new version here.

12
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,000
Copy and I'll rename it and it give it a better name.

13
00:00:40,614 --> 00:00:44,364
So we'll call it product-list-table.component

14
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:47,970
and I get rid of the copy stuff.

15
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,133
Alrighty, that looks good.

16
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,310
Let's go ahead and open up

17
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,803
our type script file, our ts file.

18
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,650
Let me zoom out here, for a bit.

19
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:05,750
And in our type script file, in our component,

20
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,080
We need to change the actual template

21
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,380
that we're going to use.

22
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,830
So in line seven, I'll just do a copy paste here.

23
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,850
I'll comment out our original version.

24
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:19,780
I'll update line seven

25
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,630
to say product-list-table.component.html

26
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:28,490
So let's go ahead an move into our

27
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:31,380
product-list-table.component.html.

28
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,580
We currently have the paragraph code here.

29
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,770
Let's just go ahead and move that to the bottom.

30
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,570
And then up top we'll add our table

31
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,320
and we'll borrow some of that code.

32
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,950
So I set up the table.

33
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,940
Then I set up my thead.

34
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,683
Then my table rows, with th's.

35
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,740
So for the actual headers here for these columns,

36
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:16,073
I'll have Name, Price and Units in Stock.

37
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,243
And then I'll some coding here for the table body.

38
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,123
So again table row.

39
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,820
And I'm going to just copy some of this ngFor stuff

40
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,310
and I'll put it here for the table row.

41
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,750
Cause this is all the same code, right?

42
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,370
We're just using a different layout thing.

43
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,993
And then I'll add some table data here.

44
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:48,123
I'll just grab the tempProduct.name.

45
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,203
Paste it up here.

46
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,743
And then I'll just copy paste line 13 x number of times.

47
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,883
And then drop in the price.

48
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,773
And I need to do one more td for the Unit's in Stock.

49
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,300
This is .unitsInStock.

50
00:03:26,377 --> 00:03:27,210
Alright.

51
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,060
So that looks pretty good.

52
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,403
And I can get rid of all the paragraph stuff at the bottom.

53
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,680
Alright, so that's the basic layout for our table.

54
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,060
For looping over our products

55
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,140
and putting them in a nice table format.

56
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:42,973
Pretty good.

57
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,010
I'm going to swing over to my browser and boom!

58
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:52,843
Success!

59
00:03:52,843 --> 00:03:53,750
This looks great.

60
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,810
So we have our table layout with our products.

61
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:57,643
Good job.

62
00:03:59,424 --> 00:04:01,250
I want to make one small little modification

63
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,100
here on the thead.

64
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,243
Add some of those bootstrap styles.

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,483
Put in the thead-dark.

66
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,540
Swing back over and there we go.

67
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,500
Okay that looks great.

68
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,333
I like it.

69
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,313
So this is looking really good, so far.
