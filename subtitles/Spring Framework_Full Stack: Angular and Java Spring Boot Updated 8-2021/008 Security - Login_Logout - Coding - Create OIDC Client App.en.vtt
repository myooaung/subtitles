00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:02.700
<v Instructor>Alrighty, so let's go ahead and move in</v>

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.870
and get started with our development process.

3
00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:05.703
In this video,

4
00:00:05.703 --> 00:00:07.240
we'll cover steps one and two of creating

5
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.500
the free developer account at Okta,

6
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.013
and also adding an OpenID Connect client app in Okta.

7
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.370
All right, it's just swinging into my browser,

8
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.220
and I'll go ahead and create this free developer account.

9
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.163
I'll simply go to developer.okta.com.

10
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.200
Okay, so this is the very basic form.

11
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.150
Just go ahead and fill it out

12
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.130
with the appropriate information.

13
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.780
There is no credit card required.

14
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.080
So once you submit the form,

15
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.670
just check your email to verify the account.

16
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:47.503
And then from there,

17
00:00:47.503 --> 00:00:50.570
you can actually log into your Okta developer dashboard.

18
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.050
So you can go ahead and pause the video here

19
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.703
for a second while you get all that taken care of.

20
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.820
Alrighty, so once you have your account verified,

21
00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.190
you'll see a page similar to this.

22
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.930
This is kind of like the Okta home screen.

23
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.580
Go ahead and click on the link here for applications,

24
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.743
and then we'll go down and we'll add an application.

25
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.100
And so for this application screen here,

26
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.150
we'll choose a single page application

27
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.360
for like one of the modern JavaScript front ends

28
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.970
like Angular, React, or whatever.

29
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.250
So here we're using Angular, which is cool.

30
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.100
And then we'll go ahead and hit next.

31
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.300
And so now for application,

32
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.370
we need to go ahead and add

33
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.410
some configurations for our application.

34
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.143
So for name, you can give it any name that you want.

35
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.060
And then for base here, all right,

36
00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.370
that's the actual reference

37
00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.180
to how to access our Angular application,

38
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.080
so now that our Angular app is running on localhost 4,200.

39
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.350
For the login redirect UI,

40
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.240
so we'll have localhost 4,200,

41
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.393
and then we'll have login/callback.

42
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.870
And basically this is the link they'll use

43
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.990
once the user logs in successfully to our application,

44
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.470
then they'll call back to this given endpoint.

45
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.870
And I'll show you more details on that in a bit.

46
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.660
And as far as our logout redirect URI,

47
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.470
we'll simply go to localhost 4,200.

48
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.160
Just basically once they log out,

49
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.183
we just send them back to the homepage of our application.

50
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.360
And for grant type allowed,

51
00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.890
be sure you have it set up for authorization code,

52
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.143
because we're going to use PKCE, Proof Key for Code Exchange.

53
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.413
And then just go ahead and click on the done button.

54
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.540
Alrighty, so our application is created.

55
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.290
It has some good information here

56
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.920
that we need to be aware of.

57
00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.580
One is the client credentials, our client ID.

58
00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.860
So that's information that we'll use a little bit later.

59
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:16.990
We can see that it's making use

60
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.883
of the PKCE, Proof Key for Code Exchange, which is good.

61
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.180
And then also for general settings,

62
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.880
we see our actual Okta domain.

63
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.500
So we'll use this information in some of the upcoming videos

64
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.083
for setting up our client application.

65
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.670
And then the nice thing about this Okta screen here

66
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.060
is that if you have any questions

67
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.980
about any of these different items,

68
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.990
they have a little question mark icon,

69
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.390
you can simply click on that to get more details.

70
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.850
You can also check the online help for additional details.

71
00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.650
Alrighty, so this looks good so far.
