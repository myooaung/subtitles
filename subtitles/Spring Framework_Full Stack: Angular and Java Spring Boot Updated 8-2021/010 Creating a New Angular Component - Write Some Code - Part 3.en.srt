1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,850
<v Instructor>All right, so we're almost done.</v>

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,290
So we're at our final step of our development process,

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:06,663
step number 7.

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:12,950
So in step 7, we basically need to build

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,593
the HTML table using this data.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,890
So the one thing I'll do is go ahead

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,330
and start up my server so I can kind of monitor my progress

8
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,480
as I'm going through with this development.

9
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,113
And I can swing to my browser real quick.

10
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,190
Right now it says sales person works

11
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,510
but that's the default stuff that was generated.

12
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,453
I need to add my own special information here.

13
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,030
So I'll move back into the IDE

14
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,920
and I'll actually open up this file

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,353
sales-person-list-component.html.

16
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,350
And so that's what we saw in the previous screen.

17
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,780
I'll make some updates here in this page.

18
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,203
So I'll do just a quick test.

19
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,430
And what I'll do is I'll actually just print out information

20
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:17,430
for that first array element, just as a really quick test.

21
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:24,210
So I'll say SalesPersonList[0].firstName.

22
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:30,040
So again, we're accessing the property from that component

23
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,530
and then I'll do a copy/paste on this

24
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,463
and I'll also do a similar thing here for last name.

25
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,540
So that first person that's in our array

26
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,250
I'll do display their first name and their last name.

27
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:49,530
So let me save this and let me swing back over to my browser

28
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,833
and let's see what we have here.

29
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,870
And oh wow, this looks great, Anup Kumar.

30
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,370
Okay, zoom in a bit.

31
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,540
So that's Anup Kumar, so that's the first person

32
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,580
in our array that we created.

33
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:08,280
So all right, the basics is working out pretty good.

34
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,870
And let's just verify this in our, yep, SalesPerson array,

35
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,470
yep Anup Kumar, cool.

36
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,590
All right, so I really can access that property,

37
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,730
I can access that array in my page.

38
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,320
All right, I feel good now.

39
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,010
So here I simply need to go through and do my HTML work

40
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,280
or my HTML table work.

41
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,260
So let me just get rid of all this stuff

42
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,053
and let's go ahead and setup our HTML table.

43
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,040
I'll setup the head section here

44
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,110
and I'll define the columns for first name,

45
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,883
last name, email and sales volume.

46
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,050
And I'll kind of do a copy/paste here,

47
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,710
first name, paste it x number of times

48
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,653
and just update the column names.

49
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,880
Alrighty, so those column names or headers are in place.

50
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,910
That's pretty good.

51
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,100
I can actually swing over to my browser real quick

52
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,743
and do a quick peak to kind of see where I'm at.

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,190
And okay cool, there's our table.

54
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:24,070
No data, but at least we have the headers in place

55
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,913
which is fine.

56
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,653
Now let's go ahead and add our body.

57
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,490
So let's go ahead and setup our tr

58
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,240
and then we'll make use of that *ngFor

59
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,840
and here I'll let tempSalesPerson of salesPersonList

60
00:03:57,726 --> 00:04:00,820
and the salesPersonList matches with the property name

61
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,743
that's defined in this component.

62
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,733
And then I'll setup table data.

63
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,020
I'll give tempSalesPerson.firstName.

64
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,050
And then I'll save this and again

65
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,690
let me kind of do a quick peak over at my browser

66
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:22,993
just to see where I'm at.

67
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,820
And this is great, so I'm getting the first name

68
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,150
of each one of those sales persons.

69
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,390
I still have more work to do

70
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,540
but at least I know that I'm actually looping

71
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,120
through the array and accessing the data.

72
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,063
So now, everything else is just more of the same.

73
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:47,080
So I simply grab that line and just copy/paste it

74
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,493
and then simply do an update.

75
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,680
Save that and now when I swing back over,

76
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,393
oh yeah, success!

77
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,720
So now I'm looping through that array,

78
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,100
getting information about each sales person

79
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,083
and using that to populate the given table.

80
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,980
Alrighty, I'm pretty excited about this.

81
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,550
So we went through the full development process.

82
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:25,920
We created our own custom Angular component

83
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,730
and then we were able to populate our template

84
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:33,200
with data from that component and create an HTML table.

85
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,203
This is awesome, good job.
