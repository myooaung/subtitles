00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.610
<v Facilitator>In this video, we'll cover the shopping cart</v>

2
00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.353
with incrementing the item quantity.

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.640
So we'll have some new buttons here

4
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.500
to increment and decrement the item quantity,

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.850
and this video will focus on adding the code for increment.

6
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.193
We'll cover decrement in some of the upcoming videos.

7
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.120
So here's our development process.

8
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.760
We're going to modify the CartDetailsComponent HTML template.

9
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.310
We'll add the increment button.

10
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.790
We'll also add a click handler

11
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.233
for the increment button on the HTML template.

12
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.820
And then we'll also update our CartDetailsComponent

13
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.533
with the click handler method.

14
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.320
Okay, step one of modifying

15
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.310
the CartDetailsComponent HTML template.

16
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.050
So we'll add this new button,

17
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.830
and then we'll setup this class.

18
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.100
We'll make use of fa-plus,

19
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.463
that's the Font Awesome Plus icon.

20
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.170
And then we'll also have code for the On Click event,

21
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.630
we'll call the method incrementQuantity,

22
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.380
and we'll pass in the tempCartItem.

23
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.367
All right, step two of updating the CartDetailsComponent

24
00:01:10.367 --> 00:01:11.480
with the click handler method.

25
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.880
So in our CartDetailsComponent.ts,

26
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.800
we'll have this method incrementQuantity.

27
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.450
They pass in the theCartItem,

28
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.920
and we simply delegate this call

29
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.920
to this.cartService.addToCart, and pass in theCartItem.

30
00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.460
And that's basically it for the coding for increment.

31
00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.320
Okay, so let's go ahead and swing into our IDE

32
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.763
and let's write the code.
