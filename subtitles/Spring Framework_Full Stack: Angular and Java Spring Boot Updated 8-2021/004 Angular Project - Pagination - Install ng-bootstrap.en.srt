1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:02,800
<v Instructor>All righty, let's go ahead and get started</v>

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,450
with our development process.

3
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:05,470
So the first thing that we'll do

4
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,833
is we'll install ng-bootstrap.

5
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,400
And actually I want to make a small digression here.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,170
I want to check my REST API Endpoints for Pagination,

7
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,650
just to make sure they're up and running

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,080
and just to make sure that they're giving me

9
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,403
the appropriate Response Metadata.

10
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,200
All righty, so let's go and swing into IntelliJ,

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,500
let's go ahead and run our Spring Boot application

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,900
if it's not already running.

13
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,570
All righty, so our app is up and running.

14
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,410
Let's go ahead and open up a browser

15
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,480
and let's access the endpoint here,

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,160
Local host 80 80, API products and then we make use

17
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,560
of those Pagination Parameters for a page and size.

18
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,773
So here I'll start with page equal zero size equals 10.

19
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,730
Okay great, so we're getting our products back

20
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:09,690
from our REST API, That looks pretty good.

21
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:10,820
And if we move to the bottom,

22
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,290
we'll see the Response Metadata for Pagination.

23
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,340
So we have page, size, total elements,

24
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,830
total pages and number.

25
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,480
And then I can change the actual size here

26
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,150
so instead of size equals 10, we'll say size equals 500

27
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,280
so just a really large number here.

28
00:01:33,762 --> 00:01:35,880
And again, we get our products and then scrolling

29
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,523
down to the bottom we can see the Response Metadata.

30
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:44,280
And so here, size of 500 total elements is 100

31
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,200
so there's only one page

32
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,260
and we're currently looking at page zero.

33
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,070
All right, so just the basic idea

34
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,700
of accessing those REST API Endpoints

35
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,893
and seeing those Pagination Response Metadata inaction.

36
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,080
All right, so let's go ahead and swing

37
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,543
over to Visual Studio Code so we can start

38
00:02:04,543 --> 00:02:06,523
with some Angular development.

39
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,530
And so this is kind of the step one here

40
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,223
of installing ng-bootstrap.

41
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,260
And to do this work we'll open up a new terminal window,

42
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,783
and let me expand this window and zoom in a bit.

43
00:02:29,845 --> 00:02:30,980
And so the first thing I'll do

44
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,800
is I'll install the Angular localize,

45
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,963
a new feature required for Angular 9 and a higher.

46
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,980
All right, so that looks good.

47
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,113
Now go through and actually install ng-bootstrap.

48
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,820
All righty, so we have ng-bootstrap installed

49
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,593
I'll close off my terminal window,

50
00:03:21,966 --> 00:03:23,800
and now I'll make this one other modification

51
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,800
of updating my app module ts to do import on the Ngb module.

52
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,470
Let me expand this window here for a second,

53
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,720
so I'll just make an entry here in the import section

54
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,673
and I'll do an import here for Ngb module.

55
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:13,950
Alrighty. So let me copy this strain Ngb module

56
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,130
and let's move down to our import section and paste it.

57
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,360
So by placing this in the import section,

58
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,760
it makes the export declarations

59
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,750
of the Ngb module available in the current module.

60
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,750
And so that's why you have to place it here for the imports.

61
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,340
All right, I'll just kind of scroll up to the top just

62
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,630
to make sure everything looks okay.

63
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:36,143
So we have the ng-bootstrap there Okay, that's fine.

64
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,230
And then scrolling down to my ng-module,

65
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:45,730
making sure that I have Ngb module for ng-bootstrap.

66
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:48,523
All right, so this looks pretty good, good job so far.
