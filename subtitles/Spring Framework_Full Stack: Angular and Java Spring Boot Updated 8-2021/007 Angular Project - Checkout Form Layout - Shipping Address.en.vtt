00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.940
<v ->We have the basic form in place.</v>

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.370
So now we simply need to repeat the process

3
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.970
for our other elements like shipping address.

4
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.243
So I'll cover shipping address in this video.

5
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.083
So let's move into our checkout.component.ts file,

6
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.563
and we'll add the fields for shipping address,

7
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.520
and so we'll say shipping address this.forBuilder.group

8
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.540
And then we'll have fields here for shipping address,

9
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.583
so we'll have street, city, state, country, zip code.

10
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.040
And these could actually be in any order.

11
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.583
We'll actually handle the layout in the actual HTML page.

12
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.030
And then I'll do a similar thing here for a billing address.

13
00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.420
So I'll just do a little copy paste on shipping address.

14
00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.783
And I'll actually paste it two times.

15
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.780
Right, so we copied shipping address

16
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.890
and pasted it twice,

17
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.690
so you should see three entries here.

18
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.573
The second entry will change to billing address.

19
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.140
And then the third entry here

20
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.473
will be for credit card information.

21
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.450
And for a credit card we need to change

22
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.530
the actual properties here.

23
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.930
So we'll have a card type,

24
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.550
we'll have name, card number, security code,

25
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.460
expiration month and year.

26
00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.530
So it's credit card, billing address,

27
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.563
shipping address and customer.

28
00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.423
So let's move over to our HTML page.

29
00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.780
Checkout.component.html

30
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.040
We're going to do a little copy paste.

31
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.473
So basically grab this,

32
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.700
customer form group section,

33
00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.940
so everything starting at Line 8

34
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.453
and we're going to select all the way down,

35
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.283
to the div right above the submit button.

36
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.143
And then let's copy that.

37
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:03.910
And then we'll move down here,

38
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.810
and this will be for shipping address.

39
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:14.883
And we'll paste that information.

40
00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.420
And then we'll scroll up or make the update here

41
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.630
for the actual names.

42
00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.370
So form group name instead of customer,

43
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.913
form group name is shipping address.

44
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.560
And it has to match with the actual property

45
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.053
or configuration that we set up in our .ts file.

46
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.570
And I'll make some modifications here,

47
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.363
so for the shipping address,

48
00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.593
instead of first name I'll have it as country.

49
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.103
And then here we'll have a drop down list for country.

50
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.553
So I select item.

51
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.203
And the form control name,

52
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:16.603
is country.

53
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.850
Again matching with our .ts file.

54
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.700
And for right now I put the country as "to do".

55
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.220
We'll come back in some later videos

56
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.040
and we'll add all the countries

57
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.560
accordingly for analysis,

58
00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.863
kind of get the form layout set up.

59
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.063
So this will be street.

60
00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.810
And then we'll have city.

61
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.960
And then for state, it's going to be a drop down,

62
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.010
so let's just kind of copy the country section

63
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.480
and we'll use that for a state also.

64
00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.770
So just moving up to this section

65
00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:20.880
where I have country,

66
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.713
just kind of copy this row.

67
00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.040
And then I'll just move down right after a city

68
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.403
and I'll paste it in.

69
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.380
Make sure you keep all your divs lined up just right,

70
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.330
just to kind of help you out with knowing where things

71
00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:40.310
are located.

72
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.143
So there's state and then form controls state.

73
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.400
And then the one final item we have is zip code,

74
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.660
so that's just a plain text item,

75
00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.920
so we'll grab the city info.

76
00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.570
And we'll copy that and paste it.

77
00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.223
Right here after state.

78
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.240
And I'm change this to zip code.

79
00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.240
Alrighty, so that's all of the coding there

80
00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.123
for shipping address.

81
00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:35.220
So let's swing over to our browser and see how things look.

82
00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.510
So we have customer,

83
00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:38.000
that's cool

84
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:38.833
and scrolling down

85
00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:40.140
and shipping address.

86
00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:41.220
Alright.

87
00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:42.053
Looks pretty good.

88
00:07:42.053 --> 00:07:42.886
I like it so far,

89
00:07:42.886 --> 00:07:45.890
so at least the layout stuff is working out for us.

90
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:48.030
We'll get into all the population stuff in a bit,

91
00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:49.500
but just right now.

92
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.703
Getting things laid out properly.
