00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:02,260
<v Instructor>Alrighty, so moving ahead</v>

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:03,760
with our development process.

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,223
In this video we're going to focus on step 6.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,300
Alrighty, so step 6 in our SalesPersonListComponent

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,453
we're going to create some sample data.

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,040
Okay, so let's go ahead and open up the file

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,633
sales-person-list-component.ts.

8
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,883
And then let me expand the window here for a second.

9
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:31,400
And now basically what I'll do in this file

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,880
is that I'll create an array of objects.

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,943
I'll create an array of those SalesPerson objects.

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,473
So I'll define this property here, salesPersonList.

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,053
It's going to be an array of SalesPerson objects.

14
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,223
Take care of the quick fix here to import that SalesPerson.

15
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,700
And so inside of this array,

16
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,203
I'll just create x number SalesPerson objects.

17
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,483
So I'll start off, I'll create one for Anup Kumar.

18
00:01:32,821 --> 00:01:36,738
Then I'll do a similar thing here for John Doe.

19
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,743
Claire Murphy.

20
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:06,013
And Mai Truong.

21
00:02:28,997 --> 00:02:30,580
Alrighty, so that looks pretty good.

22
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,973
So that's my array of objects, my SalesPerson objects.
