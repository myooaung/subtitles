00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.320
<v ->Okay so let's go ahead and test this out.</v>

2
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.190
The first thing we need to do, again, is a checkpoint,

3
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.940
make sure our springboot application is up and running.

4
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.980
And then we'll move into visual studio code,

5
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.943
open up a new terminal window and run a angular application.

6
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.393
All right we are into our browser.

7
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.203
And add some items to the cart.

8
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.230
So let's move over to our cart.

9
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.780
All right this looks great we have a quantity of 3.

10
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.370
Let's go ahead and just do a quick

11
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.730
increment and a decrement.

12
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.120
Okay great. Nice.

13
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.900
So decrement is working as desired.

14
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.520
And let's go all the way down to 0.

15
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.410
Our cart is empty,

16
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.110
so I was actually removing something from the cart

17
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.040
when the quantity makes it to 0.

18
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.183
So this is working out as desired. I like it.

19
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.070
With step 4, we on something on a repeat the process

20
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.683
for the remove button.

21
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.415
Okay let's go ahead and move our

22
00:01:27.415 --> 00:01:29.015
cart details components at HTML.

23
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.850
And let's scroll down a bit.

24
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.543
So what we will do here we will add a new button for remove.

25
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.300
And we will add this button right above

26
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.293
the line for subtotal.

27
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.730
And now let's just swing back into our application

28
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.853
and just test it out a far as the layout.

29
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.690
Add something to the cart and great.

30
00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.540
So there is our remove button, so that looks good so far.

31
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.350
Now let's swing back to our code

32
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.473
and we will add the click handler.

33
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.663
So for on click we can't remove and we give temp cart item.

34
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.353
Stand a drill we simply copy that method name,

35
00:02:50.353 --> 00:02:53.623
we move over to our cart detail component.cs.

36
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.843
We write the code here for the remove method.

37
00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.703
And then we simply call this .cartservice .remove.

38
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.270
And we wrote all of that code earlier.

39
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.423
So we good to go in that regards.

40
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.623
Now I can swing back into my application,

41
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.580
and we will add some items into the cart.

42
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.940
Now looking at our cart we see that items there.

43
00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.330
Let's just increment a couple of times,

44
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.280
and now let's hit remove.

45
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.190
And now that entire cart item has been removed.

46
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.870
Now we can do a similar thing

47
00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.540
for the other cart item remove.

48
00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.840
And now the cart is empty.

49
00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:59.643
Okay great.

50
00:03:59.643 --> 00:04:01.100
We have covered all the big things here

51
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.010
for the shopping cart.

52
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.690
So we have increment, decrement and also remove.

53
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.623
So I like to say good job my friend.
