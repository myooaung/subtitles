00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.840
<v Instructor>Alrighty, so now let's go ahead</v>

2
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.400
and set up the entity relationships

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.593
between customer, order, order item and address.

4
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.100
So we can see here that a customer has zero to many orders.

5
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.410
An order can have a shipping address and a billing address.

6
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.003
And also an order has a collection of order items.

7
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.460
So we'll start with order and order items.

8
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.613
So an order has a collection of order items.

9
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.890
So I can move into this order class

10
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.853
and first I'll define a field here for order items.

11
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.873
So just make it a collection, a set.

12
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.133
And then I'll define the relationship here, one to many.

13
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.283
So cascade type of all, and mapped by order.

14
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.710
That's the order field that we'll add

15
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.403
to the order items in the next section.

16
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.270
We'll also add a convenience method here

17
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.563
for adding order items to the given order.

18
00:01:55.651 --> 00:01:56.920
So this is just a convenience method

19
00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.220
we could use it in the future if we needed it.

20
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.800
So, first thing I did is just make sure

21
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.500
that items is not equal to null,

22
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.700
and also check my order items collection.

23
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.153
Make sure that's not null,

24
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.680
if it is I'll go ahead and create a new one.

25
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.993
Now go ahead and add this item to order items.

26
00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.880
And then I'll also do an item dot set order this.

27
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.323
Just so we have the bi-directional relationship set up.

28
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.910
So now item that set order this.

29
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.290
That means in my order item class

30
00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.840
I need to define a reference or a field for order.

31
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.160
Okay, no problem.

32
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.430
Let's move over to order item

33
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.663
and let's define this field or order.

34
00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.220
So the order item has a reference back

35
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.443
to the order that it's associated with.

36
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.363
Alright, so that's in place.

37
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.150
And then something that goes over the order and

38
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.630
strange it's still telling us that we have an issue here

39
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.390
with this set order and Lombok

40
00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.328
should give us a set of method for free,

41
00:03:20.328 --> 00:03:25.000
since we're using the add setter.

42
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.080
Let's look at order item and go to the top add setter.

43
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.030
It's actually okay.

44
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:31.313
That's interesting.

45
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.860
I think I know what's up.

46
00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.214
I forgot to configure this IDEA

47
00:03:39.214 --> 00:03:41.560
IntelliJ for Lombok support.

48
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.240
Okay, that's what's up.

49
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.490
So this is a fresh install of IntelliJ.

50
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:46.490
I need to get it up to speed.

51
00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.693
So let me go into my IntelliJ preferences,

52
00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.543
and I'll move down to the build section.

53
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.540
So that's Build, Execution, Deployment

54
00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.100
and then moved down to the Compiler

55
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.370
and choose annotation processes, because this is required

56
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.860
because Lombok does some special magic annotations

57
00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:16.900
and so forth.

58
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.800
So we simply enable that, but we're not done.

59
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.200
There's one more thing we need to do.

60
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.150
We actually need to install the Lombok plugin.

61
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.193
So let's move over to plugins.

62
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.960
And in the center section here

63
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.960
we just type in Lombok and grab that Lombok entry.

64
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:41.700
And then over here on the right

65
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.643
we click the install button.

66
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.533
So now this should resolve the issue.

67
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.570
So let's swinging back over

68
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.830
to our code and yaaay Lombok is in action.

69
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.330
So it may take a bit for everything to catch up

70
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.230
but eventually here you'll have everything being okay.

71
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.540
So we're good with that.

72
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:16.373
All right.

73
00:05:16.373 --> 00:05:17.206
Good job.
