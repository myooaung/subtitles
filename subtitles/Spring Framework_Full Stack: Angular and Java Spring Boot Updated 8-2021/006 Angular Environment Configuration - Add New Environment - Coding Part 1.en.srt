1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:02,840
<v ->Alrighty. So let's go and move in here.</v>

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,030
So the first thing I like to do

3
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,570
is just change my Spring Boot Serve report

4
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,773
to listen on 9898.

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,573
So let's go ahead and move into our IntellJ IDE.

6
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:21,333
And I'll move into my application.properties file.

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,520
And let me kind of move down a bit in this file

8
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,500
to the HTPs configuration zoom in for a second

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,739
and change my server web ports.

10
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:40,560
So my server port instead of 8443,

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,510
I'll just copy paste that for a second.

12
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,883
And I will comment out the original value.

13
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,170
And for this new one

14
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,590
I'll set this up from our little QA demo,

15
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,510
and this is just kind of a quick and dirty example.

16
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,100
There's some other techniques I could use, but right now,

17
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,453
just keep it simple here.

18
00:01:02,511 --> 00:01:05,040
And I'll say server port equals 9898.

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,690
So my spring boot app will be listening on this port.

20
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,010
Now, just go ahead and start my spring boot application.

21
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,310
And then I can zoom in here and kind of

22
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,687
scroll over a bit and I can see that the Tomcat

23
00:01:29,687 --> 00:01:32,800
is started on 9898 using HPS.

24
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,810
Great, so I know that my spring boot app

25
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37,973
is really running on 9898 right now.

26
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,170
Let's go ahead and move over to vs code

27
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,993
into our angler application,

28
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,590
and I just want to double check something here for a second,

29
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:57,053
so under source environments, environment dot CS.

30
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:03,140
It's currently going to connect to 8443,

31
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,030
so I want to kind of break it on purpose.

32
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,470
I'm going to leave this value as is,

33
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,480
and I'll try and run my application

34
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:12,730
and just break it on purpose and see what actually happens

35
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,453
when I start up my angular app.

36
00:02:18,391 --> 00:02:20,710
So let's go ahead and open up a new terminal window so we

37
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,137
can start our angler app.

38
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,100
So I'll just use NPM start.

39
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,683
It's just going to use the default configuration here.

40
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:47,490
Alrighty, let's go ahead and swing over to our web browser

41
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,783
and then we'll visit our angular application,

42
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,993
HTPs local host 4,200.

43
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,340
And so right now it says no products found

44
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,400
so no products and also no categories,

45
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,300
and so the app's broken because of the wrong URL and

46
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,321
actually can't connect to the backend

47
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:11,420
spring boot application.

48
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,900
But let's go ahead and add some logging messages here,

49
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,930
just so we can see something in the logs.

50
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,580
So I'll go ahead and move into services and then product

51
00:03:20,454 --> 00:03:21,333
service dot Ts.

52
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,220
And I'll move down to this method,

53
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:38,240
get product list paginated and I'll simply do a console that

54
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,873
log on the search URL.

55
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:47,950
So here at console dot log and here I'm going to make use of

56
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:51,650
the back ticks because I'll make use of the template string

57
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:52,903
here, so back ticks.

58
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,330
And I'll say getting products from,

59
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,810
and then the dollar sign curly brace,

60
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:09,360
or reference that variable search URL.

61
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,670
So it's important here that you use back ticks here,

62
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,423
as opposed to regular quotes,

63
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,060
allows us to process that such URL

64
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,473
as part of the console log.

65
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,290
Alrighty, let's go ahead and save that.

66
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,893
And then we can swing back over to our web browser.

67
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,853
And then simply do a reload.

68
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,840
So again, the app is still broken,

69
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,120
but we have some logging messages we can go take a look at.

70
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,390
So I can just move down to my developer tools here and then

71
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:49,280
zoom in and we can see it's getting products from,

72
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,050
and then note here, it's using local hosts, 8443

73
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:55,140
so it's broken and it's saying, hey,

74
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,600
we can't access that given in point or URL.

75
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,130
We know that it's broken. That's good.

76
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:03,520
We know that our default environment is using 8443,

77
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,400
but now we need to change this to use a QA environment on

78
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,950
the angler side to use a proper URL.

79
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,073
And we'll do that in the next video.
