1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:03,430
<v Chad>Okay, so, let's go ahead and add the styles</v>

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,703
to the angular.json file.

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,630
So, this is the main configuration file

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:12,960
for your Angular project.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,660
You can place all types of configuration here.

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,770
At this point, we'll simplify focus on adding

7
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:20,353
some additional styles to our project.

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,360
So, let me expand my window here,

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,863
give myself some extra space to kind of work with.

10
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,310
All righty, so, let's go ahead and move down here

11
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,040
to the styles section.

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,930
So, there's one style sheet that's already referenced,

13
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,620
and we can add additional items here.

14
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,080
So, this is for CSS styles that will be applied globally

15
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,900
to your Angular project.

16
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,990
There's no need to manually reference

17
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,900
these styles in your Angular components.

18
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,490
You simplify configure it here,

19
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,820
and the styles are available globally

20
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,293
throughout your given Angular project.

21
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,450
And so, what I will do here I'll add

22
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:02,193
some entries here for bootstrap and Font Awesome.

23
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,880
So, I'll give a reference to those style sheets here.

24
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,563
I know they're installed in my node_modules/bootstrap,

25
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,220
and I simply just give the location

26
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,383
for the given CSS style that I want.

27
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,650
So, that's the entry there for bootstrap,

28
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,130
and you can just verify that by looking

29
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,853
at your node modules directory.

30
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,653
And then we'll do a similar thing here for Font Awesome.

31
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,570
But again, remember the spelling here.

32
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:39,463
So, it's @fortawesome, that's an R,

33
00:01:42,887 --> 00:01:47,887
/font, F-O-N-T,

34
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,903
awesome-free.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,900
All righty, so that looks pretty good.

36
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,060
So, we'll save that, and if your application is already

37
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,850
running, be sure to restart your application,

38
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,040
because it'll need to pick up those new configs

39
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,913
in the angular.json.

40
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,670
Okay, so, at step three we're going to add the local

41
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:27,463
custom CSS styles to our Angular source/styles.css.

42
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,720
So, if we open source styles.css,

43
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,190
this is a CSS file that comes with all Angular projects.

44
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,350
You can add your global styles into this file.

45
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,700
You can also import other style files,

46
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,072
as I say there in the comment.

47
00:02:45,072 --> 00:02:46,570
(laughs)

48
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,270
And so, what I'll do is I'll actually grab

49
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,743
the styles from our template.

50
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,383
And so, there's a styles.css.

51
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:07,583
I'll just Copy the styles from here.

52
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,290
And then I'll move over to that styles.css

53
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:16,613
that's in my Angular project and Paste those items.

54
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:20,350
All right, so, there we go.

55
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:23,010
So, now we have our styles.css

56
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,523
that's also part of this given project.

57
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:31,200
Now, let's go ahead and look at our index.html

58
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,410
that's in our Angular project,

59
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,780
and we can get rid of some stuff.

60
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,780
So, we're not using bootstrap from the CDN

61
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,260
or the web anymore.

62
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,200
We're going to make use of the ones

63
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,710
that we have cloned locally.

64
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,630
So, we can simply delete this code.

65
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,310
There's no need for us to reference anything,

66
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,320
because we get those styles globally

67
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,170
based on those configs that we just set up

68
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,633
in that angular.json.

69
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:55,023
I'll update my title here for this given project.

70
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,420
And I'll also add a reference here for the favicon.

71
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:21,830
So, right now the favicon is that Angular icon.

72
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,770
That's fine, we kind of get that out of the box

73
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,720
when we create a new Angular project.

74
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,470
However, I'd like to add my own icon here,

75
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,570
my luv2shop icon.

76
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,160
And so, we actually have that in the starter files

77
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,993
that were provided.

78
00:04:34,993 --> 00:04:39,233
So, we have a favicon, which is our luv2shop icon.

79
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,220
And so, if I open it up, that's kind of what it looks like.

80
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,463
So, okay, great, that'll show up on our browser tab.

81
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:53,070
So, I'll just Copy this file, or Move this file

82
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,623
into the project and replace the previous one.

83
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,083
So, I just do a Replace there.

84
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:09,260
All right, great, so that's now part of our project.

85
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,060
So, I need to do a little workaround here.

86
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,460
The web browsers will keep a cache

87
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,750
of the previous favicons.

88
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,420
So, you need to either clear your cache,

89
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,670
or you can do a little URL trick here

90
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,833
to force the browser to get a new version.

91
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,450
And so, one way of doing that here

92
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:30,280
is when you set up the href, just do a little question mark

93
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,340
and give any unique reference here.

94
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,740
So, I call it v equals two.

95
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,100
That'll kind of avoid the caching issue

96
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,550
by giving a unique query param,

97
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,010
or you can do any value, question mark, A, B, C,

98
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,740
X, Y, Z, one, two, three, anything.

99
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,800
As long as it's unique the browser won't remember it,

100
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,740
and it'll use your new icon.

101
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,430
So, that's one of the workaround,

102
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:54,090
or you could just have the user

103
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,250
clear their browser cache, either way.

104
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,150
But that's just one little item there.

105
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,710
Okay, good, so, we're in place now.

106
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,650
We have our icon set up and we have CSS styles in place.

107
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,563
So, we're in really good shape so far.
