00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:03.470
<v Narrator>Okay, so let's go ahead and get started.</v>

2
00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:04.480
The first thing I want to do here

3
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.470
is open my file system and I want to create

4
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.133
a new folder here for Angular training.

5
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:14.990
I'll name the folder angular-training,

6
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.090
but you can use any name that you want to.

7
00:00:21.201 --> 00:00:22.410
All righty, so let's go ahead and open up

8
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.693
Visual Studio Code.

9
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.080
And the first thing I want to do is install

10
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.770
the Angular CLI, or the Angular Command Line Interface.

11
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.890
So I'll open up a new terminal window

12
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.713
and I'll install it using NPM.

13
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.240
This install process will take a bit,

14
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.750
and depending on your network speed,

15
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.530
it could go fast or it could go slow.

16
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.250
But at this point, I have this installed

17
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.523
and it's ready to go.

18
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.713
And I'll verify the installation by doing an ng version.

19
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.290
All righty, this looks good,

20
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.000
tells me the version of Angular CLI tool that's installed.

21
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.013
I can also get some information on the help system here.

22
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.280
So I'll simply give ng help

23
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.470
and this is all very good information

24
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.500
in case you need to get additional help

25
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.773
as you going through using this tool.

26
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.180
All righty, so now I want to go through

27
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.883
and actually create a new Angular project.

28
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.650
And so I use that command ng new

29
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.470
and I give the name of my project

30
00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.997
so I call it my first angular project .

31
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.120
And I'll except the defaults here for the prompts

32
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.830
so for routing I'll say no

33
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.260
and then for the style sheet format I'll choose CSS

34
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.642
and I will go (murmur) create all of these files here

35
00:02:16.642 --> 00:02:19.930
that we discuss in the previous video.

36
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.823
And you can safely ignore the warning messages.

37
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.310
And so this will take a while,

38
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.223
so I go ahead and speed up the video.

39
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.320
So at the end I'll let you have your project created

40
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.223
everything's set up and ready to go.

41
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.610
I can see that it created a new directory for me,

42
00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.010
My first angular project

43
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.133
so that's the name of our project here.

44
00:02:46.972 --> 00:02:48.383
I can move into that directory.

45
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.700
And then I can also expand

46
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.710
the folders over here on the left hand side

47
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.572
and I can see that 'hey' it created all

48
00:02:58.572 --> 00:02:59.405
of these files for me.

49
00:02:59.405 --> 00:03:00.620
So these are some of the files

50
00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.703
that you saw on the previous video.

51
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.320
So let's go ahead and run our application

52
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.010
so remember we can run the app by using ng serve

53
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.830
and so in the background this ng serve command

54
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.663
will start performing its magic.

55
00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.120
And remember behind the scenes

56
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.063
that builds the app doing the compile / transpile,

57
00:03:24.063 --> 00:03:26.309
It will start the server, watches the source files.

58
00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:29.060
It will rebuilt the app when the source is updated

59
00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.350
giving you a hot new look

60
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:31.953
so very nice feature here.

61
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.570
So can see at the bottom here

62
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:36.830
that the server is up and running

63
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.530
and listening on port 4200

64
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:39.743
that's the default port.

65
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.250
So I can go ahead and swing to a web browser

66
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.723
and open up localhost:4200.

67
00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.310
And there's my application

68
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.530
so they give you a lot of stock information upfront

69
00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.630
but next to the little rocket here you can see

70
00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.440
that the name of your project my first angular project app

71
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.650
is up and running.

72
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.010
And also some really good links of resources here

73
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.850
for learning angular CLI blog and so fort

74
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.370
and also some next steps for its new components

75
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:12.370
and so on.

76
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.110
This page changes a lot depending

77
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:16.830
on the version of angular that your using

78
00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.580
so each version they add new features and functionality

79
00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.220
so what you see may be slightly different

80
00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.820
then what we have here because

81
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.743
a new version of angular has released every three months.

82
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.510
All righty, so that's up and running

83
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.480
let's go ahead and and move back to our Ide.

84
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.363
Let's go ahead and edit the HTML template file.

85
00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.510
So i'll zoom in here on the left hand side

86
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.310
and I'll go to the source directory.

87
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.393
I move into app and I'll open up this app component.html.

88
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.680
So there's a lot of information (murmur)

89
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.840
see here, a lot of place holder concept

90
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.980
that you'll see here

91
00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.980
but let's go ahead and look for this one section of text.

92
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.347
So let's go ahead and do a search for "is running".

93
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:05.880
Okay, great so that's where we saw

94
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.140
that little piece where it says

95
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.683
hey our project title app is running.

96
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.400
So I'll add some additional text here,

97
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.510
I'll say YES, YES SUCCESS,

98
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:17.820
just so I know that hey this is something

99
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.083
that I modified, that I edited.

100
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:23.800
And then if I save this file

101
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.150
the recent changes are automatically reloaded

102
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.500
because, remember the server is actually watching

103
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.500
the source files

104
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.160
and if I move back to the browser

105
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.567
I'll see the updated page

106
00:05:33.567 --> 00:05:36.500
and notice here the page is automatically refreshed

107
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.490
by angular there's no need for you

108
00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.270
to hit the refresh button

109
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.210
the page will automatically update

110
00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:43.210
which is kind of cool.

111
00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.410
All righty, let's swing back over to our ide.

112
00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.770
And I want to cut this line of code

113
00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.970
and I'm going to delete everything else in this file.

114
00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.920
So let's just cut this line

115
00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.960
and delete everything else

116
00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.610
and then we'll paste that one line.

117
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.160
I wanted to get rid of all the additional fluff

118
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.483
in that given page.

119
00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.410
All righty, so I've saved this

120
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.970
and now let me swing back to my actual browser again

121
00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.173
and see the new version.

122
00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:21.410
So now I got rid of all of the fluff

123
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.160
and I only see my one message,

124
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.830
which is great and this is kind of what I'll do

125
00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.563
for the remainder of the videos.

126
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.210
Okay, so this looks great.

127
00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.270
So we're here to create a new angular project

128
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.610
and get it up and running and play around with it a bit.

129
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.823
So (murmur) say good job.
