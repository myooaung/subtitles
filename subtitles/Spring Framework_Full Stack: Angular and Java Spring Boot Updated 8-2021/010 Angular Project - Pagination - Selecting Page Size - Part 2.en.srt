1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,118
<v Instructor>Okay so we have our drop-down list</v>

2
00:00:04,118 --> 00:00:06,231
on our HTML template page.

3
00:00:06,231 --> 00:00:09,070
Let's just do a quick test here

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:10,665
and just view it in the browser

5
00:00:10,665 --> 00:00:13,200
just to see what it looks like,

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,123
as far as the placement and location.

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:18,983
Okay, great.

8
00:00:18,983 --> 00:00:19,816
So this looks really good.

9
00:00:19,816 --> 00:00:21,350
So here's our new drop-down list.

10
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,646
It looks great.

11
00:00:22,646 --> 00:00:25,388
But it doesn't do much right now.

12
00:00:25,388 --> 00:00:28,990
It's just a pretty face, it doesn't really do anything.

13
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:30,738
Because we haven't added any logic

14
00:00:30,738 --> 00:00:33,080
or event handling to it right now.

15
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,610
So this was mainly just for placing it on the page.

16
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,060
But now we have a bit more work to do.

17
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,760
So let's go ahead and do that now.

18
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,850
Okay so now select tag we need to handle

19
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:48,500
for the change event.

20
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,553
And then call a given method and pass in a value.

21
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,153
Alrighty.

22
00:01:09,153 --> 00:01:09,986
So event binding.

23
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:11,795
So for the change event, so when the user selects a page,

24
00:01:11,795 --> 00:01:14,893
then we'll call a method, updatePageSize.

25
00:01:16,268 --> 00:01:20,310
And then we pass in the value that is selected by the user.

26
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,290
And remember that's five, 10, 20, or 50,

27
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:26,063
based on the options from the drop-down list.

28
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,610
And then also the updatePageSize method

29
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,333
is actually defined in the component .ts file.

30
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,130
Alrighty so now in step two,

31
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:42,090
we need to update our ProductListComponent

32
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,993
for setting the page size.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,460
So let me grab that method name here, updatePageSize,

34
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,473
and just copy it.

35
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,940
And then move over to my ProductListComponent.ts file,

36
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,623
and I'll add this method.

37
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:06,377
So I'll just move down here and paste that method name,

38
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:09,280
updatePageSize, it's going to pass in a parameter,

39
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,363
which is a number.

40
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,680
And so remember the link there from our HTML template

41
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,100
to the actual component here.

42
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,050
So updatePageSize, they'll pass in

43
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,920
the actual page size that the user selected.

44
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,370
So here we simply make an assignment.

45
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,950
So I give this.thePageSize equals pageSize,

46
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,450
the parameter being passed in.

47
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:39,650
And then here I simply reset the page number to one.

48
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,310
Because they've changed their page sizes,

49
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,080
I want to reset it to one.

50
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,630
And then also I called this.listProducts

51
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,980
just to kind of refresh the page view

52
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,320
based on this new information we have for page size,

53
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,793
and page number, and so on.

54
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,493
Alright so that's the code for updating the page size.

55
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,110
And I'll just move up top here

56
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,210
and I'll just set the page size to five

57
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:08,160
because in our HTML template,

58
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,240
we had the default selected value of five.

59
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,140
So just so it matches up with everything

60
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,810
that we have on our front end.

61
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,510
So just make that one update here.

62
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,280
Alright so we're back in our application,

63
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,630
everything is up and running.

64
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,500
So the default page size is five.

65
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,060
So we see five items here.

66
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,270
And then for the navigation items,

67
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,920
there's five different pages.

68
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,050
So this is a success.

69
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,070
Our page size of five is working!

70
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:43,430
But let's test it and now choose a different size.

71
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,530
So page size of 10.

72
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,363
Okay great.

73
00:03:46,363 --> 00:03:50,510
So 10 and then we have a total of three pages.

74
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,700
So that works out also.

75
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,820
And then we can play around with some of

76
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,623
the other page sizes here for 20.

77
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,630
We'll scroll down a bit.

78
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,633
That looks good.

79
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,163
And finally page size of 50.

80
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,540
And that looks good.

81
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,480
One page only.

82
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,370
So this looks good.

83
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,850
Our user has the option now to choose their own page size,

84
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,450
and our application will update accordingly,

85
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,100
in terms of pagination.

86
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,563
Alrighty, good job!
