00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:03.973
<v ->Welcome to the Angular and Spring Boot course.</v>

2
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.410
As an introduction,

3
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.330
here's the course development team.

4
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.090
Harinath Kuntamukkala, and myself, Chad Darby.

5
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.110
We've created a number of popular Spring courses,

6
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.530
and now we're teaming up again

7
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.283
to create another fun course for you.

8
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:25.820
Alrighty, so let's go ahead

9
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.650
and look at our course objective.

10
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.080
So our main objective here

11
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.450
is to build a full stack application

12
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.490
with Angular and Spring Boot.

13
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.600
So we'll have Angular on the front end,

14
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.730
we'll have Spring Boot on the back end,

15
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.150
and they'll communicate with each other using a REST API.

16
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.320
And then in the background we'll have a database

17
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.803
and we'll have full CRUD support for the database.

18
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.130
And then in terms of prerequisites,

19
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.310
you should already have prior experience with Java,

20
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.560
Spring Boot, and also Maven.

21
00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.830
So if you've taken one of my previous courses before,

22
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.800
the Spring and Hibernate for Beginners course,

23
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.163
then you're already set up.

24
00:01:04.225 --> 00:01:05.058
If not then you should go off

25
00:01:05.058 --> 00:01:07.120
and learn those appropriate technologies.

26
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.863
But there's no prior experience needed for Angular.

27
00:01:12.699 --> 00:01:14.020
We'll actually teach you angular from the beginnings.

28
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.120
So just a heads up.

29
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.610
It's not an A to Z coverage of Angular,

30
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.673
but enough to build to full-stack apps.

31
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.370
Alrighty, so lets go ahead and look at our course road map.

32
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.472
So we'll start with an angular overview,

33
00:01:28.472 --> 00:01:31.360
and then we'll set up our development environment.

34
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.020
Next we'll have a TypeScript Crash Course

35
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.750
and then we'll have an Angular Crash Course.

36
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.420
Next we'll pull all this together

37
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.900
and we'll build a real-time eCommerce application.

38
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.290
So we'll build the Angular front-end

39
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.053
and then we'll make use of Spring Boot on the back-end.

40
00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.540
So in terms of source code and PDFs,

41
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.800
all source code is available for download.

42
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.020
And also, all the PDFs of the slides

43
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.100
are also available for download.

44
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.270
In the next lecture I'll actually give you links

45
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.513
on how to download those resources.

46
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.940
And then also if you have questions or you need help

47
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.820
simply post your question in the classroom discussion forum

48
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.580
and then we'll get back to you shortly.

49
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.870
Okay, that's it for now,

50
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.420
I'll see you in the next video.
