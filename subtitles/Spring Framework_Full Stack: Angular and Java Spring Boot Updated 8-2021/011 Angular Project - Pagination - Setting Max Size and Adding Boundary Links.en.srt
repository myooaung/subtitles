00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:03,370
<v Instructor>I want to show you two more features</v>

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,850
of this pagination component.

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:06,870
This is something just really quick.

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,410
I want to show you how to setup the max size for pagination,

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,980
and also how to setup boundary links.

6
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,790
So just a really quick video to show you

7
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,090
how these parameters work.

8
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,900
So we have pagination up and working.

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,490
And the user can change their page size.

10
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:27,180
I'd like to make one small change here.

11
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,950
I like to move into my code and add a new page size.

12
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:33,273
So I'll add a new page size for two.

13
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,763
So this way we can see two products per page.

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,393
Then I'll save this and swing back into my application.

15
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,770
And then I move over here, and I choose the page size of two

16
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,630
and ooh, yuck, okay.

17
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,220
We have too many pages, all right.

18
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,170
We'd like to show only a max number of pages.

19
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,430
But right now it's running off the screen.

20
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:10,070
And imagine if we had a million products right?

21
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,320
Two products per page, this just would not work.

22
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,653
So somehow we need to try and manage this or limit this.

23
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:24,010
And we can do this by setting a new parameter here

24
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,053
on this NGB pagination component.

25
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:33,860
I can make use of this new parameter here called max size.

26
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,760
So this will always show a max number of pages,

27
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,790
and I'll set the max size equals to five.

28
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:43,660
You can actually get more details on this parameter here

29
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,050
at the link shown on the screen.

30
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:48,800
But we'll see it in action here as far as how it works.

31
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,950
So basically this will show a max number of pages.

32
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,853
So I'll save this and swing back into my application.

33
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,760
I choose the page size of two.

34
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,690
And now notice here, it shows a max of five pages.

35
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,380
Then it does the dot, dot, dot.

36
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,900
And it'll give you the last or first page or whatever.

37
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,810
But the key here is that it's limiting the number of pages.

38
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,470
So even if you had a million products,

39
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,610
it wouldn't show all of those, just that one given max.

40
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,930
And again, you can look at the docs online

41
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,350
to get more details of it.

42
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,020
But this is fairly straightforward here,

43
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,400
as far as how to work this in.

44
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,003
I encourage you to experiment with it on your own.

45
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,410
Alrighty, so one other thing I want to do

46
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,290
is show boundary links.

47
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,000
So boundary links is the little angle bracket,

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,640
angle bracket of front and the back.

49
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,880
Basically allows you to jump to the beginning

50
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,770
or the end page quickly and easily,

51
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,403
as opposed to having to scroll through every page.

52
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,960
So I set boundary links equals to true.

53
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:10,300
Save it, swing back into my application.

54
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,450
And now notice here, we have these boundary links

55
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,120
at the beginning and at the end.

56
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,130
So now I can simply select those boundary links

57
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:18,500
and it'll take me directly to the front page,

58
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,500
or it'll take me to the last page or the end page.

59
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,843
Basically, the boundary.

60
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,670
Alrighty, so that was it.

61
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,900
We just played around with some of those parameters there.

62
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,100
Again, all the documentation is online.

63
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,300
So you can go there and review some of the other parameters,

64
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,670
and you can experiment with them,

65
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,700
and add 'em to your application.

66
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,053
Alrighty, good job.
