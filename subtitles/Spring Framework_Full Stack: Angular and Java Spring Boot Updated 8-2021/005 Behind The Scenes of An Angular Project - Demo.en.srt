1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:02,850
<v Lecturer>All righty, so let's go ahead and move back</v>

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,390
into our RDE and let's kind of do some

3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:06,163
behind the scenes work here.

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:10,210
So starting with the launch process,

5
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,260
we mentioned that is going to open up the index.html file.

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,293
So I'll go into index.html, zoom over here a bit.

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,850
And we see that entry here of app=root,

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,280
so basically it's going to replace this tag selector

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,050
with a template of the component, like I mentioned earlier.

10
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:27,853
It's similar to an include.

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,040
So let's look at out app module,

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,060
just a collection of components here,

13
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,770
and so we see that we have a given

14
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,210
main component for bootstrapping,

15
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,707
that main component is called AppComponent.

16
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,020
All righty so let's go ahead and move to our AppComponent.ts

17
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,200
so this is our TypeScript file.

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,760
So we see the AppComponent and we see the selector app-root,

19
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,220
so this matches what we have in the index.html,

20
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,310
like I said earlier, you can use any selector you want,

21
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,500
simply stay consistent between those two files.

22
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,980
Okay, templateUrl points to the location

23
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,110
of our html template file

24
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,430
so that's appcomponent.html

25
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,053
and this is the basic that we have for right now.

26
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,560
And remember, with the {{,

27
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,170
this will actually read the property

28
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,140
of the related component,

29
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,120
so it'll read the property from the appcomponent.ts,

30
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,800
that TypeScript code.

31
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,680
And that's the actually property that it'll read

32
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,800
and include it right there in the template output

33
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,023
as far as rendering.

34
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,527
So I can change this title to say,

35
00:01:39,527 --> 00:01:41,333
"This is My First App"

36
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,450
And then I can move here to the bottom

37
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:49,223
and start my server using that ng serve.

38
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:54,320
So remember in the background it compiles the code,

39
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,200
it starts the server and it watches your source files

40
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,353
and it'll reload any of your source files.

41
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:05,820
I simply swing over to my browser and open up localhost:4200

42
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,970
and there's the output.

43
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:10,081
This is My First App app is running.

44
00:02:10,081 --> 00:02:13,410
(chuckle) Okay, that doesn't make any sense.

45
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,650
I need to change my code a bit

46
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,593
'cause I have app app twice.

47
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,123
It's all good.

48
00:02:20,123 --> 00:02:21,420
So let's swing back over here

49
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,963
and make that slight change.

50
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:28,140
So in html, instead of saying app is running,

51
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,470
I'll just remove all of that stuff and just save

52
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,890
and remember it reloads everything for me,

53
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,750
and then there's the new version of it right here.

54
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,190
So, that's a nice little demo here, of the hot reloading

55
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,023
actually working in practice.

56
00:02:42,023 --> 00:02:44,190
(chuckle)

57
00:02:48,582 --> 00:02:53,165
And I don't have to use span here, I can simply use h2,

58
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,370
and save that and swing back over

59
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,963
and now I see new output here in the page.

60
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:06,830
I'll play around a bit,

61
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,180
kind of experiment here behind the scenes.

62
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,900
I'll set up a horizontal rule,

63
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,420
then I'll say "My name is"

64
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,473
and for right now just kind of leave it as dot, dot, dot.

65
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,250
I see the new output there in the browser,

66
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,010
but I actually want to read this from the component.

67
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:30,150
So in the component I'll define additional properties here.

68
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,073
So first name of Bill,

69
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,703
last name of Smith.

70
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:44,280
And now I should be able to access those properties

71
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,280
in my actually template using that {{ syntax.

72
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,963
So first name,

73
00:03:52,634 --> 00:03:54,090
{{,

74
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,123
last name.

75
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,423
Then I'll save that.

76
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,000
And notice here, it automatically

77
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,723
recompiles in the background.

78
00:04:03,621 --> 00:04:05,680
All righty and then swinging over to my web browser

79
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,630
and oh yeah, this looks great, I like it.

80
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,220
So here it says "My name is Bill Smith",

81
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,660
so we're actually reading those properties

82
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,200
from that angular component,

83
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,370
so we're reading the first name property

84
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,040
then also the last name property

85
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,100
and including it right here in our html page.

86
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,150
So this looks good.

87
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,030
I'm happy with this work so far.

88
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,863
Good job.
