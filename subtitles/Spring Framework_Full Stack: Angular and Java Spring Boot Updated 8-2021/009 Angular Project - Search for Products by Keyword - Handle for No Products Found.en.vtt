00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.810
<v Man>All righty, I'd like to make one enhancement</v>

2
00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:06.290
to our application.

3
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.890
I'd like to display a message if products are not found.

4
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.488
Let's go ahead and find out how we can make the updates

5
00:00:14.488 --> 00:00:15.688
to handle for this case.

6
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.690
Let me zoom in and show you a quick demo here.

7
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.220
So if we search for products like python,

8
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.040
we know we have python products in our database

9
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.493
and we'll get some results.

10
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.200
So that's AOK.

11
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.010
But now if I remove that and just type

12
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.500
in any random characters on my keyboard,

13
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.360
then I get a blank screen.

14
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.510
So I'd like to display a message if products are not found.

15
00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.140
The blank screen is not really good for the users,

16
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.140
when I could tell them, "Hey, I couldn't find any products."

17
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:48.423
All righty, so let's go ahead

18
00:00:48.423 --> 00:00:50.203
and move into Visual Studio Code.

19
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.530
And let's open up our file, product-list-grid-component.html

20
00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.563
and I'll expand my window here and zoom out a bit.

21
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.040
And so I'll move down to this section

22
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.830
where we have loop over the collection of products.

23
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.673
And I'll actually add some code after this section.

24
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.200
So I'll move in here at the bottom

25
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.190
and I'll write some quick comments to myself,

26
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.053
just to kind of keep myself on track.

27
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.110
So basically, if the products are empty, then I want

28
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.193
to display a message to the user.

29
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.703
All righty, we'll set up a div.

30
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.433
And we'll make use of ngIf.

31
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.340
And we'll say products?.length and be sure

32
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.760
to include the question mark, I'll discuss it in a second.

33
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.210
And we'll check to see if the length equals zero.

34
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.350
And then we'll also add some bootstrap styles here

35
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.563
for alerts and alert warnings.

36
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.130
And I'll also add a role="alert".

37
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.010
So role alert basically is for accessibility.

38
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.030
So it provides extra information to assistive technologies

39
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.783
such as screen readers.

40
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.447
And then inside of this div, I simply say,

41
00:02:29.447 --> 00:02:30.797
"No products found."

42
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.890
Okay, so a bit more on the question mark.

43
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.590
This is known as a safe navigation operator.

44
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.020
It guards against null and undefined values

45
00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.760
in your property paths.

46
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.440
So it's a shortcut way of avoiding null point

47
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.950
or exception issues.

48
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.170
So effectively here at the bottom,

49
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.030
if products is null or undefined

50
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.617
or the product lengths equal zero, then we'll display,

51
00:02:58.617 --> 00:03:00.120
"No products found."

52
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.800
So that's the whole idea about the safe navigation operator,

53
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.763
the question mark.

54
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.110
And this is a really nice angular feature.

55
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.560
If you'd like to get more details

56
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.290
on this safe navigation operator,

57
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.900
visit the link here on the screen,

58
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.343
it'll redirect you to the official angular documentation.

59
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.070
And that's the coding required to display a message

60
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.730
if the products are empty.

61
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.210
Now I want to give credit

62
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.720
to one of our students, Matt Seymour.

63
00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.370
He actually came up with this snippet of code

64
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.630
and he provided it in the course of discussion forum.

65
00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.597
I saw his solution and I said, "Wow, Matt, this is great.

66
00:03:38.597 --> 00:03:41.080
"Do I have permission to include this in the course?"

67
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.840
And he said, "Sure, no problem."

68
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.700
He was very happy to provide permission.

69
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.654
So anyway, I said, "Hey Matt, I'll give you credit

70
00:03:46.654 --> 00:03:47.550
for this."

71
00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.250
And so here we go, so Matt, your name's in lights now.

72
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.950
Thanks a bunch for helping us out.

73
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.920
All right, so I'm kind of excited.

74
00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:57.860
I want to test this out.

75
00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.730
So let's go ahead and swing into our browser.

76
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.950
Let's just do a regular search for a python just

77
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.140
to make sure that we can get products.

78
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.500
Okay, that's fine.

79
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.620
Now let's just enter any type of characters on our keyboard

80
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.893
and then do a search.

81
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.840
All right, success!

82
00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.040
So now we display a message if the products are not found

83
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.230
so no more blank page.

84
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.560
Now we can actually see that given message

85
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.990
for this given scenario.

86
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.230
So this is a really good enhancement and I like it

87
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.200
and I'm happy.

88
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.843
So I'd like to say, good job my friend.
