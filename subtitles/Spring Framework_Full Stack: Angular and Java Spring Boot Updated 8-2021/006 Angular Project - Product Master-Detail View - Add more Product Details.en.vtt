00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:02.900
<v ->All right, so our Details page</v>

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.550
can display the product name,

3
00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:06.150
but like I mentioned earlier, let's go ahead

4
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.343
and add some more details to the page.

5
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.000
But before we do that, I want to add

6
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.840
a new CSS style to our file "styles.css"

7
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.760
because we'll use this style on our actual Details page.

8
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.527
So let's just move down to "styles.css".

9
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.970
And so in this file, let's go ahead

10
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.697
and do a search for the string "detail-section".

11
00:00:40.136 --> 00:00:41.330
And this should bring you down to

12
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.990
the area of code that's similar

13
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.823
to what I have on the screen.

14
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.550
And so we're going to add a new style right after here.

15
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.780
We could actually place this style anywhere,

16
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.340
but I'm just trying to group related styles

17
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.043
in similar locations in the file.

18
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.240
And so I'll add a new style for the

19
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.063
actual image width as a percentage.

20
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.377
So I'll call this style "detail-img".

21
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.953
And the width is 30%.

22
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.380
So when we display our detail image,

23
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.360
this is the actual percentage that we want to have

24
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.843
as far as a view for that given image.

25
00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.070
All righty, so now we can move back

26
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.760
to our "product-details-component.html"

27
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.750
and I'll get rid of some of that

28
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.453
hard-coded stuff that I put in a little bit earlier.

29
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.703
So I'll just kind of remove line four here.

30
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.310
And the first thing that we want on our Details page

31
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.223
is the actual product image.

32
00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.980
So we'll make use of "img src",

33
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.180
give the image URL and class,

34
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.480
and we'll make use of the new class

35
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.517
that we just created, "detail-img".

36
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.550
All right, so let's go ahead and

37
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.083
add an "h3" for the product name.

38
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.173
Next, we'll add code here for the product price.

39
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.340
We'll also add a button here for a cart.

40
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.820
Right now it's just a placeholder,

41
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.260
it doesn't really do anything.

42
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.293
We'll add that functionality in some of the upcoming videos.

43
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.650
I'll just set up a little horizontal rule here.

44
00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.650
I'll set up a heading for a description.

45
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.813
And then I'll actually give the product description.

46
00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:29.779
And I'll save that here.

47
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.150
And...oh!

48
00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.530
Red stuff in the terminal, whoa.

49
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:35.763
What's going on there?

50
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.423
Let me scroll the window up and see what's happening.

51
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.070
Error.

52
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.117
Description does not exist, oh, typo!

53
00:03:47.117 --> 00:03:48.370
(laughing)

54
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.280
And it even says, "Hey, did you mean 'description'?"

55
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.050
Oh, wow, you're great, I like that.

56
00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.230
Typo, it found it for me.

57
00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.833
Description with a "c", nice, excellent.

58
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.573
Compiled successfully, yeah!

59
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:09.900
All righty, I'm excited now.

60
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.210
Let's go ahead and test this out

61
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.110
so I'll swing back over to my browser.

62
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.740
And I'll select one of our products

63
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.510
and then success, yes!

64
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.600
So we have the image, name, price, button, description.

65
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.103
Sweet, I like it, I like it.

66
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.773
Check out some of our other products here.

67
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.963
Yep, good, good, looks good.

68
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.560
And let's play around with some of our other categories.

69
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.193
So mouse pads, sweet.

70
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.203
And coffee mugs, oh yeah!

71
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.500
And finally, all of our luggage tags, awesome.

72
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.603
So I'm fairly confident here that...

73
00:04:56.603 --> 00:04:57.436
(laughing)

74
00:04:57.436 --> 00:04:59.430
the Master Detail View is working out

75
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.663
just fine for us in our application.

76
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.950
But there's one more thing I want to add,

77
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.560
I want to add a navigation link

78
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.460
to the bottom of that Details page

79
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.940
just so the user can click that link

80
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.373
to go back to the main page if they like.

81
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.563
So the "routerLink" will be to products.

82
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.803
Set the appropriate class here in T5.

83
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.853
Save that and swing back over to my application.

84
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.780
And I should see the new updates here.

85
00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.400
Great, so right here at the bottom, notice here,

86
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.560
there's a "Back to Product List",

87
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.603
and choosing that takes me back to my products.

88
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:47.280
All righty, so this looks really good.

89
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.020
So we have the master detail functionality

90
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.000
working for our project.

91
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.823
I'd like to say good job.
