00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.570
<v Narrator>All righty so we're moving right along.</v>

2
00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:04.360
So in this video we'll cover steps six,

3
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.000
of laying out the form controls.

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.770
Basically, just kind of repeating the process

5
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.830
for the other roles for Last Name and Email.

6
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:11.700
And then also we'll add an event handler

7
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.963
for form submission.

8
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.490
Alrighty so let's kind of do more of the same.

9
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.440
So back in our checkout.component.html,

10
00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.170
and we'll just do a little copy, paste on

11
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:28.453
some of the roles here.

12
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.493
So I'll just copy this row.

13
00:00:39.158 --> 00:00:44.158
And then I'll just move down and I'll paste it, two times.

14
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.930
So we already have First Name.

15
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:46.790
That's in place,

16
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.230
and now we'll make use of, Last Name.

17
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.570
All right, so the second one here is Last Name.

18
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.823
Be sure to update the form controls to say, Last Name.

19
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.060
And now let's move down

20
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.223
and do a similar thing here for Email.

21
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.343
All right so that's our Email row.

22
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.570
Alrighty, so let's swing into our browser

23
00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:26.910
and take a look at this and,

24
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.620
wow, looks good, I like it.

25
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.560
So we have our Customer, grouping here.

26
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.380
And we have First Name, Last Name and Email.

27
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.230
So this is great.

28
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.650
Okay one thing to notice here

29
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.010
is that our purchase button, doesn't really do anything.

30
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.320
We don't have any event handling on it yet.

31
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.250
We'll fix that right now.

32
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.430
So that's step seven of,

33
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.803
Adding an event handler for form submission.

34
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.033
So let's move back into our checkout component.ts.

35
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.157
And let's create a method, onSubmit,

36
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.420
and just for right now we'll keep it simple,

37
00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.040
we'll simply just do a console.log.

38
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.873
And we'll simply say,

39
00:02:13.873 --> 00:02:16.140
hey we're, "handling the form submission."

40
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.863
And then we'll simply do a console.log on the form data.

41
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.260
So I'll say, "Hey get the form group for Customer."

42
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.150
And let's get the actual value for that one,

43
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.250
and that's the information that we'll log.

44
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.780
Now we also need to update our checkout.component.html.

45
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.410
To actually call that given method right?

46
00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.570
So we have a Submit button here,

47
00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.970
but we need to some how hook the form

48
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.180
to that given method.

49
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.240
So for our form up top, we have,

50
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.010
ngSubmit so, for the ng, angular, submit event.

51
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.887
Then we'll call our method, onSubmit.

52
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.680
So our method name really could be, anything,

53
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.077
but, in our example we called it, onSubmit.

54
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.800
And so I'd have called the onSubmit,

55
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.570
from our initial component.ts file

56
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.690
Alrighty so let's swing over,

57
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.083
and let's test this out in our browser.

58
00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.870
So, I will, open up our Dev Tools,

59
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.863
so we can see the Console logs.

60
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.440
I'll just add some sample data here.

61
00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:59.010
And I'll hit purchase.

62
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.440
And, all right.

63
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.217
So, looking here at the bottom it says,

64
00:04:02.217 --> 00:04:03.900
"Handling the submit button."

65
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.360
And we see the actual form data, as Jason.

66
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.410
Email, First Name, Last Name.

67
00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:10.793
Looks good, I like it.

68
00:04:22.773 --> 00:04:24.730
And remember we can also make a small mod.

69
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.150
So say for example you didn't want

70
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.570
all of the form data, you simply wanted a specific field,

71
00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:30.853
well we can do that also.

72
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.760
So I'll just do a little copy, paste on this line.

73
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.963
And, out of the customer form I only want the email address.

74
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.037
I'll just add a little descriptive string upfront.

75
00:04:50.037 --> 00:04:52.197
"The email address is."

76
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.173
Now let's swing back over to our browser.

77
00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.053
And let's do a purchase.

78
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.900
And great, so that's that, new piece of information there.

79
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.820
The email address is john@test.com.

80
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.270
Okay great, we have the basics in place here

81
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.770
for doing form handling.

82
00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.530
Now it's just more of the same of,

83
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:24.840
building out our form,

84
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.010
adding all the different groups and sections.

85
00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.520
And then we'll do all the form processing,

86
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.733
in some upcoming videos.
