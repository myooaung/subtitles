1
00:00:01,154 --> 00:00:02,190
<v Instructor>All right, so moving along</v>

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,520
with our development process.

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,040
We're going to cover steps two and three

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,980
of creating a new component for search,

5
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:10,310
and also adding a new angular route for searching.

6
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:11,910
And just a quick heads up,

7
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,890
I'm going to swap the order of these in the actual video,

8
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,290
so we'll see kind of step three first,

9
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,140
and then we'll see step two next.

10
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,990
But don't worry, we'll cover everything,

11
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:23,230
and everything will work out in the end,

12
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,173
I got you covered.

13
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:29,690
All righty, so moving in here,

14
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:30,810
so the first thing we'll do is

15
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,233
we'll add a new angular route for searching.

16
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,210
So whenever we need to add routes,

17
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,973
we'll open or edit our file app.module.ts.

18
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,483
All right, so here's our app.module.ts.

19
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,730
So I'll move down to my section for routes,

20
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,593
and I'll add a new route here for searching.

21
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,620
So I'll have this route called search,

22
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,700
and then I'll have a parameter called keyword,

23
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,650
so we say :keyword,

24
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,330
and this given route will be handled

25
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,670
by our ProductListComponent.

26
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,670
And remember, we're going to reuse this

27
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,690
because we already have the logic and functionality

28
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,750
for viewing and listing products.

29
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,143
That's how we have this set up in this fashion.

30
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,483
Okay, so that coding looks good.

31
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,800
Let's go ahead and open up a new terminal window,

32
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,740
and I'll zoom in here for a second.

33
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,073
So what we want to do is create a new component for searching.

34
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,973
So I'll make use of that ng generate component,

35
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,803
and this'll be components/search.

36
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,060
It'll go off and create the appropriate files for us.

37
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,640
And if we swing over here,

38
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,480
we can see, under the section for components,

39
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,810
then there's a new search directory,

40
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,470
and it has all the supporting files here

41
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,433
for our new search component that was just generated.
