1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,980
<v Instructor>Alrighty, so we're moving right along here.</v>

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,360
So in step three, we're going to update the HTML template

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,343
to display the error messages.

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,380
We've done a lot of this work before,

5
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,180
so we'll do some copy paste here and reuse some code

6
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,530
that we've created earlier.

7
00:00:29,428 --> 00:00:31,860
This is for our shipping address,

8
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,810
so I'll just move down a bit here

9
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,463
to the shipping address section.

10
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,623
There we go, shipping address, awesome.

11
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,930
So, we know we need to add some validation rules

12
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,873
here for this first field, country.

13
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,430
So, let's go ahead and scroll up to last name

14
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:55,300
and just copy the div here for displaying

15
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,623
validation messages.

16
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,290
I'll just copy this information and I'll move back down

17
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,570
to my shipping address section,

18
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:11,383
and I'll add this right after the select for country.

19
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,480
So, right inside of this div, after the select,

20
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,383
that drop down list, and I'll just paste it in.

21
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,840
Now I need to simply go through and update the reference,

22
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,470
so instead of last name invalid,

23
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:30,293
we need to say shippingAddressCountry.invalid.

24
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,690
And then a similar thing here for dirty,

25
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:45,883
shippingAddressCountry, shippingAddressCountry.touched.

26
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,580
And then also inside here for our last name errors

27
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,500
that should be shippingAddressCountry.errors.

28
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,850
Since this is a dropdown list,

29
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,150
there's no need to worry about no white space,

30
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,743
I'll just clean up some other stuff here at the bottom.

31
00:02:09,857 --> 00:02:13,740
So, shippingAddressCountry,

32
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,623
and also, update the message, Country is required.

33
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,130
All right, let's do a quick checkpoint here on the code,

34
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,990
so, make sure you have a shippingAddressCountry

35
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:31,010
for invalid, .dirty, .touched and also for the errors.

36
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,410
Make sure you have all that updated accordingly.

37
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,740
All right, so let's go ahead and test this out real quick,

38
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,663
I'll open up a new terminal window,

39
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,793
move into my directory here.

40
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,160
And again, before I run, make sure my Spring Boot app

41
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,083
is up and running, so it's up, that's good.

42
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,883
So now I can go ahead and run my Angular application.

43
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:10,150
Just move in here and add some items to the cart,

44
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,543
go to the checkout page.

45
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,063
So, here's my shipping address section,

46
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,660
let's check for validation, we added some validation

47
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,940
on the country fields, so hit purchase,

48
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:34,610
go right to the top, and success, nice, great.

49
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,130
So, they're actually checking to see

50
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,070
if something is selected

51
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,300
and if not, they'll tell us that something's required

52
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,230
and the message goes away accordingly.

53
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,180
So, this is great, I like it, good job.
