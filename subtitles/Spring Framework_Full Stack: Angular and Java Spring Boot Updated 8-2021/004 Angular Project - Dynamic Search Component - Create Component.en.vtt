00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.060
<v Instructor>Okay, so moving along</v>

2
00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:03.780
with our development process,

3
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.170
in this video we going to cover steps two and three

4
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:07.560
of creating our class

5
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.273
and also creating a new component for our menu.

6
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.273
Okay, so let's go ahead

7
00:00:17.273 --> 00:00:19.220
and swing over the Visual Studio Code

8
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.423
because now we going to do some Angular coding.

9
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.850
And let's go ahead and open up a New Terminal window.

10
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.870
So let me zoom in here from my terminal window

11
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.293
let's go ahead and generate that new class.

12
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:51.890
Okay, so we see that it created

13
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.903
that product-category.ts file for us.

14
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.540
So I'll swing in over here and I'll open up that file.

15
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.913
So it's under common, product-category.ts.

16
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.740
So we need to add two properties here,

17
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.323
one for id and another property for a categoryName.

18
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.000
Alright, so that looks pretty good.

19
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.540
Now let me expand my window here

20
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.010
and again zoom into my terminal.

21
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.843
So for step three,

22
00:01:36.843 --> 00:01:39.133
we need to create a new component for our menu.

23
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.023
So our component will be called product-category-menu.

24
00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.183
Okay, great, it created some files for us.

25
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.060
So let's look under components

26
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.200
and there's a new directory here, product-category-menu,

27
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.263
all right, good job.

28
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:15.580
So let's go ahead and open up

29
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.333
our product-category-menu-component.cs.

30
00:02:27.548 --> 00:02:29.640
So for our component, let's define our property

31
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.990
for productCategories.

32
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.933
It's an array of those productCategory items.

33
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:44.730
And then on our constructor,

34
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.983
let's go ahead and inject our productService.

35
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.860
In our ngOnInit method,

36
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.763
let's call this.listProductCategories.

37
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.850
This is a method that will create

38
00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.763
to actually call our service.

39
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.423
So let's remove the placeholder code here,

40
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.320
and let's add our own custom code.

41
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.390
So the first thing we need to do is invoke the service.

42
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.543
So this.productService.getProductCategories.subscribe.

43
00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.650
And now notice at this point there's an error message

44
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.070
for get product categories because we don't have

45
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.360
that method yet and our service,

46
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.743
we'll fix this issue in the next video.

47
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.320
So at the moment here, we'll say data

48
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.070
and I'll say console.log.

49
00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.670
So I'm going to log the data returned from the service.

50
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.920
So I make use of that JSON.stringify

51
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.453
to take a given object and display it in JSON format.

52
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.610
And then we simply assign the data to our property.

53
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.103
So it's assigned to our this.productCategories.

54
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.370
Alright, so that covers the coding here

55
00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.650
for our component for calling our service.

56
00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.220
But there's still some more work to do

57
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.063
and we'll do that in the next video.
