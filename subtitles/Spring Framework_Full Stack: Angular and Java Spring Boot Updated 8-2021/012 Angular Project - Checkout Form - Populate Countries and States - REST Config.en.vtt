00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:03.670
<v Instructor>Okay, so we're in our final step here</v>

2
00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.933
step four of Updating the Spring Data REST Configs.

3
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.330
So we have our REST APIs in place

4
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.830
but we want to make sure that these REST APIs are read only

5
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.070
because in this scenario, there's no need for us

6
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.060
to make any modifications to the countries or states

7
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.830
because that's referenced data.

8
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.910
We don't want to modify that via the REST API.

9
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.370
So we'll use a similar approach that we used earlier

10
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.700
as far as kind of locking down the REST APIs

11
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.253
and we'll do that work here in our MyDataRestConfig class.

12
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.010
Already so let's expand this window here

13
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.740
and scroll to the top so at this moment

14
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.830
we should be in MyDataRestConfig

15
00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.220
and in the method configureRepositoryRestConfiguration

16
00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.420
that's where we disable HTTP methods for the product

17
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.480
and also for the product category.

18
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.330
Now, one thing about it here is that

19
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.670
you'll notice that this is duplicate code.

20
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.270
There's only really one thing here that's different,

21
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.560
everything else is the same.

22
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.880
So, we'll actually kind of take the duplicate code

23
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.083
and we'll refactor it into a reusable method.

24
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.830
So let me zoom in here.

25
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.710
So the only thing that's different in these code blocks here

26
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.360
is the line for domain type

27
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.190
and then we have product dot class and below we have

28
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.900
for domain type product category dot class.

29
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.010
Other than that, everything is the same

30
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.320
so we'll simply pass in the class as a parameter.

31
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.160
So first off, let's go ahead and grab

32
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.440
this section of code here and let's refactor it

33
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.593
and extract it as a method.

34
00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.860
So I'll choose as Refactor here and I'll say Extract Method

35
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.880
and now I can give the name of the new method

36
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.341
that they're going to extract here so I'll call it

37
00:02:07.341 --> 00:02:12.341
disableHttpMethods and I'll keep all the other defaults here

38
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.293
and I'll hit Refactor.

39
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.250
So notice here on line 40,

40
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.740
they have a method call for disableHttpMethods

41
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.920
and that's for the method that was just created here

42
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.320
at the bottom, so that's that refactor method

43
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.593
that the IDE created.

44
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.100
We still need to do one small change here

45
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.100
so we need to add a new method parameter pass in the class

46
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.340
because right now we still have product category

47
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.450
kind of hard coded inside of this method

48
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.443
and we want to pass this in as a parameter.

49
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.440
So I'll actually just take this little section here

50
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.020
for product category dot class and I'll just cut it

51
00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.820
to a little cut paste exercise here.

52
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.230
So I'll just cut that and then I'll paste it up here

53
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.983
so I'll pass it in as a parameter value.

54
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.060
So product category dot class config unsupportive actions

55
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.940
okay, that's fine

56
00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.910
and then I'll move back down the line 48.

57
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.640
Now use, tell it to use the method parameter

58
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.730
that's passed in the class.

59
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.463
That's the one that we justified on line 46.

60
00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.220
So now we're going to call this method

61
00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.040
and we'll disable the methods therefore

62
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.233
that given entity type or class.

63
00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.410
So let's do a similar thing up top here

64
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.980
so up top we have product class, the same code

65
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.060
so I'll just replace this code with our new methods.

66
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.440
So I'll just kind of grab this code and delete it really

67
00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.100
and I'll just copy this method here and then paste it

68
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:08.100
and so I'll disable methods for product dot class

69
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.513
and also for product category.

70
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.030
So I'll just sort of fix here on the imports

71
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.310
and there we go, so that's the same code that we had before

72
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.580
it's just been refactored into a reusable method here.

73
00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.020
So I like it, this is a bit cleaner

74
00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.893
than the coding that we had before.

75
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.720
And now let's go ahead and copy these two lines

76
00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.450
and then we'll do a similar thing here

77
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.970
for our other entities our new ones for country

78
00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.283
and also for state.

79
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:45.783
Okay, great!

80
00:04:45.783 --> 00:04:48.410
So now we're able to kind of lock down items here for country

81
00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.820
and state by using that same functionality

82
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.733
that we already have in place.

83
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.920
All right, so good job.

84
00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.870
So we've pretty much covered all the coding here

85
00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.410
for the back-end, we're in good shape

86
00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:01.690
and then the next set of videos,

87
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.330
we'll move into writing the code for the front-end.

88
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.153
So I'll see ya there.
