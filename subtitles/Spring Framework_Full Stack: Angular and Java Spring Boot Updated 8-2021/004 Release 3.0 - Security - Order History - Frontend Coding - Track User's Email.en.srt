1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,070
<v Instructor>Alrighty, so let's go ahead and get started.</v>

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,580
So in this video, we'll cover steps one and two

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,247
of keeping track of the user's email address

4
00:00:07,247 --> 00:00:10,303
and also creating new OrderHistory class.

5
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:20,140
Okay, so let's go ahead

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,373
and move into our login-status.component.

7
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,433
All right, so we're in login-status.component.ts.

8
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,630
I'll move down here and I'll add an entry

9
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,343
for the browser storage.

10
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:56,510
So this gives us a reference

11
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,613
to the web browser sessionStorage.

12
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,020
Now let's move down to this getUserDetails method.

13
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,480
So once the user's authenticated,

14
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,900
then we can get some data from the actual authentication

15
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,050
or response, in particular the email address.

16
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,750
So let's go ahead and do that now.

17
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,490
All right, so now that we have an email address,

18
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,573
let's go ahead and store the email in the browser storage.

19
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,370
So I make use of storage.setItem.

20
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:45,660
I give the key, userEmail and then the values

21
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,883
are a stringified version of the email.

22
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,410
So that's the new coding here

23
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,120
that we added to kind of keep track

24
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,406
of the user's email address.

25
00:02:01,406 --> 00:02:04,490
We'll make use of this and some other angler components

26
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,000
to retrieve it at a later time,

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,063
but at least now we have that person's email.

28
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,380
In step two, we're going to create the OrderHistory class.

29
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,030
So I'll just open up a new terminal window here

30
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,060
and I make use of the angular CLI

31
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,060
for ng generate class common/OrderHistory.

32
00:02:55,036 --> 00:02:56,410
All right, so let's zoom in here

33
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,690
and let's add some fields for this OrderHistory.

34
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:02,760
So we'll keep track of the ID, the order tracking number,

35
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,933
the total price, the total quantity, and also the date.

36
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,320
Alrighty, so this looks pretty good.

37
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,780
So we can use this information

38
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,663
when we display the list of orders.
