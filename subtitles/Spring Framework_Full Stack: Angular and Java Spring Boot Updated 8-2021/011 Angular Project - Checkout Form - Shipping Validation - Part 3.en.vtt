00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:02.560
<v Instructor>All right, so we have the validation</v>

2
00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.393
set up for country.

3
00:00:03.393 --> 00:00:05.300
Let's go ahead and edit for the other fields here

4
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.223
in this section.

5
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.610
So I'll just copy this section and move it down

6
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.110
to the next field that we're going to work with here.

7
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.560
And this is for street.

8
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.303
So edit right here after the street form control.

9
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.400
All right, so this is for street.

10
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.020
So we'll go through the same drill

11
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.490
of updating the reference here.

12
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.123
So this will be shipping address street.

13
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.840
And then a similar thing here for a dot dirty,

14
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.403
and similar thing for a touched shipping address street.

15
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.590
Error is required and this is a plain text field,

16
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.430
so they could possibly enter all spaces.

17
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.523
So we'll check for the errors, not only white space.

18
00:01:28.339 --> 00:01:29.460
And then we'll swing over here,

19
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.503
and we'll say street is required.

20
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.550
All right, so just kind of use this as a checkpoint,

21
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.753
make sure your code is updated accordingly.

22
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.250
And I'll just copy this section again,

23
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.193
move down to the city section.

24
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.340
So this is for city,

25
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.573
so we'll do a similar drill, shipping address city.

26
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.243
And I'll move down to the state section.

27
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.420
Just kind of copy what we have from before

28
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.200
and paste it right here for state.

29
00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.740
So we'll update this to shipping address state.

30
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:33.800
This is a dropdown list,

31
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.500
so we don't have to worry about the notOnlyWhitespace.

32
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.860
Let's just copy this section

33
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.483
and move down here for zip code.

34
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:14.980
And I'll make the updates here

35
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.523
for a shipping address zip code.

36
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:54.900
All righty, so those are the updates there

37
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.233
for shipping address zip code.

38
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.230
So this looks pretty good right now.

39
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:02.930
I'm happy with it.

40
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.103
Let's go ahead and test this out and see how this works.

41
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.700
So there's my shipping address here.

42
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.233
I'll swing to the bottom, and I'll hit Purchase.

43
00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.230
Go back up to the top, and all right, success.

44
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:23.100
So we have country.

45
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.270
We had that before,

46
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.530
and then the new field, street, city, state,

47
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.070
and zip code, all required.

48
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.903
Good job.
