1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:03,740
<v Instructor>Okay, so we've made some progress</v>

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,800
but I'd like to clean things up a bit

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,650
and I'd like to remove the hard-coded CORS configuration

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:10,483
because right now,

5
00:00:10,483 --> 00:00:12,850
you see we have the /api that's hard coded

6
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:16,020
and also we have the localhost:4200 that's hard coded.

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,950
And so let's clean this up a bit

8
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,300
and make use of some properties files for this.

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,923
So I'll move down to my application.properties file.

10
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:31,973
Zoom in here for a second.

11
00:00:37,839 --> 00:00:41,540
Then I'll add a new property here for allowed.origins

12
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,623
and I'll just move my localhost:4200 right here.

13
00:00:54,767 --> 00:00:57,423
And now just swinging back over to MyDataRestConfig.

14
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:11,020
And I'll set up a field up top

15
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,103
for the AllowedOrigins.

16
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:18,390
So this is a String array AllowedOrigins

17
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,810
as they could be multiple.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,643
And I'll make use of the @Value.

19
00:01:33,636 --> 00:01:35,350
And I give my dollar sign, curly brace

20
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:38,040
and I reference that actual property name,

21
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,640
allowed.origins and so this will actually inject the data

22
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,703
from the app.properties file.

23
00:01:54,053 --> 00:01:55,020
All right, so that part looks pretty good,

24
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,880
so now we can use this new field here

25
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,490
of the allowedOrigins and we can reference it here

26
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,340
in our code.

27
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,640
So remove the hard-coded data, add our variable, our field

28
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,190
and we're A-OK.

29
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,023
Good, I like it.

30
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:14,580
And then let's do a similar thing here for the path.

31
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,290
So instead of the /api,

32
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,893
we can read this information from our config.

33
00:02:27,964 --> 00:02:31,040
So the config object that's passed into this method

34
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,240
has a method getBasePath

35
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,730
and so it'll access the same information

36
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,893
from the properties file for us.

37
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:44,330
So that'll give us the actual mapping

38
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,730
for this given path pattern.

39
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,580
All right, so I think we've accomplished our task here

40
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,040
of removing the hard-coded information

41
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,713
from the CORS configuration setup.

42
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,010
All right, so I like to go ahead

43
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,950
and run this application and test it out,

44
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,313
just to see how these CORS mappings work out.

45
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,520
So I have my Boot application up and running.

46
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,020
I'll go ahead and start up my Angular application.

47
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,760
All righty, simply go and visit my application.

48
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,400
And we're able to get categories over here, that's great.

49
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,420
And able to get products, so this looks pretty good.

50
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,500
So those configurations that we set up,

51
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,403
those work out just fine.
