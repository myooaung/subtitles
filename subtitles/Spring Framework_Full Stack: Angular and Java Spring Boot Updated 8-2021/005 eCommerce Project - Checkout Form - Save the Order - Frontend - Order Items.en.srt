00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:02,430
<v Instructor>Okay, so let's go ahead</v>

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,373
and move in here and let's start writing the code.

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,280
So for setting up our order,

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,963
we'll just create a new instance.

5
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,550
And I'll update the values here

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,050
for total price and total quantity,

7
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,980
based on the values that we have

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:29,163
for our current checkout component, this.

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,420
Now I need to get the cart items from the cart service.

10
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:44,740
And basically what I want to do is kind of convert

11
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,800
those cart items into order items

12
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,230
and I need to kind of loop through it and make this happen.

13
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,745
I'll show you two ways of doing it.

14
00:00:51,745 --> 00:00:53,860
The first way will be the long way

15
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,933
and then I'll show you a short way.

16
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:00,730
So the long way is more of the traditional approach,

17
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,820
you know, you create an empty array

18
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,530
and then you simply loop through and you,

19
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,280
you know, create new objects based on the other object.

20
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,026
So we go through the loop

21
00:01:53,026 --> 00:01:55,970
and say order sub-I equals new order item,

22
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,070
pass in the cart item using that constructor

23
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,230
that we created earlier.

24
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,380
So that's kind of one approach of doing it.

25
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,710
So let me show you the short way of doing the same thing.

26
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,030
So we'll set up our order items short,

27
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,730
just giving it a unique name here.

28
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,433
And then I'll say cartItems.map.

29
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:51,370
And then I pass in new order item, temp card item.

30
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,280
So basically what this will do,

31
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,110
this will loop over the array and it'll return a new array

32
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,520
by applying the function to each element in that array.

33
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,300
So we're going to basically loop over cart items

34
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,680
and then map or convert that to order items.

35
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,223
So that's the short way.

36
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,910
So I'll common out the old code

37
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,073
and I'll simply rename this as just order items.

38
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:24,930
So anyways, I like keep the old code there

39
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,370
just so you can kind of jog your memory,

40
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,160
so you know exactly what's going on,

41
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,490
but that's the, you know,

42
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,733
the short way using cartItems.map.
