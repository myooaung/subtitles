00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:02,213
<v Instructor>All righty.</v>

2
00:00:02,213 --> 00:00:04,090
So let's go ahead and dive in here

3
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:05,370
and let's write the code here

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,833
for this computeCartTotals method.

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,080
So we'll just set up some variables here

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,447
for totalPriceValue and also totalQuantityValue.

7
00:00:30,735 --> 00:00:31,580
And this is really simple.

8
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,023
I simply loop over the cartItems

9
00:00:34,023 --> 00:00:36,213
and just add all these values together.

10
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,160
So for the totalPriceValue,

11
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,010
it's the currentCartItem.quantity

12
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,747
times currentCartItem.unitPrice.

13
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:05,708
And then a similar thing here for quantity.

14
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,930
And the next thing I need to do is publish the new values

15
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,530
for totalPrice and also totalQuantity.

16
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,023
And remember, all subscribers will receive the new data.

17
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:34,390
And so here I give totalPrice.next,

18
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:35,743
I pass in totalPriceValue,

19
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,130
and a similar thing here for totalQuantity.next

20
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,480
pass in totalQuantityValue.

21
00:01:49,687 --> 00:01:51,850
And so this will publish the events to all subscribers.

22
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,050
One event for totalPrice,

23
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,390
one event for totalQuantity.

24
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,230
So this is the part here where the CartService

25
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,740
is actually publishing events.

26
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,410
And remember, the .next method will actually publish

27
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,873
or send the event.

28
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,350
All righty, and then one other thing I'll add here

29
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,270
is I'll just add a method for logging in a cart data

30
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,040
just for debugging purposes,

31
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,780
just so we can kind of keep track of things

32
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,520
as far as what's going on behind the scenes.

33
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,230
So I'll have this method here, logCartData,

34
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,220
I'll pass in the totalPriceValue

35
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,750
and the totalQuantityValue.

36
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,130
Just a little helper method

37
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,553
to help us out here in this class.

38
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:52,710
So again, this method here=,

39
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,870
we're just logging the contents of the cart.

40
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,160
I'll simply do a loop over the cartItems

41
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,270
and then just log information here.

42
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,420
So I simply log the name, the quantity,

43
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,233
the unitPrice, and also the subTotalPrice.

44
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,680
All right now kind of just scroll over

45
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,840
just so you can see everything.

46
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,080
This is a big long line here.

47
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,820
So name, quantity, unitPrice and subTotalPrice.

48
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,453
That's what we're logging right now.

49
00:04:51,408 --> 00:04:53,804
All righty and so we'll also log the totalPrice

50
00:04:53,804 --> 00:04:55,040
and totalQuantity.

51
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,580
So here I have the totalPriceValue.toFixed of two.

52
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,070
So only show two digits after the decimal.

53
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,010
And you can apply this for other price related items

54
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,253
here and the code as needed.

55
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:21,720
And then we give totalQuantity, the totalQuantityValue.

56
00:05:31,877 --> 00:05:34,090
And then finally, I'll just give a little line separator

57
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:36,310
to make things pretty in the logs

58
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,543
when we view everything.

59
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:41,030
And that's pretty much it here

60
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43,393
for this logCartData method.
