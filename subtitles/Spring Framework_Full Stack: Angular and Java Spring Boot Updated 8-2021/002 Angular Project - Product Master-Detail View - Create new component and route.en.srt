1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:02,250
<v Instructor>Alrighty, so let's go ahead</v>

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,420
and get started with our development process.

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:06,620
In this video, we'll cover steps one and two

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,080
of creating a component

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,163
and adding a new Angular route for product details.

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,070
Alrighty, as far as housekeeping,

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,510
there's one thing we have to do first

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,570
is starting up our Spring Boot backend

9
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,123
if it's not already running.

10
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,007
So I'll just run my SpringBootEcommerceApplication.

11
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,500
And I want to just test some rest end points real quick

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,290
on my spring boot backend.

13
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:46,510
So I'll open up this localhost:8080/api/products/1.

14
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:47,430
This'll basically allow me

15
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,133
to get the product with the id of one.

16
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,500
Alright this looks great.

17
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,390
So this is actually a built-in feature of Spring Data REST.

18
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,220
There's no additional coding or configuration required.

19
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,030
You get this out of the box with Spring Data REST.

20
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,850
And so our Angular app will use this end point

21
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,123
for retrieving details for a given product.

22
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,790
Alright so let's go ahead swing into Visual Studio code.

23
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,780
And let's go ahead and cover step one of creating

24
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,863
a new component for product details.

25
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,013
Okay, I'll open up a new terminal window.

26
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,173
And gimme one second,

27
00:01:35,173 --> 00:01:37,510
I'll kind of expand the window here for a second.

28
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,683
And I'll zoom in.

29
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,500
Let's go ahead and move into

30
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,913
the correct directory, angular-ecommerce.

31
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,413
And we'll make us of our ng generate component.

32
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:51,283
And give components/ProductDetails.

33
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,600
Okay great so it created the appropriate files for us.

34
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:10,200
And then we'll see under our source directory,

35
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,210
app, components, we should have

36
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:16,830
a new directory here called product-details.

37
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,180
Good, so looks pretty good.

38
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,220
So in step two, I need to add

39
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,600
the new Angular route for product details.

40
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,533
And so I do this in the file app.module.ts.

41
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,410
I'll just expand this window here for a second and zoom in.

42
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,913
I'll do a quick copy paste on one of these routes.

43
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,190
And I'll just update it here.

44
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,363
I'll say, products/:id.

45
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:53,600
And then the actual component

46
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,233
is gone be the ProductDetailsComponent.

47
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:07,330
Alright ProductDetailsComponent.

48
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,980
Okay great, that takes care of step two

49
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,773
of adding the route for the product details.
