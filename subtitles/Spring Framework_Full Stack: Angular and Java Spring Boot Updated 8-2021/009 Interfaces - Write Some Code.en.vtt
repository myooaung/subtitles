00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.000
<v Instructor>Okay, let's go ahead and zoom in</v>

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.763
and let's create a new folder,

3
00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.423
and I'll call this folder 07-interfaces.

4
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.940
And now, let's go ahead and create a new file,

5
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.793
and this is for my interface Coach.ts.

6
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.120
So, let's swing over here

7
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.580
and I'll create my interface.

8
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.580
So, export interface Coach

9
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.550
and then I'll add the given method here

10
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.573
for this interface, getDailyWorkout.

11
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.230
And again, remember there's no implementation,

12
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.040
no body, this'll be implemented

13
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.593
by the given classes.

14
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.040
So, let's swing back over here

15
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.513
and let's create a new file.

16
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.793
And so, this is for CricketCoach.ts.

17
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.523
And so, we'll export this class CricketCoach

18
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.483
implements Coach.

19
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.230
So, it can't find the Coach,

20
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.710
but we simply do a quick fix here

21
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.873
and tell it to import Coach for us.

22
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.070
And now, it says that this CricketCoach

23
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.870
incorrectly implements the interface,

24
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.580
so we need to have this given method getDailyWorkout.

25
00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.730
And we can also make use of the quick fix here,

26
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.010
say implement the interface for me.

27
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.843
Very good.

28
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.890
So, for getDailyWorkout, I remove the placeholder code

29
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.270
and then I add the given implementation here

30
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.340
for the CricketCoach.

31
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.007
So, here I'll say return "Practice your spin bowling."

32
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.413
All right, so that looks really good.

33
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.050
Now, let's swing back over here

34
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.947
and create a new file for our GolfCoach.

35
00:02:27.596 --> 00:02:28.670
And so, a similar thing here,

36
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.670
export class GolfCoach implements Coach.

37
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.723
We do the quick fix here on the import,

38
00:02:45.672 --> 00:02:47.450
and then we do the quick fix here

39
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.193
to implement the interface.

40
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.970
And now, we provide the appropriate workout.

41
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.577
So, I'll say, "Hit 100 balls at the golf range."

42
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.313
All right, so this looks really good here for GolfCoach.

43
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.670
Alrighty, and then let's swing over here one more time

44
00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.460
and let's create another new file,

45
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.160
that's for our driver to kind of pull it all together.

46
00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.330
Alrighty, so let's go ahead and move into our Driver,

47
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.310
and let's create some coaches.

48
00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.940
So, first off here I'll create myCricketCoach

49
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.243
equals new CricketCoach.

50
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.010
And then, a similar thing here for myGolfCoach

51
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.857
equals new GolfCoach.

52
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.180
Now, let's declare an array for coaches,

53
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.473
so it's initially empty.

54
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.700
So, we've seen some of this coding before.

55
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.293
Let's do an import on Coach.

56
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.440
So, I add theCoaches to the array.

57
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.280
I give myCoaches.push myCricketCoach,

58
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.630
and I'll do a similar thing here for GolfCoach.

59
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.780
Now, scroll down a bit and I'll set up my for loop.

60
00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.180
So, tempCoach of theCoaches.

61
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.613
And I'll do a log on getDailWorkout.

62
00:05:29.177 --> 00:05:31.283
All right, so open up a terminal window,

63
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.303
move into this new directory here, 07-interfaces.

64
00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.840
I'll also generate that tsconfig.json file

65
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.513
by using that tsc dash dash init.

66
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.698
Open that file and add my one entry here,

67
00:05:48.698 --> 00:05:50.543
noEmitOnError for true.

68
00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.083
So now, I can move back over here and compile.

69
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:12.600
So now, I go ahead and run the application

70
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.560
and I see the output "Practice your spin bowling technique"

71
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.210
and also "Hit 100 balls."

72
00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:19.880
All right, so this works out great.

73
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.890
So, we have interfaces up and running

74
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.793
with TypeScript, good job!
