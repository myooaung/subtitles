00:00:01.232 --> 00:00:02.065
<v Instructor>All righty, so let's go ahead</v>

2
00:00:02.065 --> 00:00:03.630
and get started here with refactoring

3
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.683
our cart.service.ts file.

4
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.030
Just move down here and I'll open up

5
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.093
that given file cart.service.ts.

6
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.163
Let me zoom out a bit and expand my window.

7
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.173
Okay, so we're in cart service.

8
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.850
Let's move down to this add to cart method.

9
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.530
This is where we're going to kind of focus on

10
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.733
and do our main work here.

11
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.880
There's that for loop.

12
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.720
And this is the code that we're going to refactor.

13
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.360
So let's just go ahead and remove this code

14
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.903
or delete this code.

15
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.273
All right so that's removed.

16
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.590
And now let's add in that new code

17
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.170
that we learned about using that new code .find method.

18
00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.360
So here I'll say existingCartItem

19
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.543
equals this.cartItems.find.

20
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.640
I'll pass in the loop parameter that we're going to use,

21
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.990
we'll call it tempCartItem.

22
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.530
We can actually give it any name here

23
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.610
but I just like to keep it simple.

24
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.300
And then also check with our conditional here,

25
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.500
tempCartItem.id equals theCartItem.

26
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.210
And so remember theCartItem is the parameter

27
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.123
that's being passed into this add to cart method.

28
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.140
All right and just kind of zooming in here

29
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.630
so remember find returns

30
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.020
the first element that passes, else returns undefined.

31
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.410
We have our test that's executed

32
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.420
for each element in the array

33
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.360
until the test passes.

34
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.680
So that's our test conditional here.

35
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.510
And we also have the current array element

36
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.160
that we can use for looping over it.

37
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.000
So this current array element you can actually give it

38
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.420
any name that you want

39
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.360
but here I just like to, you know, keep it normal here

40
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.900
and call it tempCartItem.

41
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.580
But we could have easily called this current array element

42
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.340
x, y, or z just make sure

43
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.053
you update the test conditional accordingly.

44
00:02:08.392 --> 00:02:09.450
And we can kind of zoom out a bit

45
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.963
just so we can kind of see everything together.

46
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.920
I'll just scroll over a bit here

47
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.460
so we see the addToCart method

48
00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.713
and we have this work that we just add in a line 26.

49
00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:28.840
All right, so let's go ahead and test this out,

50
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.470
I'll just open up a new terminal window

51
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.533
and I'll start my application.

52
00:02:44.525 --> 00:02:45.650
All righty, so I'm going to add those up,

53
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.000
let's go ahead and swing over into our browser.

54
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.853
I'll open up my web developer tools for the console.

55
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:00.483
And we can go through

56
00:03:00.483 --> 00:03:02.590
and just start adding some items to the cart.

57
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.050
And then we can see that our shopping cart

58
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.710
still works as desired

59
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.560
so it's able to increment quantity items

60
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.120
and add items to the cart and so on.

61
00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.826
And so all of our same functionality is working out

62
00:03:13.826 --> 00:03:15.623
just fine for us.

63
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.003
So this is great,

64
00:03:18.003 --> 00:03:19.940
so our refactoring was successful.

65
00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.143
So I'd like to say good job.
