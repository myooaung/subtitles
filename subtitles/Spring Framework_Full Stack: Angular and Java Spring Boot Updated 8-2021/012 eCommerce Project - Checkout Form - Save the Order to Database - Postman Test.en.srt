1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,700
<v Tutor>All right so, let's run it.</v>

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,223
Ready to run this.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,040
So I just fire it up in my IDE,

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,890
start the app, get it up and running.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,280
And then I need to make use of

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,423
that sample-purchase.json

7
00:00:17,423 --> 00:00:19,693
that we downloaded a little bit earlier.

8
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,990
So I like to run this with Postman

9
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,850
and test it out.

10
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,133
So let me go ahead and start Postman.

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,160
And so I'll zoom in here,

12
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,300
and I'll update my request.

13
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,640
So for the one thing I'll do

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,283
is I'll make it a POST method.

15
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,300
And then I'll enter the request URL

16
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,393
that I have here on the screen.

17
00:00:55,641 --> 00:00:56,474
So that's localhost:8080/api/checkout/purchase.

18
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,090
And then I'll select body,

19
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,693
I'll go to raw and choose the type of JSON.

20
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,820
So now, we need to add some JSON here for the body.

21
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,650
So let me kind of swing back over to my file system

22
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,680
to that Downloads directory.

23
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,600
And let's open up that sample-purchase.json,

24
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,430
you just open it up with any one of your text editors,

25
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:31,253
and just copy-paste that into Postman.

26
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,000
All right, there it is.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,144
It's in Postman now.

28
00:01:40,144 --> 00:01:41,580
And I just do some small little massaging

29
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,323
on the customer names here.

30
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,433
And then also here,

31
00:01:56,433 --> 00:01:57,930
shipping address, billing address,

32
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,988
I'll make sure that those are the same addresses here.

33
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:04,930
So I'll just kind of copy some of this stuff.

34
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,820
So I'm just going to copy the shipping address content

35
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,870
and put it down here for billing address.

36
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,570
All right. So that looks pretty good.

37
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,143
So let's go ahead and send it across our API.

38
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,940
All right, look at that order tracking number.

39
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,390
And that's that UUID,

40
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,630
that random UUID that was generated.

41
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,690
Oh, yeah.

42
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,870
I'm happy about that.

43
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,820
That's pretty good.

44
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,820
And let's swing over to our database

45
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:38,190
and see if this is in our database.

46
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,650
So move back to the Orders table

47
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,840
and run this query again.

48
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,000
And oh, yeah,

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,080
so that's the same tracking number that we had in Postman.

50
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,430
So I like to say, success.

51
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:53,300
So we were successful in storing our purchase order

52
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,720
in the database.

53
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,330
We can look at some of the other items here,

54
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,010
we can take a look at customer.

55
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,250
So there's our Susan Smith.

56
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,133
Okay, great.

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,550
And so all of our relationships are working out okay.

58
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,580
Address good, Canada.

59
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,413
All right.

60
00:03:06,413 --> 00:03:08,010
Good, good, good.

61
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,800
Order Items.

62
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,060
Okay, we have two items there.

63
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:12,893
Good, good.

64
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:15,950
Associated with a given order ID.

65
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:16,783
Good.

66
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,210
All right. So just kind of standing back

67
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,500
and admiring our work,

68
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,460
looking here at this checkout controller.

69
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,440
Based on architecture,

70
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,810
we had the controller talking to the service

71
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,950
using that Spring Data JPA repository,

72
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,250
and saving information in the database for us.

73
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,580
And we also did some custom work here

74
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,530
by making use of that custom order tracking number

75
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,420
that we generated.

76
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,380
So this looks really good.

77
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,570
I'm happy.

78
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:50,403
Good job.
