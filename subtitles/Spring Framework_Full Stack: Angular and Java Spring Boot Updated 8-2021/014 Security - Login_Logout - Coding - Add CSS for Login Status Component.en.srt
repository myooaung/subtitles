1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:02,810
<v ->Okay, so now we'll go ahead</v>

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:05,930
and take a look at doing some layout work for our component

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,333
and also adding some CSS support.

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,910
So let me move into my login status component.html,

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,530
expand my window,

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,180
I'll get rid of all the previous stuff that was here.

7
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:24,840
And basically what I want to do here

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,720
is have this new component

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,370
where we have a login button.

10
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,810
And then also once they're logged in

11
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,460
we want to have an area where we can display the user's name

12
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,063
and a log out button.

13
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,583
So we'll just set up a div as the main container here.

14
00:00:54,492 --> 00:00:56,550
And what I'll do here is set up an ngIf

15
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,780
I'll check to see if the user's authenticated

16
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,060
and also if their username is set,

17
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,970
if so then I'll actually display a welcome message

18
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:04,843
to the user.

19
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,053
So we'll say, Hey, welcome back, user full name.

20
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,520
Now we'll display some buttons

21
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,533
depending on their actual authentication status.

22
00:01:32,983 --> 00:01:35,210
So here, if they're not authenticated

23
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:38,203
then we'll actually show them the login button.

24
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,090
All right, so that's the login button

25
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,255
that'll send them over to this

26
00:01:51,255 --> 00:01:52,820
routerLink/login

27
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,673
and we'll take care of the router links in a bit.

28
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,040
The third item here is ngIf,

29
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,620
and we'll say if is authenticated,

30
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:09,113
then we'll actually show them the log out button.

31
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,760
And then we'll just change the routerLink portion to be

32
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,670
an actual event binding forward click.

33
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,870
And once you to code the log out method

34
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,790
and then we'll move over here

35
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:34,150
and we'll give the text for the button to be logged out.

36
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,700
So effectively here, if they're already logged in

37
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,453
then we'll show the log out button.

38
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,340
So this will kind of give us the layout here

39
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,850
for the coding here for a login button

40
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,460
meaning that they're not logged in.

41
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,930
If they are logged in already

42
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,270
then we'll show them a welcome message

43
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,420
along with a log out button.

44
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,780
So that's kind of the basics,

45
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,710
the source of the layout here for our

46
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,173
login status component.

47
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,770
Now there are a couple of CSS styles that I used here

48
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,290
that we haven't really defined yet.

49
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,910
So we actually need to go through the process

50
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,593
of getting that part set up.

51
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,600
And what we'll do is we'll actually

52
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,920
put this information into our

53
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,600
login-status.component.css.

54
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,850
Now in previous videos we never really use the CSSs

55
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,440
for the actual component,

56
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,310
We will kind of put them into the main file

57
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,560
for our styles.css.

58
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,420
But in this video, just to show you a different approach

59
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,740
we'll actually put our local styles

60
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:35,090
for this component in its own CSS file.

61
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,580
Again, you can do it either way

62
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,510
you can put everything into one big style CSS

63
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,810
or you can put them in smaller specific file

64
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:44,600
so think about it working on a much larger project

65
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,440
you may want to have separate CSS files per component

66
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,630
just so you can kind of keep track of

67
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,850
which styles belongs to which components.

68
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,560
Again, it can work either way

69
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,810
I'm just showing you an alternative approach.

70
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,840
So what we'll actually do is we'll copy some CSS styles

71
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,747
from styles.css and then we'll rename them

72
00:04:09,747 --> 00:04:12,943
and we'll use them here for the login status component.

73
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,770
And we'll also make some slight maths to them.

74
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,350
So I move it to the style CSS

75
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:35,800
and I'm going to copy this au-button submit.

76
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,120
So I'm in style CSS right now

77
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,000
and I'll just do a search

78
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,703
for this au-button.

79
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:56,040
Yeah, the au-button submit that's what I want.

80
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,663
So let's go ahead and select this and copy it,

81
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,330
then I'll swing back over to my login status component CSS

82
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,480
and I'll paste it here.

83
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,560
I'll do the quick rename on it,

84
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,208
let me just fix my comments

85
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,743
so it matches with what I said, okay.

86
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,500
And I'll do a rename, call it security button

87
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:29,330
and then just a slight math here

88
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,623
I'll just change the border to 10 pixels.

89
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,820
And that's the only real change here for this style.

90
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,960
But we gave it a different name

91
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,760
so if we wanted to make any maths to it

92
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,900
it wouldn't affect the entire application

93
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,200
just the styles here for this given component.

94
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,370
And then we'll move to the next video

95
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,430
and we'll do a similar thing as far as adding

96
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,237
or incorporating more styles for this component.
