00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.010
<v Instructor>Alrighty, so we're almost done.</v>

2
00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.110
So in this video, we'll cover the last two steps.

3
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.080
We'll cover step six of adding the orders button

4
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.520
to the login status component

5
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.730
and step seven of defining a protected route

6
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.363
for the order-history component.

7
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.130
Let's go ahead and move over

8
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.433
to our login-status.component.html file.

9
00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.800
And we're simply going to add a new button here for orders.

10
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.470
So we'll just copy one of the lines

11
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.463
that we had from before and paste it here.

12
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.610
So isAuthenticated is fine,

13
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.370
but routerLink will be to order-history

14
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.850
and then the actual value for the button

15
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.733
or label for the button, will be orders.

16
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.080
All right, so that's the updates

17
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.380
that you should have right now for this entry.

18
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.600
Now, moving ahead to step seven,

19
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.870
we'll define a protected route

20
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.723
for the order-history component.

21
00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.523
So we'll move over to our app.module.ts file.

22
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.548
And let's move down to the section

23
00:01:49.548 --> 00:01:51.253
where we define the routes.

24
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.827
And let's go ahead and copy this members route,

25
00:01:56.827 --> 00:01:59.620
'cause it has a lot of the stuff that we already need

26
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.113
and then we'll paste it here.

27
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.830
So the actual path is order-history

28
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.493
and this is going to reference our order history component.

29
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.850
And then we have the canActivate for Okta Guard,

30
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.400
so that gives us security there

31
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.720
to make sure no one can backdoor our route

32
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.010
or access it directly

33
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.963
without being logged in or authenticated.

34
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.520
All right, so let's go ahead and run this and test it out.

35
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.260
So just make sure your Spring Boot back in

36
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.093
is up and running.

37
00:02:42.093 --> 00:02:43.720
If not, go ahead and start it now.

38
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.460
Then we'll swing over and start our angular app.

39
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.810
Alrighty, so I just move over to our browser

40
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.513
and access our application.

41
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.613
And so thing to notice here

42
00:03:14.613 --> 00:03:16.630
is that since you're not logged in,

43
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.110
you don't see the orders button right now.

44
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.160
So you have to log in

45
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.210
before you can access that functionality.

46
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.823
Alrighty, I'm logged in now, but ooh, we have a problem.

47
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.380
This is ugly.

48
00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.460
All right, so we added too much stuff here

49
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.930
and the CSS is not working out right

50
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.220
and we're kind of running out of space, so this is bad.

51
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.220
We can actually resolve this issue

52
00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.330
by reducing the width of the search bar.

53
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.040
We basically need some more space over there

54
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.390
for all of these new buttons that we're adding.

55
00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.170
So let's go ahead and do some CSS work

56
00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.260
to kind of fix this up real quick.

57
00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.283
Ew, that is ugly.

58
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.493
So let's move down to our styles.css file.

59
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.200
And I'll kind of move up to the top of his file.

60
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.030
And I want to search, or I want to find some text

61
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.163
and I'm going to search for this text au-input.

62
00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.570
So just go ahead and do like a CONTROL + F or whatever

63
00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.377
and search for au-input

64
00:04:31.377 --> 00:04:34.220
and you should find it down here around this area.

65
00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.730
And basically what I want to do, is just modify the width.

66
00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.800
So this is a CSS style that's used for that search bar

67
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.420
and I simply want to change the width,

68
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.680
right now it has min-width of 935.

69
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.030
I'm going to shrink that down a bit,

70
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.173
so, you know, we have some more space on our UE.

71
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.653
So I'll just drop that down to 500.

72
00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.810
And then I'll save that and swing back over

73
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.850
and all right, success.

74
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.390
So we were able to resolve that issue

75
00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.460
by reducing the width of the search bar.

76
00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.063
So this looks good, I like it.
