00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.670
<v Instructor>Alrighty, so let's get started</v>

2
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:04.860
with our development process, so in the first step here

3
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.660
we're going to run our database script.

4
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.710
So let's move into our web browser

5
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.453
and download the database script.

6
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.143
Simply go to the link that I have here on the slide,

7
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.423
and that'll download the file to your file system.

8
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.740
Let's go ahead and navigate over

9
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.763
to where that file is located, I'll unzip it.

10
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.320
So there's two files here, one is the SQL file

11
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.980
that we'll use for setting up our tables,

12
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.670
and then there's another JSON file that we'll use later

13
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:50.560
when we get into the part

14
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.470
of actually running our application.

15
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.850
So let's go ahead and open up MySQL Workbench

16
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.240
and we'll open up that SQL file.

17
00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.763
So first I'll connect,

18
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.060
and then I'll open up that SQL script

19
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.493
that I just downloaded.

20
00:01:15.403 --> 00:01:19.403
And now I'll just go ahead and execute this SQL.

21
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.140
Great, so we have all green at the bottom, that's good,

22
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.890
let's go over here and Refresh All.

23
00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.020
And we should have some new tables here,

24
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.020
one for address, one for customer, order_item and orders.

25
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:39.680
So these tables are created,

26
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.380
we can see the relationship with the tables here

27
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.230
by looking at the diagram that I have here on the screen.

28
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.830
Now let's go ahead and take a look at some of the tables

29
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.870
and see what's out there, so I'll go to orders.

30
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:50.810
Okay, right now it's empty,

31
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.040
which makes sense, we haven't done anything yet,

32
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.870
and a similar thing for the other tables, they're all empty.

33
00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.610
Once we run our code and run our application

34
00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.933
then we'll start populating these tables with data.
