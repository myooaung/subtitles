00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.050
<v Instructor>All righty, so we have circle and shape</v>

2
00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:04.060
taken care of.

3
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.660
Let's go ahead and create a new file for our driver.

4
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.160
And so, in our driver, we're going to kind of pull things

5
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.350
all together here by creating an instance of shape

6
00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.390
and also creating an instance of circle

7
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.080
and just culling some of the methods.

8
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.130
So the first thing I'll do up top is I'll just do an import

9
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.253
on shape and also an import on circle.

10
00:00:41.352 --> 00:00:46.352
And now, I'll go ahead and create an instance of shape.

11
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.903
So I'll create a new shape, x, y.

12
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.160
And then I'll just simply do a console.log

13
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.923
on myShape.getInfo.

14
00:01:00.021 --> 00:01:01.900
And then I'll do a similar thing here for circle.

15
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.440
So, myCircle equals new Circle.

16
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.723
Pass in the x, y, comma the radius.

17
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.930
And then I do a console.log on myCircle.getInfo.

18
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:20.443
Okay, this looks good.

19
00:01:20.443 --> 00:01:22.843
So let's go ahead and open up a new terminal window.

20
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.180
And I'll move into that directory, 05-inheritance/.

21
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.340
And the one thing I want to do is create

22
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.930
a typescript config file, so that tsconfig.json.

23
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.330
And so, remember, I can create this by using tsc--init

24
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.110
so it'll create that .json file for me.

25
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.440
I can open this file and the one entry I want to add here

26
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.440
is I want to add the entry here for noEmitOnError.

27
00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.148
So, if there's a compilation error, don't generate code.

28
00:02:00.148 --> 00:02:02.430
(laughs)

29
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.900
All right, so that's in place and we are a-okay

30
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.623
with the tsconfig.json.

31
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.570
So now I can move back into my terminal window,

32
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:12.403
do a compile.

33
00:02:12.403 --> 00:02:14.050
So that compiles just fine.

34
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.970
No errors.

35
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.773
And now I can run the driver application.

36
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.050
And then we get the desired output here.

37
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.460
This is all from the driver here.

38
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.420
So, the first line is for myShape.

39
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.590
And then the second line is for myCircle.

40
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.740
Simply culling those getInfo methods on those given shapes.

41
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:34.780
All right, this looks great.

42
00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.250
So, we have inheritance working with typescript.

43
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.900
In the next video, we're going to add some more features

44
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.103
to this given project.
