1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:02,620
<v Instructor>In this video, we're going to populate</v>

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,513
the Country-State Drop-Down list.

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,800
On the form for our shipping address,

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,560
we need to populate the drop-down list for countries

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,960
and also populate the drop-down list for States.

6
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,080
So what we'll do is we'll populate the countries

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,090
and States from the backend REST API,

8
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:24,510
we'll pull information from the database.

9
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,310
The user will select the country,

10
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,040
and then depending on the country select,

11
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,190
we'll populate the list of States.

12
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:34,010
Now the term "State" is different for each country.

13
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,090
So in the US we make use of States,

14
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,560
but I know in other parts of the world

15
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,820
or in other countries,

16
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,860
they have other names like Province, Districts,

17
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,420
Regions, Prefecture, so on.

18
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,090
So basically whatever administrative region

19
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,110
is used for your country simply use that name,

20
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:53,123
but I'll simply use state here just to keep things simple.

21
00:00:56,566 --> 00:00:57,399
All right, so let's go ahead

22
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:58,540
and look at our development process.

23
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,890
And this is for the backend development.

24
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:01,780
The first thing that we'll do

25
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,610
is we'll create the database tables

26
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,770
and then we'll develop a JPA Entities for country and state.

27
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:09,700
Next we'll create the Spring Data Repositories,

28
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,650
and then finally we'll update our Spring Data REST Configs.

29
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,270
All right, step one of creating the database tables.

30
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,560
So here we'll have two tables.

31
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,150
We'll have a country table and a state table.

32
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,930
So for country, we'll have the ID, the code and the name.

33
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,680
For state we'll have the ID, name and the country ID.

34
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,083
So the country ID maps back to the actual country.

35
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,620
So basically many States will belong to one country

36
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,800
and one country has many States.

37
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,180
And the nice thing here is that we can make use

38
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,990
of some of these advanced mappings,

39
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,900
one to many and many to one.

40
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,550
And we'll be able to pull this together

41
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,343
in our eCommerce application.

42
00:01:51,538 --> 00:01:54,150
All right, so here's the SQL for creating those tables.

43
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,880
So we create the table country.

44
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,900
We have the columns ID, code and name.

45
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,073
We specify the ID is the primary key.

46
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,210
And then we also create a table for state,

47
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,450
ID name, country ID.

48
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:10,200
So country ID is actually a foreign key

49
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:15,580
and that country ID maps back to the actual ID column

50
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,713
of the country table.

51
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,040
All right, so let's go ahead

52
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,210
and insert data into our database.

53
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,700
So we'll insert some data into the country table.

54
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,500
So we'll insert data for Brazil, Canada, Germany,

55
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,860
India, Turkey, and the United States.

56
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,510
The values here are ID, code and name.

57
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,750
And you may wonder why only six countries,

58
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,970
as you know, there are more countries in the world.

59
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,250
Well, at the moment, these are the six countries

60
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,090
that our fictional company, Love to shop,

61
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,370
can actually ship products to.

62
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,450
Of course, we're just making this up,

63
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,070
but we're a small startup

64
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,400
and hopefully in the future,

65
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,860
our company will expand and we'll be able to ship

66
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,320
to more countries in the future.

67
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,210
Now this is just a little classroom example,

68
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:06,260
feel free to add more countries to the database.

69
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,683
It's totally up to you.

70
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,610
And we'll do a similar thing here for States.

71
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,020
So when you enter a state,

72
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,067
you're entering the States for a given country

73
00:03:14,067 --> 00:03:16,470
and so the values here are the ID,

74
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,633
common name and the given country ID.

75
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,640
So at the top we have the country ID of one ,

76
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,320
that's for Brazil

77
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,660
and then down here at the bottom,

78
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,513
we have the country ID of four, that's for India.

79
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,390
And once we actually run a real SQL,

80
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,510
you'll see all the data and how everything maps out.

81
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,663
So you'll get access to all of these files.

82
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,830
Now, once everything is populated,

83
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,610
then we can actually do some queries on the data.

84
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:45,020
So I can do a select star from country,

85
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,010
get all the countries that are available

86
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,090
and then here I could say select star from state,

87
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,900
where country ID equals four.

88
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,320
And so that'll give me a list of all of the States

89
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,463
for India.

90
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,730
Now step two of developing the JPA Entities

91
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:01,993
for country and state.

92
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,090
So we have our country entity.

93
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,430
This is all fairly straightforward,

94
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,570
you've seen us before.

95
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:10,390
We define our fields here for ID code and name,

96
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,390
we set up the mappings for the appropriate database columns.

97
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,570
And then we also do a similar thing here for a state,

98
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,223
we make use of the fields and also the columns.

99
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,690
And then notice here at the bottom,

100
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:25,810
we have our advanced mapping relationships here,

101
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:26,830
one to many.

102
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,373
So one country has many States.

103
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,250
And then over on the right hand side for State,

104
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,730
many States belong to one country.

105
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:36,970
All right, so we have the one to many

106
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,180
and the many to one,

107
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,203
for this JPA entity mapping relationship.

108
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,220
And so now in step three,

109
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,760
we're going to create our Spring Data REST Repositories.

110
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,910
So here's our interface,

111
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:52,010
country repository extends JPA repository.

112
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,580
And remember here we give the actual entity class,

113
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,693
comma, the primary key type.

114
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,330
So here our entities country,

115
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,233
the primary key type is Integer.

116
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,380
And then we make use of this repository risk resource,

117
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,130
we customize it by saying path equals countries.

118
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:12,020
And so this will expose as slash country's end point

119
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,033
for this given Spring Data REST Repository.

120
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,560
And so now to retrieve all countries,

121
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,440
we'll simply go to local host 8080,

122
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,017
slash API slash countries

123
00:05:22,017 --> 00:05:24,420
and that will give us a list of all the countries

124
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,730
for this given up.

125
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:28,100
And then also to retrieve country ID equal four,

126
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,320
we go to local host 8080

127
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,503
slash API slash countries, slash four.

128
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,250
All right, so let's look at the JSON output

129
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,110
for these REST APIs.

130
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,130
So here to retrieve all countries.

131
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,190
Then I'll see my JSON here at the bottom.

132
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,550
So for the countries, Brazil and Canada

133
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,520
And then to retrieve a country ID equals four,

134
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,770
then I can see the output here

135
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:54,850
and this'll give me the actual country for India.

136
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,280
And we'll run examples of this

137
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,753
when we actually get our API up and running.

138
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,560
Now let's do a similar thing here for States.

139
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,810
So we set up our interfaces,

140
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:08,600
state repository extends JPA repository,

141
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,000
state comma Integer.

142
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,110
This exposes as slash States end point.

143
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,690
And so then I can get a list of all the States

144
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,753
by going to API slash States.

145
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,300
But we'd probably want to kind of customize this a bit

146
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,810
because I don't want all the States,

147
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:27,040
I only want States for a given country.

148
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,920
So I want to find by country code.

149
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,030
So give me the States for a given country.

150
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:36,580
So here I have find by country code, Eparam code.

151
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,730
And then I'll pass in Eparam string code.

152
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,360
So this will give me the States

153
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,983
by the given country code that I pass in.

154
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,060
So here's an example.

155
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,430
Here I have slash search,

156
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,500
slash find by country code,

157
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,727
code equals IN that's for India.

158
00:06:51,727 --> 00:06:54,880
And I can do a similar thing here for code equals US,

159
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,870
that's for the United States.

160
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:01,160
So this only gimme States for that specific country code.

161
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,210
And this will work out great for us in our user Interface

162
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,360
because once the user selects a given country

163
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,450
in the user Interface,

164
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,560
they want to populate drop-down lists

165
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,973
with the States for that given country code.

166
00:07:16,065 --> 00:07:17,410
All right, so here's a quick example

167
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:19,710
as far as the JSON outputs.

168
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,440
Country code, code is equal IN for India,

169
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,380
then I'll get all the States for India.

170
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,290
A similar thing here,

171
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,530
code is equal US,

172
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,173
I get all the States for the US.

173
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,160
And again, we'll kind of pull this all together

174
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,820
once we get the backend up and running,

175
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,390
then we'll hook it into the front end

176
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:38,233
for our user Interface that's running in angular.

177
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,300
Then the last step here is

178
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,120
Updating the Spring Data REST Configs.

179
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,430
So we're going to update our coding

180
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,550
for my Data Rest config dot Java.

181
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,560
We're going to make the APIs for slash country and slash state,

182
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,800
make it read only because this is referenced data.

183
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,740
There's no real need to change it via the REST API.

184
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,900
So we'll simply disable the HTTP methods

185
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,100
for our PUT, POST, et cetera.

186
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,790
I want to get into the coding details

187
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,280
of this in the next video.

188
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,510
So it'll be easier for us

189
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,903
to just walk through the code in our IDE.

190
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,770
All right, this is good stuff.

191
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:11,940
Let's go ahead and move to the next video

192
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,853
and let's start writing some code.
