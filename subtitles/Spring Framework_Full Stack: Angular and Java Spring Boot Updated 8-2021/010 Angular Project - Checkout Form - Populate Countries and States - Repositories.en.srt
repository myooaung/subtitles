1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:02,990
<v Instructor>All right, so in this video,</v>

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:04,980
we're going to move ahead and cover step three

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,083
of creating our spring data rest repositories.

4
00:00:19,617 --> 00:00:22,510
Okay, so let's swing over to our project here,

5
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:26,110
and let's move to our DAO package,

6
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,550
that's where we create our repositories

7
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,880
and I'll simply create a new repository,

8
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,930
so I'll say new Java class,

9
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:36,380
and now I choose interface,

10
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,140
make sure you choose interface here,

11
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,110
even though it says new Java class,

12
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,960
be sure to choose interface

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,253
and the name of our interfaces, country repository.

14
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,830
And so there we go

15
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,140
I have a basic shell there for this interface,

16
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,610
expand this window

17
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,100
and now I can go ahead and get down and dirty

18
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,790
and start writing some code here.

19
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:05,080
So I say extends JPA repository,

20
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,703
and I give country comma integer.

21
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,590
And so remember here country's the entity class

22
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,850
and integers the type of the primary key.

23
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:19,870
And this is basically our spring data JPA

24
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,680
along with some spring data rest

25
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,243
that we're going to add on here.

26
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,453
So we set up our cross origin annotation.

27
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,590
And we also set up our repository rest resource annotation

28
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,940
for spring data rest,

29
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,940
and we do some small customization here

30
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:53,023
as far as the actual output and the path,

31
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:02,163
so here I have path equals countries,

32
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,270
and so by using path equals countries,

33
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:09,473
and I'll expose the endpoint slash countries.

34
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,130
So let's go ahead and

35
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,113
run this real quick and test it out.

36
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,700
So my Boot app is up and running,

37
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,480
I can swing over to my browser,

38
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:34,173
and so I can go to localhost 8080 slash API slash countries.

39
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,920
And it'll give me a list of all the countries

40
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,190
from our database, which is good.

41
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,423
So there's Brazil,

42
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,330
and then I have Canada, and so on.

43
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,380
But one thing that you may have noticed

44
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,840
is that we also have states

45
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,870
and we only want countries.

46
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,000
We don't want the states at this moment,

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,720
we'll retrieve the states later.

48
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,250
So we need to kind of modify our application

49
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,760
to only retrieve the countries,

50
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,313
not the actual associated states for a given country.

51
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,290
So I can swing back into my IDE,

52
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:16,140
and I can make one small modification here,

53
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,133
and I can make a modification in my entity class.

54
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,453
So I'll move up to country dot Java.

55
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,293
And what I'll do is

56
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:32,180
I'll make use of a special Jackson annotation

57
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,773
called @JsonIgnore.

58
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,200
This will ignore the given field

59
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,310
as far as providing a JSON data.

60
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:42,920
So here, this will actually ignore the states

61
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,013
when it makes the return on the actual data.

62
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,830
So @JsonIgnore, it'll ignore the state

63
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,980
so it'll simply give me the countries

64
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,790
without the actual associated states

65
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,633
and this is a Jackson annotation.

66
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,220
So that's the one little mode here

67
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,610
that we had to make to our given entity

68
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,453
to only give us the countries.

69
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,360
All right, so let's go ahead and run this app one more time

70
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,307
and test it out.

71
00:04:22,356 --> 00:04:25,689
Just go over here and refresh my browser

72
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,050
and success.

73
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,420
So we're only retrieving the countries,

74
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,770
not the actual states.

75
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:35,780
So I have Brazil, Canada, Germany, India, and so on.

76
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,910
So this looks really good.

77
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:37,743
I like it.
