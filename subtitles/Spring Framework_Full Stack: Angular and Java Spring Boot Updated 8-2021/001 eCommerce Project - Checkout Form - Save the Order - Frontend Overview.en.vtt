<v Instructor>In this video we'll cover the Checkout form.</v>

2
00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:05.973
We'll save the order using the front end.

3
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.900
So the Spring Boot back-end code is up and running,

4
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.280
let's go ahead and focus on writing

5
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.623
the Angular front-end code for this.

6
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.920
So here's our development process,

7
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.220
the first thing we'll do is we'll create some common classes

8
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.070
for Customer, Order, OrderItem, Address and Purchase.

9
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.600
We'll also create the CheckoutService,

10
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.570
this'll basically make the REST API call

11
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.343
to the Spring Boot backend.

12
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.500
Then we'll update the CheckoutComponent,

13
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.330
we'll inject the CheckoutService and the Router,

14
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.810
we'll also update the onSubmit method to collect form data

15
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.623
and also call the CheckoutService.

16
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.350
All right, so this looks pretty good.

17
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.690
Let's go ahead and move into the next video

18
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.423
and let's write some code!
