1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:02,140
<v Instructor>All right, so let's get started</v>

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,480
with our development process.

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,990
So in this video, we're going to cover step one

4
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:07,250
of generating the key in the self-signed certificate,

5
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,250
and also updating the application properties

6
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,723
with security configs.

7
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:21,480
Alrighty, let's go ahead and open up a terminal window.

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,830
We need to get to the command line

9
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,450
to do some operations here.

10
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:25,890
So you can open a terminal window,

11
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,540
or a command prompt window on your operating system,

12
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,210
and simply move to the directory of your

13
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,439
spring boot e-commerce project.

14
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,490
In IntelliJ, they have an option

15
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,330
where you can actually open up the terminal window

16
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:39,673
in the IDE and other IDE's have similar features too.

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,750
Alrighty, so here I am at the command line.

18
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,000
What we need to do is use the key tool command here to

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,340
generate the key and certificate.

20
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,650
Now we can manually type this out. However,

21
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,000
I have some online steps that we can make use of.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,410
So let's go ahead and open up a browser and let's visit the

23
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,160
link that I have here on the slide.

24
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:09,420
So this will take us to a document that has the steps or

25
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,370
instructions for using a key tool for generating this key

26
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:13,853
and self-signed certificate.

27
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,070
So just kind of moving down here in this document,

28
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,060
it says open up a terminal window, move to the directory.

29
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,710
So make sure you have all that stuff done already.

30
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:29,870
And then we're going to use this command to generate the key

31
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,610
and certificate. So it's one long command,

32
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,960
copy it and paste it in its entirety.

33
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,230
So you can just select this item here to copy it,

34
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,143
and it will copy this to your clipboard,

35
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,760
and then you can swing back to your terminal window

36
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,310
and you can simply paste it in.

37
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,570
Now, the reason I did this again is

38
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,660
because it's a really long command,

39
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,860
very error prone.

40
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,960
Now I know some people say, hey,

41
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,920
I want to type it in myself, character for character,

42
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,560
simply pause the video here.

43
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,300
And you can type in exactly what I have here on the screen

44
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,493
in your window. It's totally up to you.

45
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,340
All right, so the command ran successfully

46
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,810
and we can go check our directory here,

47
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,100
source main resources,

48
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,380
and so the command that we just executed,

49
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:16,270
generated this key file, 'luv2code-keystore.p12'.

50
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,420
So that's the new file that was just created.

51
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,450
And remember the key-store is

52
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,423
a collection of keys and certificates,

53
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,770
and we can actually view the contents of our certificates.

54
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,433
So just swinging back to our documentation here,

55
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,060
viewing the contents of your certificate.

56
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,300
We can use this key tool command, simply copy it.

57
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,170
All right, so that's in our clipboard again,

58
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,380
and then we can swing back over

59
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,183
to the IDE and we can paste it in.

60
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,880
And excellent. So it printed out a lot of stuff,

61
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,804
if you kind of scroll up a bit to the top,

62
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:54,543
you'll see the information for your certificate.

63
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,908
So this is for this alias 'luv2code',

64
00:03:00,908 --> 00:03:03,458
and then it was created on a given date, the owner,

65
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:06,870
So that's the information that we had earlier,

66
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,271
the issuer, self-signed certificate,

67
00:03:09,271 --> 00:03:12,030
and it's valid from this date

68
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,573
until one year from now, 365 days.

69
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,290
And that's pretty much it. So we know that that part works.

70
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:20,670
So we know that our key-store has been created

71
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:23,350
and our self-signed certificate is in that key-store

72
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,440
with the alias of 'luv2code'.

73
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,553
All right, so I'll go ahead and clean up this window here.

74
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,350
And now the next step here is to update the application

75
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,490
properties with security configs.

76
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,330
So we'll set up our configs

77
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,653
based on the previous key tool command.

78
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,090
I'll just open up my 'application.properties' file.

79
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:52,390
And I'm going to add some new entries here to the end of

80
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,303
this 'application.properties' file.

81
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,560
So I'll swing you back over to

82
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,670
our browser, scroll down down a bit.

83
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,610
So for our application properties,

84
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,960
we're going to add this to the end.

85
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,683
So these are the SSL configs that we'll need.

86
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,420
So I'll simply copy this information

87
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:21,260
and then I'll paste it here in our 'application.properties'.

88
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,530
So paste it at the end,

89
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,810
so keep all your existing stuff from up top,

90
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,410
and this is the new information.

91
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,510
And so we'll go through and discuss each one of these

92
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,713
configurations here.

93
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:45,730
So our HPS secure ports going to run on 8443.

94
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,680
We will only accept HTTPS requests,

95
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,720
our alias is 'luv2code', the key-store location is at

96
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,887
this given location, 'classpath:luv2code-keystore.p12',

97
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,640
and remember, anything on source main resources

98
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,743
is automatically on the class path.

99
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:10,410
We specify our key-store password of 'secret'

100
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,300
and our key-store format of PKCS12.

101
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,400
And again, this is all based on the information

102
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,863
from our previous key tool command.
