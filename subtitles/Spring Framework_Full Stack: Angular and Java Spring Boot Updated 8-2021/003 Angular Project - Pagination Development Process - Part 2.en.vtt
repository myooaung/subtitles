00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:02.060
<v Instructor>Okay in step five,</v>

2
00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:03.800
we're going to enhance our HTML template

3
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.250
to use the ng-bootstrap pagination component.

4
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.880
So we'll add support on our template file

5
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.363
to actually reference that given component.

6
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.610
And recall from our previous video,

7
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.090
this pagination component has some parameters

8
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.120
and we'll actually go through all the details

9
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.953
of these parameters

10
00:00:23.953 --> 00:00:26.020
and we'll actually implement them in this video

11
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.023
so you'll see them working first hand.

12
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.160
And you can always get details on these parameters

13
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.773
by going to the ng-bootstrap website.

14
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.200
All right, so here's a very basic example of

15
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.744
using that pagination component

16
00:00:40.744 --> 00:00:42.810
in our template file.

17
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.670
So we have ngb-pagination

18
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.490
and we pass in those parameters.

19
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.140
And remember the component will generate

20
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.813
the links for pagination.

21
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.210
And we'll step through each one of these parameters here

22
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.773
to see exactly how they work.

23
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.423
So we'll start here with page.

24
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.320
So it's a special syntax here,

25
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.940
the square brackets parens page.

26
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.330
This is two-way data binding.

27
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.160
It's know as "banana in a box".

28
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.760
The square brackets means the box,

29
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.363
the parens means the banana. (chuckles)

30
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.280
So here we have a two-way data binding

31
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.190
between the HTML template

32
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.573
and the ProductListComponent.

33
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.680
So on the left-hand side,

34
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.700
we have page,

35
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.400
that's a parameter of ngb-pagination component

36
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.620
and then on the right-hand side,

37
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.030
we have thePageNumber,

38
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.893
that's a property of the ProductListComponent.

39
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.380
When the user clicks a page navigation link,

40
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.900
what happens in the background is that

41
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.530
in our TypeScript component,

42
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.830
thePageNumber property is updated

43
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.690
based on the user's action.

44
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:52.640
So for example,

45
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.220
if the use clicks four,

46
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.343
then thePageNumber is set to four.

47
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.520
So now going in the other direction,

48
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.970
if our TypeScript code updates thePageNumber

49
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.470
then the UI component is updated automatically.

50
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.080
So here this is basically a binding

51
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.900
from our TypeScript code

52
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.820
over to the HTML template

53
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.380
and so if we change the value of thePageNumber to,

54
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.213
say for example,

55
00:02:16.213 --> 00:02:18.320
four in our TypeScript code

56
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.910
then the UI is updated

57
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.980
and the current page number is highlighted

58
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.413
in the user interface.

59
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:26.980
Let's look at another parameter here.

60
00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.020
pageSize, so this is special angular syntax

61
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.230
for one-way data binding,

62
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.450
so square brackets.

63
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.283
So on the left-hand side,

64
00:02:33.283 --> 00:02:36.630
pageSize is the parameter of the ngb-pagination component,

65
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.693
thePageSize is a property of the ProductListComponent.

66
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.556
If our TypeScript code updates thePageSize,

67
00:02:47.556 --> 00:02:51.290
then the UI component is updated automatically.

68
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.270
And so base on this,

69
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.507
they'll change how many pages are listed

70
00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:56.483
base on thePageSize.

71
00:02:58.596 --> 00:03:01.397
And that's an example here of one-way data binding.

72
00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.470
Alrighty, looking at collectionSize.

73
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.470
So if our TypeScript code updates theTotalElements

74
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.610
then the UI component is updated automatically.

75
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.700
So again, this will kind of determine

76
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.410
how this actual pagination controller's displayed

77
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.950
based on the collectionSize

78
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.610
or how many items are out there.

79
00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.560
And again, this is an example here of one-way data binding.

80
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.050
The next parameter here is pageChange

81
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.790
and so this is for event-binding,

82
00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.913
so for a pageChange event.

83
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.050
So when the user clicks a page navigation link

84
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.940
then they'll call the method listProducts.

85
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.170
So this gives us a chance to access information

86
00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.350
from the database

87
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.740
based on the thePageNumber,

88
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:42.850
pageSize and so on,

89
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.000
return those items

90
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.530
and then update the actual template accordingly.

91
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.227
So this is basically how you get to show

92
00:03:49.227 --> 00:03:51.120
a new page of products

93
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.063
based on the user actions.

94
00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.280
Alrighty, so that's pretty much all of the development there

95
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.110
for the pagination component.

96
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:00.120
In the next set of videos,

97
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.290
we'll go ahead and write the code

98
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.620
and we'll get this set up.

99
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.823
So I'll see ya in the next video.
