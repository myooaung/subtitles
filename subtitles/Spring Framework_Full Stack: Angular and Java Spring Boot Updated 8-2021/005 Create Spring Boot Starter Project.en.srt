00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:03,770
<v ->Alrighty, so moving along with our development process.</v>

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,200
in this video we'll focus on step two of creating this

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,963
Spring Boot starter project.

4
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:19,650
Alrighty so let's go ahead

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,330
and move it to our web browser

6
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,463
and let's visit the website start.spring.io.

7
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:29,410
Alrighty, so I'll go ahead

8
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:30,243
and move down here

9
00:00:30,243 --> 00:00:32,930
and I'll start adding some project metadata.

10
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:35,680
So for the actual group name I'll call it com.love2code

11
00:00:43,183 --> 00:00:46,753
and for the artifact ID I'll use spring-boot-ecommerce.

12
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,050
I'll expand the options here.

13
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:03,708
So I'll simply update the description here for this project.

14
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,530
And I'll also update the project name,

15
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,040
so simply .ecommerce

16
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,060
So com.luv2code.eccomerce

17
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:20,750
So just a quick check point,

18
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,500
so make sure you have these values here

19
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,883
for your project metadata.

20
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,700
And then for the Java version,

21
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,577
I'm using Java 13,

22
00:01:32,577 --> 00:01:34,120
I'll select that option

23
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,610
but the Java versions change over time

24
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:38,050
so simply choose the Java version

25
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,703
that works for your system.

26
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,780
And so now we'll add the dependencies here

27
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,763
so I'll enter JPA for Spring Data JPA.

28
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,493
I'll add support for the Rest Repositories.

29
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:58,423
And I'll also add support for the MySQI database driver.

30
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,550
And then finally, we'll add support for Lombok,

31
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:08,530
that new modern development project

32
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:11,130
for minimizing the boilerplate code

33
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,270
for generating all those getters and setters

34
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,010
for you automatically.

35
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,400
All right, so just a check point here

36
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,350
over on the right hand side.

37
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:20,300
So make sure you have Spring Data JPA, Rest Repositories,

38
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,323
MySQI Driver, and Lombok.

39
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:32,032
All right, so go ahead and generate this project.

40
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,410
And then that's downloaded to your file system

41
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,260
so let's swing over to our folder here,

42
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,650
let's move into that downloads directory,

43
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,011
there's that spring eCommerce zip file

44
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:47,844
that was just generated,

45
00:02:47,844 --> 00:02:48,677
let's unzip it.

46
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:52,100
And then before I move it over,

47
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,540
one thing I want to do in my eCommerce project folder

48
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,490
is I want to create this new folder for the backend.

49
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:00,683
So I'll create a new folder called 02-backend.

50
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,660
And so I'll move into the folder backend

51
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,700
and I'll simply move our spring boot eCommerce

52
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,453
into the backend folder.

53
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,360
So just stepping back a bit

54
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,903
so you can see the layout of the folders.

55
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,603
Okay, so this looks good so far.
