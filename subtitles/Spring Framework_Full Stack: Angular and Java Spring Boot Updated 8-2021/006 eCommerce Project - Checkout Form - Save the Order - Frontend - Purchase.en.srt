1
00:00:01,059 --> 00:00:03,170
<v Chad>All right, so we have orderItems taken care of.</v>

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,583
Now let's go ahead and set up our purchase.

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,820
So we just create a new instance here.

4
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,760
So we'll start here by pulling in information

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,233
for the purchase.shippingAddress.

6
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,630
So the first thing I do here is go through

7
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:34,816
and use that checkout.FormGroup.controls

8
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,620
for shippingAddress.value.

9
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,310
So it's going to access that form data for me.

10
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,520
And now I need to kind of do a little more massaging here

11
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,710
to grab the data accordingly.

12
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,100
So I want to grab the shippingState.

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,610
So I grab that information from purchase.shippingAddress.

14
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,130
And then I'll do a similar thing here for countries.

15
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:07,320
So just a little copy paste.

16
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,967
So shippingCountry.

17
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,050
Okay, so that takes care of that.

18
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:25,380
Have those as objects right now.

19
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,210
Now I need to just grab the actual data

20
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:30,643
for each one of those items.

21
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,913
So I'll say the state equals shippingState.name.

22
00:01:49,942 --> 00:01:52,757
And then I'll say purchase.shippingAddress.country

23
00:01:52,757 --> 00:01:55,533
equals shippingCountry.name.

24
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,333
Okay, so this looks good.

25
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:06,773
Well, actually, I didn't follow my comments here.

26
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,310
I need to cut this and move it somewhere else.

27
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:16,360
No, this isn't for customer, this is shippingAddress stuff.

28
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,310
So let's just cut this section

29
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,220
and move it down to the right comment.

30
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,110
Okay, ah, there we go.

31
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,930
I had comments to keep myself on track

32
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,470
and I still got off track.

33
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,043
Oh, gosh!

34
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,030
So let's get back on track,

35
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:36,050
and let's have a purchase.customer equals,

36
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,723
and then we'll grab the customer from the checkoutFormGroup.

37
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:46,490
So this is checkoutFormGroup.controls['customer'].value.

38
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,763
Okay, so that's okay, that's in good shape.

39
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,740
And now for the shippingAddress, I can copy this,

40
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,273
and use a similar thing for billing address.

41
00:03:09,238 --> 00:03:10,810
All right, so I simply just need to go through

42
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,413
and update or change our references to shipping to billing.

43
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,370
Alrighty, so I think I have everything covered.

44
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,260
So just double check that

45
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,850
and make sure you have everything aligned up

46
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,163
as I have here on the screen.
