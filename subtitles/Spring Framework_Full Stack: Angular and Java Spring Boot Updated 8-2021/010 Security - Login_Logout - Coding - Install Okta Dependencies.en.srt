1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,180
<v Instructor>Okay so we're moving right along here</v>

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,720
so in this video we'll cover steps four and five

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,120
installing the Okta SDK dependencies

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,613
and also integrating the Okta Sign-In Widget.

5
00:00:22,306 --> 00:00:23,139
So let's go ahead

6
00:00:23,139 --> 00:00:24,630
and open up a new terminal window

7
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,570
and then here's the command here

8
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:36,680
for installing the Okta Sign-In Widget

9
00:00:57,497 --> 00:01:01,953
and now simply do an npm install for the Okta angular SDK

10
00:01:20,127 --> 00:01:20,960
and then finally

11
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,610
I'll just run this npm audit fix

12
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,140
to try and fix some of the vulnerabilities

13
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,770
I mean it's not always successful

14
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,010
but I'll try and fix some of them

15
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:29,843
but that's just something

16
00:01:29,843 --> 00:01:31,250
that's really beyond our control

17
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,670
it's up to the package maintainers.

18
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:36,480
But anyway I'll just do the npm audit fix

19
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,540
you'll have different results

20
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,340
than what you see here on my screen.

21
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,370
So anyway we have those dependencies installed

22
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,970
so we're in good shape for that.

23
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,393
And now what I'd like to

24
00:01:53,393 --> 00:01:54,520
just kind of poke around

25
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,930
into the node modules

26
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:58,840
to see the Okta information that was installed.

27
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,543
So under node modules/Okta

28
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:11,697
and we'll see here

29
00:02:11,697 --> 00:02:14,093
we have this Okta Sign-In Widget.

30
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,330
We can look in the disk section and the CSS

31
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:22,600
and we can see here that they have a min CSS.

32
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,433
So this is great

33
00:02:23,433 --> 00:02:25,040
So we'll let you use this CSS

34
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,253
and this upcoming section here.

35
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,680
So what we'll do is we'll add support

36
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,600
for the Okta CSS and our angular.jsonfiles

37
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,610
so this is part of the step five

38
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:40,333
of integrating the Okta Sign-In Widget.

39
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,510
So I'll move down to this anglular.json

40
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:50,660
and I'll give a reference

41
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,283
to the CSS for the Okta Sign-In Widget.

42
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,490
So I moved down here to the styles section

43
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:07,283
where we have the other CSS references here.

44
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,670
And now let's add one more reference here

45
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,750
so styles and then I'll do this node modules

46
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,810
that same path we saw a little earlier here

47
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,650
okta/okta-signin-widget/disc/css

48
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:36,260
and give her the reference here to that CSS file name

49
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,000
and so be sure you get this correct

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,920
exactly like I have here

51
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,700
just so we can find the appropriate styles

52
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,513
for the opt to Sign-In Widget.

53
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:53,760
You can always go through

54
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,900
and poke through the note modules again just to make sure

55
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,127
that you're on the right track with the reference

56
00:03:58,127 --> 00:04:01,193
and the location there for that main CSS file.

57
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,960
Let me just kind of size this up a bit

58
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,063
so you can see everything on one screen.

59
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,410
Okay, all right there we go great.

60
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,150
So you can kind of just eyeball it

61
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,710
make sure you have the correct path here

62
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,333
for your reference here for that CSS.

63
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,940
All ready this looks pretty good

64
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,773
I like it.
