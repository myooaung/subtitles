1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:02,103
<v Narrator>Alrighty, so let's go ahead</v>

2
00:00:02,103 --> 00:00:03,910
and move along with our Development Process.

3
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:06,630
So in this video, we're going to cover steps 1.2

4
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,950
and 1.3 of handling the reviewCartDetails()

5
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:14,120
and then we'll also cover step two of updating a CartService

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,713
by changing Subject to BehaviorSubject.

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,390
All right, so let's go ahead and move

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,260
into checkout.component.ts and our ngOnInit() method

9
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,467
we're going to write some codes to call reviewcartDetails().

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,900
So this.reviewCartDetails().

11
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,890
Now this is a new method, we haven't declared it yet,

12
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:46,223
we're simply just putting a reference in for right now.

13
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,290
And so the IDE tells us about the error, Yep, we know,

14
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:53,480
and then we will allow the IDE to help us

15
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,120
by declaring the method for our reviewCartDetails().

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,190
Awesome.

17
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,500
So it just created that method for us.

18
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,653
Let me try and scroll down and find out where it's at.

19
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,350
Let's see, can't find it, silly me.

20
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,960
I'll just go back to the top and I'll say reviewCartDetails

21
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,710
and I'll simply say, Hey, go to the Definition.

22
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,340
I should've did that from the beginning.

23
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,173
All right, great.

24
00:01:17,173 --> 00:01:18,006
So there's the method,

25
00:01:18,006 --> 00:01:20,250
so I buried it somewhere in the middle.

26
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,210
Yikes.

27
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,180
So, it has some placeholder stuff here, I'll remove that

28
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,110
and so basically what we want to do here

29
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:33,350
in reviewCartDetails() is that we want to subscribe

30
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,743
to the subjects on the cartService.

31
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:41,530
So I want to subscribe to cartService.totalQuantity

32
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,833
and also subscribed to cartService.totalPrice.

33
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,860
And whatever data's returned

34
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,400
then I'll simply assign it accordingly.

35
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,500
I'll simply say this.totalQuantity equals

36
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,913
the data returned, totalQuantity.

37
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,180
And we've seen this coding before

38
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,913
with some of our other coding for subscribing.

39
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,600
And I'll simply do a similar thing here for totalPrice.

40
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,777
So totalPrice.subscribe().

41
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,330
Alrighty, so this looks pretty good.

42
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,240
So we have the subscriptions set up

43
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,260
for totalQuantity and totalPrice.

44
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,190
Now let's just test our application real quick,

45
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:50,340
moving to Mouse Pads, I'll add some items here to the cart

46
00:03:51,321 --> 00:03:52,271
and on the Checkout

47
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:57,660
and move all the way down to my Reviewing Your Order

48
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,113
and, that's strange.

49
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,950
Now, remember, since the checkout component

50
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,210
is instantiated later in the application

51
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,360
it's going to miss out on the previous messages

52
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,760
so we're still going to get these zeros

53
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,800
for total price and total quantity,

54
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,700
so we need to somehow get a replay

55
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,560
or somehow get the last message that we'll send across.

56
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,870
And remember earlier in the videos we said,

57
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,640
BehaviorSubject is the one that we want to use

58
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,243
for this given scenario.

59
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,280
Alright, so Let's swing back into our IDE

60
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,850
and this is step 2.1

61
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:45,347
of changing Subject to BehaviorSubject.

62
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,033
And so we'll do this work inside of our cart.service.

63
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,363
And it's a very simple change here, right?

64
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,713
So we just replaced Subject with BehaviorSubject,

65
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:19,874
and then I simply give the initial value of zero.

66
00:05:25,706 --> 00:05:27,610
And then I can simply copy paste this

67
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,550
and do the same thing for totalQuantity.

68
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,931
Alright, so that's in place, that looks pretty good.

69
00:05:38,931 --> 00:05:41,935
So newBehaviorSubject and we specified the initial value

70
00:05:41,935 --> 00:05:44,685
of zero for a price and quantity.

71
00:05:50,956 --> 00:05:52,160
All right, so let's go ahead and swing back

72
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,963
into our browser and test this out.

73
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:59,230
Let's add some items to the cart, do a Checkout

74
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:06,600
and we'll scroll down to our Review Your Order section

75
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,750
and success!, alright.

76
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,310
So we're getting the quantity and the price

77
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,810
and the reason we're getting this information now is that

78
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:16,690
even though the checkout components subscribe late

79
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,800
we're making use of BehaviorSubject,

80
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,870
so they're going to send the most recent or the latest event

81
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:25,393
or message to this given component.

82
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,763
Alrighty, so I'd like to say "Good job my friend".
