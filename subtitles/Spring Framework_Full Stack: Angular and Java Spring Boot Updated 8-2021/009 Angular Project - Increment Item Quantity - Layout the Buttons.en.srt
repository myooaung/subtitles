00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:03,050
<v ->With our development process,</v>

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:04,680
in this video, we're going to cover step one

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,770
of modifying the CartDetailsComponent HTML template

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,913
and adding the increment button.

5
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:20,850
So let's move in here,

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,573
and let's open up our cart-details.component.html.

7
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,020
I'll move to the top of the file as a checkpoint

8
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,283
just to get our bearings,

9
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,780
and let's move down to the section near quantity

10
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,873
because we're going to add some new code in this section.

11
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,100
One thing I'll do here is focus in

12
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,513
on the quantity item right now.

13
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:06,193
I'll set up a div.

14
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,670
I'll apply the appropriate styles here for this div.

15
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,623
I'll create a div here for the increment button.

16
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,020
Then I'll add the code here for the button.

17
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,163
Let me slide over here for a second.

18
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,070
Then I'll add that font awesome icon,

19
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,453
the font awesome plus icon.

20
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,730
Good, so this is the code in place

21
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:53,913
for giving us the increment button.

22
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,453
And let's set up a div here for the actual quantity.

23
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,423
I'll reference tempCartItem.quantity.

24
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,940
I also want to add the decrement button,

25
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,700
so let me just go ahead and copy the code I have

26
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,970
for the increment button or for plus,

27
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,100
and let's just copy that

28
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,113
and paste it down here at the bottom.

29
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:37,820
Instead of the fa-plus, I'll say fa-minus.

30
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,900
So just a very small change here

31
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,303
to get the minus or the decrement button.

32
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,100
Then I'll simply add a div here as a spacer

33
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,250
just so things can line up properly

34
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:57,620
as far as the layout in the actual table row.

35
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,050
So just think of this as a extra spacer here

36
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,263
to tighten things up.

37
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,033
This looks good.

38
00:03:08,033 --> 00:03:09,290
Let's go ahead and test it.

39
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,190
So I'll open up a new terminal window,

40
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,630
and before I start my Angular app,

41
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,370
I just want to do a quick checkpoint here.

42
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,360
Make sure the Spring Boot app is up and running.

43
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,710
If it's not running, go ahead and start it now.

44
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,920
Now I'll go ahead and start up my Angular app.

45
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,510
Then we can swing over into my browser.

46
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,600
I can add some items to my cart

47
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,210
and then view my cart and success.

48
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,410
This is great.

49
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:00,170
Now notice here we have our increment button

50
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,810
and our decrement button along with our quantity,

51
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:03,960
so good job.

52
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,900
Now these buttons don't do anything yet, right? (laughs)

53
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,710
Because we haven't added any event handlers

54
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,130
or click handlers on it.

55
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,550
We'll do that in the next video,

56
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,490
but at least we have the layout in place

57
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,133
for the given buttons.
