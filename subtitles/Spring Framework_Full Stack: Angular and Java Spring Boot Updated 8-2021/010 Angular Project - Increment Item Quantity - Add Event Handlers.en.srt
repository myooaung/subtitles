00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,530
<v ->Alright so on this video we're going to</v>

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,590
cover the step of adding a click handler

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:07,440
for the increment button on the HTML template.

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,460
And then also we'll update the cart details component

5
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,333
with the click handler method.

6
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,200
Alright, so let's move in here

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,980
into our cart details component dot HTML,

8
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,420
and let's move up to the section

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,453
where we have our increment button, the FA plus.

10
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,110
And so on this button here

11
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,773
we're going to add a click handler.

12
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,330
So we'll call the method increment quantity

13
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,713
and we'll pass in the temp cart item.

14
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,240
And of course, the IDE is going to

15
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,530
give us the error message saying,

16
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,880
hey, this method is not defined.

17
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,440
Okay No worries, We'll cover this in step two

18
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,710
of updating our cart details component

19
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,493
with that click handler method.

20
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,433
So I'll just swing over to my cart details component dot ts.

21
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,250
And I'll move down to the bottom of the class

22
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,860
and I'll add the method increment quantity,

23
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,113
That going to pass in a cart item.

24
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:41,970
And then we simply use this dot cart service dot add to cart

25
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,673
and we pass in the cart item.

26
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,763
Alright this looks pretty good, Let's test it out.

27
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,840
Alright, so it's move in here

28
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,163
and let's add an item to our cart.

29
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,960
So add the coffee mug for cherokee,

30
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,543
go check our cart details,

31
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,000
and looks good,

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,140
increment, quantity, Great Love it, Love it.

33
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,820
So it's increment and quantity

34
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,800
for this given cart item.

35
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,083
Great, awesome.

36
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,593
And let's add another item to our cart,

37
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,283
mousepad.

38
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,880
And also do the increment here,

39
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,980
great so this all works as desired,

40
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,163
so our increment button is up and running.
