1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,240
<v Instructor>Alrighty, so just as a check point</v>

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,073
I want to make sure that

3
00:00:04,073 --> 00:00:05,650
you have the tools installed already.

4
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:07,650
So at this point you should already have

5
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:12,070
Visual Studio Code installed, node, npm and tsc.

6
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,144
If not, go to the link here on the slide,

7
00:00:14,144 --> 00:00:17,210
follow the install guides and then they'll show you

8
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,510
how to get everything set up on your computer.

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,250
Okay, so let me go ahead and move into my files system.

10
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,980
And the one thing I want to do here is create a new folder

11
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,954
where I can place all of my training code

12
00:00:31,954 --> 00:00:34,500
for these set-up videos here.

13
00:00:39,982 --> 00:00:42,410
So I'll create this folder here typescript-training

14
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:43,980
but you can use any folder name,

15
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,780
you can give any name that you want.

16
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,183
And then I'll start up Visual Studio Code.

17
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,560
So here's the basic IDE, and I just have

18
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,560
all the defaults in place for right now.

19
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,763
And I'll go ahead and open that folder that I just created.

20
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,133
So I'll select my typescript-training folder.

21
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,710
Okay, so there we go.

22
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:24,830
So we have typescript-training folder that's open,

23
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,163
that looks pretty good.

24
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,490
I'll create a new folder underneath

25
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,040
the typescript-training folder.

26
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,013
I'll call it 01-helloworld.

27
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,753
I'll create a new file.

28
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,560
I'll call it myhelloworld.ts,

29
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,073
and remember the .ts is for TypeScript.

30
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,200
So I'll keep it real simple, I'll simply build

31
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,060
console.log and notice how the whole IntelliSense

32
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,283
code completion helps us out.

33
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,567
So I'll do a log, and then I'll give my message:

34
00:02:15,567 --> 00:02:17,107
"Hello World."

35
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,010
All right, so our very basic Hello World program

36
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:26,943
using TypeScript.

37
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,973
So let's go ahead and open up a new terminal.

38
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,450
So this terminal basically gives you a shell,

39
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:36,950
and you can use this to go through

40
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:39,873
and access your code, compile the code, and run it.

41
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,773
So there's my new terminal.

42
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,913
Just resize here a bit.

43
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,060
So I'll go ahead and move into

44
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,550
this directory here 01-helloworld.

45
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,850
And I'll just check the directory contents here

46
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:01,903
and I see my file myhelloworld.ts, good.

47
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,120
And now let's compile the code, so we use that tsc command,

48
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,303
so I'll do a tsc on myhelloworld.ts.

49
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,780
And then we simply check the directory here, the output,

50
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,830
and we see that all right, there's the myhelloworld.js.

51
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,970
So remember it generates a .js file.

52
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,160
It's part of that transpiling process;

53
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,823
translating/compiling.

54
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,550
And so now to run the code, I use the node command,

55
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:35,740
and I give the reference to the generated .js file.

56
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,873
So node myhelloworld.js.

57
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,530
And then there's our output: Hello World.

58
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,193
Cool, good job.

59
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,673
Alrighty let's move into our editor here,

60
00:03:48,673 --> 00:03:51,773
and let's just add some more code to our TypeScript file.

61
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,700
So I'll do a console.log and I'll just play around with

62
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,190
some string concatenation here.

63
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,093
So "Coding Gurus"...

64
00:04:02,647 --> 00:04:04,817
"Time for some fun!"

65
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,500
And then let's go ahead and compile it one more time.

66
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,350
So I'll just clear my terminal window here at the bottom.

67
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,560
And then I will compile it once again.

68
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,423
So tsc myhelloworld.ts.

69
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,900
And then I'll run it using the node command

70
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,073
I run the generated JavaScript file.

71
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,440
And there we go. So that's our new output.

72
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,092
So that's awesome. So this works out just fine for us.

73
00:04:35,092 --> 00:04:36,430
Now one thing I want to give you

74
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,450
a head's up about to be aware of.

75
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,971
So, only edit the TypeScript files the .ts files.

76
00:04:41,971 --> 00:04:46,100
Do not edit the JavaScript file, .js.

77
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,147
Because remember, the .js file is generated

78
00:04:48,147 --> 00:04:52,180
every time by the TypeScript compiler, all right?

79
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,100
So here we're developing code using TypeScript,

80
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,603
so simply write all your code in the TypeScript file.

81
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,910
Okay, that's it.

82
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,960
So we created our first TypeScript file,

83
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,990
and then we'll move into some more fun features

84
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,440
in the next set of videos, so I'll see you there.
