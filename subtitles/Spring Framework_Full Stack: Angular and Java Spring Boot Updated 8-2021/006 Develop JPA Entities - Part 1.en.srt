1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,193
<v ->Alrighty, so,</v>

2
00:00:02,193 --> 00:00:03,920
moving along with our development process.

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,840
In step three we need to develop the entities

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,083
for the product and the product category.

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,433
Alrighty,

6
00:00:14,433 --> 00:00:15,266
now the first thing we need to do

7
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:17,133
is import the spring boot project.

8
00:00:25,853 --> 00:00:27,190
And we simply navigate over

9
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,890
to our ecommerce project directory,

10
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:31,573
and our 02 backend.

11
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,340
And there should be a spring boot ecommerce folder,

12
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,373
let's open that one.

13
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,130
And so now we'll simply just go through

14
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,560
the IntelliJ wizard for importing a project,

15
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,660
so make sure you choose the maven project.

16
00:00:56,595 --> 00:00:58,140
And we'll simply check the box here

17
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,060
to help us out in the future

18
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,053
to import maven projects automatically.

19
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,360
We'll keep the defaults here on this screen.

20
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,570
I'm using Java 13,

21
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,440
but whatever version of Java you have installed,

22
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,090
just make sure it's listed there.

23
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,440
And you can keep all the other defaults,

24
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,303
and hit finish.

25
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,553
Alrighty,

26
00:01:30,553 --> 00:01:32,780
I'll just do a little quick scan here of this project.

27
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,503
I'll just move into my source main Java directory.

28
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,370
Our ecommerce package.

29
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,580
And I'll just open up this main application,

30
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,380
the spring boot ecommerce application.

31
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,993
So this is our spring boot app that we get for free.

32
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,030
And then I'll take a look at our resources

33
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,480
and our application.properties,

34
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,523
and it's empty by default.

35
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,270
And what I like to do is copy over

36
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:09,223
the application.properties file from my starter files.

37
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,173
So let's swing over to our file system.

38
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,020
And our ecommerce project folder,

39
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,520
and our 01 starter files,

40
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,940
we have an application.properties.

41
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,320
Let's copy that file,

42
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,240
and let's paste it here into the resources directory,

43
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,923
and let's hit okay and we overwrite the existing file.

44
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,310
Alrighty, so this is our application.properties

45
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:46,393
that we copied from our starter files.

46
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,910
And this is all the standard

47
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,330
JDBC spring boot connection work.

48
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,660
So, our driver class name,

49
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,750
our URL,

50
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,583
username,

51
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:57,416
password,

52
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:58,510
the dialect,

53
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:02,890
and the path that we'll use for our rest API slash API.

54
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,200
So this is all standard spring boot stuff.

55
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,800
You should be aware of how this stuff works already.

56
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,073
Alright so now it's step three of developing the entities.

57
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,370
So the first thing I'll do is

58
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,733
I'll create a new package called entity.

59
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,683
And then I'll create a new Java Class called product.

60
00:03:56,091 --> 00:04:01,091
Alrighty so let me expand my window here and zoom in a bit.

61
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,653
So this is going to be our JPA entity.

62
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,380
And then we'll set up our JPA annotation for table

63
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,723
to map this argument table product.

64
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,420
And then I'll make use of this

65
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,373
data annotation from the lombok project.

66
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:32,803
And so remember,

67
00:04:32,803 --> 00:04:34,430
this will automatically generate

68
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:37,490
the getter and setter methods for you behind the scenes.

69
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,130
It reduces the boilerplace code.

70
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,020
So, you won't actually see the getter and setter

71
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,120
methods in the code,

72
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,734
but lombok will provide the support for you

73
00:04:43,734 --> 00:04:46,153
behind the scenes automatically.

74
00:04:50,408 --> 00:04:53,120
And now I'll simply go through and define fields here

75
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,430
to map to the given database tables.

76
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,250
So this is kind of straight forward,

77
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,620
more of the same.

78
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,880
I'll be quiet here for a bit

79
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,580
and I'll just crank out this code.

80
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,170
Alrighty, so this looks pretty good.

81
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,020
So we created all of the fields here

82
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,860
for this database table.

83
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,170
We still need to do some more work

84
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:17,870
as far as mapping it to the actual columns,

85
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,670
but we'll do that in the next video.
