<v Narrator>All righty, so moving along</v>

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:03,520
with our development process.

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,440
In this video, we're going to focus on step four

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,530
of modifying the cart details component

5
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,483
to retrieve the cart items.

6
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,270
All right, so let's swing into our IDE

7
00:00:19,487 --> 00:00:23,904
and let's move to our cart-details.component.ts file.

8
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:31,710
Now let me just move down here to the bottom

9
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,140
and clean up my terminal window

10
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,030
and get rid of it just so I have some extra real estate

11
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,440
for writing all the code right now,

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,530
so, okay, good.

13
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:39,500
So that's out of the way.

14
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,840
All right, so let's zoom in here

15
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,390
and let's get down to business.

16
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,983
So the first thing we're going to do is create some properties,

17
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,550
so we'll set up a property here for cart items

18
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,860
and we'll initialize it to an empty array

19
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:06,640
and then we'll also set up properties here

20
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,143
for the total price and also the total quantity,

21
00:01:16,745 --> 00:01:18,560
and then, in our ngOnInit method,

22
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,150
we'll call this method this.listCartDetails

23
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,310
and in this method, I will write some quick comments

24
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,373
to myself just to keep myself on track.

25
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,930
All righty, so we'll get a handle to the cart items,

26
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,890
we'll subscribe to the cart totalPrice,

27
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,670
the cart totalQuantity, and we'll also

28
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,313
compute the cart total price and quantity,

29
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,140
and one thing is that I'll need to inject

30
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,790
the cartService here, so I'll move up

31
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,633
to the constructor and perform the injection.

32
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,680
All righty, so scrolling down here

33
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,020
to our listCartDetails method,

34
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,650
we'll go ahead and write the code

35
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,450
for getting a handle to the cart items,

36
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,929
so I'll simply give this.cartItems

37
00:02:46,929 --> 00:02:49,762
equals this.cartService.cartItems,

38
00:02:53,628 --> 00:02:55,681
and then we'll subscribe to the cart totalPrice,

39
00:02:55,681 --> 00:03:00,023
so I simply give this.cartService.totalPrice.subscribe,

40
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,960
and then, when that data arrives,

41
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,960
then we'll assign it to this.totalPrice,

42
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:25,010
and I'll do a similar thing here for cart totalQuantity,

43
00:03:43,793 --> 00:03:45,440
and then, finally, I'll compute the cart

44
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,363
total price and quantity.

45
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,020
All righty, so this looks pretty good.

46
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,820
This is all the major coding here for this given method.
