1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:02,840
<v Narrator>Alrighty, so let's go ahead</v>

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,120
and continue the process here

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,130
and now we simply need

4
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:08,330
to create a Spring Data rest repository

5
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,980
for our state's entity.

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,490
So in our DAO package I'll create this new Java class

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,900
or we select interface again and

8
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,627
so here we give the name of StateRepository.

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,330
Alrighty, so here is our StateRepository.

10
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:30,680
A similar thing as before,

11
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,150
we say extends JpaRepository

12
00:00:37,807 --> 00:00:40,137
and we give state comma integer

13
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,630
and so for the imports here make sure you import

14
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:48,173
the correct state from our entity package.

15
00:00:49,352 --> 00:00:50,640
Okay, so this looks great.

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,647
So we have our entity class and also our primary key.

17
00:00:56,886 --> 00:00:58,480
And we'll just repeat the process here

18
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,111
of setting up our annotations here

19
00:01:00,111 --> 00:01:02,220
for this given repository

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,210
and also remember we're going to create a special finder method

21
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:26,210
here or query method for finding states by the country code.

22
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,373
So they'll pass in a param code.

23
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:33,803
That'll be a string param.

24
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:42,810
So this will allow us to get

25
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,500
the states for a specific country code.

26
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,770
So not all the states only the states for a given country.

27
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,773
For example, code equals IN for India.

28
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,960
And remember this is very useful for our user interface,

29
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,260
where the user will select a country first

30
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,600
and they want to populate the states based

31
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,640
on the user's selected country.

32
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,893
So that's why we have this method in place.

33
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,930
Alrighty, so that's the coding for that.

34
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,280
We're in really good shape.

35
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,250
Let's go ahead and run it and test it out

36
00:02:28,355 --> 00:02:31,160
and then I'll open up a new tab here

37
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,360
and I'll visit localhost:8080/API/states

38
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,580
and here's our data

39
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,240
and it's all looks pretty good.

40
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,610
But this is for all the states.

41
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:48,110
Let's retrieve states for a given country code.

42
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,180
So I'll do a slash search find

43
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:53,930
by country code code equals IN

44
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,823
and so this will give me all of the states for India.

45
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,060
I can do a similar thing here for US

46
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,173
and also, I can do a similar thing for Turkey code of TR.

47
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:27,180
Alrighty, so this is great.

48
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,560
So we have our REST API for retrieving countries

49
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,760
and we also added that query method

50
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,110
for finding by country code so we can get

51
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,770
the states for a specific country code.

52
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:37,760
So I like it.

53
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,683
This looks really good.
