00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.718
<v ->In this video, will cover step three</v>

2
00:00:02.718 --> 00:00:04.580
and our Spring Boot application

3
00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.713
we'll set our application properties.

4
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.678
Let's move back over to our Spring Boot application

5
00:00:18.678 --> 00:00:22.303
and let's open up our application properties file.

6
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.580
Let me expand my window for a bit

7
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.490
and let's move down here.

8
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.680
And so we'll add these three new entries here

9
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.023
for the okra oauth configuration properties.

10
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.640
So each property starts with okta oauth 2 dots.

11
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.011
So, I'm just going to copy this

12
00:00:57.011 --> 00:01:00.093
and just paste it X number of times.

13
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.100
And for the first item here, it's the client ID.

14
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.620
So, this is where we'll going to plug in our client ID

15
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.340
and then we'll also have a client secret.

16
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.883
So we'll plug in our client secret,

17
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.140
and then finally the issuer.

18
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.730
So, this is going to be the actual location

19
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.140
of your authorization server

20
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.503
Okta with the appropriate path.

21
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.340
So, you should have something similar to these

22
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.223
at this point.

23
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.346
Now, let's swing over to our web application

24
00:01:46.346 --> 00:01:49.807
and copy some of the information from it.

25
00:01:49.807 --> 00:01:52.973
So, let's go ahead and start with our client ID.

26
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.950
So, on okta there's client ID

27
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.710
we can simply copy that to the clipboard

28
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.403
and then swinging back over and just pasting it.

29
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.290
And now of course your values are going to be different

30
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.900
because they're unique per application.

31
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.650
So, I'll do a similar thing here for the client secret.

32
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.970
So, I just moved here to the client secret.

33
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.460
Copy that to the clipboard

34
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.090
and then for issuer, ooh, not, not issue, issuer, okay.

35
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.310
That's a typo here, be sure to have issuer

36
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.840
so I S S U E R.

37
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.313
So, we're missing an R here.

38
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:51.870
That's really important.

39
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.603
So, be sure you update that accordingly for this property.

40
00:03:05.472 --> 00:03:07.770
And so, now I need to provide the okta domain.

41
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.770
I can just move down here and copy that.

42
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.646
And I'll just paste it here

43
00:03:16.646 --> 00:03:18.657
in this section here for your okta domain.

44
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.700
Okay. So our okta domain and then oauth 2 slash default.

45
00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:29.533
All right,

46
00:03:29.533 --> 00:03:31.610
So, this is basically what your properties file

47
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.253
should look like at this point.

48
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.300
And then you may wonder why am I showing you my client IDs

49
00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.400
and my secrets?

50
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.450
Well, there's no security issue here

51
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.760
because this is just a demo video.

52
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.010
And these are just,

53
00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.470
this is just a demo app that I'll kind of throw away.

54
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.370
So, even if you enter the exact same values

55
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.050
for your app, it won't work.

56
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:54.790
'Cause I'm just creating these demo apps.

57
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.420
I use them for the video and then I throw them away.

58
00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.543
So, no security issues here.

59
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.640
Okay. So this looks pretty good.

60
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.473
I like it.
