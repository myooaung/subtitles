<v Instructor>In this video</v>

2
00:00:01.713 --> 00:00:04.110
we're going to cover the question

3
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.403
what about an empty cart?

4
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:11.680
So you may have noticed

5
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.810
when you are poking around

6
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.770
or testing your application

7
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.660
that if the cart is empty,

8
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.100
then it shows information about the totals

9
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.490
but there's nothing really to see,

10
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.997
and ideally you'd probably want to tell the user,

11
00:00:24.997 --> 00:00:27.640
"Hey, your cart's empty, there is nothing here."

12
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.180
So we'll actually modify the code

13
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:30.533
to kind of support this.

14
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.640
And so what I'll do is I'll make

15
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.140
one quick minor update for the logo link

16
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.410
in our application and this is

17
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.490
in our app.component.html file.

18
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.713
So just a quick minor update here.

19
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.830
This is kind of unrelated to the empty cart item

20
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.240
but I simply wanted to fix this

21
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.180
because this is something

22
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.303
that's been lingering here for a bit.

23
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.823
So let's select the file app.component.html.

24
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.970
I'll move in to the menu sidebar section

25
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.600
and zoom in, and I'll update the href here

26
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.483
for the link on our logo.

27
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.830
And I'll make use of router link

28
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.860
to make use of the Angular routing

29
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.203
and this will go to /products.

30
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.140
And that's something that I should have fixed

31
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.930
much earlier but anyway,

32
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.020
we got it taken care of now

33
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.413
so we're all good to go.

34
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.530
Okay, so now back to the real issue here for us,

35
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.900
actually displaying the empty cart message.

36
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.880
So moving back to our cart-details.component.html

37
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.860
I only want to show the table

38
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.790
of the cart items

39
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.550
only if we have some data to show.

40
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.987
If not, I want to give the user a message

41
00:02:08.987 --> 00:02:10.847
"Hey, your cart is empty."

42
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.410
So I can make use of an ngIf

43
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.353
and just check the size of the cart items.

44
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.310
So here I'll have cartItems.length greater than zero.

45
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.660
If so, then we can go ahead

46
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.800
and handle all the table stuff and so on.

47
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.800
Let me just do a cut-paste on that /div,

48
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.333
move it down to the bottom of the table.

49
00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.603
So I'll place it right after the table.

50
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.040
And then make sure you have

51
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.163
those three divs there at the bottom.

52
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.230
Just to make sure the placement is correct.

53
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.190
Alrighty, so if we save that,

54
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.900
then that should help get us started.

55
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.990
Let me just highlight everything here for the table

56
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.803
and just tab it in, just so everything's lined up.

57
00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.023
That looks pretty good.

58
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.090
So here we have the ngIf

59
00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.113
just checking the cartItems.length.

60
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.610
All right, so I'll swing over to my app

61
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.033
and click on the cart and okay,

62
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.800
it's not displaying the table,

63
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.110
it's displaying nothing.

64
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.050
So that part is working

65
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.140
but I also want to show a message

66
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.670
if the cart is empty, okay?

67
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:46.853
So we're almost there.

68
00:03:54.022 --> 00:03:55.250
And so we can add this support

69
00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.730
by making use of an ngIf

70
00:03:57.701 --> 00:03:58.710
and just checking to see

71
00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.140
if cartItems.length equals zero,

72
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.473
then we display whatever our message is.

73
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.277
And so here we'll simply give our message

74
00:04:39.277 --> 00:04:41.367
"Your shopping cart is empty."

75
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.280
All right, so we can save this

76
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.883
and swing back into our browser.

77
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:52.810
Alrighty, so there's the message.

78
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.680
Let's just go through the full app here

79
00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.513
and test it out.

80
00:04:55.513 --> 00:04:58.673
So going over to our shopping cart icon.

81
00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.310
Okay, good, so your shopping cart is empty.

82
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.976
Great! So this is working out just fine.

83
00:05:03.976 --> 00:05:05.610
Now let's add some items to the cart

84
00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.210
and see how that part works out.

85
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.570
Alrighty, and oh, they're good.

86
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.020
So we only see the cart if there's actually

87
00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.750
some items in the cart.

88
00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.180
If not, we get the error message as desired.

89
00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.850
So this is great.

90
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:22.683
Good job!
