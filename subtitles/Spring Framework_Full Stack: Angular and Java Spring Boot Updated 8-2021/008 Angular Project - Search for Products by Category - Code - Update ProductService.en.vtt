00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.720
<v ->Alrighty, so we're at our final step here,</v>

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.940
Step Seven of updating our angular service

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.033
to call new URL on the Spring Boot app.

4
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.153
So let's swing into Visual Studio Code.

5
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.913
Let's move to the product service.

6
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.070
Expand my window here, so it just has a check point

7
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.763
we're in our product service.

8
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.040
And I had a little reminder here, a little to-do statement

9
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.901
saying, hey, come back and do this work.

10
00:00:37.901 --> 00:00:40.240
(laughter)

11
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.750
So I'll remove all my little cute comments here for that

12
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.900
and I will remove the little to-do

13
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.700
because we're actually doing it now.

14
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.850
All right, so I need to build the URL

15
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.133
based on the category ID.

16
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.980
So remember that Spring Data REST

17
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.960
automatically exposes the endpoint

18
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.800
search find by category ID equals,

19
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.820
so I can use that as my search URL.

20
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.010
So I'll make use of the base URL for this REST API

21
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.360
and I'll simply add on the slash search and so on.

22
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.110
So I have this dot base URL and then slash search

23
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.133
slash find by category ID.

24
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.560
And then I have ID equals and then I'll simply use

25
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.690
the parameter that's passed into this method,

26
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.653
the category ID.

27
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.770
And that's it, so that's our search URL.

28
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.960
So now need to update line 21 here

29
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.520
so instead of using base URL

30
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.633
I need to make use of search URL.

31
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.840
And that's pretty much it.

32
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.910
So we've made the appropriate updates here

33
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.410
for our product service to call

34
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.360
the appropriate REST endpoint

35
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.970
that was set up by Spring Data REST.

36
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:16.803
Good job.

37
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.080
So now let's go ahead and run this application,

38
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.773
open up our new terminal window.

39
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.600
Make sure we move into our appropriate directory here.

40
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.583
And simply do an NG serve.

41
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.053
Let me just swing back over to my browser.

42
00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.413
This my angular app running on port 4200.

43
00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.570
Alrighty, so our app is up and running,

44
00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.240
so we can test some of the menu links

45
00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.623
over on the left hand side.

46
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.630
And success!

47
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.060
So we're able to display books and coffee mugs.

48
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.210
This is great, so we're only displaying products

49
00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.683
for that given category ID.

50
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.650
Okay, this looks really good, I'm happy with this.

51
00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.553
This works as desired. Good job.
