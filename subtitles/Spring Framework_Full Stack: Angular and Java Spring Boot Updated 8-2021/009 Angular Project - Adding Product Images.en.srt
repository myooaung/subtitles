1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,690
<v Instructor>Alrighty and so one thing I like to do</v>

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:07,113
is add support for images for our given products.

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,990
So if you may have noticed in our database,

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,293
if you looked at the products table.

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,300
And there's an entry here called image URL

6
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,380
and it has assets, image products,

7
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,120
and right now each one of these products

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,800
simply have a placeholder file that it references.

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,350
We could always update that later.

10
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:33,460
But for now we'll just go ahead

11
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:34,880
and use this placeholder file

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,610
and see how this would work out.

13
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,140
So right now, that's simply the name

14
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,370
or the location of the file.

15
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,943
We actually need to add this to our given project.

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,683
So in your angular projects under your source directory

17
00:00:46,683 --> 00:00:48,427
there's an assets directory

18
00:00:48,427 --> 00:00:50,040
and so this is a special directory

19
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,510
where you can place your web assets

20
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,970
like images, JavaScript, CSS, PDFs, whatever.

21
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,700
You can also add sub-directories here with any name

22
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,873
and these items will be served up by the given application.

23
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,550
So what I'll do is I'll actually place

24
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:08,253
our placeholder images here in this assets sub-directory.

25
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,790
So in our file system we actually have some starter files

26
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,110
that you can make use of.

27
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:16,943
So if you'll look

28
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:20,080
in the e-commerce project 01-starter-files

29
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,033
there's a directory here called angular-image-assets.

30
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,130
So inside of here there's an images sub-directory

31
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,790
that has products, placeholder.png.

32
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,830
So we'll actually copy that images folder

33
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,293
into our given project.

34
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,690
And I'll show you a nice little technique here,

35
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:43,620
you can simply drag and drop the images folder

36
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,813
to the assets folder in your angular project.

37
00:02:07,365 --> 00:02:09,570
And there we go, so we have this placeholder.png.

38
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,030
So now we can reference this

39
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,163
in our given angular application.

40
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,620
So let's add a new column here for our image

41
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,240
and it won't have a name or anything.

42
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,970
We'll just give a little empty TD here.

43
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,870
Just so we have a column.

44
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:30,410
And then what I'll do in the actual TD section,

45
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,060
I'll use the tempProduct.imageurl

46
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,120
and I make use of the image source equals

47
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,923
and I give a reference to that image URL.

48
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,230
And image source is standard HTML work right?

49
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:50,813
So here we have tempProduct.imageUrl.

50
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,363
And that's pretty much it for that item there.

51
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,100
And so again it's going to serve it out of that

52
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:11,910
assets/images/products placeholder.png.

53
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,180
So swing over to our browser, and okay, great.

54
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,220
This looks good.

55
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,720
The images are kind of big (laughs)

56
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,880
but at least they're being displayed, and again,

57
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,160
these are just placeholder images.

58
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,250
We could always replace them with real images if we'd like.

59
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,000
But let me go ahead and change some of the sizing here.

60
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,270
So I'll just change the height.

61
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:37,570
And I'll simply change the height to 50.

62
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,760
And save, and swing back and okay great, this looks good.

63
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,970
So these little thumbnails

64
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:48,307
basically now of the product images.

65
00:03:48,307 --> 00:03:50,050
And we could always play around with other stuff

66
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:53,090
but at least we have the basics in place here.

67
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,520
So we have our app kind of up and running

68
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,633
with making use of images.

69
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,350
And one thing here I'll go through

70
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,550
and add some alignment here.

71
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,510
So class equals align middle,

72
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,260
just so everything kind of lines up properly in the table.

73
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,863
And I'll apply this to each one of the elements here.

74
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,513
A little copy paste exercise.

75
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,163
And then swing back over.

76
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:35,060
And then we'll see how the text is aligned in the middle,

77
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,900
vertically, for this given item.

78
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,070
So this looks great, so our table's in place.

79
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,290
It looks good and we've just added some image support.

80
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,040
So I'd like to say good job my friend.

81
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,873
Yoohoo!
