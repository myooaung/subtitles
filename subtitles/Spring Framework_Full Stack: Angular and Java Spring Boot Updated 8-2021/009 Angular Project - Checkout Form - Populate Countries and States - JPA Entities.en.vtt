00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:02.600
<v Instructor>Alrighty, so moving along</v>

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.070
with our development process,

3
00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.530
in this video we'll cover step two

4
00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.933
of developing the JPA Entities for Country and State.

5
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:13.780
Alrighty, so let's go ahead and swing

6
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.343
into our IntelliJ IDE.

7
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.233
Let me zoom in here for a second.

8
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.050
So, we'll move into our src, main, java, our package.

9
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.723
I'm going to add some new classes in this entity package.

10
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.040
So I'll just create a new class here.

11
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.823
And the name of this class is Country.

12
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.840
And I'll just expand my window here.

13
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.900
So this is our JPA Entity,

14
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.960
so up top I'll make use of the @Entity annotation,

15
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.893
and also the @Table annotation to map it to a given table.

16
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.220
And I'll also make use of Lombok here

17
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.043
to generate the getters and setters for me.

18
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.870
Okay, so let's go ahead and define

19
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.693
the fields here for id, code and name,

20
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.100
and then I'll just go ahead and set up

21
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.810
the JPA mapping tier

22
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.580
for mapping these fields to given columns.

23
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.370
And so Id is our primary key,

24
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.093
so that's our @Id and the @GeneratedValue here.

25
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.580
Now just kind of copy-paste that @Column,

26
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.270
X number of times,

27
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.530
and I'll simply change the name here.

28
00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.400
So id, code, and name,

29
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.840
so those are the three columns

30
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.323
that we're mapping to in our database table.

31
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.533
Okay, so the coding for this entity class looks pretty good.

32
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.470
Now there's one thing that we have to do is a TODO.

33
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.870
We need to set up our one-to-many relationship

34
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.770
because one country has many states,

35
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.880
but for right now, just leave it as a comment.

36
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.470
I won't write the code yet.

37
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.160
I'll wait until I create the class for state

38
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.710
and then I'll come back and take care of this TODO,

39
00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.810
but at least it's here to just remind me

40
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.613
that I have more work to do.

41
00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.560
Now, let's go back to this entity package

42
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.303
and let's create a new Java class for State.

43
00:03:19.554 --> 00:03:20.950
And so, this is a very similar process

44
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.580
to what we did for Country, right?

45
00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.533
So we'll simply give our JPA annotations,

46
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.873
and then I'll make use of the @Data annotation from Lombok.

47
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.153
And the same drill,

48
00:03:48.153 --> 00:03:50.253
I set up the fields here for the table.

49
00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:53.653
And so for the country_id

50
00:03:53.653 --> 00:03:57.530
this is actually going to map back to the given country object,

51
00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.850
so we'll add a special annotation there.

52
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.600
I'll come back to that in a second.

53
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.570
But let's go ahead and just put

54
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.913
the basic annotations in place right now.

55
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.153
So for our primary key field Id,

56
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.790
and then I'll just copy that column

57
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.530
and put it here above name.

58
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.870
And so name equals name, all right.

59
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.620
And now this many-to-one relationship,

60
00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.940
because many states belong to one country, so @ManyToOne,

61
00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.130
and then the join column will join on country_id.

62
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.840
That's the actual column that we're joining on

63
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.033
in the state table.

64
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.670
And so that country_id maps back

65
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.470
to the actual country table

66
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.343
as a foreign key relationship.

67
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.560
Okay, so now that our state's in place,

68
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.170
now we can kind of swing back to

69
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.540
that TODO statement that we had,

70
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.393
and we can kind of resolve it now.

71
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.083
So in Country.java, that's where I'm at right now,

72
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.460
down at our little TODO,

73
00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.210
I'll kind of zoom in here for a bit

74
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.613
and I'll make use of this OneToMany,

75
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.373
and this is going to be mapped by country.

76
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.870
And so we have a list of states

77
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.913
that are mapped by the country.

78
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.850
Alrighty, and I can remove the TODO

79
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.933
because we're done with it.

80
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.350
All right, so this looks pretty good so far

81
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.923
with setting up that one-to-many relationship.

82
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.810
And yeah, so we're pretty much done

83
00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.130
with writing the code here for our JPA Entities

84
00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.130
for Country and State.

85
00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.010
So we set up the basic fields,

86
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:08.450
and we also set up the relationships

87
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.930
of one-to-many and many-to-one.

88
00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.313
Alrighty, good job.
