1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:02,070
<v Instructor>Alrighty so let's add</v>

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,460
validation for credit card,

3
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,889
we'll do things slightly different here

4
00:00:05,889 --> 00:00:07,950
on credit card for the card number,

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,530
we only want to have 16 digits as well as the card number.

6
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,450
Now I know that there's some special algorithms

7
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:18,230
that you can apply to card numbers to check the checksum,

8
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,906
if it's an American express or a visa or MasterCard,

9
00:00:21,906 --> 00:00:23,740
I won't cover that.

10
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,160
For now I'll simply check

11
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,850
if it's only 16 digits

12
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,320
and I'll do that using a regular expression.

13
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,660
If you'd like to get into more advanced algorithms

14
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,290
on the credit card number checks,

15
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:35,670
feel free to add that in your own time,

16
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,570
and also feel free to share it with the rest of the group.

17
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:41,240
And also for the security code,

18
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,360
we only want to accept three digits

19
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,650
and then the expiration month and year

20
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,510
they are auto-populated based on our previous coding logic

21
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,670
so, there's no special validation rules

22
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,833
we need to add for the section.

23
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,130
So again just more of the same

24
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,610
as far as our development process

25
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:02,633
and let's go ahead and dive in.

26
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,920
So move in here to our checkout component.Ts

27
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:19,913
I'll move down to our credit card section.

28
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,713
So we'll set up our car type to be required.

29
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,210
And then from name on card,

30
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,300
we'll make it required min length 2 ,

31
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,683
not only white space.

32
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,560
And then for card number we'll add Validators.patterns

33
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,010
we're going to make use of a regular expression here

34
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,710
and this regular expression

35
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,873
we'll check to make sure that we only have 16 digits.

36
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,270
We'll also make this field required

37
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:46,480
and we'll apply very similar validation rules

38
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,833
for security code.

39
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,313
So for security code, only three digits.

40
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,780
And remember we don't need to add anything

41
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,060
for expiration month or year

42
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,410
because those are pre-populated based on the logic

43
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:13,763
that we created before.

44
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:19,280
So just moving right along here step two of defining

45
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,873
the Getter method to access these form controls.

46
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,563
I'll just copy some previous code.

47
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,433
So I'll update the method name here.

48
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,010
This is credit card type

49
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,593
and the field name is credit card,

50
00:03:55,732 --> 00:03:56,763
that card type,

51
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,110
and just copy this and paste it X the number of times

52
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:11,110
and go ahead and make my updates on the method names.

53
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,813
So credit card name on card,

54
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,280
credit card number

55
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,963
and credit card security code,

56
00:04:32,698 --> 00:04:33,990
and then I'll make the appropriate updates

57
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,193
over on the right hand side for the field names.

58
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,050
So this is creditCard.nameOnCard

59
00:04:44,207 --> 00:04:45,040
.cardNumber

60
00:04:50,137 --> 00:04:51,220
.securityCode

61
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,430
Alrighty, so just use this as a checkpoint,

62
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,020
make sure your methods match up directly

63
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,950
with what I have here on the screen.

64
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,043
And this looks pretty good.
