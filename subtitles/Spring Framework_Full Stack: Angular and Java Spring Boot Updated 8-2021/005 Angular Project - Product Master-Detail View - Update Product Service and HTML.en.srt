00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:02,500
<v Chad>Alrighty, so moving along</v>

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,860
with our development process,

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,100
in this video we'll cover steps five and six

4
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,920
of updating our product service

5
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,583
and also updating the HTML page.

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,050
Alrighty so, remember earlier I said, "Hey, this getProduct

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,440
method doesn't exist yet,

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,350
we'll declare it in the next video."

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,823
Well, this is the video and we'll actually declare it now.

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,210
Alrighty, so lets zoom in here

11
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,640
and we'll make use of the IDE and we'll tell it to

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,190
declare the method, getProduct.

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,653
So, that takes care of that one issue.

14
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,781
Okay, so now for step five, we're actually going to

15
00:00:42,781 --> 00:00:46,010
update our ProductService to call the URL

16
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:47,843
on the Spring Boot application.

17
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,050
So I'll move over here into my ProductService

18
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,470
and we see right here at the beginning

19
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,210
they have that method that was just declared,

20
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,570
the getProduct, let me just cut this for a second,

21
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,373
and just move it down to the regular methods are.

22
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,223
Drop it in here.

23
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,150
Alrighty, so there's my getProduct method,

24
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,543
just a template right now or a place holder.

25
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:31,810
I'll set up the return type of observable product

26
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,343
because we're going to return one product.

27
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,770
And so, the first thing I need to do is

28
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,563
build a URL based on the product id.

29
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:23,450
So, for example this'll be localhost:8080/api/products/1,

30
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,003
two or whatever that actual product id is.

31
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,570
And remember we get this end-point out of the box

32
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:32,200
with Spring Data REST, there's no additional coding

33
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,253
or configuration required on the Spring Boot side.

34
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,540
And then we simply call the rest API,

35
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,713
based on its product URL.

36
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,330
And that's the basic coding here

37
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,823
for the getProduct method and the service.

38
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,070
Okay, so lets go ahead and swing back

39
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:06,000
to our project here, and lets open up the file

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,653
product details component.HTML.

41
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:19,100
And so, this is for step six of updating the HTML page

42
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,900
for the ProductDetailComponent,

43
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,160
to actually display the product details

44
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,470
because right now, we simply have a stock place holder here.

45
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,543
We need to give some real information.

46
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:34,120
All right, so instead of that hard coded item here,

47
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,633
Product Details Works, we're going to say product name.

48
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,440
So now once we run it, we should see the actual

49
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,150
product name for each product

50
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,870
when we select the actual details.

51
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,620
So let me just get my application up and running again.

52
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,200
Okay back in the browser, select one of my products here

53
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,880
and this is great, that's the product name.

54
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,770
Crash Course in Python, good, good.

55
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:22,460
And lets try one more, so the beginners guide,

56
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,023
nah, I'll try the JavaScript cookbook.

57
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,000
Excellent, great.

58
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,500
So now we know the actual product name is being

59
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,960
displayed on the product details page.

60
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,580
And this even works with our other categories,

61
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,203
like Coffee Mug for Sweeper.

62
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,270
Okay I'm happy, we're making some really good progress.

63
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,140
Now, we just have to add some details for the page

64
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,093
and we'll cover that in the next video.
