00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.120
<v Instructor>Okay so let's get started.</v>

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.100
Our goal here is to add a new column

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.693
to check if a sales person has met their quota.

4
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.400
In our angular code,

5
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.750
we're going to make use of conditionals with ngif.

6
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.030
Alrighty, so I'll zoom in here

7
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.230
and I'll move down to our file

8
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.553
sales-person-list-bootstrap.component.html.

9
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.023
And I'll expand this window here.

10
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.900
So the first thing we'll do is

11
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.900
we'll add this new table heading here for met quota.

12
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.570
Then I'll move down here and zoom in a bit

13
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.330
so we'll have this new table data

14
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.980
where we'll make use of our ngif.

15
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.553
So I'll say star ngif and I'll give my Boolean expression.

16
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:10.720
So here I'll have

17
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.567
tempSalesPerson.salesVolume greater than 60,000.

18
00:01:21.937 --> 00:01:26.660
Else myElseBlock and for this div

19
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.433
if everything is true then I'm going to display yes.

20
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.930
And in handling the case for the else

21
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.390
I set up this ng template for myElseBlock

22
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.590
which matches the saying that I had on the previous line.

23
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.070
And so for this portion I'll say no

24
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.470
so this is kind of the else.

25
00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.530
Alrighty, this looks pretty

26
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.190
let's go ahead and open up a new terminal window,

27
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.063
move into our project directory and start our server.

28
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.240
So this automatically opens up our browser and success!

29
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.490
Conditionals with ngif is working, this is great!

30
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.080
So note here on the far right hand column here

31
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.340
we have the values of no, no, yes, no,

32
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.500
so yes where Claire Murphy has a sales volume of 90,000

33
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.860
so this works out based on our Boolean expression in the

34
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.210
bottom ngif temp sales person.sales

35
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.460
volume greater than 60,000.

36
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.493
So this is awesome.

37
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.910
But I'd like to make one little small update here

38
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.910
because for Truong their sales volume is 60,000

39
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.420
didn't quite make the cutoff so I'd like to change that

40
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.093
to be greater than or equal to.

41
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.370
So just swinging back into our IDE for a second

42
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.210
expanding my window here

43
00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.450
and I'll just make very quick update for this conditional.

44
00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.033
So greater than or equal to 60,000.

45
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.650
And then I'll just save this

46
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.060
and swing back over to my browser.

47
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.820
And yay, this is great!

48
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.650
So it automatically updates and so here we have it.

49
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.270
Claire 90,000, Mai Truong 60,000.

50
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.513
Excellent, so this is working exactly as desired.

51
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.030
But hey don't go anywhere,

52
00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.180
have one more thing to do here.

53
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.720
And our next goal here is that we want to format

54
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.463
the sales volume as a currency using US dollars.

55
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.490
So just moving up here to line 18

56
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.570
we have temp sales volume,

57
00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.020
we're going to make use of that angular pipe for currency.

58
00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.303
So I have currency colon and in quotes USD.

59
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.160
So this'll provide the formatting of our sales volume

60
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.343
as a currency using USD.

61
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.480
Simply save this,

62
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.480
swing back over to my browser, and success!

63
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.550
So now it's formatted using that currency pipe

64
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.410
that we just added to our source code.

65
00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:22.500
So this looks great!

66
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.140
I'm happy, I'm excited

67
00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.883
and I'd like to say good job, my friend.
