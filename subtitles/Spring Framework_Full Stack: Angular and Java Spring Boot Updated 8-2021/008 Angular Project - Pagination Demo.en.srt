1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,620
<v ->All ready, so I'll go ahead and run my application,</v>

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,220
I'll open up a terminal window,

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,303
and I'll run the app using ng serve.

4
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:21,530
Alright, so the app is up and running,

5
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,110
I'll swing into a browser

6
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,043
and test it out.

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,160
Okay, so we have our list of products.

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,460
Now let's scroll to the bottom

9
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,710
and see if we can see our pagination control.

10
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:32,810
And oh, yeah,

11
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:33,940
this looks pretty good.

12
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:34,900
Check it out.

13
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,160
So I'll zoom in here.

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,610
So our database has 25 books,

15
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,170
the page size is 10.

16
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,210
So we should have three pages of data,

17
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,940
10, 10, and five.

18
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,890
So, this is great.

19
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,550
And if you click on any one of these pages here,

20
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,140
it'll call that list products method

21
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,740
and it will list those products for that given page.

22
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,023
So I'll just move over to page two.

23
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,720
And then yep, so there we go 10 products

24
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,020
four, four, two

25
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,150
and then page three, five products four more.

26
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:05,983
Great.

27
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:06,980
So this looks pretty good.

28
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,430
So our pagination is working out

29
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,600
as desired.

30
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,540
But let's go ahead and look behind the scenes

31
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,550
and let's get a bit more info

32
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,770
as far as what's happening with our data

33
00:01:17,836 --> 00:01:20,423
and also what data we have in our given database.

34
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,090
So I'll go ahead and open up my sequel workbench,

35
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,633
I want to run some queries here on my database.

36
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,330
So here we see that we have our products,

37
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:45,830
and then we do a count star.

38
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,130
This will tell us how many we have so

39
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,593
we have a total of 100 products.

40
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:52,640
And that's pretty good.

41
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,160
And now remember when we view the products by category,

42
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,520
so we have 25 books, 25 coffee mugs,

43
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,150
mouse pads and luggage tags.

44
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,570
So, 25 each.

45
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,960
That's why we saw just 25 in the previous example,

46
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,390
in the web app,

47
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:12,090
but we have a total of 100 products out there total.

48
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,820
So here to do a query just on books,

49
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,180
so where category ID equals one,

50
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,943
that's the ID for books.

51
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,283
And I could also just do a select star.

52
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,780
And just highlight that and execute that query only.

53
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,290
And so those are all of the books that we have

54
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,280
in this example.

55
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,850
Okay, good.

56
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,040
And I could do a similar thing for another category ID

57
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,873
of two.

58
00:02:56,182 --> 00:02:57,960
Until that will give me all of the coffee mugs.

59
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,110
So we have 25 coffee mugs.

60
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:03,113
Then select count star for category ID two.

61
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,720
And that'll give me 25.

62
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,620
So, we have 25 per category

63
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,100
four categories, a total of 100.

64
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,933
Good job.

65
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,870
And so I can simply go through

66
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,490
and just check some of the other categories

67
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,670
and a similar thing here at the bottom with the pagination.

68
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,320
So this is pretty good.

69
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,253
I like how this is working out for us.

70
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,440
Now let's swing over into our IDE

71
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,260
and let's play around a bit

72
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,573
with the actual page size.

73
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,850
Right now we have page size equals 10,

74
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,670
but let's play around with the page size

75
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,443
and change it to five.

76
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,430
Just to verify that the pagination control is being

77
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,900
generated dynamically,

78
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,073
and it's using this information to generate those controls.

79
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,650
Alright, so I have page size equals five,

80
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,440
I save it reloaded,

81
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,170
go to books over here

82
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,100
and scroll down and excellent.

83
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,590
Good job. So notice here,

84
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,140
our pagination control,

85
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,050
so our database has 25 books

86
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,070
page size of five.

87
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,160
So we have five, five and five.

88
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,400
Excellent, excellent.

89
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,233
I love this.

90
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,420
And I can simply choose some of the links here at the bottom

91
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,380
to go through the different pages.

92
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,213
Okay, good job.

93
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,070
And so now I'll swing back

94
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,910
and I'll change the page size to 50.

95
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,690
Okay, I'm just having fun here.

96
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:47,410
We really only have 25 products per category,

97
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:48,900
but I'll change it to 50

98
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,263
just to see what happens in our application.

99
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,560
So swinging back into our app,

100
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,760
scrolling down to the bottom,

101
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,350
wow! A lot of products.

102
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,203
That's good.

103
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,670
And our database has 25 books

104
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,600
page size of 50.

105
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,387
So we have one page of data.

106
00:05:07,387 --> 00:05:08,530
(laughs)

107
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,390
And, that's it,

108
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,500
just one page of data, all right,

109
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,600
same for all the other product categories.

110
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,160
Okay, so that's it.

111
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,370
So we had a good time of playing around with page sizes

112
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,423
and seeing how this would affect our pagination control.
