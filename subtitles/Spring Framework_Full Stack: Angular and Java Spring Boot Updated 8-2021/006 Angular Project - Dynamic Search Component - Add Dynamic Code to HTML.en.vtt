00:00:01.287 --> 00:00:02.700
<v Chad>All righty, so we're at the last step</v>

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.530
of our development process, step six.

3
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.130
So in the HTML, we're going to replace

4
00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.223
that hard-coded links with our menu component.

5
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.910
All right, so let's swing in over here,

6
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.970
and let's close some of these windows

7
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.513
just to clean things up a bit.

8
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.060
And I'll open up the file app.component.html

9
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.300
because that's the one that currently

10
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.560
has the hard-coded links.

11
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.943
Zoom out real quick, expand my window.

12
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.023
Here's our MENU SIDEBAR.

13
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.020
And then moving down, here's our menu-sidebar-content,

14
00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.000
and this is where we have those hard-coded links

15
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.677
category/1, category/2.

16
00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.973
So we need to replace this with our new menu component.

17
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.910
The first thing I need is the actual selector

18
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.100
for my new menu component.

19
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.030
So I'll move into my file here,

20
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.620
product-category-menu-component,

21
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.653
and I'll simply copy the selector.

22
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.510
Then I'll swing over to my app.component.html,

23
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.393
and I'll make use of this selector.

24
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.930
All right, so that's our new menu component.

25
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.053
That's the selector here for our new menu component.

26
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.480
Now the code on lines 13 through 24,

27
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.340
we actually need to cut this

28
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.433
and move this to a different file.

29
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.910
And I need to move this over

30
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.163
to my product-category-menu-component.html file.

31
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.330
And let's go ahead and remove the placeholder text here,

32
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.800
and then let's paste in our new content.

33
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.600
And just do a quick little format here on this document.

34
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.550
This is the hard-coded content,

35
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.310
but right now, I want to just test this out

36
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.540
just to make sure the whole menu component things works.

37
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.340
We still have the hard-coded data,

38
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.850
but I simply want to run the app,

39
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.560
just to make sure all the pieces fit in place,

40
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.303
just to make sure I didn't break anything. (laughs)

41
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.160
Let's move into our Terminal window,

42
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.210
and let's run our application real quick.

43
00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:19.740
And I just access my application, and it's up and running.

44
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.510
So great, this works.

45
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.470
It's not dynamic yet.

46
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.920
We still have the hard-coded links,

47
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.130
but at least now, it's actually using our menu component.

48
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.880
So now we know that parts works,

49
00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.680
now we can go through and make this piece of it dynamic.

50
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.380
Moving back into my application here,

51
00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.070
let's remove the item here for Coffee Mugs.

52
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.653
So let's delete this content.

53
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.460
And so we'll make use of this list item,

54
00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.533
and we'll make use of the ngFor.

55
00:04:04.803 --> 00:04:07.840
We have let tempProductCategory of productCategories,

56
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.170
so we're basically looping over the categories,

57
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.413
and we'll build the links dynamically with this loop.

58
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.880
Instead of hard-coding the category id,

59
00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.060
I'm going to make use of tempProductCategory.id,

60
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.560
and I'll add that to the link.

61
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.350
I'll slide over a bit.

62
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.693
I'll just put this down on a separate line.

63
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.900
And again, instead of hard-coding the actual category name,

64
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.913
I'll make use of the category that I have for my data.

65
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.843
I have tempProductCategory.categoryName.

66
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.020
All righty, so this looks pretty good.

67
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.940
And then I swing back over to the application, and voila!

68
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.110
This looks great!

69
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.350
So we have more categories here.

70
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.770
So we're actually reading these product categories

71
00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.930
from the REST API, from the database.

72
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.360
So this is great, so now our menu component is dynamic.

73
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.050
It's no longer hard-coded.

74
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.960
And it's powered by data from our database.

75
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:30.980
This is really good!

76
00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.333
I'm happy about this!
