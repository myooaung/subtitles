1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,520
<v Instructor>Alrighty, so let's go ahead and get started</v>

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,680
with step one of adding the click handler

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,383
for the add to cart button.

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,690
So I'll just zoom in here,

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,993
and I'll move down to a source, app, components.

6
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,773
And I'll move into the product details component.

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,650
And I'll open up the html page,

8
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,713
product details component.html.

9
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,680
Let's expand this window here,

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,230
give us some room to work with,

11
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,460
and I'll move down to where I have the button

12
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,850
for add to cart.

13
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,343
And so this is where I'll do my work right here.

14
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,003
In select before will change href to a button.

15
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,630
And then we'll add the appropriate styles here

16
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:02,493
for the button.

17
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:14,550
So I'll make use of button, button primary,

18
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,713
button SM for button small.

19
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,130
And then I'll add code here

20
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,970
for my click handler.

21
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:27,870
So I'll have click,

22
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,363
and I'll call it add to cart.

23
00:01:38,735 --> 00:01:40,240
Then the IDE will do a good job,

24
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,800
and tell me that I have an error. (laughs)

25
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,910
And yes, Sir, I know

26
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,800
the identifier add to cart is not defined,

27
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,363
and we'll actually do that now.

28
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,130
So here's step to of updating the product details component

29
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,653
with the click handler method.

30
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:59,680
So I'll actually copy this method name, add to cart,

31
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,390
and then I'll move to the file

32
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,853
product details component.ts.

33
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,880
And what I'll do is I'll move to the bottom of this file,

34
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,730
and I'll just paste in that method name, add to cart,

35
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,683
and I'll just stub it out for now.

36
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,360
But I know that I'll need the cart service,

37
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,160
so let me go ahead and move up to my constructor,

38
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,173
and let's inject the cart service.

39
00:02:34,802 --> 00:02:36,450
Alright, so now I can start using this

40
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,663
here in my actual method, add to cart.

41
00:02:46,456 --> 00:02:47,490
And the first thing I'll do here

42
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,240
is I'll just put a little console.log.

43
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,290
I'll say adding to cart,

44
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,923
and I'll give the product name and the product unit price.

45
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,873
I'll add a semi-colon here.

46
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,250
Notice I have a small syntax error.

47
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,490
And, oh yeah, that's right.

48
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:18,143
I need to say this.product name and this.unit price.

49
00:03:24,763 --> 00:03:29,160
And now I simply go through and create a cart item

50
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,090
based on this product.

51
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,580
So I say the cart item equals new cart item product.

52
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,103
This.product. (laughs)

53
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,440
Alright, and now I can call my cart service.

54
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,470
I can say this.cart service.add to cart,

55
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,793
and I can pass in the cart item.

56
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,380
And that's the basic coding here

57
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,103
for this add to cart method.

58
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,600
And remember with our application interaction,

59
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,470
that new code,

60
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,303
that's the step two.

61
00:04:05,303 --> 00:04:06,136
That's the new code we're adding

62
00:04:06,136 --> 00:04:08,410
for this product details component.

63
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,550
But, again, we're simply leveraging

64
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,090
all of the existing work

65
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,240
on the right hand side.

66
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,310
So no changes for steps one, three, and four.

67
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,530
All that is still the same.

68
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:20,540
We're simply adding new data to the cart service

69
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,783
by calling that method.

70
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,720
And, again, we're simply using the product

71
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,650
that's been defined on this product details component,

72
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:33,700
and, of course, we'll assign it and initialize it

73
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,210
via our handle product details method.

74
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,880
So by the time we add it to the cart,

75
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,230
that product has already been loaded with data.

76
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,170
So, one thing I want to do

77
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,230
is make sure

78
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,780
that our Spring Boot application is up and running.

79
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,903
That's good.

80
00:04:50,903 --> 00:04:52,063
We're running on that side.

81
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,060
And now my Visual Studio Code,

82
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,660
I'll just go ahead and start my Angular application.

83
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:13,863
Okay, great.

84
00:05:13,863 --> 00:05:14,970
So our application's up and running.

85
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,480
Let's swing over to our browser.

86
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,800
Let's go ahead and open up our Web Developer Console

87
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,843
for debugging.

88
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,910
Now we can access our application,

89
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,810
and we can go to the details view

90
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,060
for a given product.

91
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,093
So, Crash Course in Python.

92
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,313
Hit the add to cart button.

93
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:38,890
And, yes.

94
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,650
So the shopping cart is updated

95
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:41,950
with the appropriate data.

96
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:42,990
So this is great.

97
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:46,290
So now we can add something from our details view.

98
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,100
Let's try some of our other products here

99
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,110
like our mouse pad.

100
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,850
Hit the add to cart link.

101
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,980
And good, this product has been added to the cart.

102
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,830
We can add multiple

103
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,690
entries of this.

104
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,470
And excellent, this all looks really good.

105
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,180
And we can go around and some other items

106
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,013
to the cart,

107
00:06:02,013 --> 00:06:03,560
but this all works as desired,

108
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,877
so I'm very excited,

109
00:06:04,877 --> 00:06:06,780
and really happy right now.

110
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,603
So I'd like to say good job, my friend.
