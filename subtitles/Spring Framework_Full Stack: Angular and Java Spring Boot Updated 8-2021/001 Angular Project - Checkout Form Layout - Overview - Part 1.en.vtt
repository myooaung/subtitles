<v Chad>In this video we'll cover the checkout form layout.</v>

2
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.330
You can easily build forms in Angular.

3
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.480
They have support for form data binding,

4
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.690
validation, and processing.

5
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.350
And Angular provides two types of forms.

6
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.993
You have reactive forms and also template-driven forms.

7
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.260
So with reactive forms

8
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.280
they leverage the programmatic API for form building.

9
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.690
It's a scalable solution,

10
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.190
it's designed for large complex forms,

11
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.313
and the forms can easily be reused and tested.

12
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.540
Now, for template-driven forms,

13
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.260
they're really targeted for small simple basic forms.

14
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.670
They're not really scalable,

15
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.820
and not designed for large complex forms.

16
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.750
So in our scenario we're going to make use of reactive forms

17
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.070
'cause we're going to build a large complex form

18
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.950
that makes use of nested elements,

19
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.763
and this is ideal for building real-time applications.

20
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.250
Now, for a comparison of reactive forms

21
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.870
and template-driven forms,

22
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.860
you can go to the link that I have here on the slide.

23
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.090
They have a detailed analysis comparing reactive forms

24
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.750
and template-driven forms.

25
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.653
But again, we're going to make use of reactive forms

26
00:01:14.653 --> 00:01:17.843
because we're going to build a large complex form.

27
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.260
Okay, so let's take a look at some of the key components.

28
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.780
So you have a FormControl,

29
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.220
so that's an individual control

30
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.350
that tracks the value and the validation status.

31
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.920
And then there's also a FormGroup

32
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.500
that's really just a collection of controls.

33
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.500
And you can also create nested groups.

34
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.100
And then there's some other items there too.

35
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.430
And so the link that I gave you on the previous slide,

36
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.630
they go into more details

37
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.600
as far as the other items that are out there,

38
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.350
but we'll make use of some of the key components,

39
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.120
the FormControl and the FormGroup.

40
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.350
So for our checkout form we'll make use of nested groups.

41
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.210
So we'll have a customer group,

42
00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.920
we'll have a shipping address group,

43
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.370
and we'll also have one for billing address,

44
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:02.680
credit card information,

45
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.710
and then finally at the bottom of our form,

46
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.150
we'll have a section where the user can review their order,

47
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.943
and then finally purchase.

48
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.050
So in this section of videos

49
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.490
we're going to focus on the form construction and layout.

50
00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.360
Later on we'll get into populating a form,

51
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.780
and then also we'll get into the work

52
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.793
of processing the form on the backend.

53
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.390
Okay, so in terms of form construction and layout,

54
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.040
here's our development process.

55
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.000
So the first that we'll do

56
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.130
is we'll generate our checkout component.

57
00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.170
Then we'll add a new route for the checkout component.

58
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.210
Next we'll create a new checkout button

59
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.450
and link it to that checkout component.

60
00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.280
Then we'll add support for reactive forms.

61
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.320
We'll define the form in our component .ts file.

62
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.710
Then we'll lay out the form controls in our HTML template.

63
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.460
And then finally, we'll add an event handler

64
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.183
for the form submission.

65
00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.220
All righty, step one of generating our checkout component.

66
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.540
And this is very easy, we've seen this before,

67
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.000
just use ng generate component components/checkout,

68
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.593
and it'll create our checkout component for us.

69
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.480
Then we add a new route for the checkout component.

70
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.910
So in our file app.module.ts

71
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.940
we add this new path here for checkout

72
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.380
and then component to the CheckoutComponent

73
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.873
that was just generated in the previous slide.

74
00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:25.813
And then in step three

75
00:03:25.813 --> 00:03:27.270
we're going to create a new checkout button

76
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.640
and link to the checkout component.

77
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.930
So in our cart details page,

78
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.520
where we have all of our cart items,

79
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.170
we have a new button here, Checkout,

80
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.360
and so that'll actually link over to that routerLink

81
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.560
that we just created, /checkout,

82
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.593
and that'll take us to our given checkout form

83
00:03:42.593 --> 00:03:43.913
that we're going to create.
