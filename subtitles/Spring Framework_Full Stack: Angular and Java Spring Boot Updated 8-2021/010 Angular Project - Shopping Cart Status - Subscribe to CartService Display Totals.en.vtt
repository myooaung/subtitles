00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:03.817
<v Instructor>Alrighty, so we're almost done.</v>

2
00:00:03.817 --> 00:00:05.150
(chuckles)

3
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.050
We're at our final two steps here,

4
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.010
steps four and five of enhancing the CartStatusComponents

5
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.100
to subscribe to the service,

6
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.400
and also updating our CartStatusComponent HTML

7
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.770
to display the cart total price and quantity.

8
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.033
Woof, almost there, almost there.

9
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.270
Alright, let's move back into our IDE.

10
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.460
Let me clean up some of the windows here.

11
00:00:38.347 --> 00:00:39.180
And now let's move over

12
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.193
to our cart-status.component.ts file.

13
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.163
Let me expand my window here for a second.

14
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.440
And what I'll do for this component

15
00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.060
is I'll create two properties for the total price

16
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.463
and also for the total quantity.

17
00:01:21.594 --> 00:01:23.570
And then in this CartStatusComponent,

18
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.813
I'm going to inject the CartService.

19
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.530
And then in my ngOnInit method,

20
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.740
I'll call this.updateCartStatus.

21
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.490
It's a helper method that I'll create here in a second.

22
00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.160
And in this method will actually subscribe for the events

23
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.493
on the CartService.

24
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.130
Alrighty, so let's move in here and write the code.

25
00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.743
So, this.cartservice.totalPrice.subscribe.

26
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.850
And then we'll receive an event from this subscription,

27
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.360
we'll make the assignment so the data comes in,

28
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.193
and I'll have this.totalPrice equals data.

29
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.940
And then I'll do a similar thing here

30
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.823
for a cart totalQuantity.

31
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.473
So .subscribe.

32
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.660
And again, when an event comes in,

33
00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.970
this data will assign it to our property,

34
00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.843
this.totalQuantity equals data.

35
00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.040
Alright, so again, when new events are received,

36
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.630
we make the assignments to update the UI for total price,

37
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.423
and also total quantity.

38
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.020
Okay, so with Step five, we're going to update

39
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.130
the CartStatusComponent HTML to display

40
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.563
the cart total price and quantity.

41
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.250
And so we'll actually reference these properties here

42
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.130
from our CartStatusComponent.

43
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.150
We'll reference the total price and the total quantity.

44
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.210
Now let's go ahead and open up

45
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.643
our cart-status.component.html.

46
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.580
And so remember earlier we had the hard coded data.

47
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.240
So now we'll actually get data

48
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.363
from those component properties.

49
00:04:07.321 --> 00:04:09.370
So I make use of total price,

50
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.820
send it to the currency pipe.

51
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.420
And then I'll do a similar thing here for total quantity.

52
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.630
And so again, it's reading these properties here

53
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.940
from our CartStatusComponent.

54
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.700
So any changes or updates

55
00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.870
via this whole event driven approach,

56
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.673
will update these items dynamically in our UI.

57
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.860
Alright, I'm anxious.

58
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.150
I'm excited.

59
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.033
Let's test it.

60
00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.690
So my app is already running.

61
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.910
And let's swing into our browser.

62
00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.950
And yes, so first off, notice here cart is empty.

63
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.500
So price of zero, quantity is zero.

64
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.793
Yes, awesome.

65
00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.930
Now let's go ahead and add something to the cart.

66
00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.010
So this crash course in python 1499.

67
00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.833
One item, yes, awesome.

68
00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.380
And we can verify that by looking at our console logs

69
00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.690
at the bottom.

70
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.760
Let's also add another book here for a Guru in JavaScript.

71
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.293
So that's the total price, total quantity.

72
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.131
Now let's add another Python book again, okay.

73
00:05:32.131 --> 00:05:33.100
(chuckles)

74
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.123
So notice here the price increases, and also the quantity.

75
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:39.720
And again, the logs here shows the output,

76
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.730
we're adding X number of books in there

77
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:44.290
cause we really, really love Python.

78
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.110
And so now we have those shopping carts status updated.

79
00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.970
We can add some items for mugs,

80
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.150
mouse pads, and so on.

81
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.230
So we can play around with this as much as we'd like.

82
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.160
And we can see here that our shopping cart status component

83
00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.970
is updating dynamically on the fly.

84
00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.550
Based on all of our coding, so, whoo,

85
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.700
I'm really really happy with the way this

86
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:05.830
is coming together.

87
00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.630
And I think you should be happy also.

88
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.693
So I like to say good job.
