00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:03.710
<v Instructor>Now, once we have the project created</v>

2
00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:05.400
we can actually run the project

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.660
by simply moving into that project directory,

4
00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.900
so in this case I'll cd into my-first-angular-project

5
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.800
and the I'll simply run ng serve.

6
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.670
So this command actually performs a number of operations.

7
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.560
So the first thing it does is that it builds

8
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.630
the application, so the compiling slash transpiling,

9
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.420
then it starts the server

10
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.970
and then it'll also watch the source files.

11
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.740
So it'll actually rebuild the application

12
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.760
when any of the source files are updated.

13
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.910
So there's no need to to stop start,

14
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.190
it'll automatically reload or it'll perform

15
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.880
a hot reload of your application.

16
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.640
And we'll actually see this in action

17
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.990
when we go through some of the upcoming videos.

18
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.100
And then by default the server will listen on port 4200,

19
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.830
so once the server is up and running

20
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.740
then you simply open up a web browser

21
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.020
and you visit localhost colon 4200.

22
00:00:55.562 --> 00:00:56.940
And then there's another option here,

23
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.000
you could say ng serve and it'll give dash dash open,

24
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.870
so this is the same as above

25
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.180
but it also will open a web browser for you

26
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.930
and automatically go to the site localhost 4200.

27
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.913
So you have an optional source, which one do you want to use?

28
00:01:15.514 --> 00:01:17.480
Now, you can also change the server port,

29
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.710
so you could say hey, I don't want 4200,

30
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.990
can I run it on a different port?

31
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.560
The answer's yes, you simply give the port argument

32
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.020
and a given value here.

33
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.280
So here I could say ng serve port 5100

34
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.950
and then I can simply go to localhost 5100

35
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.700
or we'll say ng serve port 5100 and open,

36
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.040
so it'll automatically open a browser

37
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.473
and go to that given site.

38
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.000
All righty, so let's take a look at the project files.

39
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.120
So as I mentioned, there's a lot of files

40
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.400
for a given Angular project.

41
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.810
But don't worry, we'll cover some of the key files.

42
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.200
So let's kind of zoom in here.

43
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.640
So we have this angular dot json and this file

44
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.380
basically has the Angular workspace configuration

45
00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.090
and also a list of execution targets.

46
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.990
So we have the e2e directory and the karma file.

47
00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.763
This is for end to end testing.

48
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.480
There's a node_modules directory.

49
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.668
So this is the local repository of the node modules.

50
00:02:10.668 --> 00:02:12.390
There's the package dot json file,

51
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.130
so this has the project metadata,

52
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.500
also a list of node dependencies.

53
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.400
So you can kind of think of the package dot json

54
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.700
as being similar to Maven's pom dot xml file,

55
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.950
basically a list of all your dependencies

56
00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.043
for your project.

57
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.820
Then we have the main source directory.

58
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.820
And then the app folder basically has

59
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.270
your app components, templates and so on.

60
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.840
The assets folder has any other web assets

61
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.800
that you want to serve up.

62
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.160
So for example, images and so on you can place here.

63
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.070
The environments folder has configuration

64
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.540
for your different environments,

65
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.330
so for like dev environment,

66
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.200
test environment, prod environment,

67
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.883
similar to profiles in the Spring world.

68
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.800
There's the index dot html.

69
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.570
So this is your main launch page,

70
00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.470
so this basically kind of bootstraps

71
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.893
the entire process for your given application.

72
00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.690
There's the polyfils dot ts.

73
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.530
So this adds support for different browser versions,

74
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.423
for like i.e. Chrome, Firefox, Safari.

75
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.090
There's the test dot ts, basically has a collection

76
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.370
of unit tests for the entire application.

77
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.040
And then the tsconfig files.

78
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.713
These are the TypeScript compiler config files.

79
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.593
All righty, so if you'd like

80
00:03:25.593 --> 00:03:28.240
to get more information on the file structure,

81
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.330
visit the website here on the screen, angular.io,

82
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:32.940
there's a guide online that will basically

83
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.000
walk through the file structure for you

84
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.570
for a given Angular project,

85
00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.690
so you can get all the gory details

86
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.633
for a given Angular project.

87
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.990
All righty, so let's go ahead and move into our IDE

88
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.380
and let's get started with creating

89
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.490
our first Angular project and we'll get it up and running.

90
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.863
So I'll see ya in the next video.
