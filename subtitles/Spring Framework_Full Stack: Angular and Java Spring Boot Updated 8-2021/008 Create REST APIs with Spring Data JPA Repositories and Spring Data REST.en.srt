1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,260
<v Instructor>Okay, so moving along</v>

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,690
with our development process we're almost done here,

3
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:06,740
so the last step of creating the REST APIs

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:11,320
with Spring Data JPA Repositories and Spring Data REST.

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,350
Okay so let's go ahead and move over here on the side,

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,033
in our project structure here, our package structure,

7
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,013
clean up some of the windows,

8
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:37,520
and the first thing we'll do

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,570
is we'll create a new package called DAO.

10
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,300
And now we'll create a new Java interface,

11
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,670
so in IntelliJ you do a new Java class

12
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,780
and you select Interface

13
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,423
but it's going to be for a product repository.

14
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,393
So choose Interface,

15
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,893
and this is for a ProductRepository.

16
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:24,360
Let me expand the window here

17
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,910
and just kind of zoom in a bit.

18
00:01:32,378 --> 00:01:34,590
And so we'll make use of that Spring Data JPA,

19
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,433
so we extend the JpaRepository,

20
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,920
and then we specify our entity type

21
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,113
and also our primary key type.

22
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:55,060
So the entity type is product,

23
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,740
and the primary key is long.

24
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,570
And this is all from our product that we just created

25
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,723
in the previous video.

26
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,500
And that's it for the coding for our repository.

27
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,250
Pretty easy, pretty fun.

28
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,060
Let's go ahead and create one more repository

29
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,583
for our product category repository.

30
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,933
So choose Interface, ProductCategoryRepository,

31
00:02:26,595 --> 00:02:29,200
and then we'll follow the same technique as before.

32
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,450
So extends JpaRepository,

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,720
the entity is product category,

34
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,123
and the primary key is long.

35
00:02:47,678 --> 00:02:50,720
And I'll add one bit of customization here

36
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,413
for this given repository.

37
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,940
I'll provide the name

38
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,193
for the collection resource relationship.

39
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,740
And also I'll specify the actual path

40
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,570
because I don't want to take the defaults.

41
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,970
The defaults don't work for me,

42
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:19,230
so I'll specify the given data.

43
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,500
So this will be the name

44
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,823
of the actual JSON entry, product category,

45
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:26,880
and this will be the actual reference

46
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,060
for the path product-category.

47
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,820
Normally they'll try and make things plural

48
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,970
by simply adding an "s" onto it,

49
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:34,890
and I don't want that.

50
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,513
I simply will use a simple reference here.

51
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,090
And that's it for creating our repositories.

52
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,790
So we have a product repository,

53
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:47,400
and also a product category repository.

54
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,803
So this looks really good.

55
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,180
All righty, so we finished our development process.

56
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,710
I'm excited now.

57
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,930
Let's go ahead and run it.

58
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,680
I want to see this thing in action.

59
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,293
Okay, great.

60
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:13,770
Our Spring Boot application is up and running.

61
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,220
Now we can swing over to our Web browser

62
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,903
and access one of the URLs.

63
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,410
So just for starters I'll access localhost:8080/api.

64
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:28,240
So this will give me a list of APIs

65
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,970
that are exposed for this given application.

66
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,740
So we can see that we have our product category API

67
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,750
and also a products API.

68
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,910
Let's go ahead and access the products API,

69
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,813
so we do /api/products.

70
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,270
And awesome, this looks great.

71
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,140
So we're getting a list of our products

72
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,300
and this is all coming from our database.

73
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,733
This is awesome, good job.

74
00:04:57,247 --> 00:04:59,923
And so we can also access our product category.

75
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,510
So I'll simply update the URL to reference this

76
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,040
and great, really good.

77
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,450
So notice here we only have one

78
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,930
product category right now, books,

79
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,900
but they basically give us the information

80
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,830
for the various items that are out there.

81
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:21,320
And we can even see the products for this given category.

82
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,850
So we can select the link here,

83
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,470
and now this basically takes us over

84
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:27,070
to the previous products that we saw earlier.

85
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:27,903
So this is great.

86
00:05:27,903 --> 00:05:29,460
So we know we have our REST API

87
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,270
that exposes the actual product categories

88
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,710
and also a list of products.

89
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,633
So I'd like to say good job.
