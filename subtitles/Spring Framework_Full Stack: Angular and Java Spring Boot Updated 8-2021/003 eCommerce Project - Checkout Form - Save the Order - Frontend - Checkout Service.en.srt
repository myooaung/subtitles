00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:03,250
<v ->Alrighty, so we're moving right along.</v>

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:04,590
In this video, we'll cover step two

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,240
of creating a CheckoutService.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,380
Basically making the REST API call

5
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,003
to the Spring Boot backend.

6
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,790
So the first thing I'll do is I'll generate the service.

7
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,713
I use ng generate service services slash checkout.

8
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:46,230
And then we can see in this services subdirectory,

9
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,063
it created a checkout service for us.

10
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:59,070
So the first thing I want to do is set up my purchase URL.

11
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,820
Basically the URL to that Spring Boot backend

12
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,243
REST end point.

13
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,660
And also our class needs to make use of the HTTP client,

14
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,673
so let's go ahead and inject that into the constructor.

15
00:01:41,503 --> 00:01:44,836
Now let's define the method, placeOrder,

16
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,063
that'll pass in a purchase.

17
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,853
We'll make this observable.

18
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,643
Now we'll say any, basically any return type for this one.

19
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,250
Ah, the red squigglies under the observable,

20
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,060
that's because we haven't returned anything yet,

21
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,543
so once we do the return then it'll go away.

22
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,680
So here I'll say return, this dot httpClient dot post,

23
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,803
remember we're going to post to that REST end point.

24
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,750
And so we'll send this to that purchase URL,

25
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,203
and pass over that purchase object.

26
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,443
And that's basically it there for the CheckoutService.
