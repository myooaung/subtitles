1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:02,970
<v Instructor>All righty, so I'm a little excited here.</v>

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:06,100
Let's go ahead and run the app and see what it looks like.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,430
Let's see how our integration process worked

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:12,573
with the template and the Angular application.

5
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:17,630
So the one thing we need to do,

6
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,420
is get our back-end up and running,

7
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,929
so start up IntelliJ,

8
00:00:20,929 --> 00:00:25,083
and run the Spring Boot back-end application.

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,623
All righty, so our Spring Boot back-end is up and running.

10
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,870
And then we can move over to visual studio code.

11
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:48,303
And we can run the Angular front-end application.

12
00:00:57,657 --> 00:00:58,680
All right, so that's up and running,

13
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,690
go to our web browser and go to localhost:4200

14
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,986
to access the Angular app, and okay.

15
00:01:06,986 --> 00:01:11,030
Looks okay, it's just a rough cut right now.

16
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,777
That main section is just out HTML table

17
00:01:13,777 --> 00:01:15,780
that we created earlier,

18
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,110
being put into the template

19
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,660
and we'll work on making it a grid a little bit later,

20
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,560
but at least we have the data being displayed,

21
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,370
which is kind of cool.

22
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,110
Over on the left hand side we have the categories,

23
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,410
along the top we have the search bar and so on.

24
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:30,120
We'll add this functionality over time.

25
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,970
But this is good,

26
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,606
at least we know we have the styles in place

27
00:01:32,606 --> 00:01:35,453
and all the basics in place right now.

28
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,570
All right, let's swing back over to visual studio coding,

29
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,810
you may sit there and wonder, gosh all of the CSS styles,

30
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,170
what are they?

31
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,624
What are they doing and so on.

32
00:01:48,624 --> 00:01:52,349
So if you need to find out about a given CSS style,

33
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:54,820
simply copy the style name

34
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,471
and then search for it in styles.css.

35
00:01:57,471 --> 00:02:00,059
If it's not in the styles.css,

36
00:02:00,059 --> 00:02:02,051
then you simply copy the style name

37
00:02:02,051 --> 00:02:03,890
and search for it on Google.

38
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,674
Like Bootstrap or whatever.

39
00:02:05,674 --> 00:02:07,718
If the style starts with FA,

40
00:02:07,718 --> 00:02:11,163
then most likely it's something from Fontawesome.

41
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,640
So let's look at a quick little demo of this,

42
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,140
'cus there's a lot of styles here.

43
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,033
Page wrapper, let's go ahead and grab that style,

44
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:26,880
let's get some more information about it.

45
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,363
So we simply grab the style, we copy it.

46
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,123
And then we move over to our styles.css,

47
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,120
and then we simply search for that style.

48
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,820
So here we see it's one of the styles in our own files,

49
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,080
so overflow, background, padding and so on.

50
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,556
So that's a local CSS style that we're using.

51
00:02:51,556 --> 00:02:54,000
So what about menu side bars,

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,943
so let's do a similar thing with that one.

53
00:03:03,477 --> 00:03:05,900
So drop in menu side bar,

54
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,520
and again we can see the reference

55
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,271
on how that given CSS style is defined.

56
00:03:10,271 --> 00:03:11,104
Okay,

57
00:03:11,104 --> 00:03:14,253
so these are all local styles in our given application.

58
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:22,010
So what about other styles, maybe a Bootstrap style.

59
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,533
So let me go ahead and grab this container fluid,

60
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:31,143
and copy this style and see if I can find it in styles.css.

61
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,590
Notice here in the top right, it says no results.

62
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,214
Hey, I couldn't find it, it's not in your local CSS file.

63
00:03:38,214 --> 00:03:40,170
All right, so that means we need to go to the web

64
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,320
and then search for it.

65
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,900
So I'll check to see if it's a Bootstrap style.

66
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,610
So I'll just do a search on Bootstrap

67
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,023
and that given style name.

68
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,390
Bingo!

69
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,870
Good, so this is definitely a Bootstrap style.

70
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,716
So we found some tutorials about it,

71
00:03:57,716 --> 00:04:01,164
and we even find the official Bootstrap documentation

72
00:04:01,164 --> 00:04:03,293
about that given style.

73
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,103
If we follow the link here,

74
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,950
search for it over here on their site,

75
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,583
that's a cool feature.

76
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:15,773
It basically gives you information about that given style.

77
00:04:15,773 --> 00:04:18,868
So it's for setting up containers and flow and so forth.

78
00:04:18,868 --> 00:04:21,102
Basically for setting up a grid system.

79
00:04:21,102 --> 00:04:24,343
That's what we'll use on our product layout.

80
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:33,330
All right, so that was just a little example there

81
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:36,370
on researching or investigating the different styles

82
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,293
that are used in this given application.

83
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,690
So now we'll take a look at this app product list.

84
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,554
So this is code we created a little bit earlier,

85
00:04:45,554 --> 00:04:47,570
so this is one of our components.

86
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:48,930
Our product list components.

87
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:49,763
So let's go ahead

88
00:04:49,763 --> 00:04:52,320
and look at the product-list-component.ts file.

89
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,270
So that's given selector, that kind of connects everything.

90
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:01,480
We're going to make use of a different template here,

91
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,600
so we're not going to use the product list template component,

92
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,290
we'll make use of a new one,

93
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,972
but we'll use it as a starting point.

94
00:05:07,972 --> 00:05:11,246
All right, so let's go ahead and copy this component file.

95
00:05:11,246 --> 00:05:13,423
Product list table.component.

96
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:20,580
Then we'll paste it and now we'll simply rename it,

97
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,373
and give it a new name.

98
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:29,450
So I will call it product list grid.component,

99
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,183
and I'll remove the copy stuff.

100
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:38,223
All right, so that's my own file that I can use now.

101
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,730
Make sure that file is open, list grid.

102
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:45,670
Close the list table,

103
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:48,053
make sure I'm editing the correct file.

104
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,920
I also need to update the type script file

105
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,797
to make sure it's using the right template.

106
00:05:59,797 --> 00:06:02,040
All right, so I just did a little copy, paste over there.

107
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,510
Comin' out this guy,

108
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,210
and then the template URL is

109
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:09,503
product list grid.component.html.

110
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,980
Okay, great.

111
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,370
Let's go ahead an open up our product list

112
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,770
grid.coponent.html, expand the window.

113
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,333
This is where we'll do all of our work.
