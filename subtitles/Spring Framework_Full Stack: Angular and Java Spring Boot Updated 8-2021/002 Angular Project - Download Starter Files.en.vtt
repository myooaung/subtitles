00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:02.650
<v Instructor>All righty, so let's go ahead</v>

2
00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.620
and take a look at our development process.

3
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.120
So in this video, we're going to focus on step one of

4
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.003
downloading the HTML template starter files.

5
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.420
Okay, so let's go ahead and move into a web browser

6
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.973
and let's access this URL link that I have on the screen.

7
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.410
So let's go ahead and look at our file system here

8
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.173
and take a look at that file.

9
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.530
So I'll move into my browser downloads directory here.

10
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.253
There is that file OO-starter-files.zip.

11
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.250
And give me one second here.

12
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.070
I want to open up a new window here from our file system

13
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.497
so I can move some files around.

14
00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.530
All right, so down at the bottom,

15
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.773
I want to create a new folder on my file system.

16
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.983
I'll call it ecommerce-project-release-2.0.

17
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.613
You can use any name that you want.

18
00:01:34.405 --> 00:01:35.640
And then this is the directory

19
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.520
that I'll put my starter files in

20
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.040
so let me just go ahead and open up this directory

21
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.490
ecommerce-project-release-2.0

22
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.310
and unzip up top

23
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.183
and simply move those files down to my directory.

24
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.973
Okay, great.

25
00:01:50.973 --> 00:01:52.000
This looks pretty good.

26
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.740
So I should have ecommerce-project-release-2.0

27
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.630
and my OO-starter-files.

28
00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.123
There's three main directories here,

29
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.240
db-scripts, luv2shop-template, and product-image-assets,

30
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.620
and we'll use these directories and files

31
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.543
in the upcoming videos.

32
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.010
All right, so for now I want to go through

33
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.810
and actually view the HTML templates

34
00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.000
so we'll move into that directory luv2shop-template

35
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
so this has .html files, assets, and CSS styles.

36
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.843
Let's go ahead and open up home.html.

37
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.350
All right, so this looks good.

38
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.030
So this is just a demo template.

39
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.630
There's no real functionality.

40
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.330
There's no database interaction.

41
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.280
We're simply using files locally in our file system.

42
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.900
But don't worry, later in the course,

43
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.580
we'll hook in our backend Spring Boot system.

44
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.160
But anyway, I just want to kind of play around

45
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.820
with this given template,

46
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.610
take a look at it, click on some links and so on.

47
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.820
I can actually click on one of these products here

48
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.150
and it'll take me to the details page for this product

49
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.050
so this will be our master detail view for a given product

50
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.173
so our product-detail.html on the top URL bar.

51
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.350
And I can also add something to the cart.

52
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.350
And again, just a demo, no real updates on anything,

53
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.433
but just showing you the pages here and the layout.

54
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.360
And then down in the bottom right, I can click checkout.

55
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.360
This will take me to the checkout page for a given customer.

56
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.120
And then finally we could do the purchase and so on.

57
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.290
All right, so again just the basics with HTML.

58
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.280
We'll actually integrate this into our Angular application.

59
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.880
We'll hook this into our Spring Boot backend.

60
00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.830
We'll get real information from the database

61
00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.740
and we'll start adding real functionality

62
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:45.823
to this application.
