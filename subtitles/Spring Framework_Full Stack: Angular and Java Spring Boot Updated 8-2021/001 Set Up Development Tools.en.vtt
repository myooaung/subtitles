00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:02.600
<v ->In this video we'll cover the steps</v>

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.723
for setting up our dev environment.

3
00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.580
In terms of angular development tools

4
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.560
to write angular code you can use any text editor or IDE.

5
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.860
Most angular developers use the TypeScript language

6
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:18.860
for their coding.

7
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.770
It's just a superset of JavaScript.

8
00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.100
It's a strongly-typed language with compile time checking

9
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.860
and IDE support.

10
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.970
I'll talk more about typescript in upcoming videos.

11
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.859
We'll also make use of some command-line tools

12
00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:35.043
to compile code and create Angular apps.

13
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.260
Okay so visual studio code.

14
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.051
It's a free IDE

15
00:00:42.051 --> 00:00:44.181
that supports multiple programming languages.

16
00:00:44.181 --> 00:00:46.450
It has built in support for TypeScript

17
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.990
and also the IDE has really cool features

18
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.080
such as IntelliSense, Debugging, et cetera.

19
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.370
You can get more details on Video Studio Code

20
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.650
at code.visualstudio.com.

21
00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.673
It's a free tool from Microsoft.

22
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.085
Alrighty, so in terms of command line tools

23
00:01:06.085 --> 00:01:08.700
you can make use of the node tool

24
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.823
for running JavaScript code from the command line.

25
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.830
You can also use the npm tool, the Node Package Manager

26
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.790
for downloading new node packages and features.

27
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.086
It's loosely similar to Maven

28
00:01:22.086 --> 00:01:24.980
and there's also the tsc tool

29
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.860
which is the TypeScript Compiler.

30
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.413
This is used for compiling TypeScript code.

31
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.860
Now as far as installing these tools

32
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.520
like Visual Studio Code, node, npm, tsc,

33
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.550
I have some step by step instructions

34
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.330
for each operating system.

35
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.943
So I have instructions for Windows, Mac, and also Linux.

36
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.370
So you can view the instructions at the following link,

37
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.530
www.love2code.com/angular-install-guides.

38
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.070
So these are text guides that'll simply walk you through

39
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.340
step by step on how to get everything set up

40
00:01:59.876 --> 00:02:01.724
and installed on your computer.

41
00:02:01.724 --> 00:02:02.990
All right, so go ahead and do this now.

42
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.610
So visit the link and actually go through and install

43
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.970
everything on your computer.

44
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.840
In the following videos I'll assume

45
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.320
that you've already done the work

46
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.040
and you already have the tools themselves.

47
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.940
So go ahead and follow the guides

48
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.000
and get everything up and running on your computer.

49
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.833
Alrighty.
