00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,100
<v Instructor>In this video we'll add a new feature</v>

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,210
to our pagination, will allow the user

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:07,083
to select a page size.

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,030
Now in the previous video we did some testing

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,760
with different page sizes, and we'd modify our source code

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,930
to show different page sizes.

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,490
But as we went through the process,

8
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,560
I think you were probably wondering, hmm, we should allow

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,770
the user to choose the page size,

10
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,080
and allow them to simply select that page size

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,910
from a drop-down list.

12
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,283
And so we'll do the exact thing here in this video.

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,980
All right, so here's the development process.

14
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,420
So the first thing that we'll do is we'll add

15
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,720
a drop-down list for the page size to the HTML template,

16
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,740
and then we'll update our ProductListComponent

17
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,483
for setting the page size.

18
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,780
Alrighty, step one of adding the drop-down list

19
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,120
for page size to the HTML template.

20
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,220
So here in our component.html we'll simply make use

21
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,500
of a select tag and then we'll have the drop-down options

22
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,140
of five, 10, 20, and 50.

23
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,313
We'll initially display five as the selected one for true.

24
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,743
And then we'll add an event binding for the on change event.

25
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,290
So basically, when the user selects a page,

26
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:20,300
then we're going to call a method, updatePageSize.

27
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:24,000
And this method is defined in the component.ts file.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,870
So we'll pass in the value that is selected by the user,

29
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,660
and that's the value of five, 10 , 20, or 50,

30
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,713
depending on whatever they select.

31
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,810
Now in step two we're going to update the ProductListComponent

32
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,870
for setting the page size.

33
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:42,080
So remember in the previous slide we had a call to a method,

34
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,890
updatePageSize, so this method is actually defined

35
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,790
here in this component.

36
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:50,270
So this method will take in a parameter, the page size,

37
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,860
and then we'll simply set the page size based

38
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,600
on that parameter value.

39
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,920
Then we'll also reset the page number to one,

40
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,790
and then we simply call listProducts

41
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:02,823
to list the products again for this given page size.

42
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,030
Alrighty so that's it with our development process,

43
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,490
very simple, very straightforward.

44
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,880
Now let's go ahead and dive into our IDE

45
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,533
and let's write this code.

46
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:21,260
Okay, so step one of adding the drop-down list for page size

47
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,903
to the HTMl template.

48
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,880
So let's get a quick visual here as far as what we want to do.

49
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,940
So currently we have our app running.

50
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,180
We have pagination in the bottom right,

51
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,660
but we'd like to add a drop-down list for this application.

52
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,710
And we want to add the list right here.

53
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:43,010
And so the user can go through, select one of these items

54
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,110
for the page size

55
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,233
and then we'll update everything dynamically, on the fly.

56
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,370
Okay so let's go ahead and move into Visual Studio Code,

57
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,623
and let's open up product-list-grid.component.html.

58
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:00,730
Let me expand my window here, stretch out a bit

59
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,423
so I have some room to work with.

60
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,730
I'll add the drop down list right here

61
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,463
after this div section.

62
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,593
Alrighty, so I'll set up a div.

63
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:43,673
And give a span here for the text page size,

64
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,413
that's what you'll see on the screen.

65
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,000
And now I'll set up the drop-down list

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,063
using the HTML select tag.

67
00:04:17,183 --> 00:04:19,570
So I get the option with the value of five,

68
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,630
and I set selected to true, so that's the item

69
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,523
that'll be selected by default.

70
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,297
And then I give the other entries here for 10, 20, 50.

71
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:41,930
And that's pretty much it.

72
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,233
This looks good so far.
