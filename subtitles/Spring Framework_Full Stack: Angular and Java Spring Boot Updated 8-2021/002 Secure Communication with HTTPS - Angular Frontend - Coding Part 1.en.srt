1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:03,490
<v ->Okay, so let's get started with our development process.</v>

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,240
In this video, we'll cover steps one and two

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,350
of generating the key in the self-signed cert,

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,943
and running the Angular app with a key and self-signed cert.

5
00:00:22,012 --> 00:00:23,860
And so one thing I'd like for you to do now

6
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,076
is pause the video and follow the steps at

7
00:00:26,076 --> 00:00:29,450
luv2code.com/openssl-setup.

8
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,470
They go through all of those steps that you need for

9
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,160
generating a key and the self-signed cert.

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,710
The steps are different depending on the operating system

11
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:37,543
that you're using.

12
00:00:37,543 --> 00:00:39,410
We have one set of steps for Microsoft Windows,

13
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,990
and we have another set of steps for Mac Linux.

14
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:43,960
So be sure you walk through those steps

15
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,250
and get everything working in that regards.

16
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,090
And the end product is that you'll have a new key that's

17
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,870
been generated and also a self-signed cert.

18
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,570
Once you finish the steps there,

19
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,143
then you can come back to this video and continue.

20
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,870
Okay, welcome back.

21
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,560
So now you should have two new files that were generated in

22
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,220
this directory called SSL-localhost.

23
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,740
So the openssl steps generated these two files.

24
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:19,260
Localhost.crt and localhost.key.

25
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,860
And these are all covered in those steps

26
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,813
at luv2code.com/openssl-setup.

27
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,520
So I'm in my terminal window here.

28
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,713
I'm in my Angular e-commerce directory.

29
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,870
And what I want to do now is just kind of

30
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,670
view the certificate just so I can see what's out there.

31
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,490
I can enter this command here,

32
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:51,050
openssl, x509, no out, text, in,

33
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,173
and give a reference to the actual cert.

34
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,113
Ssl-localhost/localhost.crt.

35
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,123
And then I can see information about my certificate here.

36
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,870
So a couple of things I'll point out.

37
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:09,800
The issuer,

38
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,580
so I have the country, state, locality,

39
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,390
and it's valid starting at this date and it's valid for

40
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,183
365 days to 2022.

41
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,360
All right, so we're in good shape.

42
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,960
So we know that our certs been created successfully.

43
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,640
So now in step two,

44
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,780
we need to run our Angular app with the key

45
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,303
and the self-signed cert.

46
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,630
And what I need to do here is open up this file

47
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,793
package.json.

48
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,360
And then I move into the script section,

49
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,870
from the start command.

50
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,253
So right now we have our regular "ng" serve.

51
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:02,290
And I'll give the additional commands here for making

52
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,157
use of ssl.

53
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,390
Alrighty, and I'll just kind of highlight

54
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,833
the new items here.

55
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,143
So we have the part where we enable the ssl mode.

56
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,340
We give a reference to our key file

57
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,850
and we also give a reference to our certificate.

58
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,863
Now I can go ahead and start my application.

59
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,140
So I'll make use of this NPM start.

60
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,040
And so remember this is a new command

61
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,420
for starting our Angular application.

62
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,470
And this refers back to the start command

63
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,170
that we just set up in the script.

64
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,250
So they'll go ahead and start,

65
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,320
behind the scenes that does the ng serve with all the ssl

66
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,513
flags accordingly.

67
00:04:36,394 --> 00:04:39,160
And at this point, your app has compiled successfully

68
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,620
and it's up and running.

69
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,910
And so in the next video,

70
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,010
we'll go ahead and start testing this out.
