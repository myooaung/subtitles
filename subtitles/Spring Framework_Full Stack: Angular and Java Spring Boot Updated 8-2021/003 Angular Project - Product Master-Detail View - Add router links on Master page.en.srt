00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:02,650
<v Instructor>Alrighty, so moving along with our</v>

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:05,760
development process, in this video we'll start work on

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,950
step three of adding the router links to

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,603
the product-list-grid HTML page.

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,010
Alrighty, let's swing into our IDE and let's open up

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,707
the file 'product-list-grid.component.HTML'.

7
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,030
Just expand my window here.

8
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,850
All right so moving to the section where we loop

9
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,640
over the collection of products,

10
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,970
I want to add a link on the actual product image

11
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:49,493
and also the actual product name.

12
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:59,880
So let's just move in here and let's add a link

13
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,423
on the product image.

14
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,543
So I'll set up my router link.

15
00:01:07,402 --> 00:01:11,570
/products/tempproduct.id

16
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,560
All right so that takes care of that first item

17
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,283
of adding a link on the product image.

18
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,403
And then I just repeat the same for the actual product name.

19
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,330
I'll let you just copy the line with the router link

20
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,170
and then paste it down here.

21
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,183
And then just fix up my ending anchor tag.

22
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,630
Okay great so this covers the work of adding a link

23
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,170
on the product name.

24
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,470
So this looks pretty good.

25
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:08,120
Alright let's just take a quick look at our product details

26
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,840
component.HTML

27
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,850
So right now it says "product detail works"

28
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:16,170
but I want to add some divs and styling around it.

29
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,210
Just so it'll show up properly in my application.

30
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:22,140
So give me one second here, I'll set up two divs

31
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,303
for this example.

32
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,473
So I'll set up a div for the detail section.

33
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:46,053
And I'll also set up a div for container fluid.

34
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,480
I'll simply more the paragraph inside of the divs

35
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,470
and I'll just do a quick and dirty example

36
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,390
here of setting up some of the CSS styles.

37
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,190
And I'll do it in line but don't worry

38
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,670
this is dirty for right now,

39
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,810
I'm just doing this for a real quick test,

40
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,170
we'll clean it up in some of the later videos.

41
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:09,603
But for right now, this is mainly for doing a quick test.

42
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,163
So I just have the margin top of 100px.

43
00:03:19,846 --> 00:03:22,600
All right so let's save this and run this application

44
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,713
just to test it out.

45
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:36,030
Alrighty so lets go ahead and swing to our web browser

46
00:03:37,822 --> 00:03:40,540
and let's access our application running on port 4200.

47
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,460
And then when we click on the link

48
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:48,810
for one of these products here, yes!

49
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,776
This is good progress.

50
00:03:50,776 --> 00:03:53,860
So we have the links going to our product details component.

51
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,057
Now, there's not much data here (chuckles).

52
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,960
We'll actually add some of the product details

53
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,890
in some of the upcoming videos.

54
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,200
but at least we have our links working

55
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,110
between our master page and our actual details page.

56
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,830
But don't worry, we'll flesh this out

57
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,630
in some of the upcoming videos.

58
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,173
All right, good job.
