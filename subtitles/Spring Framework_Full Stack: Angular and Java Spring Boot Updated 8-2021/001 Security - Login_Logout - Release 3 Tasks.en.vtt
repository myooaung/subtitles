<v Instructor>In this video,</v>

2
00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.173
we'll cover the Release 3 task.

3
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.600
So just looking back at our release plan,

4
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.860
so we had our Release 1.0 of showing a list of products

5
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.600
and that part's already done.

6
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.940
And then we had released two of adding products

7
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.450
to the shopping cart, doing the shopping cart checkout,

8
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.830
and we've accomplished that also.

9
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.940
And now currently we are at Release 3.0

10
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.480
and so the three items here is user login/logout security,

11
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.030
provide access to a special VIP page

12
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.240
only for authenticated customers.

13
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.030
Also keep track of order history

14
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.470
for authenticated customers.

15
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.320
And this is the main functionality that we'll add

16
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.513
for Release 3.0, this'll be our main focus.
