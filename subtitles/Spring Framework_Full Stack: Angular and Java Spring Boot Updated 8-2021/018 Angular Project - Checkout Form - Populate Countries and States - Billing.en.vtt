00:00:01.867 --> 00:00:03.895
<v Instructor>All right, so now we have our arrays</v>

2
00:00:03.895 --> 00:00:05.390
in place center and that's good

3
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.390
and then we can actually use those

4
00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.890
in our assignments down at the bottom.

5
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.510
So let's go ahead and swing back down to the bottom.

6
00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.620
So now (laughs) I can assign

7
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.893
this.shippingAddressStates = data.

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Else, we say this.billingAddressStates = data.

9
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.970
Okay, got it.

10
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:27.803
Okay, great.

11
00:00:27.803 --> 00:00:29.280
So I didn't have those arrays up front

12
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.740
and now we have created

13
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.393
and now we can assign them, so good job.

14
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.490
And now one other thing I want to do

15
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.690
is I want to select the first state as the default

16
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.663
when everything is displayed here.

17
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.593
So I'll simply just grab the formGroup

18
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.427
I get the actual stateControl.

19
00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.500
And then I simply set the value to be the first item

20
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.373
in this array that was returned.

21
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.470
So once you select the country,

22
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.580
then the first state will be selected by default,

23
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.210
the user can always go and change it,

24
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.043
select the default one,

25
00:01:12.043 --> 00:01:14.290
but at least that'll be set up by default.

26
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.320
All right, so that's the work therefore the component.ts.

27
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.160
Let's go ahead and move into our HTML template,

28
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.280
and let's add the appropriate code here

29
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.633
for shipping address and for billing address.

30
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.460
So again, we're in the shipping address section here

31
00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.853
we have that assignment.

32
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.270
And now for states we have this the actual formControl

33
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.280
for states has a TO DO.

34
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.660
Now we can actually add our work here

35
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.720
and loop over the appropriate states array

36
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.950
to display the information.

37
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.320
So same coding as before on some of our other features here.

38
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.723
So ngFor let state of shippingAddressStates

39
00:02:13.762 --> 00:02:17.643
ngValue equals state so we can access it later on.

40
00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.053
And then we simply guess state.name.

41
00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.060
Slide a little bit so you can see everything and zoom out.

42
00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.460
All right, so let's go ahead and test this out

43
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.633
and see how it works.

44
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.093
So I'll just fire up my Angular app one more time.

45
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.993
Swing in some app, add something to the cart,

46
00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.713
go down to my cart do a check out.

47
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.193
And now with shipping address, let's select a country,

48
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.020
so I'll choose Brazil and success.

49
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.450
So the states are changing based on the selected country.

50
00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.260
Let's choose India.

51
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.080
And great notice states also change there, cool.

52
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.700
And let's choose Turkey.

53
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.080
All right, I like it.

54
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.883
So that part is working out just fine for us, I'm happy.

55
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.720
Now let's go ahead and do a similar thing here

56
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.723
for billing address.

57
00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.780
So let me just kind of copy this little section

58
00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.010
that we just added previously,

59
00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.100
and I'll just move down to the billing address section

60
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.443
and paste it in.

61
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.713
All right, so we're in the billing address section.

62
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.053
And let's move down to our state here,

63
00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.210
paste that in.

64
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:21.120
Now it's really important here we need to make an update.

65
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.741
So instead of shippingAddressStates,

66
00:04:22.741 --> 00:04:25.870
we need to use billingAddressStates, okay?

67
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.070
Be sure make this change

68
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.910
very important billingAddressStates,

69
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.970
because we want to keep the billingAddressStates independent

70
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.050
or separate from the shippingAddressStates.

71
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.560
And then also another thing is very important here.

72
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.410
So in our billing address section,

73
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.820
make sure we set up that change event for countries

74
00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.750
so when they choose a country and billing address,

75
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.040
then we'll call getStates and then we'll pass in

76
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.063
that formGroup name, Billing Address.

77
00:05:03.683 --> 00:05:04.850
And that's it.

78
00:05:16.312 --> 00:05:17.980
All right, so I'll just save this

79
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.903
and then swing back over to my browser here.

80
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.360
So we have shipping address that's already up

81
00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.620
everything kind of reloaded, Billing Address.

82
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.800
Let's choose a different country, Germany.

83
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.850
Great, so those are German states, Excellent.

84
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.300
And then Turkey.

85
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.710
Okay excellent, great.

86
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.400
So this is kind of working out as desired.

87
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.840
So it works for shipping address

88
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.000
and it also works for billing address.

89
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.833
Good job!
