00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.870
<v ->In this video, we'll cover the checkout form validation</v>

2
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.423
for shipping, billing and credit card.

3
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.080
Alrighty, so basically what we want to do here

4
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.810
is finish up the remaining sections for shipping,

5
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.860
billing address and credit card

6
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.510
and we'll add the validation here for these sections.

7
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.560
And our development process is just more of the same,

8
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.200
all right, so basically we'll just go through

9
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.170
and we'll add the validation rules,

10
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.920
define the getter methods and update the HTML template.

11
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.390
Alrighty, so let's go ahead and swing into our IDE,

12
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.400
so in this section here we kind of focus on

13
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.663
adding the validation for shipping address.

14
00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.660
So for step one will specify the validation rules

15
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.103
for the form controls.

16
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.873
Summon checkout component at CES right now.

17
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.960
I moved down here to the section for shipping address.

18
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.753
This is where we'll do all of our work.

19
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.220
And I'll just go ahead and copy paste

20
00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.403
some of the coding from up above.

21
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.685
So I just copied this form control code

22
00:01:45.685 --> 00:01:47.853
and I'll put it down here for a street.

23
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.650
And then I'll also clean everything up

24
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.563
to kind of put it all on a two lines here.

25
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.920
All right, so that'll work out for street.

26
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.390
So required middle of two and not only white space.

27
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.503
I'll do a similar here for city.

28
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.593
So just like quick copy and paste here.

29
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.390
And then similar thing for zip code

30
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.403
down at the bottom.

31
00:02:54.806 --> 00:02:56.320
I'll just remove that extra comma

32
00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.350
at the end there.

33
00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.453
Okay, that looks good.

34
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.660
And then for stating country those are drop down list.

35
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.000
So there's no input at the usual actually type.

36
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.803
So here I'll simply just make those fields required.

37
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.670
So just clean this up a bit and only

38
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.323
use required here.

39
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.110
Because there's no white space

40
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.740
or anything that the user can enter.

41
00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.220
Just selecting an item.

42
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.770
Stereo valid ID is required.

43
00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:32.920
All right, that's good.

44
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.683
And I'll apply the same here for country.

45
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.900
All right, so that looks pretty good here

46
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.393
for the validation rules for shipping address.

47
00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.740
Now in Step 2 we'll define the Getter methods

48
00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.793
to access the form controls.

49
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.110
So I'll just move down here where

50
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.810
I have the getter methods to find.

51
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.840
I'll just copy the one here for email and I'll paste it.

52
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:22.810
And I'll simply rename the method

53
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.523
as shipping address Street.

54
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.120
And then returns shipping address doc street.

55
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.710
So that's the actual name of the form control

56
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.560
or the reference of the form control.

57
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.410
And remember we'll use these methods

58
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.373
on our actual HTML template to access the form control.

59
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.210
So now let me go ahead and copy this line

60
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.970
X number of times and I'll go through

61
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.163
and just update the fields here.

62
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.303
So shipping address City.

63
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.333
Shipping address dot City.

64
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.900
And I just repeat the process here

65
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.113
for a state country and zip code.

66
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.160
All right. So this looks pretty good.

67
00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.170
So make sure you get everything just right

68
00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.260
as I have here on the screen

69
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.420
because we need it to be set up just right

70
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.073
in order for Angular to access it accordingly.

71
00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.740
Alrighty, so we have all of the methods updated

72
00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.570
along with the appropriate field.

73
00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:02.653
So this looks pretty good.

74
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.560
Stand back here and just take a look at my work.

75
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.053
Make sure everything's okay.

76
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.403
And oops. I see a typo.

77
00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.100
Get shipping address State ooh an extra T.

78
00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.200
Let's get rid of that.

79
00:06:21.161 --> 00:06:23.880
All right hoof that's better, okay.

80
00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.060
Shipping address State.

81
00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.840
Alright, so kind of pause the video here.

82
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.610
Make sure your code follows exactly

83
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.060
what I have here on the screen.

84
00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.440
Make sure it's all correct.

85
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.990
And from there. We're in pretty good shape.

86
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.263
So good job.
