00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.470
<v Narrator>Now here's a frequently asked question</v>

2
00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:04.303
that I get.

3
00:00:04.303 --> 00:00:06.500
The question is, can I view the data

4
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.570
in the browser's storage?

5
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.130
And the answer's yes.

6
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.510
The steps are different depending on the browser,

7
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.750
but I'll go through and show you an example here

8
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:15.603
using Chrome.

9
00:00:22.801 --> 00:00:23.634
So just looking at our code,

10
00:00:23.634 --> 00:00:25.340
we can see that currently we're using local storage

11
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.543
in our application.

12
00:00:29.715 --> 00:00:32.240
Now we can go into our browser and view the local storage.

13
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.860
So in Chrome, you can go under more tools

14
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.643
and then choose developer tools,

15
00:00:43.056 --> 00:00:45.283
and then select the application tab,

16
00:00:49.514 --> 00:00:50.590
and then I notice on the left-hand side,

17
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.480
you have a section for storage,

18
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.943
okay, looks pretty good.

19
00:00:54.843 --> 00:00:56.410
So we have local storage and session storage.

20
00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.870
So at the moment, our code is using local storage.

21
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.450
So we'll go ahead and look under local host 4,200

22
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.630
that's our origin protocol host name port.

23
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.040
And that's the data here available for this given origin.

24
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.050
So we can see our card items,

25
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.983
and you can go through and look at all the data.

26
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.280
Now if we swing back into our application,

27
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.493
if we change our app to make use of session storage,

28
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.579
so we're using session storage here,

29
00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:32.533
let's go ahead and save that.

30
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.423
Then move back into our application.

31
00:01:43.117 --> 00:01:44.617
So I'll add some luggage tags.

32
00:01:53.576 --> 00:01:54.560
You can see that we have three items in our cart

33
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.923
for these luggage tags.

34
00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.893
And I can look at the cart details here,

35
00:01:59.893 --> 00:02:03.533
so luggage tag cherish and luggage tag adventure.

36
00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.990
So now I can go and expand session storage

37
00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.840
and so I have an entry here for this origin local host 4200

38
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.200
and then we'll see those two products that we have here

39
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.170
along with their associated quantity.

40
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.330
So quantity of one, quantity of two,

41
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.750
a total of three,

42
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:22.583
alrighty so,

43
00:02:22.583 --> 00:02:25.030
that's how we can view the session storage here

44
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.263
in our web browser.

45
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.800
Now what about some of the other browsers like Firefox?

46
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.370
Well, in Firefox, you simply go to your developer tools,

47
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.010
so you got a web developer and storage inspector,

48
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.730
and you'll see screens similar to what they have in Chrome.

49
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.280
And then for Microsoft Edge,

50
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.740
you'd go through and select EdgeDevTools

51
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:45.890
and then choose storage,

52
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.893
and you'll see similar screens there.

53
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.709
Alrighty.

54
00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:52.542
So that covers it.

55
00:02:52.542 --> 00:02:54.133
That shows you how you can view the data

56
00:02:54.133 --> 00:02:54.966
in the browser storage.

57
00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:55.799
Good job.
