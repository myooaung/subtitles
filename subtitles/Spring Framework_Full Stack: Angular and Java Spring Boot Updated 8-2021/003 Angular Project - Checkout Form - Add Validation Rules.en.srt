1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:03,620
<v Instructor>Alrighty, so let's go ahead and get started.</v>

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,290
Let's look at our development process.

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:07,530
So in this video, we're going to start with step one

4
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:11,043
of specifying the validation rules for the form controls.

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,210
Alrighty. So let's go ahead and swing into our IDE

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,470
and let me zoom in here.

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,630
So I'll move into my source directory

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,723
and I'll open up the code for our checkout component.

9
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:32,083
So I'll open up the code for a checkoutcomponent.ts.

10
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,403
I'll expand my window here.

11
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,170
And what we'll do is we'll move down to our ngOnInit map,

12
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,123
and then this is where we'll do our work.

13
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:51,190
So primarily here on lines 35 and 37 for first name,

14
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:54,860
last name, email, we'll add those validation rules.

15
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,060
So I'll start with first name for right now.

16
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,140
And remember we create a new form control.

17
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,670
We give the initial value

18
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,273
and then we also specify our validators.

19
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,620
So the initial value is just an empty string

20
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,400
and then we give an array of validators.

21
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,530
So for this example, we'll have validators.required,

22
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,603
and also validators.minlength.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,677
And we'll have minlength of two.

24
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,250
Alrighty. So that looks pretty good.

25
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,700
And for last name, we want to do a similar thing.

26
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,190
So let's just go ahead and copy this code for first name,

27
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:44,403
and we'll do a similar thing for last name.

28
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,883
So just a little copy paste here.

29
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:56,993
All right, so that's good.

30
00:01:56,993 --> 00:01:58,890
So both first name and last name.

31
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,550
Though both of those fields are required

32
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,073
with minimum length of two.

33
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,960
With email, we'll do something similar,

34
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,020
but we'll make some slight changes here.

35
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,110
So again, we create the new form control

36
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:18,700
and then for email, it's a required field,

37
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:23,210
but we'll also make use of regular expression patterns.

38
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,650
So I'll kind of drop this down to a separate line because

39
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,670
I've a lot of coding here to type

40
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,523
for the pattern item in particular.

41
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,913
So I'll do validators.pattern,

42
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:39,073
and I give the actual pattern as a string.

43
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,350
Let me just kind of clean up some of the extra space there.

44
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,260
And I'll put the actual pattern in quotes.

45
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,180
And so now I actually need to put in the real pattern.

46
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,540
So I have it here on the screen.

47
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,380
There's, it's a big long string here

48
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,800
and this pattern for matching on email.

49
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,820
So I'll talk more about this pattern in a second,

50
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,640
but for now, just go ahead and type in what I have here

51
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,710
on the screen.

52
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:10,610
And I'll give a high level discussion of this in a second.

53
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,130
And if you need to feel free to pause the video now,

54
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,640
to type this text and make sure you get it exactly right,

55
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,403
like I have here on the screen.

56
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,130
Alrighty, so you're probably looking at this

57
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,527
and you're wondering, "Oh my gosh, what is this?"

58
00:03:36,527 --> 00:03:38,828
"It looks like a totally different language."

59
00:03:38,828 --> 00:03:40,270
And it is.

60
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:43,940
Regular expressions is a separate topic all to itself,

61
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,250
kind of beyond the scope of this course,

62
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,250
but I'll give you a quick overview

63
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,300
as far as how this pattern is used in our example.

64
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,150
So we're using this pattern

65
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,990
to match on valid email address formats.

66
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:01,323
So for example, anil.public@gmail.com.

67
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,610
So looking at the pattern here,

68
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,220
and I'll kind of break it down at a very high level.

69
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:10,837
The first section here says, "Hey, match on any combination

70
00:04:10,837 --> 00:04:14,010
"of letters and digits with an optional period."

71
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,270
So we can have like a anil.public.

72
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,260
Then we have the at symbol, okay.

73
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,860
Kind of separating that email address portion.

74
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,580
And then the next section here says matching any combination

75
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,547
of letters and digits with a period.

76
00:04:27,547 --> 00:04:30,983
So gmail. or yahoo. or whatever.

77
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,940
And then for the domain extension basically says,

78
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,740
we can have two to four letters, A to Z,

79
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,690
and that'll be the actual extension.

80
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,110
And that'll kind of give us the basics here,

81
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,970
of matching on like anil.public@gmail.com.

82
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,150
Now regarding the domain extension,

83
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,490
I know there are other high level domain extensions

84
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,720
that are longer than four characters.

85
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,130
So feel free to adjust this regular expression as needed,

86
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:57,560
if you need a much longer extension there for your example.

87
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,710
But this will cover the basics

88
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:02,430
for the actual domain extensions,

89
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,490
and also cover the basics here for email addresses.

90
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,500
So this is a very common regular expression pattern

91
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,050
that you'll find for matching on email addresses.

92
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,630
And even if you do a Google search,

93
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:17,100
you'll find this very pattern exactly like this,

94
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,003
or a very similar pattern.

95
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,397
Now you're probably wondering, "Gosh, I'd like to

96
00:05:22,397 --> 00:05:24,247
"get more details on all this

97
00:05:24,247 --> 00:05:25,380
"regular expression stuff."

98
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,760
So there's a free tutorial available

99
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,140
online at regexstutorials.com.

100
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,540
They kind of walk you through the steps.

101
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,160
They talk about all the special characters here,

102
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,500
like the caret, the square brackets,

103
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,288
the backslash, and so on.

104
00:05:37,288 --> 00:05:40,280
And nice interactive examples to kind of help get you up

105
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,160
to speed with regex.

106
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,036
And also there's some really good tutorials

107
00:05:44,036 --> 00:05:46,956
online at YouTube, if you need to go

108
00:05:46,956 --> 00:05:49,220
and get more details on this.

109
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,290
But for now, we'll kind of take this as is,

110
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,264
and then we'll use this given regex pattern for

111
00:05:53,264 --> 00:05:56,203
matching on email address formats.
