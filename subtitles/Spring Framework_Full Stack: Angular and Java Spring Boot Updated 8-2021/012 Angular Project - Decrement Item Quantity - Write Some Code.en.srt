1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:02,360
<v Instructor>Okay, so taking a look</v>

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,550
at our development process,

3
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:05,650
in this video we're going to cover the first three steps.

4
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,370
We're going to add the click handler for the decrement button,

5
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,170
update the CartDetailsComponent

6
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,473
and also modify the CartService.

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,780
Okay, so let's go ahead and move in

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,713
and open up our cart-details.component.html.

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,423
And let's move down here to our decrement button.

10
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:39,403
And that's the one here that has fa-minus.

11
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,390
Okay great, so this is our decrement button here.

12
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:49,093
And I will add a onclick handler.

13
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,023
And I'll call the method decrementQuantity,

14
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,517
and I pass in the tempCartItem.

15
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,590
Just slide over a bit so we can see it all on the screen.

16
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:09,530
All right, this looks good.

17
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,535
Of course, the IDE is given us that message again.

18
00:01:12,535 --> 00:01:13,460
(laughs)

19
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,800
No problem, we'll go ahead

20
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,232
and update the CartDetailsComponent

21
00:01:16,232 --> 00:01:19,086
with that click handler method.

22
00:01:19,086 --> 00:01:22,566
So I'll just copy that method name, decrementQuantity,

23
00:01:22,566 --> 00:01:25,899
move into the cart-details.component.ts,

24
00:01:30,032 --> 00:01:34,449
and I'll just scroll down to the bottom of this file,

25
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,380
and I'll just paste in that method name.

26
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:41,557
They'll pass in the param, theCartItem,

27
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,900
and then I simply call a method on the cartService,

28
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,343
so this.cartService.decrementQuantity.

29
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,950
All righty, so this coding looks good.

30
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,320
Now, in step three we need to modify the CartService

31
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,970
with a supporting method,

32
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:07,343
so we'll let the IDE generate this method for us.

33
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,610
All righty, so they created the method for us.

34
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,820
Let's go ahead and move into CartService

35
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,660
and take a look at things.

36
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,360
So we'll see right near the top of the class,

37
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,290
they have this generated method, decrementQuantity.

38
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,960
Now, let's go ahead and cut this method.

39
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,560
I like to move them down to the bottom near my other code.

40
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,620
So I'll just move all the way down here

41
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,543
and paste it right here.

42
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,053
All righty, good.

43
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,500
All right, so in moving here for this method,

44
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,510
the first thing I want to do is decrement

45
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,053
the quantity by using --.

46
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,460
Next, I'll check theCarItem quantity,

47
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,890
and see if it's equal to zero.

48
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,753
If so, then we'll remove it.

49
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,723
Else, we simply call computeCartTotals.

50
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:16,263
We'll have the IDE generate the remove method for us.

51
00:03:21,683 --> 00:03:23,290
And I'll just scroll up so I can kind of focus

52
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,400
on the remove method.

53
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,490
I'll write some quick comments here to myself

54
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,013
to kind of keep myself on track.

55
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:51,580
All right, so let's go ahead and start writing the code.

56
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,537
So I'll set up const itemIndex = this.cartItems.findIndex();

57
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:04,223
I give it the expression for matching or finding,

58
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:12,300
and so here I'm comparing tempCarItem.id with theCartItem.id

59
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,950
and we created code like this earlier

60
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,183
in some of the other videos for finding items in an array.

61
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,423
All righty, so that's the coding, looks pretty good.

62
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:28,650
And remember, if it's not found, the value's -1.

63
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,450
If it did find it, it'll give you the index,

64
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,410
and that'll be greater than -1.

65
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:36,053
So here I say, if itemIndex is greater than -1,

66
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,003
then we'll give this.cartItem.splice,

67
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,220
starting at that itemIndex comma 1,

68
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,990
so we're simply removing one element,

69
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,103
and this matches our given use case.

70
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:57,243
And then we also call computeCartTotals.

71
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,150
And that's pretty much it for the remove method.

72
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,850
This looks pretty good, I like it.

73
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,781
And this remove method is used

74
00:05:10,781 --> 00:05:12,470
by our decrementQuantity method,

75
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,223
so we have some good functionality in place right now.
