1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:02,310
<v Instructor>Okay, so moving ahead</v>

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,530
with our development process.

3
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:05,530
In this video we'll cover steps two and three

4
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:06,900
of defining the Getter methods

5
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,063
and also updating the HTML template.

6
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,220
All right, so let's go ahead and scroll down a bit

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,443
in our application.

8
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:31,270
And let's add a new method here, a Getter method.

9
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:33,433
Get first name,

10
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,610
and it's going to return the actual first name control.

11
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,240
So use that checkoutformgroup.get

12
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,013
and then we get customer.firstname.

13
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,800
And so this will actually be used by our HTML template

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,920
to get access to the form control

15
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,760
and to check the status of the form control,

16
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,333
and so on to see if it's valid, so on and so forth.

17
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,530
And now what'll I do is I'll just kind of clean up

18
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:05,610
some of the white space here.

19
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,460
And I'll actually put this Getter method all on one line,

20
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,440
cause we're going to have a lot of these Getter methods

21
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,273
in this example.

22
00:01:11,273 --> 00:01:13,180
So I'll just put it all on one line

23
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,632
and then I'll just do a little copy-paste

24
00:01:15,632 --> 00:01:17,171
on this get firstname,

25
00:01:17,171 --> 00:01:18,730
and I'll paste it x number of times

26
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:20,860
to add support for lastname,

27
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,163
and also do a similar thing here for email.

28
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,933
So get email, customer.email.

29
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,810
All right so just as a check point here

30
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37,130
make sure that your code looks like this

31
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,300
and you have the appropriate updates accordingly.

32
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,533
Make sure you don't have any copy-paste errors.

33
00:01:43,574 --> 00:01:45,173
Firstname, lastname, email.

34
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,260
All right so step three, we're going to update

35
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,393
the HTML template to display error messages.

36
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:00,433
So I'll move over here to my file system.

37
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,900
And I'll open up checkout component.html

38
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,513
So that's our HTML template.

39
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,320
And so I'll move into the section here

40
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,240
for customer first name.

41
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,130
So right after that form control for first name,

42
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,720
then we'll go ahead and add coding here

43
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,933
to display validation error messages.

44
00:02:26,934 --> 00:02:29,400
So I'll make use of this ngIf and I'll say,

45
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,463
if firstname.invalid.

46
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,680
And then also remember we need to add

47
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,810
the additional code here to check to see

48
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:45,563
if this field is dirty or if this field has been touched.

49
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,240
And then I'll apply the appropriate styles here.

50
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,220
All righty so I just kind of pause here for second.

51
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,860
So that's the coding here, just to check to see

52
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,787
if we have any validation errors:

53
00:03:13,787 --> 00:03:16,053
.invalid, .dirty, .touched.

54
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,010
Now what we can do is, we can move in here

55
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,990
and we can display the specific error message

56
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:32,460
for a given validation.

57
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,710
And remember we'll make use of that errors object

58
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,620
to check for those specific error messages,

59
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,763
or error validations.

60
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,173
So I check firstname.errors.

61
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:48,483
Okay, that special object that has a list of errors.

62
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,933
And then .required.

63
00:03:54,862 --> 00:03:56,590
So basically we're saying, hey if the validation

64
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,700
for required failed, then we'll display this message:

65
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,163
first name is required.

66
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,910
And then we'll do a similar thing here for min length.

67
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,760
So I'll just kind of copy this portion and paste it.

68
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,930
And just update the error.

69
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,983
So errors.minlength.

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,930
And then I'll give the specific error message here

71
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:24,810
for min length.

72
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,613
So it must be at least two characters.

73
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,090
All righty so let's kind of just stand back here

74
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,280
and admire our code.

75
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,266
This all looks pretty good.

76
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:39,440
So that's the coding in our template

77
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,283
for displaying the error messages if they occur.

78
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:43,483
Good job.
