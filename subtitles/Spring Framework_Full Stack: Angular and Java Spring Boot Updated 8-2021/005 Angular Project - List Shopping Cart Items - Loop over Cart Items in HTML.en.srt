1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,750
<v Narrator>Okay, so we are almost done.</v>

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:04,010
We are on our final step here.

3
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:06,340
Step five of adding the HTML template

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,755
for the CartDetailsComponent. And actually,

5
00:00:09,755 --> 00:00:11,460
(laughing) we are just finishing up because,

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,990
we already created some of the HTML table

7
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,070
for this component. We are simply going to add in

8
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:19,070
the looping code to loop through all of the Cart items,

9
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,920
and we will cover that in this video.

10
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,270
Okay so let's go ahead and move back over to

11
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,523
our cart-details.component.html.

12
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,340
And basically we simply want to loop over

13
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,020
each one of the cart items and display

14
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,680
the product image, product detail, and

15
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,403
information about the quantity.

16
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,450
So I will set up a tr here and I use

17
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,490
my ngFor tempCartItem of cartItems.

18
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,453
And so we'll add code here to display the image.

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,143
Next, we will display the name and the unit price.

20
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,443
And then we'll also add code here to display the quantity.

21
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,340
And we'll come back and do subtotal

22
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,860
in the next video. Just for now,

23
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,660
we will simply display the quantity.

24
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,430
So that's the basic piece here for

25
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,123
looping over all the cartItems and displaying information.
