1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:02,700
<v Instructor>Okay, great, so let's go ahead and</v>

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,740
look at our development process.

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,180
We'll actually walk through each one of

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,343
these steps here in this video.

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,219
All righty, so starting step 1 of getting the

6
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:16,623
links for the remote bootstrap files.

7
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,343
On our web browser we simply go to getbootstrap.com,

8
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,490
and this will bring us to the main bootstrap web page.

9
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:30,960
They have a link for getting started,

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,560
so let's go ahead and select that link.

11
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,180
And this will take us to a nice section

12
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,554
that has information about quick start,

13
00:00:36,554 --> 00:00:39,322
and also some sample template code that we can

14
00:00:39,322 --> 00:00:41,143
simply copy and paste.

15
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,590
I'll move down to this starter template

16
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,690
and I'll grab a couple of pieces of code here.

17
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,699
I'll grab the line here for the meta viewport

18
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:53,973
and also the line for the link.

19
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:59,263
And I'll copy those sections or snippets of code.

20
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,930
Okay, great, so here we go.

21
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,563
Step 2 of adding the links to the index.html page.

22
00:01:18,836 --> 00:01:21,220
Just give me 1 second, here I have the page open.

23
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,670
Well, let me expand the window here for a second.

24
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,790
All righty, so let's move in here.

25
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:29,760
So, right after the line 4,

26
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,045
let's go ahead and do a paste.

27
00:01:31,045 --> 00:01:33,530
All right, so that part looks good.

28
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,820
So there's one thing I want to clean up down on line 13,

29
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,450
there's another meta name=viewport,

30
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,090
I actually want to delete this line 'cause we

31
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:41,610
already have it up above.

32
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,573
So let's go ahead and delete the line here on line 13.

33
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,010
All right, that looks good,

34
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:51,233
and so here's the information that we have for adding

35
00:01:51,233 --> 00:01:53,830
references for the bootstrap styles.

36
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:54,980
So this is pretty good.

37
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:03,837
So let's go ahead and open up

38
00:02:03,837 --> 00:02:06,760
app component.html file.

39
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,180
And so, that's step 3 applying the bootstrap

40
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,103
CSS files in this template.

41
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,630
Basically, what I want to do here

42
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,863
is actually wrap all of this code inside of a div.

43
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,210
It's inside of a div.

44
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,090
And then for this given div I'm going to set

45
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,640
the class=container, so that's a bootstrap style,

46
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,770
for giving us a proper bootstrap container.

47
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:46,770
Then also for h1 I'll set the class=mt3 and also mb3,

48
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:49,713
margin top, margin bottom.

49
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,930
And those are all the changes that we need

50
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,533
here for app component.html file.

51
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,700
Okay, so let's go ahead and zoom in here.

52
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,890
Let's go to this list component.html file

53
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:13,003
and let's do a copy/paste on this file.

54
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,730
All right, so that's the copy so let's go

55
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:22,003
ahead and rename this copy and give it a new name.

56
00:03:26,222 --> 00:03:31,063
This copy I'll call it list-bootstrap.component

57
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:37,723
and I'll remove the copy stuff from the file name.

58
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,363
All right, so list-bootstrap.component.html.

59
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,120
Just make sure that you're in the proper file,

60
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,670
sales person list bootstrap.component.html.

61
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,423
Let me expand the window here.

62
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,820
Now, this is step 4 of applying the bootstrap CSS

63
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,343
styles in the HTML table.

64
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,670
Up top, I'll get rid of the border=1,

65
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,713
and then I'll set class=table and then table-hover.

66
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,630
And then for thead I'll say class=thead-dark,

67
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,950
and so this will give us this desired view

68
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,533
of our HTML table.

69
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,348
This is pretty good it's a nice pretty table

70
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:44,530
compared to the ugly one that we had earlier.

71
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:45,563
Thanks to bootstrap.

72
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,330
One more thing we have to do in step 5 is

73
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,500
update our typescript component to reference

74
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,393
the bootstrap HTML template.

75
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,660
We have to open up our component.ts file,

76
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,933
our typescript file.

77
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:18,620
Up top in this file we need to update the template URL.

78
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,470
Instead of using the original template URL

79
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:25,220
we're going to use the list-bootstrap component.html.

80
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,040
That's the new file we created, we renamed

81
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,623
and that's the one we have our bootstrap CSS styles

82
00:05:30,623 --> 00:05:31,623
applied in.

83
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,260
Now, when our component is processed and rendered,

84
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,653
it's going to use this new template URL.

85
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,700
All right, so this covers all of our major steps

86
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,820
here for our development process.

87
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,840
Now let's go ahead and open up a new terminal window

88
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,133
and let's test it out.

89
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,460
I just move into my project directory

90
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,783
and I'll start my server.

91
00:06:07,054 --> 00:06:09,040
And it will automatically open up the browser page

92
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,730
and success, yay!

93
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:14,760
The bootstrap style are applied as desired.

94
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:19,410
We went from a very ugly HTML page to a very pretty,

95
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,100
beautiful HTML page.

96
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,210
And this is all thanks to bootstrap.

97
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,040
This looks really good.

98
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,933
I'd like to say good job.
