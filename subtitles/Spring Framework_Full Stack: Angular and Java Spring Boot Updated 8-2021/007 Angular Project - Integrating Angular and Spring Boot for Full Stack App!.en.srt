1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:02,590
<v Instructor>Okay, so we're almost done.</v>

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:04,680
So the final step of our development process

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,610
is adding CrossOrigin support

4
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:08,673
to our Spring Boot application.

5
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:15,610
So we'll add CrossOrigin support

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,173
to get rid of that ugly error message.

7
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,020
So what I'll do is I'll move into my IDE.

8
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:37,090
So we'll move into our product repository.

9
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:41,240
We'll add support for the @CrossOrigin annotation

10
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,370
and then we'll specify the origin.

11
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,750
So here we give the actual origin or server

12
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,200
that our Angular application is running on,

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,090
or our JavaScript application.

14
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,593
So I'll give http localhost 4200.

15
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,090
And so we can accept calls from web browser scripts

16
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,423
for this origin.

17
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,610
So remember that origin is more than just the hostname.

18
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:10,650
The origin is the protocol, hostname, and port.

19
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,570
And all of these have to match for it to be the same origin

20
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,720
so note here an example of the same origin.

21
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,610
We have the exact same protocol, hostname, and port.

22
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,420
And notice in the second example here

23
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,990
we have a different origin,

24
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:25,740
and the reason it's a different origin here

25
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,760
is because the port numbers are different.

26
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,003
All right, so again, origin is more than just the hostname.

27
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,030
All righty, so we have this in place here

28
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,610
for our product repository.

29
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:43,340
We'll do a similar thing for our product category repository

30
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,733
so let me open that one up.

31
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:50,233
And I'll also add the annotation here for @CrossOrigin.

32
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:59,430
All righty, great, so that's in place.

33
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,360
All right, so let's go ahead and run our application

34
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,460
and let's test it out.

35
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,640
All right, so my Spring Boot app is up and running

36
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,963
with the new setup.

37
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,790
And now I can swing back over to my web browser

38
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,160
and I simply do a reload here on the browser

39
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,820
and, yes, success.

40
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,370
So now we have a list of products being displayed

41
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,510
in our Angular application.

42
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,040
So now that we know that we're successful

43
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,950
of having our front end making a call to our back end.

44
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,900
So now we have Full Stack up and running.

45
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,760
I'm excited.

46
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,440
This is working exactly as desired.

47
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,603
So I'd like to say good job, my friend.
