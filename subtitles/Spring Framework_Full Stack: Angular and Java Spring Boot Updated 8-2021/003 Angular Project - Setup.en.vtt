00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.780
<v Instructor>Alrighty, so let's take a quick look</v>

2
00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.210
at our development process.

3
00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:05.043
So in this video,

4
00:00:05.043 --> 00:00:06.810
we're going to focus on steps one and two

5
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.130
of creating the Angular project

6
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.693
and creating the Angular component for the product-list.

7
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.290
All right, let's go ahead and move in here and get started.

8
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.870
So I'd like to kind of swing over to my file system

9
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.563
and move into this eCommerce project directory.

10
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.593
I like to create a new directory here for O3 front end.

11
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.820
And then what I'll do is I'll simply drag and drop

12
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.240
the O3 front end to my visual studio code application

13
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.160
and it'll automatically open that folder

14
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.110
and make it available in the IDE.

15
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.710
Nice little trick there for you.

16
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.230
Alrighty, so I'll go ahead and open up

17
00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.853
a new terminal window here.

18
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.093
Just expand my window here real quick.

19
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.453
And I should be in the O3 front end directory, looks good.

20
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.790
So now I'll go ahead and crate the Angular project.

21
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.373
I'll use ng new angular eCommerce.

22
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.500
They'll ask me if I want to add angular routing,

23
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.760
for now we can say no,

24
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.110
we can always add it later.

25
00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.933
And then I'll accept the default for CSS style sheets.

26
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.610
Alrighty, so it's creating our project.

27
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.260
I'll speed the video up to make this go a bit faster.

28
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.023
And remember, you can safely ignore the warning messages.

29
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.330
Okay great, so once everything is done

30
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.910
our project has successfully created

31
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.210
so we're good to go there.

32
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.300
And we can simply move into

33
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.583
that directory for angular eCommerce.

34
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.410
And if I swing back over and look at my project structure

35
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.380
over on the left hand side,

36
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.720
we'll see that we have this angular eCommerce directory

37
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.900
and all of those angular project files that were created.

38
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.600
All right so that part looks good.

39
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.890
So one thing I'd like to do is add Bootstrap support

40
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.370
to this project so let's go ahead

41
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.073
and move to that getboostrap.com website.

42
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.803
Click on the get started section.

43
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.760
And we'll simply scroll down

44
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.313
and copy paste some code from the starter template.

45
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.310
We'll just highlight this little snippet of code

46
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.330
like we did before.

47
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.513
We'll simply copy it.

48
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.033
And then we'll edit our index.html file.

49
00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.013
And then we'll drop this in right here after line four.

50
00:03:21.288 --> 00:03:24.197
And then we'll also delete the entry on line 13.

51
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:29.783
All right, so that's good.

52
00:03:29.783 --> 00:03:31.930
So we have the basic Bootstrap support

53
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.253
added to this project.

54
00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.710
All right so let's go ahead and edit our

55
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.713
app component.html file.

56
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.390
Let me expand the window here.

57
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.510
And so remember this file has all this template code.

58
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.880
Let's go ahead and delete everything in this file

59
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.000
'cause we don't need it.

60
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.903
And we'll add a very simple entry here for our application.

61
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.170
We'll create a very basic Bootstrap container

62
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.673
and we'll simply set up heading one for products.

63
00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.700
And now let me test it out real quick

64
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.070
so just hit my terminal window here,

65
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.643
go ahead and start the server.

66
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.290
Okay, it's up and running and there's products.

67
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.123
So that's good,

68
00:04:29.123 --> 00:04:30.100
so we have the basics in place

69
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.960
and we have the Bootstrap styling set up

70
00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.713
so we're good so far, we're just getting started.

71
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.900
All right, so now let's go ahead to step two

72
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.650
of creating the angular component for the product-list.

73
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.060
So down in my terminal window

74
00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.910
I'll just hit Control + C real quick.

75
00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.803
And I'll use the angular CLI to create a new component.

76
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.360
So I'll just use that ng generate component

77
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.193
and I'll say components/products-list.

78
00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.120
Okay great, so our component's created.

79
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.160
We can view those new files here on the left hand side.

80
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.733
So this in the components subdirectory.

81
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:22.380
And there's our product-list

82
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.253
and all of the associated angular files for this.

83
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.350
So let's go ahead and open up product-list component.ts.

84
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.150
Let's just copy the selector for this component

85
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.420
and then let's move back to our app component.html

86
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.393
and let's make use of this selector.

87
00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.513
So we just simply get app product list.

88
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:50.870
And now down in our terminal,

89
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.720
let's just run our app one more time.

90
00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.400
And then we should see product-list works.

91
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.290
Great, so we have our main application up and running

92
00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:07.140
and now we've also plugged in our new component

93
00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.270
that we just created.

94
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:09.620
So we're just putting things together

95
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:10.960
piece by piece right now.

96
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.310
But this looks really good.
