00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.350
<v Tutor>Alrighty, so in this video,</v>

2
00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:05.243
we'll cover step two of developing the CartService.

3
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:15.897
So let me move in here

4
00:00:15.897 --> 00:00:18.293
and let's open up a new terminal window.

5
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.540
And now let's make use

6
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.453
of this command ng generate service services/cart.

7
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.240
And that will create the appropriate files for us.

8
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.750
Let me just close off that terminal window real quick.

9
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.310
And then under services, there's our new cart.service

10
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.653
that was just created.

11
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.270
And I'll expand the window here for a second

12
00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.353
and I'll get down and dirty and start writing some code.

13
00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.540
So the first thing we'll start off

14
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.640
with is defining a property here for our shopping cart,

15
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.230
so it's really just an array of CartItem objects.

16
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.100
And then I make use of the square brackets

17
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.810
to make the array empty initially,

18
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.590
I'll take care of the little imports there.

19
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.300
Alright, so that's our shopping cart,

20
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.653
array of CartItem objects.

21
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.147
I'll create this totalPrice, Subject&lt;number&gt;.

22
00:01:34.831 --> 00:01:38.570
And now remember here a Subject is a subclass of Observable,

23
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.550
we can use the Subject to publish events in our code,

24
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.340
and the event will be sent to all subscribers.

25
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.620
Alright, so the CartService, this totalPrice subject,

26
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.250
it'll actually publish events to the subscribers,

27
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.190
and I'll show you the coding for it in a second

28
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.620
as far as how to actually publish the event.

29
00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.750
So we'll have a subject for a total price.

30
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.450
We'll also have a subject for total quantity

31
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.740
So I'll kind of do a copy paste here,

32
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.673
and so I'll have totalQuantity right here.

33
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.040
Okay, so moving down here,

34
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.870
let's go ahead and create this method addToCart.

35
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.653
That'll pass in theCartItem.

36
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.800
And what I'll do is I'll write some quick little comments

37
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.253
to myself to kind of keep myself on track.

38
00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:49.950
So we'll need to check if we already have

39
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.163
the item in our cart.

40
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.020
Then we need to find the item in the cart,

41
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.513
based on the item ID.

42
00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.193
And then check to see if we actually found that given item.

43
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.700
Alright, so that's the basic game plan.

44
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:09.730
Let's go ahead and dive in here

45
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.380
and let's start writing the code.

46
00:03:24.741 --> 00:03:26.090
So I'll just set up two variables here

47
00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.700
for alreadyExistsInCart, boolean, initialise it to false,

48
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.600
existingCartItem is a CartItem

49
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.803
and initially set it to undefined.

50
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.030
So if the cartItems.length is greater than zero,

51
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.310
then let's go ahead and do some work.

52
00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.230
So this work here, we'll do a little cut paste,

53
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.580
move those comments inside

54
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.280
'cause this will all be inside of this little if block

55
00:04:00.293 --> 00:04:03.440
So I need to find the item in the cart based on ID.

56
00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.790
There are a number of ways to do this,

57
00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.560
but I'll keep it simple just for now,

58
00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.430
and I'll simply loop through each one of the cart items

59
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.583
and compare item IDs.

60
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.690
So if the tempCartItem,

61
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.330
the guy that we're looping through right now,

62
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.330
if the ID is equal to theCartItem

63
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.460
that's been passed in as a parameter.id,

64
00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.660
then that means we've found it

65
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.370
and we simply assign existingCartItem,

66
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.166
equal to that tempCartItem,

67
00:04:35.166 --> 00:04:36.866
and then we break out of the loop.

68
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.110
So then we just check to see if we've found it.

69
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.980
So we assign this boolean alreadyExistsInCart

70
00:04:49.988 --> 00:04:54.988
is equal to existingCartItem is not equal to undefined.

71
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.380
So it'll have a value of true or false,

72
00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.463
depending on if we found it or not.

73
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.890
And that's the basic, basic coding here

74
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.433
for this add to cart.

75
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.920
Alright, and let's add some more code here to this method.

76
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.390
So if alreadyExistsInCart, then let's simply increment

77
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.670
the quantity of that item.

78
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:31.383
So we say existingCartItem.quantity++.

79
00:05:40.317 --> 00:05:42.450
Else we just add the item to the array.

80
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.723
So this.cartItems.push theCartItem.

81
00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.760
And then the final thing we'll do in this method

82
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.560
is it will compute the cart total price and total quantity.

83
00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.550
And I'll have a helper method to help us out with this.

84
00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.350
So I'll call this.computeCartTotals.

85
00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.650
And then we simply use the IDE

86
00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.513
to declare this method for us.
