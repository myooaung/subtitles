00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:01.903
<v Lecturer>In this video,</v>

2
00:00:01.903 --> 00:00:03.803
we'll discuss authorization servers.

3
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.453
So again, what is an authorization server?

4
00:00:09.453 --> 00:00:11.390
Like I mentioned earlier, it's a server

5
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.100
that generates tokens for OAuth 2 or OpenID Connect.

6
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.620
We can also use it for defining access policies

7
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.940
for a given application and protect resources,

8
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.120
and it can also serve

9
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.260
as an identity provider using openID Connect.

10
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.730
So at a very high level

11
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.620
that's what an authorization server is.

12
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.230
And like I mentioned earlier,

13
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.850
not all authorization servers are created equal.

14
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.890
You can have some very basic simple solutions

15
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.907
and you can also have some real-time enterprise solutions.

16
00:00:41.523 --> 00:00:44.520
Okta provides a cloud based authorization server

17
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.780
and platform.

18
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.760
So Okta provides authentication support where

19
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.790
they provide log-in widgets.

20
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.220
So with these login widgets, there's no need to worry

21
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.040
about creating your own login pages or whatever.

22
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.880
You can simply use their widget drop into your application

23
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.210
and you can also customize it.

24
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.610
So a really nice feature.

25
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.510
They also have support for social login.

26
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.700
So you can log in

27
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.443
with Facebook log in with Twitter and so on.

28
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.140
There's also support for authorization.

29
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.210
So you can make use of role based access.

30
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.540
So you can define roles

31
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.830
and define what end points or actions

32
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.563
that they can perform, can also define API access policies.

33
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.500
And then there's also user management support.

34
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.310
So, you have X number

35
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.160
of users that you're keeping track of or managing,

36
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.520
they provide an admin panel.

37
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.930
So, no need to write your own admin panel.

38
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:32.763
You can make use

39
00:01:32.763 --> 00:01:35.230
of the admin panel provided by the security solution.

40
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.003
You can also assign policies and so forth.

41
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.873
And the nice thing

42
00:01:39.873 --> 00:01:41.780
about Okta is that it supports industry standards

43
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.140
such as OAuth 2, OpenID Connect,

44
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.283
JSON Web Tokens and others.

45
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.110
The one thing that I really like about Okta here is

46
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.210
that they provide a free developer account.

47
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.220
So there's no credit card required.

48
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.070
You simply just register

49
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.400
and then you have a free developer account.

50
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.430
And you can use this to support up to 1000 users, all right.

51
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.100
So you can really have a chance to put this product

52
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.620
or platform through its paces

53
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.590
and see how it works out for you.

54
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.943
And we use Okta in our e-commerce store.

55
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.760
Also, when you develop applications using OAuth 2,

56
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.300
OpenID Connect, JSON Web Tokens, and so forth,

57
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.300
if you do it yourself, there's a lot

58
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.860
of low level boilerplate coding that you have to create.

59
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.680
But Okta provides SDKs for Angular, Java

60
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.230
and other programming languages.

61
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.650
And so these SDKs provide a high level of abstraction,

62
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.610
helps to accelerate the development process.

63
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.040
And it also provides these log-in widgets

64
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.280
that I mentioned earlier, that you can customize to look

65
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.130
and feel, add your own color scheme,

66
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.440
your own CSS, logos, and so forth.

67
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.963
And we'll see how to do this for our project coming up.

68
00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.050
Alrighty, so let's look at the Okta integration.

69
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.090
So we'll have our normal Angular front end,

70
00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.480
Spring Boot back-end that we've already developed.

71
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.420
And then we're going to integrate with Okta.

72
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.710
So Okta will provide a sign-in widget.

73
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.580
It'll help us with the authentication, authorization

74
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.430
and also Okta provides user management.

75
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.750
So our information will be stored there

76
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.780
at the Okta website, okta.com.

77
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.150
And we'll be able to integrate this

78
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.500
into our application and I'll show you all the steps

79
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.450
on how to make this integration happen.

80
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.250
All right, so before we get

81
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.270
into all of the coding and so forth, let's take a look

82
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.810
at a quick demo of the application and just to see

83
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.313
how the log-in, log-out functionality will work.

84
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.200
So just swinging into our application here.

85
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.660
And notice up in the top right we have

86
00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.770
this new button here called login.

87
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:44.883
Ooh, I like it.

88
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.820
So when we click on the login button we'll integrate

89
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.460
the Okta sign in widget.

90
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.610
So this is the widget from the Okta website.

91
00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.890
I've customized it with the luv2code logo

92
00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.850
and I'll show you how to do that in the coding.

93
00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.300
And just to start out here, I'll just enter a bad username

94
00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.913
and also a bad password and attempt to log in.

95
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.920
And so it'll say, hey, unable to sign in.

96
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.360
Okay, that's good.

97
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.803
And let's go ahead and give a good username.

98
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.973
And also the password.

99
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.500
So now we're successfully logged into our application.

100
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.080
So one thing to notice up in the top right

101
00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.340
it says welcome back and it gives the user info.

102
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.800
In this example, it's Demo Darby

103
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.450
and also the login button has changed to the logout button.

104
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.650
And so we'll actually add this functionality

105
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.330
when we develop the application.

106
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.230
So you'll see how that part all works.

107
00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.800
And know let me kind of zoom out for a second.

108
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.633
So other than that

109
00:04:54.633 --> 00:04:56.000
that's really the only thing that's changed.

110
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.530
There's nothing really new.

111
00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.170
In feature videos will add support for protected pages,

112
00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.340
so we'll have these VIP pages for logged in users.

113
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.910
And so VIP stands for very important person.

114
00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.030
So again, like a special member area only available

115
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.250
to people that are logged in.

116
00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.010
And then we'll also add support

117
00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.220
for adding tracking information for logged in users.

118
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.840
So users can track their previous orders

119
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.960
that were placed here on our website.

120
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.820
All right, so a lot of good features that are coming,

121
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.700
let's go ahead and get started and focus in on the login in,

122
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:24.830
log out functionality.

123
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.303
Alrighty, I'll see you in the next video.
