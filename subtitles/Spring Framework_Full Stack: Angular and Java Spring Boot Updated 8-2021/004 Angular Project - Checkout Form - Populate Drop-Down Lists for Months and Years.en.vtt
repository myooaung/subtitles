00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.150
<v Instructor>Alrighty, so we're at the final step</v>

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:04.790
of our development process.

3
00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.460
This is step four of updating the HTML template

4
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.713
to populate the drop-down lists for months and years.

5
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.060
Alrighty, so let's swing over here

6
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.250
and let's open up the HTML template, checkoutcomponent.html

7
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.190
and let's scroll down to the credit card section

8
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.190
and then let's move down to the area of expiration month,

9
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.100
so this is kind of the area of code

10
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.120
that we need to be in right now

11
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.550
and in particular, we're going to focus in on lines 206, 208:

12
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.320
form control name, expiration month.

13
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.860
Right now we have that placeholder here for to do,

14
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.940
we're going to remove this and add some angular code

15
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.183
to support this feature to actually populate the data.

16
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.193
So I make use of the option, do the ngFor,

17
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.030
so I let month of credit card months,

18
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.930
so basically going to loop over that array from our component

19
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.910
and then I simply display the month

20
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.710
using the double curly braces

21
00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.060
and so this will loop over that array

22
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.930
and it'll populate that drop-down list

23
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.683
with all of the different months.

24
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.420
Okay, so let's scroll down and let's do a similar thing here

25
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.050
for expiration year

26
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.850
and so again, we're going to focus in

27
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.430
on this little select component here

28
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.200
for form control name, expiration year

29
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.650
and update that to do section

30
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.010
and again, very similar coding here,

31
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.670
let year of credit card years, that's the array

32
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.680
that we'll loop over from our component

33
00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.523
and we simply display the year.

34
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.570
All right, so that's the coding there

35
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.250
for populating the drop-down list for expiration months

36
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.823
and expiration years, good.

37
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.810
So now let's go ahead and test this application.

38
00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.850
I'll open up a new terminal window

39
00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.690
and actually, before I do that,

40
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.670
let me swing over to IntelliJ,

41
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.400
make sure that my spring boot back end is up and running.

42
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.410
So I'll go ahead and start

43
00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.913
my spring boot e-commerce application.

44
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.490
Okay, excellent, that code is up and running,

45
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:04.820
the back end's running.

46
00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.600
Now we can go through and run our front end,

47
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.870
just open up a new terminal window, move into our directory

48
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.523
and start up our angular application.

49
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.180
Okay, great, so our app is up and running.

50
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.660
Let's go ahead an access it in the web browser

51
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.160
and then let's just go ahead and add some products

52
00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.300
to our shopping cart

53
00:03:39.531 --> 00:03:40.731
and go check on our cart

54
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.750
and now it's moved down to this checkout button.

55
00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.710
Okay great, so now here's our form,

56
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.500
let's move down to the credit card section,

57
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.010
zoom in a bit and success!

58
00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.910
So notice here, we have the expiration months and years

59
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.960
that are populated dynamically

60
00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.530
and we start at the current month.

61
00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.765
So when I'm recording this video it's June,

62
00:04:00.765 --> 00:04:02.350
so that's why we start at June,

63
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.340
and the current year of 2020

64
00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.575
but you could easily go through and check

65
00:04:05.575 --> 00:04:08.120
or select other items there accordingly

66
00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.390
and we have some other things I want to do

67
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.400
to kind of fine tune this a bit but this is a good start

68
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.709
and we have some other things that we'll cover

69
00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.900
in some of the upcoming videos

70
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.600
but at this point I'd like to say good job, my friend.
