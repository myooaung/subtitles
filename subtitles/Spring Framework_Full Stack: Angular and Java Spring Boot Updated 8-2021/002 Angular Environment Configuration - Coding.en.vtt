00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.760
<v ->All right. So let's go and get started.</v>

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.940
In this video we're going to define our configs

3
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.240
and our environment file,

4
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.670
use the environment in our app,

5
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.220
and also run it with the environment configuration.

6
00:00:19.816 --> 00:00:22.100
So, let's move into this directory here, environments,

7
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.460
and let's opened up the file environment.ts.

8
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.773
So this is our default configuration.

9
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.950
And in this file, we can define any name value pair

10
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:35.920
that we like.

11
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.633
So we'll define our luv2shopApiUrl.

12
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.490
And we know that our backend right now

13
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.143
is running on the secure port, https://localhost:8443.

14
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.426
All right, so let's go ahead and take a look at step two.

15
00:00:50.426 --> 00:00:52.976
We're going to use the environment in our application.

16
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.510
And so basically this URL is hard-coded

17
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.253
in all of our services.

18
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.923
So I'm moving to the app services,

19
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.410
and then I'll go through the services

20
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.770
and I'll update them accordingly.

21
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.693
And I'll start here with the auth-interceptor service.

22
00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.440
And we'll see down here in the handleAccess method

23
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.230
that we have is URL hard-coded.

24
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.160
So let's go ahead and make use of our environment.

25
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.233
So I'll, simply set up the end point.

26
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.513
This will be equal to the environment.luv2shopApiUrl.

27
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.600
So that's the end point.

28
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.850
And then this array of secured end points.

29
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.940
I'll simply replace the hard coded item here

30
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.847
with this item that I just set up, theEndpoint.

31
00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.533
And then the environment was imported up top.

32
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.760
So we're making use of that environment file

33
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.363
that we set up previously. So this looks pretty good.

34
00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.120
Now let's move down to our checkout.service.ts

35
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.163
and this person also has a hard coded URL in place.

36
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.910
So we'll simply replace this portion of it

37
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.083
with our environment information.

38
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.463
So again, referencing that environment.luv2shop.ApiUrl,

39
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.350
and that is automatically imported at top for us.

40
00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.130
And now we just kind of repeat the process for all the

41
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.520
upcoming services here.

42
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.570
So this is kind of just more of the same.

43
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.277
So right now I'm in my luv2ShopFormService

44
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.143
and I'll make the appropriate updates here.

45
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.030
And then I'll make a similar update here

46
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.083
for the order history service.

47
00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.363
And then the last item here is for the product service.

48
00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.023
Alrighty, so this looks pretty good so far.

49
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.210
Now in step three, we can run our application

50
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.973
with the environment configuration.

51
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.840
So let's go ahead and open up a new terminal window,

52
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.260
just move into my angular-ecommerce directory

53
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.160
and we'll start the application.

54
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.010
And what we'll do here is that we won't give

55
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.810
an actual configuration name,

56
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.770
so it'll simply use the default configuration

57
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.113
and the default configuration is environment.ts.

58
00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.860
So those entries that were made into the environment ts file

59
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.263
it'll actually use that one.

60
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.580
Alrighty, so our Angular app is up and running.

61
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.913
We can go ahead and access it in our browser.

62
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.690
And so we're at 4200 and I like to say success.

63
00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.630
So right now we're able to connect or retrieve data

64
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.155
from the Spring Boot backend

65
00:05:30.155 --> 00:05:34.340
and the URL is no longer hard coded in the services class.

66
00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.151
So we have the basics in place right now to use

67
00:05:37.151 --> 00:05:39.250
other environments in the future.

68
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.890
So if we wanted to make use of like a QA environment or

69
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.410
production environment, we can easily do that

70
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.708
by simply adding the appropriate files.

71
00:05:46.708 --> 00:05:49.060
And I'll show you some more details on that

72
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.110
in some of the upcoming videos, but at least at this moment,

73
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.395
we have the basics in place.

74
00:05:53.395 --> 00:05:57.820
No more hard coding of the URL in the services class,

75
00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.840
it's in one central location.

76
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.850
Okay. So this looks pretty good so far.

77
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.713
I'm happy. Good job. My friend.
