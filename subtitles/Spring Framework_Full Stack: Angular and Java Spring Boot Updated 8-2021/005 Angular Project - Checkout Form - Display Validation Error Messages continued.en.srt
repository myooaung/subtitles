1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,780
<v Instructor>All righty, so we're almost done.</v>

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:03,613
So in step four,

3
00:00:03,613 --> 00:00:05,560
we're going to add the event handler to check

4
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,633
the validation status when the submit button is clicked.

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,250
All righty, so we'll move over

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,030
to our checkout component.ts file

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,480
and we'll move down to this onSubmit method.

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,063
So let me just kind of zoom in here onSubmit.

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,210
So here I'll check on the checkout form group

10
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,580
to see if it's invalid.

11
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:50,330
If it is invalid, then we're going to mark all as touched.

12
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:53,990
And remember, touching all fields triggers the display

13
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:55,770
of the error messages.

14
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,530
Now, Angular will do a lot of the work in the background

15
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,280
when the form is first displayed,

16
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,040
but also when they actually do the submit,

17
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,053
we want to manually trigger this.

18
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,990
I'm ready so let's go ahead and run our application.

19
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,340
And actually before we run it,

20
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,320
let's just make sure we have our Spring Boot app

21
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,770
up and running.

22
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,060
So I'm just going to swing over there for a second

23
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,440
in IntelliJ.

24
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,920
And my Spring Boot app is already running.

25
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,000
If yours is not running,

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,200
be sure to start it now.

27
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,520
Then I just move over here into the correct directory

28
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,183
and get my Angular app up and running.

29
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,920
So I'll just move into my app

30
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,720
and I'll just add a couple of items to my shopping cart.

31
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,830
Then I'll go and view the cart,

32
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,030
just move down to the checkout button.

33
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,003
And now I'm on the checkout form.

34
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,960
So we have first name, last name, email.

35
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,500
Let's just test the validations here,

36
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,100
just move down and hit purchase.

37
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,320
And scroll to the top,

38
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,520
it says, hey, first name is required.

39
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,070
Now, right now it's only displaying the message

40
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:25,210
for first name because that's the only one that we added

41
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,700
the display messages for.

42
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,360
But we'll go ahead and repeat the process

43
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,653
for the other fields for last name and email.

44
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,340
So I'll move back into the HTML template

45
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,700
and I'll just grab the coding here

46
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,380
for the first name section,

47
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,429
so that div where I have the ngIf,

48
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:45,153
and I'll just copy that div.

49
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,480
And I'll apply the same thing for the other fields here

50
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,730
so I'll copy that,

51
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,373
move down to last name.

52
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,330
And so the last name section here,

53
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,560
I'll just paste that and now I'll just update this right.

54
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,550
So last name.

55
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,570
So instead of first name,

56
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,370
replace it with last name.

57
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:13,280
A couple of locations there and also for errors

58
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,560
and also for required and minlength.

59
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,650
And say last name is required.

60
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,270
Last name must be at least two characters.

61
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:23,890
So just make sure you make the appropriate updates there.

62
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,313
So last name invalid, last name dirty, last name touched.

63
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,470
Now, let's swing back into our application

64
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,340
and let's just move down to the purchase button

65
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,133
and then up top,

66
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,203
success, great.

67
00:03:46,203 --> 00:03:49,400
So now we also have the last name is required

68
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,350
error message showing up.

69
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:51,183
So that's good.

70
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,300
So now it's just kind of more the same.

71
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,800
We'll do a similar thing here for the email field.

72
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,233
Just our copy paste exercise one more time.

73
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,190
Move down to the email section,

74
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,853
just paste it in here.

75
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,090
And again, we simply go through

76
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:22,913
and we've replaced last name with email.

77
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,970
And so for the minlength,

78
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,630
email doesn't have a minlength,

79
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,630
email makes use of that regular expression pattern

80
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,600
validation.

81
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,620
So be sure to say email.errors.pattern

82
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,410
Now, I'll just update the appropriate text here

83
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,560
for those messages.

84
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,820
So email is required

85
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,653
and also

86
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,713
email must be a valid email address format.

87
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,660
All righty, so we're back into our application here.

88
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,663
Let's just move down to the bottom and I'll do a purchase.

89
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,730
Okay, good, so this is great.

90
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,740
So email is required, so that's good.

91
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,593
Happy about that.

92
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,050
Now, let's kind of play around with the form a bit

93
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,430
and just add some data here to the form.

94
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:30,010
And notice Angular will automatically display or hide

95
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:33,540
the validation messages accordingly based on your input.

96
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:38,010
So it monitors these fields behind the scenes automatically.

97
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:40,600
So here I added some information for first name,

98
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,340
added some information for last name.

99
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,330
That's great.

100
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,980
And even email address so it's required.

101
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,770
We gave some data, but it's bad data.

102
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:48,860
So we have to make sure

103
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,183
that we gave a valid email address format.

104
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,080
Okay, great.

105
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,340
This looks really good.

106
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,173
So I'm happy.

107
00:06:02,173 --> 00:06:04,890
So we have the basic validation in place.

108
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,020
In some of the other videos,

109
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,360
we'll add some more features here for validation.

110
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,240
And we'll also apply the validation rules

111
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,150
to the other fields on our checkout form.

112
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,740
So a lot of good stuff coming up.

113
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,273
So I'll see ya in the next video.
