00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:01,973
<v Instructor>In this video,</v>

2
00:00:01,973 --> 00:00:04,130
we're going to learn how to add products to the cart

3
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:05,933
from the Details view.

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:11,730
So we've already done work of adding products to the cart,

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,930
but now on our Details view or our Details page,

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,750
we need to add similar support.

7
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,400
So here we have an Add to cart button

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,130
on our Details view for adding a given item

9
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,533
to the actual cart.

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,270
So here's the development process.

11
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,480
So the first thing we'll do is we'll add the click handler

12
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,620
for the Add to cart button on our ProductDetailsComponent,

13
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:35,530
and then we'll update our ProductDetailsComponent

14
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,960
with the given click handler method.

15
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,690
And a lot of the functionality will be similar

16
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,520
to what we did before, just with a small change

17
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,653
or a small twist.

18
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,560
So step one of adding a click handler

19
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,850
for the Add to cart button,

20
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,750
so in our product-details.component.html page,

21
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,830
we have a button here, Add to cart,

22
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:59,020
and that's the item that we'll see on the screen,

23
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,540
and then we'll add this On click event.

24
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,543
So we'll actually call the method, addToCart

25
00:01:04,543 --> 00:01:06,673
when the user clicks on that given button.

26
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,890
Now moving ahead to step two

27
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,450
of updating our ProductDetailsComponent

28
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,080
with the click handler method,

29
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,313
so this is in our file, product-details.component.ts.

30
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:21,040
So we already have our existing product,

31
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,680
and then we'll just have some comments here,

32
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,270
meaning that behind the scenes,

33
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,440
we do all the code for retrieving the product

34
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,570
from the product from our REST API.

35
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:29,460
We've written all that code before,

36
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,800
but now we'll simply add this new method here, addToCart,

37
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,030
and we simply log the product name and unit price,

38
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,260
and that's the product that's defined

39
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,160
in this component up top.

40
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,220
Then we simply create a cart item based on this,

41
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:45,570
and then we'll call cartService.addToCart,

42
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,540
and then we pass in theCartItem.

43
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,190
So as you can see, a lot of this code is similar

44
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,503
to what we did before.

45
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,140
Now, with the application interaction,

46
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,620
the only new code is right here

47
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,270
on the ProductDetailsComponent

48
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,370
where we actually have addToCart

49
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,370
and we call a method on the CartService,

50
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,860
but there are no changes for steps one, three, and four,

51
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,770
so everything over on the right hand side,

52
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:10,900
that's all the same.

53
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,490
We're simply feeding data to the CartService,

54
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:16,640
and the CartService is responsible for publishing the events

55
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,010
to all subscribers.

56
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,580
So the really nice thing about this

57
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,840
is that we can leverage a lot of the work that we did before.

58
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,690
We're simply adding on a new piece of code here

59
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:28,360
for simply calling a method on the CartService

60
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,783
and adding data to it.

61
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,400
Alrighty, so this looks pretty good.

62
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,280
Let's go ahead and move into the IDE,

63
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,930
and let's start writing the code.
