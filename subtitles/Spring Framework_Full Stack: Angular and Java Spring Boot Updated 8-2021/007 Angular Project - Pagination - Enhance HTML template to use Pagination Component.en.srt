1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:02,700
<v ->Alrighty, I'm getting really excited because</v>

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,560
we're at the final step here!

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,370
So step five of the enhancing the HTML template

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:11,010
to use the 'ng-bootstrap pagination component'.

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,110
All right, good stuff!

6
00:00:22,816 --> 00:00:24,490
All right, it says go ahead and close that window,

7
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,670
and let's go ahead and open up our template

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,767
'product-list-grid-component.html'.

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,730
And just moving to the top, this is our main

10
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,090
list grid for listing all of our products

11
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:44,820
and we want to have our pagination component

12
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,940
at the bottom.

13
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,250
So one thing you want to do here is move down

14
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,260
to the bottom of this file, and you want to

15
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:56,260
add your new entries just above the third 'div'

16
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,870
All right, so third from the bottom.

17
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:02,140
So you want to have three 'divs' below you when

18
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,010
you start adding new data and it's really

19
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:07,080
important because if not what CSS,

20
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,390
if you don't have things at the right location,

21
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,240
your page is all mixed up and CSS is pretty unforgiving.

22
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,076
Okay?

23
00:01:15,076 --> 00:01:15,909
(laughs)

24
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,480
So make sure you have your new entry here above

25
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,583
the third 'div' from the bottom.

26
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:23,810
All right, now I'll just add some more comments

27
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:26,160
here to myself to kind of keep myself on track.

28
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:35,090
So this where I'll add my pagination component area,

29
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:36,913
in this little footer section here.

30
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,350
Give myself some white space at the bottom to stretch out.

31
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:50,520
So now add a collection of 'divs' mainly for layout

32
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,087
and alignment of this given pagination component.

33
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,620
All right, so that covers the 'divs'

34
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,590
and styles for the layout.

35
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,130
Now actually getting down to work here with our

36
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,630
'ngb-pagination component',

37
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:47,123
so getting into the real meat of the actual coding here.

38
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,150
So I'll make use of this 'ngb-pagination' component

39
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,830
and then we'll set some parameters on it,

40
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,500
and remember, this pagination component will

41
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,380
automatically generate the actual controls that

42
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,200
you'll see on the screen.

43
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,463
Again, base on information from those parameters.

44
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,670
So I'll set up parameters here for the 'page',

45
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,015
'PageSize', 'collectionSize',

46
00:04:17,015 --> 00:04:19,393
and the 'pageChange' event.

47
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,240
And remember, on the left-hand side,

48
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,380
these are parameters for the 'ngb-pagination' component.

49
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,640
Over on the right-hand side, those are properties

50
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,970
for the 'ProductListComponent'.

51
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:17,022
And also, this 'pageChange', this is an event-binding

52
00:05:17,022 --> 00:05:18,580
'pageChange' event.

53
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,490
So when the user clicks a different page,

54
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:23,568
then they'll call our method list products in our

55
00:05:23,568 --> 00:05:26,180
'ProductListComponent'.

56
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,970
And this will make sure that we show a new page

57
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,223
of data base on this information.

58
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,550
Alrighty, so that's the end of step five.

59
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,240
That's the end of our major development here.

60
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,780
So on the next video, we'll actually run

61
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,350
this application and we'll test it out,

62
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,350
and see our how pagination control works.

63
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,963
Alrighty, I'll see ya in the next video!
