00:00:01.375 --> 00:00:02.830
<v Instructor>In this video we'll cover step six</v>

2
00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.083
of laying out the form controls in the HTML template.

3
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.400
All right, so let's go ahead and move back over

4
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.763
to our checkout component about HTML.

5
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.700
Right now we simply have "checkout works"

6
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.440
and we need to actually put our real form here,

7
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.373
to show some real form data for the checkout form.

8
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.680
So I'll make a small mod here on my div,

9
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.700
I'll make use of that new CSS style that updated CSS style

10
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.950
and I'll add page-m because we need that

11
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.483
for just some other cosmetic layouts here for our form.

12
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.263
So we'll set up divs here for the section and the container.

13
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.360
And now we'll get down to business

14
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.333
and actually start creating our form,

15
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.820
and we use form group in square brackets

16
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.643
and we have a reference to checkout form group.

17
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.340
I'll do some quick cleanup here on the divs at the bottom.

18
00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.280
So now this form group, that's the name

19
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.860
of the property from our component class,

20
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.350
so remember earlier when we created our checkout component

21
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.720
dot ts we had a property called checkout form group,

22
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.913
so those two items have to match up.

23
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.010
And so remember a form group is a collection

24
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.550
of forms controls or other groups,

25
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.370
so we'll add a customer form group and also a submit button

26
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.970
and we'll add more form groups later,

27
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.463
but this is just enough to kind of get us started.

28
00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.600
So all set with this form group name customer,

29
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.350
and that's the actual name of the key

30
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.730
that's in the form group,

31
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.970
so again from that coding that we created earlier,

32
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.510
we add customer colon this dot form builder blah blah blah,

33
00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:57.850
that's the actual reference there

34
00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.280
those two items have to match up.

35
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.600
So we're basically binding this form

36
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.440
to the actual properties of fields in our,

37
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.203
back in component dot ts file.

38
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.530
So now it's simply do some HTML work here

39
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.570
for setting up our H3 for customer

40
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:22.940
and then I'll define a row

41
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.750
and this row will be for first name.

42
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.760
So I'll have a label here for first name

43
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.880
and also an input field for the actual first name.

44
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.180
Alrighty so there's our input form control name

45
00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.190
of first name and the input type of text.

46
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.584
So again, that's the name of the form control

47
00:04:43.584 --> 00:04:46.230
in our form group, first name,

48
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.030
and again they match up because we are doing data binding

49
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.193
between this form and our actual component dot ts file.

50
00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.940
Alrighty so I'll just move down here at the bottom

51
00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.390
and I'll add a submit button.

52
00:05:26.884 --> 00:05:29.350
All right, so that looks pretty good for our submit button,

53
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.420
let's go ahead and swing into our browser

54
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.620
and take a look at this.

55
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.963
All right so just add some items to our cart.

56
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.993
Scroll down to the bottom here into checkout.

57
00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.763
We should of scroll up and we should see this new

58
00:05:54.763 --> 00:05:58.480
form piece that we just added in, customer and first name.

59
00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.544
So that's the basics, we'll kind of repeat the process

60
00:06:01.544 --> 00:06:03.640
X number of times, but at least we have

61
00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.070
the basic layout in place.

62
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:07.807
So I'd say, "Good job!"
