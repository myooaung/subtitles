1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:02,970
<v ->All right, so now that we have our constructors set up,</v>

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,920
let's go ahead and write the code here

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,793
for getting the countries.

4
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,710
So now it's simply make a REST API call,

5
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,303
do HB client dot get.

6
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:37,450
We get response countries pass the net countries URL.

7
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:39,623
I pipe map the response.

8
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,393
And I make use of

9
00:00:47,393 --> 00:00:51,663
that response dot embedded underscore countries.

10
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,110
And then in this interface get response countries I make use

11
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,410
of the underscore embedded

12
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,380
in countries as country square brackets.

13
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,530
So for that, all right.

14
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,290
So that'll basically unwrap the JSON from Spring Data REST

15
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,350
for that underscore embedded entry.

16
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,490
And again, we have that little mapping there

17
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,700
between underscore embedded and the actual JSON

18
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,830
that's returned by the REST API.

19
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:44,663
Okay, good.

20
00:01:44,663 --> 00:01:45,496
I like it.

21
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,390
And we need to make one small modification here inside

22
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,010
of this get countries method.

23
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:59,450
So that's the main coding there,

24
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:02,100
but we have a little issue here with this map so we need

25
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,610
to do the appropriate import here for the map.

26
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:10,150
So be sure you choose our XJS slash operators.

27
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:13,800
Don't choose the internal, just the regular operators.

28
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,090
And then just scroll up to the top.

29
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,110
Make sure we have the right one pulled in.

30
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,160
So a good online five import map

31
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,470
from our XJS slash operators.

32
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,593
Okay, good job.

33
00:02:25,315 --> 00:02:27,920
Alright, so that's the coding there for get countries

34
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,890
and that's in place.

35
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,083
So I like that so far.

36
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,020
Now let's do a similar thing here for get states.

37
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,400
So we need to make a REST API for getting the states.

38
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,150
But now remember when we get states they're not going to pass

39
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:49,490
in the country code that they want the states for.

40
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:52,560
So for example for 'In' for India

41
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,973
or 'Tr' for Turkey or whatever.

42
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,910
And then we'll also return

43
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:02,243
an observable array of state objects.

44
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,000
And we'll do something similar to what we did

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,680
for get countries but a slight modification because we want

46
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,620
to do a search using our search URL.

47
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,110
So that's that special query method

48
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:21,110
that we defined in our interface to find by country code.

49
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,690
So we'll make use of the base states URL.

50
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:27,200
Then I say slash, search find by country code.

51
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,010
And then I give the question mark code, equals

52
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,660
and then I make use of the country code that's passed in

53
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,193
to this given method.

54
00:03:37,172 --> 00:03:39,080
Alright, so semi-colon.

55
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,920
Okay, this looks pretty good.

56
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,753
I like it.

57
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,720
Alright, so that part is done.

58
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,900
Now I can make the REST API call

59
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,623
using the search states URL.

60
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:06,723
So do the client dot get, get response states.

61
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,393
We pass the net search states URL,

62
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:19,363
and then we simply pipe and map a response.

63
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,013
And then we make use

64
00:04:25,013 --> 00:04:28,153
of response underscore embedded dot states.

65
00:04:33,463 --> 00:04:34,600
And so now let's go ahead and just kind

66
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,600
of copy this get response states, pull down to the bottom

67
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,850
and create a similar interface like we did

68
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,410
for get response countries.

69
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,240
All right, so get response states

70
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,710
and then I'll just kind of copy paste

71
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,573
'cause this is very similar here.

72
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,520
And the field is states and it's an array of state objects.

73
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,070
And I just need to fix the import here so make sure

74
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,360
we have the state imported for the one

75
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,463
that we created for our project.

76
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,540
Alright, so that's the coding there for get states.

77
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,690
This looks pretty good.
