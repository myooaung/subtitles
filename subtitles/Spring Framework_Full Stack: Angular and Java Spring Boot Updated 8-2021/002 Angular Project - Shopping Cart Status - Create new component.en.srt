1
00:00:00,454 --> 00:00:02,120
<v Instructor>Okay, so taking a look</v>

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,400
at our development process,

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,450
so in this video we're going to cover steps one and two

4
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:06,850
of creating a new component,

5
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:10,143
and also adding the HTML template for our component.

6
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,273
All righty, so let's go ahead and swing into our IDE.

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,920
And what I'll do here is open up a new terminal window,

8
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:25,223
stretch out a bit,

9
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:33,990
and now I'll generate that component

10
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,500
by using ng generate component

11
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,133
and I give components/cart-status.

12
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:42,990
Okay, great so it created those files

13
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,163
for me accordingly, looks good.

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,620
So over here under src, app, components,

15
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,290
we should see cart-status, yep, there we go.

16
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:54,533
Looks great, love it.

17
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,723
Let me go ahead and close out this terminal window here.

18
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,780
Now in step two we need to add the HTML template

19
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,573
for our cart-status component.

20
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,740
So we'll do some work in the cart-status component HTML,

21
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:19,070
but actually I'll start here at the app.component.html,

22
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,090
our main page, so app.component.html,

23
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:23,590
that's where I'm at right now.

24
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,000
And let's scroll down a bit

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,470
to the section of HEADER DESKTOP.

26
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,450
So this is where we have our normal search component

27
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,840
that's already there, and also right now,

28
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,780
we have the cart information hard coded.

29
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,963
This will actually move into our cart-status component.

30
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,770
So I actually want to add

31
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,920
this new cart-status component right here

32
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,410
but I need the selector, I need the actual tag

33
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,290
to use at this location.

34
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,610
So I can find that out by looking

35
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,440
at my cart-status.component.ts

36
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,240
and if we looked at annotation @Component,

37
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,360
then there's a selector attribute, app-cart-status.

38
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,737
Let's go ahead and copy this

39
00:02:01,737 --> 00:02:05,300
and we can use it in our app.component.html.

40
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,830
So I'm swinging back to app.component.html

41
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,033
and I'm adding in our new component.

42
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,483
So that's our app-cart-status.

43
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:19,671
All right, this looks good, I like it.

44
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,400
Now this hard-coded information,

45
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,929
I can go ahead and cut this, remove it,

46
00:02:26,929 --> 00:02:29,200
and I'll put it into my component.

47
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,950
So let's go ahead and cut this code

48
00:02:32,634 --> 00:02:37,634
and let's move over to our cart-status.component.html,

49
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:46,940
and let's kind of move into this file,

50
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,793
clear our everything that's there,

51
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,400
and then we'll just paste in that hard-coded information.

52
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,450
All right, so this is good right now.

53
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:59,450
So this is our little HTML snippet here for our cart-status.

54
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,760
I'll do a quick little format on this document,

55
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,955
kind of clean some things up,

56
00:03:03,955 --> 00:03:06,650
expand my window here,

57
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,440
and give me one quick second, I'll do some formatting,

58
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,103
just put things on different lines here, one second.

59
00:03:23,896 --> 00:03:25,220
All right, so there we go.

60
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:30,220
So we have the basic layout here for our total price.

61
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,500
I'll just change this value real quickly to 36.98,

62
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,763
just making this up.

63
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,150
I'll clean up the white space here

64
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,993
on the span for the quantity.

65
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,811
And so you're probably wondering why I changed that value.

66
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:50,372
Well, I just added the new total there

67
00:03:50,372 --> 00:03:52,010
just to help us confirm that our

68
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,340
new cart-status component is being used.

69
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,600
So when we run the app,

70
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,370
we should see a different value there,

71
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,203
just so we know that, hey,

72
00:03:58,203 --> 00:04:00,430
it's really getting it from this cart-status

73
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,340
and it's not hard-coded somewhere else in our application.

74
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,900
But again, right now we're just hard-coding it.

75
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,560
We'll actually add code in the future

76
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,150
to update this dynamically,

77
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,750
and we'll cover that in some of the upcoming videos.

78
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,730
All right, this looks pretty good.

79
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,670
I want to test this, just to make sure

80
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,782
my component is actually working.

81
00:04:19,782 --> 00:04:21,930
So we need to swing over to IntelliJ

82
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,890
and run our Spring Boot application

83
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,220
if it's not already running.

84
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,970
So I'm in IntelliJ right now,

85
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,783
I'll go into my Spring Boot app and just get it started.

86
00:04:34,086 --> 00:04:37,740
All righty, so my Boot application is up and running,

87
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,970
swing over to Visual Studio Code,

88
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,890
and I'll just open up a new terminal window

89
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,843
and I'll run my Angular app here.

90
00:04:55,914 --> 00:04:59,390
Okay, great, so my Angular application is up and running.

91
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,163
Let's swing over to our browser,

92
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,500
access our application, and this looks good.

93
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,325
Great, so here's our cart-status component

94
00:05:08,325 --> 00:05:12,740
that has that new value that we just added, $36.98.

95
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,640
So we know that it's actually using our component

96
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,560
and that that part's working out great.

97
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,760
So I feel pretty good about that, I'm happy.

98
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:26,278
Now one thing that you may have noticed in my video,

99
00:05:26,278 --> 00:05:30,490
and it may happen on yours also, or maybe not,

100
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,007
is that we had some red errors here.

101
00:05:34,007 --> 00:05:35,980
I'm like, hm,

102
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:39,605
and it says router-outlet and gives you some weird error.

103
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:42,092
This is an IDE bug.

104
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:47,092
It normally goes away if you simply restart the IDE.

105
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,480
So you may this, you may not,

106
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,600
depending on the current status of VS Code.

107
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,160
I simply restarted the IDE and pulled it back up

108
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,910
and there're no more errors.

109
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:01,050
All right, so anyway, small bug,

110
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:02,500
you may see it, you may not.

111
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,030
All righty, so this looks pretty good so far.

112
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,283
We have the basics of our component in place.

113
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:09,500
We'll continue on and we'll add some features to it.

114
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,653
So I'll see ya in the next video.
