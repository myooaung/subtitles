00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.840
<v Instructor>All righty, so let's go ahead and get started</v>

2
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.170
with our development process.

3
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.420
In this video, we'll cover step one

4
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.763
of creating the database tables.

5
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.770
Okay, so the first thing we need to do

6
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.873
is download the database script.

7
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.550
So on our browser, let's go ahead and visit the link

8
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:22.763
that's on the screen.

9
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.260
And this will download a ZIP file for you

10
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.713
to your local file system.

11
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.340
And let me just swing over to my file system,

12
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.303
moving to the Downloads directory.

13
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.243
And let me simply unzip the file here.

14
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.583
So this will give me the countries-and-states.sql file,

15
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.700
and so I actually want to use this file

16
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.000
in the MySQL workbench.

17
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.763
So I'll go ahead and log in here.

18
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.323
Take a look at my full-stack-ecommerce schema.

19
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.700
We only have two tables at the moment.

20
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.603
Let's go ahead and open that file.

21
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.713
That's in the Downloads directory, countries-and-states.sql.

22
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.390
So here's the file.

23
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.133
It goes through and creates tables and also inserts data.

24
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.880
So I'll go ahead and hit the yellow lightning bolt

25
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.323
here on the toolbar to execute the script,

26
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.700
and then I simply take a look at the bottom here.

27
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.573
I see all green, so that's good.

28
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.143
Do a Refresh All over here on the left-hand side.

29
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.010
And so there are new tables here,

30
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.660
country and state, all right, looks good.

31
00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.670
Let's do a quick query here on that table for country,

32
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.893
and we see that we have the six countries,

33
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.223
so that's awesome.

34
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.583
And let's do a similar query here for state.

35
00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.650
So these are all of the states,

36
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.350
but we want to only view the states for a specific country,

37
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.980
so I'll say where country ID equals four,

38
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.980
and that's for India, and then there we go,

39
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.670
so all of the states there for India, so this is great.

40
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.940
So we have our database table set up,

41
00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.830
and also we have our data inserted into our database tables,

42
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.003
so this is good so far, good job.
