00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:02,013
<v Presenter>In this video,</v>

2
00:00:02,013 --> 00:00:04,410
we're going to cover angler environments, and in particular,

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,423
how to add a new environment.

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,060
In the previous videos, we saw the use of environment files,

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,020
so we saw the source environments directory,

6
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,080
environment dot TS, and environment prod dot TS.

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,540
And in environment dot TS, that's the default environment,

8
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,500
we can add our own custom configurations there.

9
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,410
And we also have the dot prod TS.

10
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,090
That's for the production environment.

11
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,310
And here we can add our own custom configurations

12
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,493
for production.

13
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,910
And then we'd actually run our application with the

14
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,040
environment configuration so to run with the default,

15
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,730
we simply give the command NPM start and that'll use

16
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,603
environment dot TS in the background.

17
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:45,440
And then to run with the production configuration,

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,320
we simply did an NPM start and we specify configuration

19
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,460
equals production.

20
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,293
And so in the background,

21
00:00:50,293 --> 00:00:52,613
it'll use environment dot prod dot TS.

22
00:00:57,121 --> 00:00:58,940
Now you may have some questions such as

23
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,240
how does it work behind the scenes?

24
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,280
And how are the filenames mapped to an environment?

25
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,563
And also how can I add a new environment?

26
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,620
And we'll actually answer these questions in this video.

27
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,160
All right, so let's take a look behind the scenes.

28
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,750
The environment configurations are defined

29
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,490
in the the angler dot json file.

30
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,260
The angular CLI tool added entries

31
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,490
for the production configuration in the file initially

32
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:25,933
when we created the project.

33
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,050
So in his final angler dot json,

34
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:31,380
there's already an entry here

35
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,940
for configurations for production

36
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,990
and that's the actual configuration name.

37
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,040
And then here, they also specify file replacements.

38
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,470
So let's say replace environment dot TS

39
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,510
with environment dot prod dot TS.

40
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,550
Now during processing for the production configuration,

41
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:52,380
it'll actually load the file environment prod dot TS.

42
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,360
So we don't really change anything on the file system.

43
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,790
We don't replace files on the file system.

44
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,070
It's simply saying, hey,

45
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,480
when you load the environment file,

46
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,980
load environment dot prod dot TS, okay,

47
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,100
so mainly for loading the given file

48
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,383
or referencing the file.

49
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,220
And then also in the serve section of the angular dot json,

50
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,483
it defines the actual runtime support.

51
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,750
So there's another section here in the file serve,

52
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,110
and we have configurations here and there's also an entry

53
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,920
for the production configuration.

54
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,593
So that's the configuration name.

55
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,985
And this is the actual name that we'll reference

56
00:02:32,985 --> 00:02:34,350
from the command line when we start the application.

57
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,940
So when we say NPM start configuration equals,

58
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,640
that's the production entry that we'll reference here.

59
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,810
And then we have information here for our browser target

60
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,330
and this basically references the configuration defined

61
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:49,150
on the previous slide.

62
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,140
So on the previous slide here,

63
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,640
we had a configuration entry

64
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,240
and those two configurations there have to match up.
