1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:03,010
<v ->Alrighty so we're making good progress,</v>

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:05,313
in this video we will cover billing address.

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,670
So, just swinging back into

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,803
our checkout component at HTML.

5
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:19,510
All right, so let's just add a

6
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:21,510
little comment here for billing address.

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,120
And, for billing address we simply want to copy

8
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,260
everything that we did for shipping address,

9
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,210
so lets go ahead and move up there and,

10
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,570
copy that section starting at that form

11
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,920
group for shipping address and all the way

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,233
down to that last div.

13
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,843
Just do a little copy paste there.

14
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:05,200
And then here's our new version, yep billing address.

15
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,803
We simply change the form group name to billing address,

16
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:15,387
and billing address, great.

17
00:01:15,387 --> 00:01:18,240
And so everything else should work out just fine for us.

18
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,500
Just swing back over to our browser,

19
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:25,500
and scroll to the top, customer, shipping and billing.

20
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,573
Good job I like it.

21
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,180
Now, one feature that you may have seen on

22
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,560
some e-commerce sites is that they will do a little

23
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,220
copy paste for you, so if your billing address is

24
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,360
the same thing as your shipping address,

25
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,090
they'll auto fill that, so will actually add a checkbox here

26
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,523
to provide that functionality.

27
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,480
So, will simply copy the shipping address

28
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,963
to the billing address.

29
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,410
So, will add our input type for our checkbox

30
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,580
and will add some event binding here,

31
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,560
so when the checkbox is checked or changed,

32
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,170
then will call this method,

33
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,847
copy shipping address to billing address,

34
00:02:49,847 --> 00:02:51,290
and this is a method that will

35
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,293
define in our component.ts file,

36
00:02:55,477 --> 00:02:58,320
and will pass over the event just to find out what

37
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,770
actually happened if it was checked or unchecked.

38
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,620
And, it will give us a little error message,

39
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,320
but for now don't worry about it will

40
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,470
address it in a second.

41
00:03:29,925 --> 00:03:31,280
And then will just get a text here for our label

42
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,613
billing address same as shipping address.

43
00:03:44,571 --> 00:03:47,020
And so, at least we can go over here and look and see

44
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,980
that okay yes we have our little checkbox here thing,

45
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,950
but it doesn't really do anything,

46
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,210
because we don't have the real coding in place,

47
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,493
but will fix that now.

48
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,450
So, the method here is the method that we need to

49
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,840
add to our component.ts file,

50
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,630
and the IDE even tells us this, that's cool so,

51
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,450
same thing right, just copy that method name,

52
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,543
and will add it to our component.ts.

53
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,943
So moving over to checkout component.ts.

54
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,363
I'll just scroll down and I'll just add this new method.

55
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,593
And they're going to pass in the event.

56
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,250
And then we can make use of that event

57
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,000
to find out what actually happened.

58
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:53,200
So, if the event target is checked,

59
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,370
that means that hey they actually checked something,

60
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,440
then we basically we want to copy data

61
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,703
from shipping to billing.

62
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:04,620
So here I basically get the check out from group dot

63
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,400
controls dot billing address,

64
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,140
and I'm going to set the value, so I'm going to set

65
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,013
billing to whatever shipping is.

66
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,360
And so I simply get a handle to shipping and there we go.

67
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,900
So this will basically copy the shipping address value

68
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,033
to billing address value.

69
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,430
And then else if it's not checked that means we simply

70
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,930
just want to reset it, so I'll just blank out,

71
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:36,623
or clear out the billing address if it's not checked.

72
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,613
So, I'll just grab the billing address here.

73
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,020
Then I say reset, so reset will actually clear out

74
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,400
all of the fields on the actual

75
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,593
billing address form group.

76
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,720
Alrighty, swing over here and lets test it out real quick.

77
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:19,153
Now, just add some items to my cart swing down, check out.

78
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,940
Just add some data here for my shipping address.

79
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,300
Now, move down here and check the box

80
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,140
here for billing address, and oh nice look it

81
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,660
copied it over there automatically,

82
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:46,410
so up top we have that, and to reset and it goes away,

83
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:50,050
and if I hit the check box again it's going to copy

84
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:52,360
stuff from shipping to billing okay great,

85
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,610
so nice little feature now that's in place,

86
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,573
and it looks really good, I like it.
