00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:01,913
<v Instructor>In this video,</v>

2
00:00:01,913 --> 00:00:04,543
we'll cover application security concepts.

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,210
So this is the basic introduction to security concepts.

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,010
We're going to focus on practical results.

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:15,960
Now the key here,

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,170
is that this is not an A to Z reference,

7
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,430
because security is a huge topic.

8
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,880
What we'll do is kind of focus on practical results

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,160
for our application.

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,520
And we'll cover the following tasks

11
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,220
related to our e-commerce project.

12
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,550
So we'll learn how to do user login, logout with security.

13
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,244
We'll provide access to a special VIP page

14
00:00:34,244 --> 00:00:36,930
only for authenticated customers.

15
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,050
And then we'll also keep track

16
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:40,130
of order history for registered customers.

17
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,845
And if so, we'll see how to build this in the context

18
00:00:42,845 --> 00:00:45,846
of application security and we'll make use of security

19
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:48,833
with Angular and also Spring Boot.

20
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,630
All right, so now let's kind of look at the problem

21
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,950
with a given application.

22
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:00,220
We need to authenticate a user for a given application.

23
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,860
We also would need to know what actions a user

24
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,750
or app is authorized to perform,

25
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,980
and then we may need to delegate permissions

26
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,793
to another application.

27
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,130
So in the modern security world,

28
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,440
there are a couple of key terms or concepts

29
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,990
that you may have heard of already.

30
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,020
So authentication, authorization,

31
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,440
OAuth 2,

32
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,860
OpenID Connect

33
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,630
and JSON Web Tokens.

34
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:27,923
And we'll discuss these topics in this video.

35
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,470
Okay, so authentication.

36
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,050
This is the process of validating

37
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:37,280
whether a user or app is who they claim to be.

38
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,740
So normally it works by giving a username

39
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,560
and password for log-ins

40
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,880
or you can give a token or a pin

41
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,980
or you can make use of like fingerprint or retina scan.

42
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,300
And so here, you know, the fingerprint actually works

43
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,310
on, you know, some of the mobile devices,

44
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,350
but, you know, I'm just trying to think of

45
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,720
some other real world examples

46
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,250
of where you can authenticate a given person

47
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,223
to validate who they say they claim to be.

48
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,100
Now, next we have authorization.

49
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,140
So authorization is the process of determining

50
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:09,320
the actions a user or app can perform.

51
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,160
And so you can commonly think of this as roles.

52
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,851
Like you could have a role for a guest user.

53
00:02:13,851 --> 00:02:16,300
So a guest user can do minimal actions,

54
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,370
maybe just read only work.

55
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,850
You may have an authorized user who can read

56
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,290
and write data in their own user account.

57
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,890
And then you may have an admin user

58
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,410
who has full access to all accounts system-wide.

59
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,190
So this is kind of like authorization,

60
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,280
what can a given user do once they log into the application

61
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,173
or what actions can they perform?
