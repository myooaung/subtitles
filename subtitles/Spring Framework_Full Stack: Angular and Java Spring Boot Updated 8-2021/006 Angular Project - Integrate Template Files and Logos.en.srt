1
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:02,520
<v Instructor>Alrighty, so moving along</v>

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,970
with our development process here.

3
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:05,770
In this video we'll focus on steps four

4
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,410
of integrating the template files into our Angular app

5
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,383
and also adding support for icons and logos.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,390
All right, so let's swing back into Visual Studio code.

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,223
And let's move down to our app component.html file.

8
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,550
So at the moment it's very basic, very plane,

9
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,423
we're going to add some information here from our template.

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,540
So I'll just take all of this

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,483
information and just delete it.

12
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,913
And I'll swing back over to that template html file.

13
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,873
Home.html.

14
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,560
And I'll start with this first section here

15
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,340
of the page wrapper and the menu side bar.

16
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,993
So let's just go ahead and copy that information.

17
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,330
Then I'll swing back into my

18
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,603
Angular component here and paste it.

19
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,700
Expand my window here for a bit,

20
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,210
so I have this div class page wrapper,

21
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:28,160
the menu side bar, and then let's just add an end div

22
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,163
at the bottom here just to keep ourselves on track.

23
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,320
And now let's also add our section here

24
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,870
for the page container header desktop.

25
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,873
Let's grab this information and copy it.

26
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,003
And then move down here and paste that information in.

27
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,193
So that's the page container header desktop.

28
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,663
And then let's add one more div here to wrap things up.

29
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:13,800
And now there's the main content section,

30
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,380
but this is where they do the copy/paste

31
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:20,300
of all the different products, more of the same.

32
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,760
We'll get into that in a bit.

33
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,343
This will actually be handled by our product list component.

34
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,960
So what we'll do is we'll just say main content

35
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,260
and we'll just give a reference

36
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,363
to our product list component.

37
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,433
So let me just copy that item.

38
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,660
Swing back over to Visual Studio code

39
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,570
and I'll paste it right here,

40
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:49,603
so just main content, just the comment itself.

41
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:58,803
And then I'll just make use of my app product list.

42
00:03:04,527 --> 00:03:06,270
And that's the same component that we created

43
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,593
a little bit earlier in the course.

44
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,230
And let me grab just a bit more information here.

45
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:21,183
Let's grab this footer section.

46
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,100
We'll copy that, we'll put it back

47
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,653
also in our Angular component.

48
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,410
I'll just say end page container.

49
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,433
Then paste.

50
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,510
All right, just a little check on here.

51
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,460
Make sure that looks okay.

52
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,020
Don't worry about the pagination stuff,

53
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,610
we'll get to that in some later videos.

54
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:48,540
But make sure you have those two end divs there on 61, 62.

55
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,660
Or somewhere thereabouts.

56
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,350
And then also I'll just format this thing

57
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,753
to kind of line everything up.

58
00:03:56,508 --> 00:03:59,860
All right, so this looks good so far as

59
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:04,133
in regards to our main app component.html.

60
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,260
And you can also see that we make reference

61
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:18,260
to our images/logo.png for our luv2shop image,

62
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,750
so that's our next step here

63
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,173
is adding support for those logos.

64
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,260
So we did the icon stuff a little earlier,

65
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,630
so right now we're really just focusing on the logo.

66
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,080
I'll make this one small change here

67
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,670
on the href, so instead of home.html

68
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,010
we'll just put a pound symbol

69
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,240
or a hash mark symbols for right now.

70
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,930
Or a hashtag.

71
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,463
We'll get into all that stuff a little bit later.

72
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,203
But right now we'll focus on this logo.png.

73
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,830
So remember, in Angular applications

74
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,970
the assets directory's a special directory

75
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:52,590
for serving up web resources.

76
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,680
Right now we have our placeholder.

77
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,990
Well go ahead and copy in assets/images/logo.pgn.

78
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:02,453
We can grab that here from that template directory.

79
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:10,963
I'll just drag and drop it over here and put it into images.

80
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,633
And so we can verify this, so assets.

81
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,423
Images.

82
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,430
And then logo.png.

83
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,973
So that's our luv2shop logo.
