00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:02.560
<v Instructor>All righty, so moving along</v>

2
00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.970
with our development process,

3
00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:05.520
in this video, we'll cover step three

4
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.270
of updating the checkout component

5
00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.253
to retrieve the months and years from the service.

6
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.690
Okay, so let's go ahead and move over here

7
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.453
to our checkout component.

8
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.760
So I'll open up our checkout.component.ts.

9
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.983
Okay, so here's our class CheckoutComponent.

10
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.500
Let's move in here

11
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.853
and let's go ahead and define some properties.

12
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.030
So I'll define an array for creditCardYears

13
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.163
and also an array for credCardMonths.

14
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.830
And then in my constructor,

15
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.410
I'll inject our form service

16
00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.623
that we created in the previous videos.

17
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.470
And remember, that's our luv2ShopFormService.

18
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.060
Okay, so that coding there looks pretty good.

19
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.070
And now let's add some code in our ngOnInit method.

20
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.363
So right near the end of this method ngOnInit.

21
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.810
I'll write some quick comments here to myself

22
00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.013
to kind of keep myself on track.

23
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.020
Okay, great, so we're going to populate the credit card months

24
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.493
and also populate the credit card years.

25
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.510
Alrighty, so we'll get the current month

26
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.180
and remember, the months are zero based,

27
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.453
so we need to add one to the value.

28
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.090
And I'll also just log this value

29
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.803
just so I can view it in the console for debugging.

30
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.908
Next, I'll make use of my luv2ShopFormService

31
00:02:39.908 --> 00:02:41.550
to get the credit card months.

32
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.107
I pass in the startMonth,

33
00:02:44.107 --> 00:02:46.023
the subscribe on this call.

34
00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.270
And when the data's returned, I'll simply log the data

35
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.773
and also assign it.

36
00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.143
And I'll say this.creditCardMonths equals data.

37
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.270
Okay, so this code looks pretty good.

38
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.080
This is for retrieving the credit card months

39
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.880
and we'll do a similar thing here for credit card years.

40
00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.739
So we call luv2ShopFormService,

41
00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.493
I getCreditCardYears.subscribe.

42
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.230
Once the data's returned, we simply log the data

43
00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.463
and also assign it accordingly.

44
00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.160
Alrighty, so this looks pretty good.

45
00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.260
So we've added the code here

46
00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.570
for getting the credit card months

47
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.900
and also getting the credit card years.

48
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:02.793
Good job!
