1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:02,710
<v Instructor>In this video, we're going to integrate</v>

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:04,353
Angular with bootstrap.

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,260
So let's make our page beautiful.

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:11,675
So currently, we have an HTML table for our sales team.

5
00:00:11,675 --> 00:00:15,245
But the table is here it works, but it's kind of ugly.

6
00:00:15,245 --> 00:00:16,078
(laughs)

7
00:00:16,078 --> 00:00:18,610
And what I like to do is I like to make it prettier,

8
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:19,970
I like to make it beautiful.

9
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:23,591
I'd like to apply bootstrap styles to this given table

10
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:25,810
to make it look really nice.

11
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:28,360
And so that's what we're going to do in this video.

12
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,700
All right , so let's go and look at our development process.

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,500
So the first thing we're going to do is get the links

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,800
for the remote bootstrap files.

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,470
And then we'll add the links to our index HTML page.

16
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,960
Next will apply the bootstrap CSS styles

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,260
and our component HTML template,

18
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,530
and then will apply the bootstrap CSS styles

19
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,937
and our component HTML table.

20
00:00:49,937 --> 00:00:52,620
And then finally, we'll update our TypeScript component file

21
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,863
to reference the bootstrap HTML template.

22
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,700
Already step one of getting the links

23
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,290
for the remote bootstrap files.

24
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,620
So all we have to do is visit the bootstrap website

25
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,950
at www.getbootstrap.com,

26
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,277
the website has instructions on how to get started

27
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:11,820
and also how to access the actual links,

28
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,570
they have a nice all template here,

29
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,463
we can copy and paste those links.

30
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,760
So in step two will add the links in our index HTML file.

31
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,944
So in the head section here,

32
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:25,310
we'll just drop in the link tag,

33
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:26,890
and then we'll give an H ref to where

34
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,920
those bootstrap files are located.

35
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,640
And then notice here for the version number,

36
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,061
I simply put in a placeholder for that version number,

37
00:01:33,061 --> 00:01:35,470
your version will most likely be different,

38
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,542
just because new versions of bootstrap are released

39
00:01:37,542 --> 00:01:39,053
on a regular basis.

40
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,507
Okay, now in Step three, we're going to apply the CSS

41
00:01:43,507 --> 00:01:46,010
and the component HTML template.

42
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,086
So in our file, app component at HTML

43
00:01:48,086 --> 00:01:51,860
will simply set up a div and set class equals container

44
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,820
that's a bootstrap CSS style.

45
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,060
And also far h1 will use class mt-three, mb-three,

46
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,500
basically margin top, margin bottom,

47
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,820
for our header for sales team.

48
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,250
And then the grey section here at the bottom right,

49
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,810
that's going to be a little placeholder

50
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,050
here for our app sales person list.

51
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,963
And we'll cover that in the next step.

52
00:02:13,542 --> 00:02:15,900
Already in step four, a planet CSS

53
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,820
and our component HTML table.

54
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,040
So here for the file, we're going to have a new file,

55
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,081
so we simply copied over our original file,

56
00:02:23,081 --> 00:02:25,930
and we renamed it with a dash bootstrap.

57
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,630
So we could have used any name for the file,

58
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,900
I simply use the same name

59
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,513
and just gave the dash bootstrap reference to it.

60
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:37,690
So for our table tag, we apply the bootstrap CSS styles.

61
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,080
Classical's table, table hover,

62
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,290
and for the T-H section,

63
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,670
we say class equals T head dark.

64
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:46,980
And in this it'll give us a nice, beautiful bootstrap table,

65
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,683
as we see here on the slide.

66
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,160
Okay, then moving to step five,

67
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,980
we need to update our TypeScript component file.

68
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,360
So here's our bootstrap component HTML

69
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,193
that we created in step four.

70
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:03,520
So I'll kind of slide this over to the right.

71
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,500
And then over on the left hand side,

72
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,750
here's our component.TSR TypeScript file.

73
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,360
So we have this template URL

74
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,880
we're simply going to reference the name of that file

75
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,770
that we just created.

76
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,810
So our dash bootstrap.component at HTML.

77
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,578
So this component will use that given template file.

78
00:03:20,578 --> 00:03:24,668
And this will give us our desired HTML output for our table

79
00:03:24,668 --> 00:03:27,898
using those bootstrap CSS styles.

80
00:03:27,898 --> 00:03:29,740
Alright, this looks great.

81
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,370
So let's go ahead and move into our IDE

82
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,853
and let's write the code.
