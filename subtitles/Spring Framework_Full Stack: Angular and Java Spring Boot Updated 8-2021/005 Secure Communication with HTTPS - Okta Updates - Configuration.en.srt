1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,820
<v ->Okay, so let's go ahead and dive in,</v>

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:03,730
and let's get started here.

3
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,110
So in our development process,

4
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:06,490
we're in cover steps one through three

5
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:08,710
of update redirect URIs

6
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:10,790
and our Anglur App Okta Dashboard,

7
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,893
and also set up a Trusted Origins in the dashboard.

8
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,880
Okay, so in our Anglur Application,

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,470
we need to update in one of our config files.

10
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,320
So I move down in the source, app,

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,170
move down to config,

12
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,743
then I open up this my-app-config.ts.

13
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:42,560
And I need to update the code here for the redirect URI.

14
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,050
So notice here they're using the regular HTTP.

15
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,920
I need to change that to use HTTPS

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,553
because our app is now running using HTTPS.

17
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,490
Okay, so now moving ahead to step two,

18
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:03,113
we need to update the redirect URIs in the Okta Dashboard.

19
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,210
Let's go ahead and pull up our browser,

20
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:11,700
and let's go ahead and login to our Okta Dashboard.

21
00:01:39,113 --> 00:01:39,946
Okay, great.

22
00:01:39,946 --> 00:01:41,520
So I'm logged in to the Okta Dashboard.

23
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,863
I go ahead and view my applications,

24
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,160
and then I can go ahead and choose one of the apps here.

25
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,680
So I moved down to my applications,

26
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,580
and in this example,

27
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,440
I'm using this Demo 5.

28
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,740
You can use whatever app that you've created

29
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,780
for your given environment.

30
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,780
So we're looking at a given application

31
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,923
and now let's go ahead and move down to the login section.

32
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,410
This is where you can see the different redirect URIs,

33
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,840
and let's kind of scroll up a bit

34
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,793
and click on the Edit button here.

35
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,230
And then back down to our login section,

36
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,373
and it'll simply update this with HTTPS,

37
00:02:47,104 --> 00:02:49,771
and then we'll Save our changes.

38
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,750
And then just verify that everything is set up accordingly

39
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,383
with the HTTPS for those redirect URIs.

40
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,570
We're almost done.

41
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:22,350
In step three, we're going to update the API Trusted Origins

42
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,913
in the Okta Dashboard.

43
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,880
So we just move to our dashboard.

44
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,130
We go to Security,

45
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,623
we choose API,

46
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,280
and then in the API screen,

47
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,973
we move over to Trusted Origins.

48
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,760
And then we moved down to our given origin

49
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,253
and we added the origin URL.

50
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,270
And again, we simply make use of the HTTPS

51
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,393
for our application.

52
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,920
Okay, so that looks pretty good.

53
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,753
I like it.

54
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:30,773
Now we can swing back over through our application,

55
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,360
get our Spring Boot App up and running.

56
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,263
If it's not already running,

57
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,080
then go ahead and start my Angular App.

58
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,363
And remember we make use the new command now, npm start,

59
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,760
that's based on an information from our package.json,

60
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,550
and our app is up and running.

61
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,850
We can go and test it out here on our browser.

62
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,340
So we go to HTTPS localhost 4200,

63
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,610
and this all looks good.

64
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,323
So we've seen this part before.

65
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,770
Now I can go login,

66
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,840
this is one of my accounts

67
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:43,363
and great.

68
00:05:43,363 --> 00:05:45,080
So we're logged in successfully.

69
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,380
It says, "Hey, welcome back Demo Darby."

70
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,960
So I know that it's pulling that information in accordingly.

71
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,170
That's great.

72
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:53,970
I can check the members special section,

73
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:56,720
and also I can check the orders in the background.

74
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,100
So this is really good.

75
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,410
So our app is up and running.

76
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:02,350
We have it running in a secure fashion using HTTPS.

77
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,590
We'll make use of our self-signed certs,

78
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:08,300
and we also updated the appropriate configs here

79
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,310
in the Okta Dashboard.

80
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,220
So this was great.

81
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,053
I liked it,

82
00:06:12,053 --> 00:06:15,053
and I'm very happy with what we've accomplished so far.
