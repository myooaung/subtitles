00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:02.280
<v Instructor>Alrighty, so we're moving along</v>

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.550
with our development process.

3
00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:04.900
In this video we'll cover step four

4
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.700
of updating the SearchComponent

5
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.533
to send data to the search route.

6
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.980
So lets go ahead and open up our files

7
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.610
search.component.ts, and we actually want to

8
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.053
copy the selector so we can use it in our main application.

9
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.573
Now lets over to our app.component.html, our main app.

10
00:00:37.957 --> 00:00:41.457
So lets move down into our page container,

11
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.203
and for the section for the Header Desktop.

12
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.520
So currently there is a section here for our form,

13
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.980
we're actually going to use our

14
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.943
SearchComponent in place of this.

15
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.580
So I'll just give me some whitespace here,

16
00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.320
and I'll drop in my selector with a paste.

17
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.780
So I have a starting end tag

18
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.653
for my selector app-search.

19
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.820
So this is our new SearchComponent

20
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.743
app-search, that we just created a little earlier.

21
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.270
So lines 25 through 30, I'll actually comment out

22
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.820
this code because I don't want to use it right now.

23
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.370
I want to just test it to make sure that my new

24
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.963
SearchComponent shows up in my application.

25
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.470
Alrighty, and if I look at my search.component.html,

26
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.720
right now it should simply say "search works!"

27
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.553
and that's fine.

28
00:01:39.553 --> 00:01:42.660
I simply want to make sure that this part of the app

29
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.810
actually works out.

30
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.790
So lets go ahead and run our application real quick

31
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.137
and test this out.

32
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.700
All right so swing over to the browser

33
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.023
and visit my application.

34
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.050
Okay this looks great, so it says "search works!"

35
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.335
So that's the information from our SearchComponent,

36
00:02:07.335 --> 00:02:10.040
so we know that the component is up and working.

37
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.990
Now we can go ahead and start with some real business here.

38
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.453
So I'll swing back over to my IDE,

39
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.780
and I'll move back over to that app.component.html.

40
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.310
So that code that I commented out, I actually want to

41
00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.040
copy that or cut it and move it to my SearchComponent.

42
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.630
So lets go ahead and select

43
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.030
this information into a cut.

44
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.523
And it will move it over to our search.component.html.

45
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.040
So I remove everything here and just drop this in,

46
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.513
remove the comments,

47
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.150
do a quick little format here in this document.

48
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.370
And now I'll make some changes.

49
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.850
So in this example, we're not using forms,

50
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.780
we'll simply make use of divs and input components.

51
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.530
We'll talk about forms later in the course,

52
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.570
but for now we'll just simply

53
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.223
take the divs and input components approach.

54
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.773
So I'll set up a div,

55
00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.373
I'll remove the part here for the onsubmit and method.

56
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.560
We'll make use of our event binding

57
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.713
in our methods that we'll call in our application.

58
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.280
Give me some extra whitespace here,

59
00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.910
so we can see things a bit better.

60
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.320
Now I'll kind of move around these attributes a bit,

61
00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.573
just so they kind of appear in normal order.

62
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.087
So I'll go ahead move in here and add a template variable,

63
00:03:37.087 --> 00:03:40.943
#myInput, the name of it so we can read that data later.

64
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.538
And I'll just move some things around.

65
00:03:46.538 --> 00:03:48.150
So text that was there,

66
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.683
drop this down on a separate line, class.

67
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.960
Get rid of the name attribute,

68
00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.210
because we don't need it.

69
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.253
And then this place holder, I'll move this right up here.

70
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.240
All right so we have the actual template

71
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.593
that's our place holder and then the class.

72
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.243
And then we'll say "search for products..."

73
00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.740
and it will also add our event binding or event handlers

74
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.220
so in the event that the user presses the Enter key,

75
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.220
then we'll call doSearch and pass in myInput.value.

76
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.170
So we use that template reference value,

77
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:42.560
we'll listen for that event,

78
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.740
and then we call the method in our Angular code.

79
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.110
And again this could be any method name.

80
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.880
And we simply pass in the text

81
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.103
that the user typed in, into that text field.

82
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.980
And we've seen all this before, right?

83
00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:57.813
Okay, good.

84
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.423
And then we'll do a similar thing here for our button.

85
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.133
So we remove the type portion of it,

86
00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.750
and we add our event binding here.

87
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.000
So on click event we'll call it doSearch

88
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.490
and again just a little copy paste here,

89
00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.873
doSearch of myInput.value.

90
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.330
And that takes care of the search button here,

91
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.093
for this given application.

92
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.860
Okay, so moving in here, lets go ahead and

93
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.463
add the supporting code for the Search button.

94
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.780
So I need to move into the code here

95
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.173
for my search.component.ts.

96
00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:58.410
So the first thing we need to do

97
00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.723
is inject the router into our component.

98
00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:11.490
And then we'll add that method

99
00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.363
that's called by the actually html page.

100
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.150
So the method name is doSearch.

101
00:06:19.125 --> 00:06:21.600
They're going to pass in a string,

102
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.180
so that's the actual value,

103
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.203
or the key word that the user entered.

104
00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:30.700
And then the code here will simply

105
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.920
be console.log on that value

106
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.330
just so we can look at it for debugging purposes

107
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.163
if we need it.

108
00:06:49.859 --> 00:06:54.859
And now I'll use this.router.navigateByURl/search/${value}.

109
00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:01.430
All right so zooming in here.

110
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:03.830
So we're actually going to call that route search

111
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:05.470
with the given key word.

112
00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:08.060
So we're going to pin that to this given URL.

113
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.630
So we're routing the data to our search route.

114
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.920
It's going to be handled by the ProductListComponent.

115
00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.210
And again, you're probably wondering why

116
00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:16.310
ProductListComponent?

117
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.230
We simply want to reuse

118
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.360
the logic and view for listing products.

119
00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.980
So we've already done that work before,

120
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.980
there's no reason to reinvent the wheel.
