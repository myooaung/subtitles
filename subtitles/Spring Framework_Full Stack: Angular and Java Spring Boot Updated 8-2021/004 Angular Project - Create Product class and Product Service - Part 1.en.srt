1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:02,540
<v Instructor>Alrighty so let's go ahead and continue</v>

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,850
with our development process so we'll focus on step three

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,890
of developing a TypeScript class for our product and also

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,470
step four of creating the Angular service to call

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,853
the REST APIs.

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,770
Alrighty so let's go ahead and move in here and develop

7
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,793
the TypeScript class for a product.

8
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,541
So down in my terminal window I'll make use

9
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:26,741
of the Angular CLI to help me out with this.

10
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,903
Here I'll just type ng generate class common/product.

11
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,950
So it'll place this into the common subdirectory and we'll

12
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,560
have this file product.ts and remember it's a very basic

13
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,730
class nothing's there we need to add our properties

14
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:53,870
to this class.

15
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,620
So let me just zoom in here and I'll list out all

16
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:00,460
of the property names here along with their types

17
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,440
and this matches with the actual JSON data that's passed

18
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,130
back from the string boot service.

19
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,290
So I'll just do a little copy paste here on this line

20
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:09,613
x number of times.

21
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,285
Alrighty so this looks pretty good, so this is our

22
00:02:01,285 --> 00:02:04,550
TypeScript class for our product and again it matches

23
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:07,200
on the actual properties from the actual JSON data

24
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,843
coming back from that string data rest API.

25
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,640
And now we can move to step four of creating the Angular

26
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,690
service and I'll use the Angular CLI again

27
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,490
to create this service.

28
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:28,490
So ng generate service and I'll give services/product.

29
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,930
So to place the service in the services directory

30
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,500
and the name of the service is product.service.

31
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,120
So let's go ahead and take a look here, services

32
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,625
product.service.ts.

33
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,780
So there's some actual TypeScript code here for my service.

34
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,330
So before I go any further I need to make some updates

35
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:54,060
to my application module, so let's move over

36
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,053
to app.module.ts.

37
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:09,350
In the import section we need to import the module

38
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:12,310
for http client module.

39
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:15,663
That's the module that contains the http client.

40
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,440
And also we have to give the appropriate import up top

41
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,500
for this and so we need to manually type this out

42
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,263
because TypeScript won't be able to find that solution.

43
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,230
So this is part of the Angular framework

44
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:45,383
so @angular/common/http.

45
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,480
And also in the provider section we need to add

46
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,100
a reference to our product service this will allow us

47
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,853
to inject that given service into other parts

48
00:04:03,853 --> 00:04:04,743
of our application.

49
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,970
Alrighty so this takes care of the work for updating

50
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,433
our application module.
