00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:02.550
<v Instructor>All righty, so we're almost done.</v>

2
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.830
In our final step here, we're going to update the HTML template

3
00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.713
to display the error messages.

4
00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:20.582
All righty, so let's go ahead

5
00:00:20.582 --> 00:00:23.343
and open up our checkout.component.html file.

6
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.350
I'll move down here to the firstName section

7
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.670
and around the areas of our ngIf that we had before,

8
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.250
so this is the coding we had before

9
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.750
for displaying error messages,

10
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:52.670
and so now say

11
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.403
or firstName.errors.notOnlyWhiteSpace.

12
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.870
So that notOnlyWhiteSpace,

13
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.253
that's a reference to our custom validation error key,

14
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.143
and we had that in the previous code that we created,

15
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.400
and remember, the key could be any name.

16
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.720
It doesn't have to match the method name.

17
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.830
However, I'm staying consistent here

18
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.490
because this is the same convention

19
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.863
that's used by the Angular validation development team.

20
00:01:31.635 --> 00:01:33.910
All righty, so this looks pretty good here.

21
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.370
Let's go ahead and test this out,

22
00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.270
so I'll open up a new Terminal window.

23
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.450
And again, before I start this,

24
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.250
make sure my SpringBoot app is up and running.

25
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.143
If not, go ahead and start it now.

26
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.360
All righty, so I can go ahead and start my Angular app.

27
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.010
And just swinging over here to my browser,

28
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.750
I'll just add some products here to my cart,

29
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.033
move down to the checkout page,

30
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.880
and up top, so we have First Name, Last Name, Email,

31
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.470
let's moved down here and hit Purchase,

32
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.000
and we have the fields are required.

33
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.833
That's good.

34
00:02:40.833 --> 00:02:43.320
Now let's try white space, only white space,

35
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.860
and notice here our error messages still showing up.

36
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.200
That's great, so it works fine for First Name,

37
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.960
but it doesn't work yet for Last Name

38
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.710
because we haven't added the code, but no problem.

39
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.610
We know what we have to do here.

40
00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.300
We have it up and running here with First Name,

41
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.820
so we'll simply update our code

42
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.090
to also work for Last Name and so on.

43
00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.340
All right, but at least we know

44
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.420
it works for First Name right now,

45
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.140
so our not only whitespace is in play, and it's working.

46
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.670
Cool, so that's good,

47
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.730
so let's do a similar thing here for Last Name,

48
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.433
so I'll move back into my checkout.component.ts,

49
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.280
and I'll do something very similar,

50
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.650
so whatever I did for firstName here, let's just copy it,

51
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.303
and let's just put it here for lastName.

52
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.883
Okay. Great.

53
00:03:34.883 --> 00:03:37.133
Luv2ShopValidators.notOnlyWhiteSpace,

54
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.773
and again, I'll just kind of clean up the layout here

55
00:03:40.773 --> 00:03:42.440
just so I can see everything on one screen

56
00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.883
without having to scroll left or right.

57
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.610
All right, so that's the coding in place there for lastName.

58
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.430
That's good, so we've applied it to that control.

59
00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.930
Then I also need to swing over to the template

60
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.450
and add the coding there for the template,

61
00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.693
so checkout.component.html,

62
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.713
and just move down to the lastName section.

63
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.663
lastName.errors.notOnlyWhiteSpace.

64
00:04:33.871 --> 00:04:34.900
All right, so that's it.

65
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.920
That's really all the work you had to do

66
00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.230
for adding that feature there for lastName.

67
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:40.263
Cool. I like it.

68
00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.080
So let's swing back into our browser,

69
00:04:50.095 --> 00:04:51.900
and then just do only white space.

70
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.000
That's good, and only white space for Last Name.

71
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.910
That's good.

72
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:55.743
Great, great,

73
00:04:55.743 --> 00:04:58.440
so we've taken care of adding in our custom validator rule

74
00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.153
to get rid of that all white space issue,

75
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.730
and then, for Email, that's already in play.

76
00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.320
There's nothing special we have to do for Email

77
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.580
because our regular expression

78
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.970
will handle that for us automatically,

79
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.980
so the regex comes to save the day here,

80
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.560
so that's pretty cool.

81
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.880
All right, so we're in good shape here.

82
00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.580
We have the customer up and running,

83
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.170
and our validation's in place

84
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.967
along with our custom validations.

85
00:05:24.967 --> 00:05:25.933
Good job.
