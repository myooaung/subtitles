1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:02,640
<v Instructor>Alrighty, so for step three,</v>

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,010
we're going to update the HTML template

3
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:05,300
to display the error messages

4
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,283
for our billingAddress section.

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,060
And you all pretty much know the drill, right?

6
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:17,660
It's just more of kind of copy paste.

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,730
So feel free to move ahead and do the work on your own.

8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,630
Or you can follow along with me here in the video,

9
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:24,463
totally up to you,

10
00:00:24,463 --> 00:00:26,570
but you've already been through the process once.

11
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,443
It's just more of the same.

12
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,490
So I'll just move up shippingAddress

13
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,540
and I'll just copy this section here

14
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,200
for shippingAddressCountry.

15
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,810
I'm done in the billingAddress section.

16
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:51,260
I'll add it here for country.

17
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,630
And I'll make the appropriate updates.

18
00:01:20,889 --> 00:01:22,570
And let me just run a quick test on this,

19
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:23,498
just to make sure

20
00:01:23,498 --> 00:01:26,930
the billingAddressCountry validation works.

21
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,650
So we added it for this one item here.

22
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,943
Just want to check for country right now.

23
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,873
Swing down here to our purchase.

24
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,690
Swing up to my billingAddress section

25
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,230
and country is required, so cool.

26
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,770
So we know that part works.

27
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,360
Now, we're just going to just repeat the process

28
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,710
for all the other fields here for this section.

29
00:02:07,115 --> 00:02:08,739
So I'll just make the appropriate updates here

30
00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:10,822
for billingAddressStreet.

31
00:02:58,683 --> 00:03:01,433
I'll just move down here to City.

32
00:03:05,851 --> 00:03:10,184
Make the appropriate updates for billingAddressCity.

33
00:03:40,023 --> 00:03:42,570
I'll just move down here to Zip Code

34
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,680
and then make the appropriate updates here

35
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,977
for billingAddressZipCode.

36
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,803
And then we're almost done here.

37
00:04:26,803 --> 00:04:28,743
I'll just moved down here to State.

38
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:38,860
And I'll make the updates here for billingAddressState.

39
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,720
Alrighty, so this coding here looks pretty good.

40
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,590
I'm happy with what we have in place so far.

41
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,053
So good job my friend.
