00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.300
Hello and welcome to this new tutorial.

2
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.250
All right so we actually made a good step yesterday by getting separately the questions and answers

3
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:15.030
because basically now we're ready to proceed to the cleaning process where we clean all the text of

4
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.650
the questions and answers.

5
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.020
And by that I mean that first we're going to put everything in lowercase.

6
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.660
Then we're going to remove all the apostrophes so that for example that is the same as that is when

7
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.920
the child is trained.

8
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.790
And then we'll do some more cleaning by removing the non important words.

9
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.820
But that will be later on today we're going to make a function that we're going to call clean text and

10
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.270
that will be applied on a text like a specific question or specific answer and that will do multiple

11
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.590
cleaning at the same time.

12
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.020
So we're just going to make that function today and then in the next tutorials who will apply this function

13
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.130
on the questions all the questions and all the answers.

14
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.750
So here we go.

15
00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:03.170
Let's make this function to make a function in python we need to start with Def that's defined then

16
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.120
we need to give a name to that function.

17
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:13.720
We're going to call it clean text and this function is going to take only one argument which is going

18
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.000
to be text.

19
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.500
So I'm just giving a name to this argument but later on when we apply this function to the questions

20
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.710
and answers this text will be well either questions or answers.

21
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.050
All right so there we go.

22
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.810
We are ready to start defining what this function has to do.

23
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.250
And so as I said at the beginning of the Statoil the first thing this function is going to do is put

24
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.350
all the text in lowercase that will simplify things a lot already.

25
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:51.370
And so I'm going to take my text because we are taking the text as input and we're going to modify it

26
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.530
several times.

27
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.900
So I'm doing my text that's my text.

28
00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:02.080
Now I'm going to take my previous text that is the argument text and I'm going to add that lower and

29
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.030
parenthesis.

30
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.790
This is a trick to put all the characters of the text in lowercase and that's it.

31
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.490
We're ready to move on to the next cleaning step.

32
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.190
So the next cleaning steps are going to be about removing the apostrophe's mainly So same we're going

33
00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:25.910
to take our text this will be our new text after this new cleaning step and this will be cool too.

34
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:33.820
Well that's now we're going to use the our library that we imported and that will do some replacements

35
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.680
which for example will remove the apostrophe's.

36
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.950
All right.

37
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:46.210
So text we take our our library then we had dirt and then we're going to use the sub function which

38
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.970
will do the replacement we want.

39
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.110
So we start here with our.

40
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.490
Then after that we need to put what we want to replace in double quotes.

41
00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:04.960
And so let's start by replacing I apostrophe and I'm I put lowercase is of course because we already

42
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.420
apply the lower function.

43
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.040
And so we're going to replace them by and that's our second argument.

44
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.820
End quote.

45
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.290
We're going to replace that by.

46
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.370
I am.

47
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.960
This will be much more simple for the chat.

48
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:27.010
But during the training and then the third argument is of course in which text we have to replace that

49
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.190
and that of course our text the previous version of the text that is this one here.

50
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.380
This is the new one to replace the I'm by the I am OK and now it's going to be very easy.

51
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.540
I'm just going to copy this because we're going to make some other replacements.

52
00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.750
Are going to be the same in terms of syntax.

53
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.500
So pasting the here and now what we're going to replace He's And she's.

54
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.600
So we're going to replace the he's by he is and the she's by she is.

55
00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:56.840
So let's do it.

56
00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.280
I'm going to remove this.

57
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.150
And here he is.

58
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.930
And we're going to replace that by.

59
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.190
He is.

60
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:13.200
All right then let's copy this again because I'm just going to do this she's now.

61
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.470
So she's.

62
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:16.710
She is.

63
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:17.970
OK perfect.

64
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.670
Now let's see.

65
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.890
There is a lot of that and that we can replace by that is.

66
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.510
So let's take care of that.

67
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:33.420
That's we're going to replace that by that is OK.

68
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.120
Continue.

69
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:36.050
So you see this period.

70
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:42.090
You can actually add your own replacements after this tutorial if you think I missed something.

71
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.950
So he is now what.

72
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:44.900
What's.

73
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.020
You know there is a lot of what's in question.

74
00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.140
What's the problem.

75
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:53.620
What's And we're going to replace that by what is.

76
00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:01.180
OK now let's take that again because I'm going to remake the same kind of replacement with where's.

77
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:02.120
OK.

78
00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.500
So where's And I'm going to replace that by where it's all right then.

79
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.780
New kinds of replacement.

80
00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:15.810
Now I'm going to replace all the apostrophe l l by space will.

81
00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:22.640
So to get the apostrophe and not to confuse it with the python apostrophe syntax I need to use a backslash

82
00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:23.250
here.

83
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:34.760
So backslash apostrophe and L L and that I will replace it by be careful space will because he'll go

84
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.000
will be replaced by he space will go OK.

85
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:46.970
So then copy that because I'm going to make some same kind of replacement for example with the I've

86
00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:55.550
got which I will replace by space have then same for your for example.

87
00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.920
So apostrophe R E that I will replace by.

88
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.190
You are.

89
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:06.810
So space are OK then anything that has to do with the word I'd go there.

90
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:07.910
I would go there.

91
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.190
So I replace the apostrophe d by space word

92
00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:22.220
we can replace the won't and now we need to remove the backslash because we don't need anymore.

93
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.220
Won't that will replace by will not.

94
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.940
But be careful to remove the space.

95
00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:37.330
Well not then I'm actually going to copy this and pasted below because now I'm going to replace some

96
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.770
kind of the same thing.

97
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.220
Can't buy

98
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.190
cannot.

99
00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:50.240
All right and then I'm going to make a last replacement which will actually be removal.

100
00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.520
I'm going to replace all the non-necessary symbols.

101
00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:59.580
You'll see what they are and actually again feel free to remove even more than what I'm removing.

102
00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:07.410
So since it's a removal this time I'm going to replace what I want to remove by nothing as we did previously

103
00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:08.020
for.

104
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:09.960
Remember this part.

105
00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:17.520
And so now I'm going to put in double quotes again but in a list that I put in square brackets lists

106
00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:21.480
are always in square brackets and dictionaries and brackets.

107
00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:23.880
I'm going to put all these symbols that I want to remove.

108
00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.830
That is that I want to replace my nothing.

109
00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:34.140
OK so this can be for example minus parenthesis double quotes that I have to put after backslash not

110
00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.560
to confuse it with the python double quotes.

111
00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:50.090
Then there is slash at semicolon Kollin below over bracket the two brackets plus equals the till the

112
00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.020
the bar.

113
00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:57.970
What else does question mark comma.

114
00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:03.090
And that's it you can add some more if you want but you have to put them in that list.

115
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:07.800
I think this will be already a good cleaning process and we're done.

116
00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.300
We are actually done with this function.

117
00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:19.050
And at the end we of course need to return the text that is now CLEET perfect.

118
00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:23.570
So the function is ready I will improve it if necessary.

119
00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:25.630
But I will not make it new to sorry for that.

120
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:30.670
I will just improve direct on the code that I will share with you at the end of this adventure.

121
00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:35.270
So don't be surprised if you see more cleaning steps in that function.

122
00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:41.590
All right so that's it for this Statoil in the next one we will apply this function to our questions

123
00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:48.450
and our answers so that we clean everything in the Cornell movie Diala corpus and then we'll move on

124
00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:55.200
to the next steps which will be to remove the important words so that our chat but doesn't get overwhelmed

125
00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.490
in the train.

126
00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:58.480
All right so I'll see you in the next tutorial.

127
00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:00.370
And until then Id been LP.
