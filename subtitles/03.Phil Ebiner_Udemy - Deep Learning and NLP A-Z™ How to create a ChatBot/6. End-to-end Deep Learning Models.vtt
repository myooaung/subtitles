00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.740
Hello and welcome back to the course on deep natural language processing.

2
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.860
And today we're going to look at end to end deep learning models.

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:15.870
And the reason why we're delving into this area is it will help us understand why sequence to sequence

4
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.770
models are actually so good because sequences sequence bottles are a type of end to end.

5
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.930
Mullins.

6
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.310
So let's have a look.

7
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.340
So here we have our diagram on the right but natural language processing deep learning deep national

8
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.660
I was crossing and the sequence sequence in the middle.

9
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.720
Then we're going to look at the specific examples specific use case of natural language processing.

10
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:52.830
Let's say this is us and we want to contact a customer support center of the company that we have for

11
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.470
a product or service from.

12
00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.870
For example let's say we have a mobile phone and somethings are working we don't have enough Internet

13
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:10.680
on our phone or they sent us a excessively high bill or we want to find out of some promotion about

14
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.790
roaming overseas because we're about to travel as what we normally do is we call them up and we talk

15
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.660
to the customer support Representer like we can see here because it was more representative our users

16
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:31.140
their mind to come up to assess our problem and come up with a solution and more often than not they

17
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.210
can solve our problem.

18
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.640
Of course sometimes we're frustrated because there is no solution to our problem or we didn't get the

19
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:46.020
answer that we wanted or the the charges on the bill are actually valid and so on but that's not the

20
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.610
problem that we look at here.

21
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.710
The problem is we're looking here is the problem of communication and that's this part did we get our

22
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.630
message across.

23
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.560
Did they understand the message.

24
00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:03.980
Did they apply some sort of model in this case the brain model to come up with a solution to help us.

25
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.410
This is what we were.

26
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:14.400
And so in this case this none of this is anywhere in this diagram.

27
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.940
This whole concept that this whole concept is actually way outside the law.

28
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.500
Because it's a human being a human being over the phone there's no natural language processing there

29
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.840
is probably here in the brain.

30
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.420
But that's not what we're concerned with.

31
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.580
We can construct the brain.

32
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.520
We're here to construct machine learning deep learning a chat bot and so on.

33
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.250
So in this case we're way out of the dugout as you can see the result is correct.

34
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.620
Mission accomplished.

35
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.910
Ok then what happens.

36
00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.190
What happened in history.

37
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:53.670
So it's like a little excursion to history so you can sit back and relax and grab a cup of coffee or

38
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.700
tea or whatever you're drinking and enjoy.

39
00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:05.460
So what happened after that after that companies started being smart started cutting costs and replacing

40
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:13.440
and increasing efficiency to be fair and replacing their support representatives with automated systems.

41
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.540
And we've all been through this when you call up and all of a sudden instead of Verrett company and

42
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:28.710
all of a sudden instead of a person on the other side you hear this voice which is like a human but

43
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:36.270
a prerecorded voice saying hello welcome to this company and the exquisite company.

44
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:45.300
And please please listen to the following options carefully as the options may have changed for our

45
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:53.730
sales department press one for our marketing or for our customer support press 2 for billing.

46
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.340
Press 3 to check your account balance press.

47
00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.050
And for all other questions.

48
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:04.620
Press 5 something that so help I hope I get out that quite well.

49
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:12.840
So we would use the dial that we will have to use a dial pad to come to tell this system where we want

50
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.500
to go.

51
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.080
And this might sound familiar.

52
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:23.280
From what we discussed previously this is one of those risk Stichel if else if this and that is that

53
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:30.180
in this type of algorithms where you keep pressing the buttons and sometimes you get somewhere if yours.

54
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.600
If your queries are quite easy you want to check your account balance.

55
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.850
You press the buttons and gets you there but a lot of the time we have very specific queries in mind

56
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.880
that don't get sold through a decision tree or a flow chart like that.

57
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.360
And what happens is well actually let's first of all place it on the map.

58
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.850
So on our map this is a natural language processing room.

59
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.920
As you can see for deep learning here.

60
00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.860
And basically what happens in these cases we've all been there.

61
00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:04.930
We get really frustrated and nothing happens because not it's not it's not that's you know we're frustrated

62
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:10.090
because the bill is too high and it is truly like that or because they don't have a roaming option.

63
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.370
We're frustrated because of the communication issue.

64
00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.670
That's the part that's frustrating we cannot get our point across this thing does not understand us.

65
00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.240
And again I'm sure we've all had experiences like that.

66
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.930
So what happened next well or what's happening now.

67
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.370
We're actually getting very close to the present.

68
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.380
What's happening now is again same situation.

69
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.550
Don't have a person on the phone.

70
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:43.550
But now all of a sudden we can talk to the lady or or the the man on the other side the robot voice.

71
00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:44.920
And how does that happen.

72
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:52.920
Well we call them they say hey welcome to Company X Y and Zed please tell me what you're calling about.

73
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.080
Have you had that in your life have you had a situation like that.

74
00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.750
I've definitely had a couple of those where you call up and ask you to actually tell them in your human

75
00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:06.160
voice what they're talking about more what you're calling up about.

76
00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:08.520
And why is this possible.

77
00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.620
Well this could be possible for a couple of reasons.

78
00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:20.740
So I'm going to put a brain here I'm going to go that like her quote Don't go all the way and put the

79
00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:21.640
brain here.

80
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:23.360
It could be possible.

81
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:29.530
Judy remember we talked about natural language processing but with way audio waveforms it could be done

82
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:35.200
through audio waveforms say like they could analyze the audio waveforms and then understand what you're

83
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.540
saying.

84
00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:40.930
But I'm going to go the extra mile and just going to put the brain here because some company is already

85
00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:48.980
going on how I hope that some companies are going into this new way of voice recognition.

86
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:56.920
And in this case the voice recognition is with deep learning so it's using deep learning to understand

87
00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:57.790
what you're saying.

88
00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:02.950
To understand your query and that's great.

89
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:05.480
That's a step forward as a step in the right direction.

90
00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:11.680
But the problem is we're still sitting here on the border where we're sitting on the border because

91
00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:20.110
even though it allows you to say things in a human voice and of using down pat it still passes your

92
00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:28.100
result into the flowchart into his decision tree and is like pretty much the same thing as you would

93
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:32.830
use a dial pad except for sometimes it doesn't recognize you well especially if they're not using people

94
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:41.860
or if using like one of those frequency dissection or analysis algorithms from just an LP side of things

95
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:45.550
then this is going to be terrible because they're going to get the wrong thing in the first place and

96
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:46.690
then they'll pass the wrong thing on here.

97
00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:51.950
But if they're even getting the right thing so passing on to a decision tree and it's very limited in

98
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:57.270
the options that it has just the predefined options that they've thought about that list of things.

99
00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:02.350
And so results again frustration that communication did not go through.

100
00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:06.070
But as you can see we're making our way into the right direction.

101
00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:11.670
Next one is what happened next.

102
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:17.470
Oh by the way like after this you may have noticed like I've noticed companies that went down this path

103
00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:23.500
and they got even more frustrated customers than in the previous one where they had where they had the

104
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:24.230
dial pad.

105
00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:26.480
And so they reverted back to the top Pat.

106
00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:28.330
So it was really interesting.

107
00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:33.020
I like one time I called up my mobile phone provider and said I'm a dial pad.

108
00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.190
They were like Please tell me what you're calling about.

109
00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:40.330
And this was the experience was even worse and then a couple months later I called them up again.

110
00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:44.440
Or you know maybe I was part of a pilot or something like that.

111
00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:49.410
So some companies like see this even as even a more of a challenge.

112
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:57.670
And of course you're you're going into the more advanced areas of computer science the more advanced

113
00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:01.920
areas of natural language processing is going to be challenging anyway.

114
00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:09.960
So what happened after that or what is happening now is now again we can talk with.

115
00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:18.300
Again it depends on the company the region and all like the service I guess that you're using.

116
00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.480
But they are they are.

117
00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:27.310
I hope they are advanced companies where you can you can talk and what they use in the background is

118
00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:32.680
deep learning algorithm as before but this time is different this time.

119
00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:39.980
They also use a deep learning algorithm to analyze your like what he's actually saying.

120
00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:46.150
So there's a deep learning algorithm trained to analyze your solid forms that you're making with your

121
00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:48.760
vocal chords.

122
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.780
And then there's another deep learning algorithm that is trained to take that information.

123
00:09:53.780 --> 00:10:02.060
Let's let's say it's in text form is like can become or text or something or a machine it and it's this

124
00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:05.890
algorithm is trained to understand the meaning.

125
00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:14.030
So this algorithm just transcribes basically transcribes your voice your audio that you're producing

126
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:15.070
into words.

127
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:21.800
And then this algorithm takes the words understands the meaning and searches for that answer that you're

128
00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:28.320
looking for applies to that or the actual call to the right the right person and so on basically trust

129
00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:29.270
every person.

130
00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:33.480
So now we're fully in the deep natural language processing.

131
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:40.180
And with this is the part where we are about to celebrate everything's amazing.

132
00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:46.280
But what we get is again we get frustration.

133
00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.450
How does that happen.

134
00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:50.530
How come I guess it didn't work out.

135
00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.010
And this is the key to where we're going.

136
00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.830
This is the key is always being on the screen.

137
00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:59.920
Up here my friends at the top and two and people are the models.

138
00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:06.410
The problem with this approach is that you have two separate deportee models and there's a very simplistic

139
00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:12.980
example there can be other applications of deep learning natural deep natural language processing where

140
00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:17.510
you can have not just two steps of declaring but you get a three four or five five different steps and

141
00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:23.430
each one could be converted into a deep learning model just because deploring our style.

142
00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:30.820
But the problem is if we problem occurs if we keep them separate as separate people or algorithms the

143
00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:35.050
thing there is that this one goes through training on its own.

144
00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:41.960
This one goes to training on its own and there therefore there is an Miskin is it doesn't flow it's

145
00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:45.450
not like one algorithm that is taking care of the whole thing.

146
00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:51.560
Understanding what you are saying finding in transcribing it finding the meaning of what you're saying.

147
00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:58.310
Like not not even just like transcribing but finding them is like taking your words processing them

148
00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.730
internally finding the meaning and coming up the answer.

149
00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:07.670
So as soon as you have like two or more because their training happens separately you will run into

150
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:14.180
problems not necessarily all the time but a lot of cases have been reported or as many cases have been

151
00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:14.940
recorded.

152
00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:23.620
All of this reported of this happening that because the data cloning algorithms are separate you run

153
00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:30.200
traumas think of it like the best way is to imagine it because we're talking about intuition here.

154
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:35.420
And is this like is hard to come up with concrete like a concrete.

155
00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:41.270
This is why it went wrong in it because I guess the best way to think about it is like imagine two humans

156
00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:47.180
like what a human is try is transcribing what what has been said the other human is searching for that

157
00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:47.980
answer.

158
00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:52.900
Like taking that to understanding the meaning search for that and it becomes one of those cases like

159
00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:59.150
you know the game where you have to come up to the next person in like in front of you and whisper into

160
00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:01.220
their ear what you heard from the person behind.

161
00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:03.930
And you do that a couple of times and meaning is lost.

162
00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:05.720
Similar thing here.

163
00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:12.320
Again it's it's a very it's a far fetched example but that's kind of the concept because they've been

164
00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.400
trained separately.

165
00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:14.960
This one is very good at what it does.

166
00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:23.370
This was very good at what it does but to get its act together it's not very good at what it does overall.

167
00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:26.410
So that's the best way I can describe it.

168
00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:32.600
So basically that's why we need to and deeper meaning so that one brain is taking care of the whole

169
00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:39.400
thing and that is the next stage the next step or some might say the final step.

170
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:46.000
Final Frontier that we have to look at and it would look something like this.

171
00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.750
Talk there is a brain and there's an answer.

172
00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:55.710
So we as very similar to that part where we had the human the human we hear and the human brain we the

173
00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:57.610
answer similar.

174
00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:59.070
We're getting there slowly.

175
00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:07.520
And the reason why this is so cool is because this is part of this deeper encircled is this part called

176
00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:10.690
that and to and deep learning models.

177
00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:16.320
And that's where we're putting our model and notice it's not necessarily in sequence sequences specific

178
00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:20.270
group like purposefully put it somewhere between because it could be a sequence sequence could be some

179
00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:21.080
other model.

180
00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:28.460
Those people are the models part is quite vague it's not it's not very defined it's not like an area

181
00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:32.410
that you can say these are and 10 people are like this.

182
00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:34.260
They're characterized by this this and this.

183
00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:40.470
It's just a way of somebody saying that look my people are immortal actually.

184
00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:44.520
It's just one neural network that takes care of the whole thing.

185
00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:49.950
I've built a neural network stars to finish or more or less from start to finish.

186
00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:56.860
And therefore it's kind of just a is a term that's used quite loosely to express that.

187
00:14:56.870 --> 00:15:01.110
But that's the concept that there's one neural network running the whole show.

188
00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:08.860
And if you have something like that then you have more chances of it being successful and delivering

189
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:10.780
great customer experience.

190
00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:14.760
In this case and other cases of course other applications.

191
00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:19.630
So there we go that's what and to anti-cloning models are and as you can see sequence to sequence luckily

192
00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:25.140
is an end to anti-cloning model and that's what we're going to explore further down in this.

193
00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:27.120
And I look forward to seeing you next time.

194
00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:29.230
Until then happy analyzing.
