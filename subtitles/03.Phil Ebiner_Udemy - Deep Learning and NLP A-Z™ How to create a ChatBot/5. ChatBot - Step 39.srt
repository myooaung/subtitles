1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:05,310
All right let's set up the chat between us and the Chatswood.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,010
So we're going to start with a while.

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:17,250
True which will set the interaction between the jabat and us until we apply the break.

4
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:25,330
So we're going to start by getting the question we'll be asking to our chat and this question will get

5
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:33,010
it by using the input function which will take as inputs what we want to enter in the console when we

6
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:40,420
ask a question to the Shadbolt and therefore I'm adding quote here you which will be you yourself with

7
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:44,350
a colon and a space to separate you and your question.

8
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,780
All right so that's the first step.

9
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:53,140
We get the question then we're directly going to make that break to stop the interaction when we want

10
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:53,500
to.

11
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:59,440
And we are going to start the interaction when we say goodbye to Richard but that is when our question

12
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:10,260
is goodbye and therefore I'm going to say now that if our question is equally equal to Goodbye like

13
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:10,850
that.

14
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:17,900
Well in that case we are going to break and this will stop this while loop.

15
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,460
All right then now that we take care of this we are going to take care of the real conversation between

16
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,500
the jackboot and us.

17
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,780
So the first thing we need to do is now that we got our question that we're entering the console we're

18
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:36,870
going to do all the process of getting the question in the right format so that it can go into the neural

19
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:43,380
network and so that we can get the predicted answer and therefore the first thing we need to do is well

20
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:53,180
first update our question this way by using the convert string to and function that takes as we define

21
00:01:53,190 --> 00:02:00,760
here the question and the questions word to the dictionary.

22
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:01,310
All right.

23
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,630
That will convert the string of that question into the list of encoding integers.

24
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,340
Great.

25
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,220
So that's the first thing we must do then we need to apply the padding.

26
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:18,360
We need to make sure that this question has the same length as the questions that were used for the

27
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:24,330
training and the questions that were used for the training remember have a length of 20 and therefore

28
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:31,170
now we must complete the length of that question with enough tokens and more precisely PetroChina IDs

29
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,250
so that this question has an length of 20.

30
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:43,320
And to do this we'll first thing the question and updated this way by taking it again and then adding

31
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:43,800
since.

32
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,930
Now our question is illis we're going to do a list addition.

33
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,200
We're going to add to our question list the following list.

34
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:56,740
That is the list of the pet tokens that need to be added so that our question has a length of.

35
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,690
And to give this you know the trick.

36
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:08,940
We first take our questions words to the dictionary to get the unique integer encoding the token.

37
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:17,150
And therefore here are mentoring the key which is the bad token and then we are going to multiply this

38
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:24,570
list by the difference of 20 and the length of our question.

39
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:30,980
And that will complete it exactly by the number of better ideas that will make the question have a length

40
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,120
of 20.

41
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:37,230
All right then next step now that we have the single question in the right format.

42
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:43,160
Well remember the essential thing we need to do when working with neural networks it's the fact that

43
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:50,930
this question must be into a batch the neural networks only accept batches of inputs they only accept

44
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:57,560
input batches and since now this question is by itself we need to put it into a batch and we're actually

45
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:03,140
going to create a fake batch which will contain this question and then some empty questions that will

46
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,070
only get zeros.

47
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:13,940
And that's why now I'm introducing this fake batch variable that I'm going to initialize as a number

48
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:20,750
array of zeros and then zeros function we need to specify the dimensions of this vague batch and that's

49
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,260
the only argument that has to be a couple of two elements.

50
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,610
These two elements being the number of lines of this array and the number of columns of this array.

51
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:36,860
So the number of lines is going to be of course the batch size because each line corresponds to a question

52
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,770
and the number of columns is going to be.

53
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:47,270
Well of course 20 because our new one was trained with questions of length 20 you can actually change

54
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,820
that if you want.

55
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:55,430
All right so that initializes this big batch but then now we need to include our question in this fake

56
00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:04,030
batch and to do this we will simply include it in the first row of this fake batch and therefore I'm

57
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:10,580
setting this first row this big batch of index 0 to be called to that question.

58
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:17,980
And now that we have our batch of input in the right format Well we're ready to feed that into the new

59
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:27,170
network to get the predicted answer the chat but that is the output of the neural network and this predictive

60
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:30,330
answer to get it we're going to use our session.

61
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:40,110
Then the run method which will take two arguments the first one is our test predictions variable that

62
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:46,770
we made in part to building the second PSEC model and then remember the second argument is a dictionary

63
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,870
of two sets of keys and values.

64
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:58,940
The first one is the inputs which are of course our batch of inputs which we called fake that and then

65
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:07,700
keep probability that remember we set it equal to 0.5 50 percent.

66
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,650
All right so that's exactly we'll return a list of several elements.

67
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,880
And the one that we're interested in that is the predicted answer is actually the first element of that

68
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,940
list and therefore we need to add here some square brackets and then inside the index 0 to get that

69
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,260
first element.

70
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:24,670
All right.

71
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,250
Perfect.

72
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:32,570
And now now that we get the predicted answer Well we are ready to prepare the output will get in the

73
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:39,650
council so we could directly get this predicted answer but we need to post precess it if I may say you

74
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:45,260
know we have to predict the answer but we must turn it into a clean format meaning that will replace

75
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:49,840
for example all the lower case i buy capital eyes.

76
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,260
You know when the Chulbul is saying for example I am I am not I do not.

77
00:06:54,260 --> 00:07:01,160
Wherever we will also replace all the US tokens by Dud's because that corresponds to the end of a sentence

78
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,970
and therefore it should be a dud.

79
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:10,790
Will Replace all that out tokens that correspond to the filtered out words by simply ours and for the

80
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:17,000
rest of the elements in that particular answer which I remind are the unique integers in the dictionary

81
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,810
mapping the tokens to the integer IDs.

82
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:26,800
Well we'll simply return the token associated to that unique integer Plus a space so that in the answer

83
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:29,980
we can separate the different words by spaces.

84
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:39,250
All right so let's do this let's introduce the final answer with an empty string like that.

85
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:43,840
And then we're going to do a for loop to loop over.

86
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:49,100
So here I'm going to use a trick non-pay tricks and get a number here and then I'm going to use the

87
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:59,460
ARG max function that is going to take as arguments are predicted answer and the axes which is 1.

88
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:05,720
And basically what this will do is get the token IDs in the predicted answer.

89
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,640
So I'll provide the documentation for the MAX function by name by.

90
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:14,420
But what you need to understand here is that I'm going to take the values of the different token IDs

91
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,020
in the predicted answer.

92
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,820
All right.

93
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:23,250
And so now we're going to make the replacements I mentioned starting with the lower case that we're

94
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,590
going to replace by a capital I.

95
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:36,890
So if the answer is it's two word dictionary of key that is key the unique integer idea in the predicted

96
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:40,280
answer is equal to lower.

97
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,030
I won that case.

98
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:48,820
We're going to replace that by capital and therefore I'm going to introduce a new variable token that

99
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,350
will be equal to capital.

100
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:55,110
I then next thing we can catch and replaced by something nicer.

101
00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:03,860
Well first we have to use Ilive same we're going to take our answers in two word dictionary.

102
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:11,470
And so if the token we're dealing with right now is the end of string.

103
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:20,350
So can well in that case we're going to replace that by a dot incorrupt perfect then I'm just going

104
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:24,200
to copy this because this is going to be the same.

105
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:24,570
All right.

106
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:26,760
So this time what do we want to take care of.

107
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:35,580
Well we said that out to Ken outspoken and in that case well we said that the term is going to be out

108
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,290
all right and that's it.

109
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,900
That's the main things that we're going to replace.

110
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:47,400
And we're going to finalize this with an else meaning that if we get any other token well in that case

111
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:58,230
we will simply replace that token by a space plus that token we just got which is answers in two words

112
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:02,690
of key I which will return the token.

113
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:08,970
All right so we got all the conditions and now we need to increment our answer which so far is an empty

114
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:19,200
string by the token and therefore I'm getting here my answer incrementally by the token I sew the different

115
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,340
tokens in the predicted answer.

116
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:28,760
Cleanthe by everything we did here will be added one by one to the final answer we'll get in the council.

117
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:29,630
Great.

118
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:36,720
And finally we need to add the very important last condition which will end this follow up and we will

119
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:46,480
end it by a break it's that if the token is a adult Well that means that we've reached the end of the

120
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,360
sequence because of this condition here.

121
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,910
You know the end is marked by the end of string and replace that by that.

122
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:57,890
Therefore if we get that then that means that it's the end of the chat.

123
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:58,930
But answer.

124
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:03,260
And in that case are shut but is done talking.

125
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:03,910
All right.

126
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:12,880
And finally let's not forget to print the checkbook answer and to do this will specify for us that it's

127
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:21,080
to chat but speaking so I'm adding Shadbolt here then a column and then a space to separate this Jack

128
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,170
but string by the answer of the Jedburgh.

129
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,270
And speaking of the answer of the checkbook.

130
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:34,380
That's exactly what we're at here with plus answer which is the answer we formed here by adding each

131
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:42,240
of these different tokens we can get by going through the different tokens of the predicted answer.

132
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:49,260
All right perfect so we're done with this code that will hopefully allow us to interact with a chaplain.

133
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:56,280
And now guys congratulations not only you reached the end of the whole implementation but also you were

134
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,230
ready to interact with a job.

135
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:04,980
So now I'm just going to get a little less excited because remember Archibald's was poorly trained.

136
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:07,840
I just trained it while sleeping for a few hours.

137
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:13,650
So Chad what needs to be much more trained than that and therefore what we're about to get here will

138
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,470
be a very poor conversation.

139
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,520
I will actually just say one thing you'll be convinced of the answer and you'll be convinced that of

140
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,980
course we need to train the chat.

141
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:26,590
But more and not only that I will also try to improve them all.

142
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,350
I will tweak the parameters.

143
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:33,390
I will try to improve the data preprocessing but I also encourage you to do that as well.

144
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:40,410
You can provide your ideas and your implementations in this course so that we can together find the

145
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,160
best chat.

146
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,990
But and speaking of the best.

147
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:48,420
But after the Statoil I will show you the best one ever made on her and now show you how to execute

148
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,160
it and chat with it in an extra toile.

149
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:56,960
But before we do that I'm of course going to show you what you need to execute here to chat with Chad.

150
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,740
But well that's simple.

151
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:02,460
That's basically everything except the training.

152
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:08,250
All right so we're simply going to execute everything from here up to the top.

153
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,110
There we go.

154
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:16,440
So it's going to take like 10 seconds but we're going to get basically all the building of the model

155
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,530
and all the data pre-processing variables that we made together.

156
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,350
All right.

157
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:29,430
And now there we go we are ready to select this whole section that has the whole code section of Port

158
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:32,030
for to interact with the chad.

159
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,880
But are you ready.

160
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,400
Let's do this.

161
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:36,840
All right.

162
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:44,460
So a few seconds and there we go you starting the conversation with the chad but so don't expect miracles.

163
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,320
It was only train for a few hours.

164
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,590
It's going to say total nonsense.

165
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,990
But remember I'm training the chad.

166
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,780
But on my other computer during the whole Christmas holidays I actually am going on holiday tomorrow

167
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:58,940
for Christmas and my computer is going to stay here spending Christmas with the chad.

168
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,670
But and after I come back I should have some better wait.

169
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,960
And of course based on the results I will try to improve them all.

170
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:14,160
All right so let's just say for example hi and to get the Jaggar answer you just need to press enter.

171
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:15,820
Oh my God.

172
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,190
And our Chad bird replied kicked cases.

173
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:24,660
Ladies have no idea what this means but as I told you this doesn't make any sense.

174
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,060
So I think we should stop here.

175
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:31,200
I don't really feel like talking to the Jaguar right now so I'll see you in the next tutorial where

176
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,040
I'll show you how to chat with this best bird.

177
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:39,870
And besides you have an amazing article explaining how the check book works and of course this is based

178
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:45,000
on a sex sex model with a lot of common things that we did in this implementation.

179
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,660
So you will have no problem understanding this model if you want to choose it over mine.

180
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,950
I won't be offended.

181
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:57,440
My role here is just to explain how things work but I'm not of course the best developer in the world.

182
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:04,340
And that's why I'm very happy to show you the best implementations the best but by the best developers.

183
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,750
So I'll see you in the next tutorial to show you this.

184
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,530
And until then enjoy I depend up the.
