00:01.190 --> 00:02.670
All right you guys.

00:02.690 --> 00:09.860
So whenever I'm taking a course online my biggest pet peeve is when the teacher doesn't care about the

00:09.860 --> 00:12.380
students and he doesn't care if you succeed.

00:12.380 --> 00:15.530
He just gives you the course and leaves you at that.

00:15.530 --> 00:18.730
Now this course I'm here every step of the way for you.

00:18.770 --> 00:24.230
I want to help you succeed and I want you to gain new skills by taking this course.

00:25.080 --> 00:30.170
You can ask any questions you have in the Q and A section of the course.

00:30.270 --> 00:34.400
I'll get to every single student's question no matter what.

00:34.440 --> 00:37.130
Like I said I'm here to help you guys succeed.

00:37.380 --> 00:43.260
I want to help you become the people you want to become and achieve the goals that you want to achieve.

00:43.260 --> 00:46.780
So how can you get a guaranteed win out of this course.

00:47.220 --> 00:50.420
Well the thing that you have to do is you must take action.

00:50.460 --> 00:51.990
That is the key.

00:51.990 --> 00:55.330
You must do the things that I tell you to do in this course.

00:55.620 --> 01:01.260
If you do that I promise that your skills will go up and you'll gain some more insight into the art

01:01.260 --> 01:02.250
world.

01:02.280 --> 01:09.030
Now I know there's a lot of controversy in the art world about copying artwork but the thing is when

01:09.030 --> 01:15.240
it comes to actually learning artwork you must copy that's the way I learned and that's the way every

01:15.240 --> 01:19.630
other great artist has learned is by copying from other masters.

01:20.010 --> 01:25.770
So I recommend that you go step by step through the course and do exactly as I do.

01:25.890 --> 01:30.280
Create the same character do the same animations do the same poses.

01:30.750 --> 01:34.260
And once you've done that you're going to go up and skill.

01:34.500 --> 01:39.900
Once you've done all of the work with me through this course you'll be ready to go off and create your

01:39.900 --> 01:43.450
own characters and do your own animations.

01:43.500 --> 01:49.230
But I definitely recommend that you go step by step with me through this course so that you can really

01:49.230 --> 01:53.130
learn the skills that it takes to create a character and anime in.

01:53.430 --> 01:58.650
I'm really excited to be getting into this course with you and start creating your characters.

01:58.950 --> 02:00.870
I really hope to see you in the next lecture.

02:00.870 --> 02:02.070
And thank you for watching.
