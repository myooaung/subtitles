So when you're first starting out on the freelancing site you're not going to have any reviews.

00:06.350 --> 00:08.570
And that's a big part of getting jobs.

00:08.570 --> 00:13.520
The more views you have the easier it's going to be for you to get jobs and starting out with zero reviews

00:13.520 --> 00:16.290
is going to make it very difficult to get your first job.

00:16.520 --> 00:20.620
But I'm going to teach you some techniques and things I did to get my first jobs.

00:21.490 --> 00:22.540
It's all about hustling.

00:22.540 --> 00:24.270
At the beginning.

00:24.370 --> 00:31.210
So one of the things you need to remember is that most people applying for jobs on here in their proposals

00:31.300 --> 00:36.760
they're just copying and pasting the same exact proposal to every job and you can tell it sounds like

00:36.760 --> 00:37.610
it when you read it.

00:37.720 --> 00:43.510
And I know this because I ran a job on here before and when I got my proposals from all the freelancers

00:44.080 --> 00:47.850
they just sounded very generic and like they had no idea what my project even was.

00:47.860 --> 00:54.220
They just clicked on my project pasted in and hoped that maybe I'd pick it up and make and when they

00:54.220 --> 00:57.900
do that on other people's projects they're just hoping somebody will bite.

00:58.120 --> 01:03.250
And I guess that works for them but for you starting out with your very first job that's not really

01:03.250 --> 01:05.860
going to work because you're not going to have any reviews.

01:05.920 --> 01:10.690
So what you need to do is you need to stand out from the crowd and the way you'll do that is you'll

01:10.900 --> 01:17.380
actually write a message that has to do with their project not just hi i'm so and so this is what I

01:17.380 --> 01:18.410
do.

01:18.640 --> 01:23.770
Your blah blah you know like you're going to talk about their actual project and ask them questions.

01:23.920 --> 01:30.340
Which brings me to another point is that most freelancers on here when they write their proposals they

01:30.340 --> 01:33.270
just talk about themselves and they're like This is what I do.

01:33.490 --> 01:37.360
These are my credentials and they just talk and talk about themselves.

01:37.360 --> 01:41.300
And the thing is the employers they don't really care about you.

01:41.320 --> 01:47.050
They care about their project and they care about somebody that can get it done well and that cares

01:47.050 --> 01:47.880
about it.

01:47.890 --> 01:52.940
I mean nobody wants somebody that doesn't care about the project working on a project.

01:52.960 --> 01:59.140
So when you write your message to them you need to introduce yourself tell them like in one sentence

01:59.140 --> 02:00.020
what you do.

02:00.160 --> 02:04.390
And after that it's just talking about their project.

02:04.390 --> 02:05.660
So you say hi.

02:05.680 --> 02:07.050
My name is Jason Batchelor.

02:07.180 --> 02:09.400
I'm a freelancer illustrator.

02:09.400 --> 02:14.430
I work at an animation studio and I've been a graphic designer on some games and stuff.

02:14.680 --> 02:17.470
And after that one sentence maybe two sentences.

02:17.620 --> 02:22.300
You just talk about them say you products under the coal I'm really interested in it.

02:22.300 --> 02:26.620
Can you tell me a little bit more about it you know like hit me up in the instant messaging box and

02:26.680 --> 02:31.300
that's the way you're going to get those jobs is by being somebody that the employers would want to

02:31.300 --> 02:34.440
work with as well as having a good portfolio.
