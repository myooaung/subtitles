Welcome to the course.

00:02.310 --> 00:07.860
My name's Jason and I'm going to be your instructor on teaching you how to design characters and animate

00:07.860 --> 00:09.530
them in Photoshop.

00:10.300 --> 00:16.930
Now a little bit about myself when I was very young about 17 I started an internship with an animation

00:16.930 --> 00:17.940
studio.

00:18.010 --> 00:23.380
From there it turned into a job and eventually I started doing my own freelance work and now that's

00:23.380 --> 00:28.040
what I do for a living is freelance illustration so why am I here and you to me.

00:28.210 --> 00:34.350
Well my number one goal here is to help you learn and to help you achieve what you want to achieve.

00:34.360 --> 00:39.310
So if you're here to become a professional digital artist I'm here to help you do that.

00:39.310 --> 00:43.540
If you're just here because you like to do this as a hobby then I'm here to help you with whatever you

00:43.540 --> 00:44.270
need.

00:44.320 --> 00:48.280
I'm just your instructor here to help you achieve what you want to achieve.

00:49.020 --> 00:51.950
Now what are we going to be doing in this course.

00:52.170 --> 00:58.010
Well first off we're going to look at the basics of Photoshop and go over all the necessary tools that

00:58.020 --> 01:01.350
we'll be using throughout the course once we've done that.

01:01.350 --> 01:07.260
We're going to go ahead and start sketching and brainstorming our characters then we can move on to

01:07.260 --> 01:09.210
building our first character.

01:09.210 --> 01:10.220
We're going to build two.

01:10.230 --> 01:15.450
So once we build the first character we're going to go ahead and build the second character using two

01:15.450 --> 01:22.320
different techniques then we can go ahead and start animating our second character in Photoshop.

01:22.320 --> 01:28.320
Once we've done that we're going to start creating a spreadsheet for our characters animation and I'll

01:28.320 --> 01:32.560
teach you all about spreadsheets and how they work and what they are.

01:32.580 --> 01:38.130
Once we finished our sprite sheets I'm going to show you how you can import your spreadsheets into unity

01:38.610 --> 01:41.730
and start looking at the animations and seeing how they look.

01:41.730 --> 01:46.480
This will be prepping and getting ready to actually program into a game.

01:46.500 --> 01:51.690
Now I want to make clear that this is not a programming course but I will show you like I said how to

01:51.690 --> 01:55.320
prep your animation for programming.

01:55.320 --> 01:56.730
Thanks for joining this course.

01:56.730 --> 02:00.280
And I want to let you know that I really appreciate you as a student.

02:00.360 --> 02:05.500
It means a lot to me that you decided to take this course and spend your time learning from me.

02:05.820 --> 02:07.320
So thank you.

02:07.320 --> 02:12.740
Now without further delay let's go ahead and jump right in and start creating some awesome artwork.
