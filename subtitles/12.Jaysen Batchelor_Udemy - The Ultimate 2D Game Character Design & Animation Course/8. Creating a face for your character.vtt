00:00.860 --> 00:04.980
All right now let's start adding some real detail to our character.

00:04.980 --> 00:11.450
First we want to add a new layer above our clipping mask so add a new layer.

00:11.770 --> 00:19.380
Next we want to do is we want to use the circular marquee tool to create an oval this oval is almost

00:19.380 --> 00:20.540
going to be a circle.

00:22.720 --> 00:24.060
Bout like that.

00:24.160 --> 00:32.000
Next we're going to do is we're going to fill that in with our fill tool and the color white and tactic.

00:32.060 --> 00:35.020
Now this is going to be the base for I.

00:35.120 --> 00:36.260
Now let's rotate it.

00:36.320 --> 00:43.820
So using the Transform Tool which is control t on a Windows and command t on a Mac are going to rotate

00:44.430 --> 00:48.580
our eye just a little bit about there will do.

00:48.590 --> 00:51.960
Now this new layer is going to be turn into a clipping mask.

00:51.980 --> 00:57.770
So once again we'll come up to layer and come down to create clipping mask.

00:58.050 --> 01:06.940
Now using our brush tool point to use a hard edged brush and about the size it is now will do.

01:07.100 --> 01:11.510
We're going to create our iris.

01:11.570 --> 01:15.920
I want to use a color very similar to this brown up here.

01:17.130 --> 01:24.650
But I want it to be lighter so bring that up and I think I actually want it to be a little bit more

01:24.650 --> 01:25.990
towards the yellow side.

01:26.060 --> 01:27.740
So bring that up also.

01:28.170 --> 01:28.740
OK.

01:30.020 --> 01:31.630
Switch back to the brush.

01:32.780 --> 01:39.620
And I'm going to enlarge the iris just by a little bit then I'm going to go ahead and put one dot in

01:40.280 --> 01:41.960
as is Iris.

01:41.960 --> 01:48.440
Now you'll have to play around with the placement of his iris but luckily since it's his own layer you

01:48.440 --> 01:49.870
can grab it and move it.

01:50.810 --> 01:54.660
Change the direction of where his eyes looking.

01:54.660 --> 01:55.650
So it's pretty cool.

01:55.650 --> 02:02.670
So play around with that and decide where you want your character looking.

02:02.800 --> 02:05.470
I think about there is good for me next.

02:05.520 --> 02:09.280
What I want to do is I want to paint in his pupil.

02:09.280 --> 02:12.730
So what we'll do is using the same exact color we had.

02:12.850 --> 02:14.070
We're just going to darken it.

02:14.080 --> 02:18.730
So we're going to bring it down very close to the blacks about their will do well.

02:18.790 --> 02:19.810
OK.

02:19.990 --> 02:23.120
Next we're going to switch over to our brush.

02:23.320 --> 02:30.120
Make sure that your make sure that your brush size is a little bit smaller than the previous circle

02:30.120 --> 02:31.200
we created.

02:31.530 --> 02:35.760
So make that a tiny bit smaller and then we're going to fill that in.

02:35.770 --> 02:44.580
So right next we're going to do is we're going to recollect this light brown and then using our brush

02:44.580 --> 02:46.560
tool again and bringing down the size.

02:46.560 --> 02:52.880
We're going to add a highlight into his.

02:53.130 --> 02:59.670
Now I might play around with the position of this so we might undo that and try it in a different spot.

03:01.910 --> 03:03.600
Try it down here.

03:04.920 --> 03:05.490
I like it.

03:05.490 --> 03:09.250
Probably somewhere in the middle about there awesome.

03:09.270 --> 03:13.990
Now the next thing we want to do is we want to merge these two layers together so they're one.

03:14.130 --> 03:17.110
So this layer and that layer.

03:17.200 --> 03:18.360
So we're going to select both of our

03:24.610 --> 03:31.220
what we can do is we can copy that by selecting it with the marquee tool and we copy

03:34.490 --> 03:34.870
right.

03:34.930 --> 03:37.820
So now we have to but the second.

03:37.870 --> 03:41.690
We're going to use the Transform Tool to put it in position and reshape the

03:47.920 --> 03:49.400
so because of perspective.

03:49.450 --> 03:53.840
This I look different than that I think I'm going to rotate it just a bit.

03:53.840 --> 03:54.270
Also

04:02.180 --> 04:04.540
I think I'm also going to shrink it down for tickly.

04:04.610 --> 04:08.930
So turn the Transform Tool back on bring it down just a tiny bit.

04:08.960 --> 04:13.140
This is on the other side of his head and a little bit further away from the viewer.

04:13.160 --> 04:16.090
Therefore it's going to appear a little bit smaller.

04:18.460 --> 04:23.030
Now you can also play with the placement of things by using the arrow keys on your keyboard.

04:23.080 --> 04:27.060
So I'm just going to nudge this over just a little bit and see how that looks.

04:27.770 --> 04:30.550
Are these two eyes are a little bit too close together for me.

04:30.620 --> 04:36.080
So what I can do is I can come over to my other eye and move him over with the arrows on my keyboard

04:38.060 --> 04:38.570
right.

04:38.570 --> 04:39.860
I think that looks a little bit better.

04:40.910 --> 04:43.860
Now we want to add some eyelashes to our character.

04:44.150 --> 04:45.500
Rather than drawing them on.

04:45.500 --> 04:48.800
That can be a little bit tricky especially if you're using a mouse.

04:48.830 --> 04:53.020
What we can do is we can select both our eyes.

04:53.180 --> 04:56.390
Then we're going to merge them together.

04:56.390 --> 04:58.630
So now they're on one layer.

04:58.670 --> 05:01.820
Next we're going to select their shape.

05:01.820 --> 05:08.120
Now the way you do this is by holding down control on a Windows or command on a mat and you're holding

05:08.120 --> 05:08.660
that down.

05:08.660 --> 05:11.790
We're going to click this little thumbnail on the layer.

05:11.960 --> 05:16.320
What that will do is it'll make a selection of everything on that layer you'll see here in a second

05:17.690 --> 05:25.030
and you can see that it's selected his eye shapes you want to do now is we want to create a new layer

05:25.120 --> 05:33.560
underneath those eyes then we're going to fill those in with a dark gray almost a black.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.270
So somewhere about there.

05:35.780 --> 05:39.790
OK then we're going to fill that in.

05:39.960 --> 05:43.040
And you can't see it because the layer is behind those eyes.

05:43.320 --> 05:46.560
But what we're going to do now is using the arrows on our keyboard.

05:46.560 --> 05:51.710
We're going to nudge that layer up and it's going to create some eyelashes on the top of his eye.

05:53.070 --> 05:58.400
So switch to the grab and move tool and then push those up once maybe twice.

06:01.930 --> 06:05.830
But great character is really coming along now.

06:06.020 --> 06:12.770
The next thing we want to do is we want to add eyebrows to a character so using the same gray color

06:12.860 --> 06:17.830
and my brush tool I'm just going to paint in some eyebrows and see how they look.

06:17.870 --> 06:21.320
Now this might take some experimenting until you get the eyebrows look in the way you want.

06:22.460 --> 06:23.400
And that's OK.

06:23.400 --> 06:24.720
It's all part of the process.

06:34.150 --> 06:34.380
All right.

06:34.380 --> 06:35.380
I think that looks good.

06:36.540 --> 06:43.610
That's what we want to do is we want to add in a mouth so I'm going to select this skin Tim and I'm

06:43.610 --> 06:45.460
going to darken it a little bit.

06:45.500 --> 06:51.830
So I'll bring it down to about there and then we might bring it more over to the saturated side.

06:53.410 --> 06:58.110
And then I want to bring it down more towards the red side of the color spectrum.

06:58.880 --> 06:59.470
OK.

07:00.880 --> 07:06.390
Now we can paint in some lit are usually what I'll do if I want to create a shape with a paintbrush

07:06.410 --> 07:11.080
is rather than trying to paint that shape or paint something pretty close to it.

07:11.700 --> 07:17.180
Then using my a race tool I can erase that away until I get the shape that I want.

07:20.180 --> 07:20.710
All right.

07:20.780 --> 07:25.070
I think I like that shape but I don't necessarily like the position.

07:25.070 --> 07:31.490
So what I can do is if I want to try other positions I can use my lasso tool to trace that out.

07:32.470 --> 07:37.270
And now using the grab move tool I can move that around and try different positions for his mouth.

07:43.400 --> 07:46.530
All right I think right about there is good.

07:46.760 --> 07:51.450
Now the last thing we want to do is we want to add a cast shadow from his goggles.

07:51.830 --> 07:57.090
This would just make the character a little bit more interesting and realistic look the way will do

07:57.090 --> 07:57.690
that.

07:57.690 --> 08:00.560
We're going to create a new clipping mask on our heads.

08:01.110 --> 08:06.530
So I add a new layer above that but we want this to be above our skin layer.

08:07.340 --> 08:12.840
Next what we're going to do is we're going to select a dark blue color.

08:13.280 --> 08:19.040
We're going to come up to the blue spectrum and then we're going to come down to a dark bluish grayish

08:19.040 --> 08:20.520
about somewhere in there.

08:20.620 --> 08:25.330
OK then we're going to paint in that cast shadow.

08:25.390 --> 08:30.490
I know this looks really funny but in a second we're going to bring down the opacity and it'll look

08:30.550 --> 08:32.020
a lot more like Chateau

08:34.910 --> 08:36.080
great.

08:36.190 --> 08:43.240
So now coming over to the opacity on our layer going to bring that down now you can see it's looking

08:43.270 --> 08:45.430
a lot more like a shadow.

08:45.430 --> 08:51.550
Now the reason why we did a bluish grayish color for the shadow is because shadows tend to be a cool

08:51.550 --> 08:54.470
color when you are creating shadows.

08:54.880 --> 08:58.060
Use cool colors when you're creating highlights.

08:58.060 --> 08:59.820
Use warm colors.

08:59.980 --> 09:02.530
That's just a good rule of thumb to go by.

09:02.830 --> 09:10.000
Next we want to create a new cooking mask so what we'll do is we'll come down to the first Cloudy mask

09:10.420 --> 09:11.900
and we'll add a new layer.

09:12.220 --> 09:17.680
And remember if you add a layer underneath a clipping mask it'll automatically turn it into a coating

09:17.680 --> 09:24.640
that but now we want to drag this coating mask of above our shadow clipping mask.

09:24.640 --> 09:25.250
All right.

09:25.360 --> 09:31.450
Next what we're going to do is we're going to add in a darker shadow along this edge usually in corners

09:31.450 --> 09:34.390
of walls and crevices and cracks.

09:34.390 --> 09:39.280
Shadows get darker and so we're going to add that darker shadow along this edge.

09:39.430 --> 09:47.770
So selecting the same color that we have here we're going to darken that and we're also going to bring

09:47.770 --> 09:53.960
the saturation a little bit higher about there should do maybe a little bit darker.

09:54.420 --> 09:55.540
Well hit OK.

09:55.990 --> 09:59.850
Next using our brush tool and making sure we have a soft edged brush.

10:02.480 --> 10:13.410
Point paint in that little edge.

10:13.470 --> 10:22.060
Now if it looks too dark you can always bring down the opacity on this layer.

10:22.100 --> 10:22.960
Now really quick.

10:22.970 --> 10:27.350
We'll go ahead and list the label all of our layers within our head folder.

10:27.380 --> 10:35.330
So starting with the skin layer we're going to label that skin then we'll label our next layer which

10:35.330 --> 10:42.310
is the shadow layer and we'll call Chateau the next layer is also the second part of the shadow.

10:42.370 --> 10:45.570
So we'll also call that shadow.

10:46.300 --> 10:49.070
Next is his eyebrows and mouth.

10:49.330 --> 10:52.620
So we'll call that features.

10:53.260 --> 11:01.630
And lastly are his eyes so we'll call that layer eyes now we can close this fall down.

11:02.850 --> 11:05.450
And move on to the next part of our character.

11:06.620 --> 11:11.450
Now if you're creating a character along with me or you're creating your own character I'd love to see

11:11.450 --> 11:12.440
what you're working on.

11:12.650 --> 11:18.530
So go ahead and save out your character and post the progress that you're making in the Q&amp;A section

11:18.530 --> 11:23.210
of this course or on the Facebook group page or both.

11:23.280 --> 11:26.460
Very interested in seeing how you as my student are doing.

11:26.570 --> 11:31.730
