WEBVTT

00:00.830 --> 00:03.670
Now we can turn our sketch folder off.

00:03.680 --> 00:05.720
So just go ahead and turn that off.

00:06.020 --> 00:12.260
And now we're left with a really clean crisp shapes an image of the next thing we're going to do is

00:12.260 --> 00:15.350
we're going to start adding color to our character.

00:15.350 --> 00:17.810
This is where it's going to get really fun.

00:17.830 --> 00:25.060
So the first thing we need to do is we need to create a new layer for our colors and then we need to

00:25.060 --> 00:28.210
turn those layers into clipping masks.

00:28.240 --> 00:31.930
I'll show you what this means later but for now just follow along.

00:32.230 --> 00:37.750
So first what we'll do is we'll start with the top layer which is the goggles are going to come down

00:37.750 --> 00:39.750
and add a new layer.

00:39.850 --> 00:47.560
Next we're going to come up to the layer tab up here and we're going to come down to create clipping

00:47.590 --> 00:50.200
mask so select that.

00:50.200 --> 00:55.730
And now that layer you'll see has become clipping layer mask for the goggles.

00:55.930 --> 00:59.140
Next what we want to do is we want to select both these layers.

00:59.140 --> 00:59.790
The goggles.

00:59.860 --> 01:05.500
And it's clipping layer mask and we're going to put those into a folder.

01:05.590 --> 01:07.050
Let's name that folder.

01:07.150 --> 01:07.810
Goggles

01:13.440 --> 01:16.910
to now need to do that with every single layer here.

01:16.930 --> 01:24.550
We need to add a new layer above it turn it into a clipping layer mask and then put those into a folder

01:24.610 --> 01:35.580
and label them so let's do the hair now add a new layer come up to layer come down to create clipping

01:35.580 --> 01:48.040
mask select both those layers and put them into a folder then we'll label this hair.

01:48.070 --> 01:54.610
So go ahead and do that with all of these layers all the way down until you get to the sketch folder

01:54.670 --> 01:57.420
and then you can stop.

01:57.440 --> 01:58.230
All right.

01:58.420 --> 02:03.740
So now you should have all of your folders created and all of their clipping masks.

02:03.740 --> 02:07.730
Once you've done that let's go ahead and open all of our folders.

02:07.790 --> 02:14.950
So we'll do that just by hitting this arrow on each one.

02:15.370 --> 02:21.940
Next we're going to select all of our clipping masks the way we're going to do that is by clicking on

02:22.030 --> 02:28.330
the layer mask layer and then holding down control and selecting the next one.

02:28.330 --> 02:33.430
Now if you're on a Mac you're going to hold down command and we're just going to continue doing this.

02:33.430 --> 02:40.450
So hold down control and click and now we're just going to go through and select all of our layer masks

02:51.380 --> 02:52.430
great.

02:52.440 --> 02:57.710
Now those are all selected what we want to do is we want to change their layer type.

02:57.710 --> 03:03.950
So right now they're layer type is Enorme we want to change that to color.

03:04.040 --> 03:06.580
So we'll go ahead and select color.

03:07.010 --> 03:11.660
And now all of those layers have been changed to color now that these are color layers.

03:11.660 --> 03:17.900
What we can do is we can paint on top of our image and the values that we've already painted will still

03:17.900 --> 03:21.960
come through the color so I'll show you what I mean.

03:22.190 --> 03:30.990
So if we select our brush tool and select our hair clipping mask we can then paint in the shape.

03:31.160 --> 03:38.500
Now since it's a clipping mask that means that it's creating a mask of this shape right here his hair.

03:38.840 --> 03:43.370
So when we paint it's only going to paint within the hair shape.

03:43.380 --> 03:49.950
Let me show you as you can see it didn't paint anywhere else except within the hair shape.

03:50.090 --> 03:57.140
And since it's on a color layer that means that the color is only going to show through what the value

03:57.170 --> 03:59.030
underneath it.

03:59.030 --> 04:04.550
Now for this particular character's hair I think I want the top of his hair to be orange and the bottom

04:04.550 --> 04:05.460
to be yellow.

04:05.750 --> 04:14.510
So I'm going to change the color to a yellow and I'm going to paint in the bottom making sure that I'm

04:14.510 --> 04:16.770
using a soft edged brush.

04:17.630 --> 04:20.630
Now that's looking a little bit too saturated for me.

04:20.630 --> 04:23.380
So I'm going to go back and change my color

04:27.710 --> 04:32.110
and now I'm going to repaint that.

04:32.300 --> 04:33.830
That's looking better to me.

04:34.310 --> 04:34.960
All right.

04:35.090 --> 04:43.550
Now let's move on to the face so we'll go to the head clipping mask and we're going to select a new

04:43.550 --> 04:49.950
color we want a skin tone to be more in the orange range.

04:50.090 --> 04:51.400
OK.

04:51.530 --> 04:54.970
And now we can paint that in next.

04:55.010 --> 04:57.200
Let's do this scarf.

04:57.590 --> 05:05.040
So we'll go to the scarf clipping mask and for the scarf I think I want something more red.

05:06.080 --> 05:08.990
OK.

05:08.990 --> 05:11.390
I think something like that might be a good color.

05:11.870 --> 05:19.610
Next let's do his shirt so we'll come to the shirt clipping mask and I just want to try using the same

05:19.610 --> 05:24.260
color as a scarf and see how it looks.

05:24.680 --> 05:31.670
Now that's a little too saturated for me and a bit too bright so I'm going to bring it over more towards

05:31.670 --> 05:35.350
the gray side and a little bit down.

05:35.370 --> 05:39.080
Now let's try that.

05:39.080 --> 05:41.120
I think that looks better.

05:41.120 --> 05:41.450
All right.

05:41.480 --> 05:44.950
Now let's do his gloves gloves.

05:44.960 --> 05:47.300
I want to introduce a cool color.

05:47.450 --> 05:50.890
Now if you don't know the difference between warm and cool colors I'll show you.

05:52.080 --> 06:01.440
So cool colors would be greens Aqua's and blues and purples warmer colors would be reds oranges and

06:01.440 --> 06:05.220
yellows and sometimes violets.

06:05.220 --> 06:09.970
So right now we only have warm colors working in our image which is fine.

06:10.290 --> 06:14.540
But I think I want to introduce some cool colors just to make a little bit more interesting.

06:14.700 --> 06:19.140
So I'm going to select an aqua color.

06:20.760 --> 06:25.250
OK then I'm going to fill in his gloves.

06:25.890 --> 06:27.680
Now that's a bit too saturated for me.

06:27.690 --> 06:32.710
So I'm going to bring down the saturation by getting closer to the gray side.

06:33.150 --> 06:33.820
OK.

06:33.900 --> 06:35.990
Now let's try that.

06:36.120 --> 06:36.500
All right.

06:36.510 --> 06:38.520
That's working better for me.

06:39.090 --> 06:41.960
Next let's add some color to his paints.

06:42.270 --> 06:48.840
So we're going to come down to the pants folder select it's clipping mask.

06:49.300 --> 06:52.730
Now I want it pants to be a very similar color to his gloves.

06:52.900 --> 06:59.110
So we're going to go to the color picker and the only difference I really want is I want it to be a

06:59.110 --> 07:00.390
little bit more blue.

07:00.460 --> 07:03.130
So we're going to move up more towards the blue side.

07:03.560 --> 07:04.420
OK.

07:04.840 --> 07:05.970
And fill that in.

07:07.880 --> 07:08.350
Next.

07:08.390 --> 07:14.750
Let's do our boots so our boots are going to be very similar to a shirt.

07:15.050 --> 07:22.370
So I'm going to select the shirt color then I'm going to fill my boots in with that color.

07:22.370 --> 07:24.860
Now lastly we need to do his sword.

07:24.860 --> 07:30.900
So we're going to go up to the sword folders and we'll start with the blade.

07:31.340 --> 07:33.430
So I want the blade to be a blue color.

07:33.530 --> 07:40.610
So I'm going to come to my blues and let's start off with something in this area.

07:40.830 --> 07:43.150
OK let's fill that in.

07:45.110 --> 07:46.000
I like that color.

07:46.010 --> 07:47.950
It's just a little bit too saturated.

07:47.960 --> 07:50.420
So I'm going to bring the saturation over

07:53.210 --> 07:54.150
OK.

07:54.480 --> 07:57.530
Now let's try fill in that great.

07:57.540 --> 07:59.100
I think that looks better.

07:59.280 --> 08:01.540
Now let's do his handle first handle.

08:01.560 --> 08:03.450
I think I want a brown color.

08:03.480 --> 08:11.970
So we'll select the clipping mask for the handle then we're going to fill that in with a brown color.

08:15.990 --> 08:17.410
I think that looks good.

08:17.460 --> 08:18.080
All right.

08:18.090 --> 08:20.660
Now we have all the base colors on our character.

08:20.730 --> 08:21.660
This is really cool.

08:21.660 --> 08:26.580
It's really starting come together and I hope you guys are starting to get excited about creating your

08:26.580 --> 08:27.150
character.
