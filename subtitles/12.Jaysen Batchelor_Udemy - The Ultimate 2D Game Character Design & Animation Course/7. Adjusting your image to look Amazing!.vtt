It never were done laying out all of our colors.

00:05.320 --> 00:09.360
We want to make some adjustments to the values and the colors.

00:09.400 --> 00:14.980
The reason for this is because you don't always know exactly how everything is going to look together

00:15.460 --> 00:20.280
and once you have everything together you may not like certain aspects of your artwork.

00:20.500 --> 00:24.030
So for example we're going to start off with the goggles.

00:24.130 --> 00:27.110
I think the goggles are just a little bit too dark.

00:27.280 --> 00:28.660
So we're going to lighten them.

00:28.750 --> 00:34.290
The way will do this is by adding a hue and saturation layer above our goggles layer.

00:34.630 --> 00:39.130
So we'll hit this little guy right here that says hue and saturation.

00:39.280 --> 00:40.890
So click it.

00:41.060 --> 00:48.070
And now that's added a hue and saturation now because we added it underneath our clipping mask it automatically

00:48.070 --> 00:51.100
turned into a clipping mask which is good.

00:51.220 --> 00:56.000
Next what you want to do is we want to bring up the brightness on this.

00:56.200 --> 01:01.090
I don't want it super bright but as you can see you can take out all the way up to white or take all

01:01.090 --> 01:02.890
the way down to black.

01:02.890 --> 01:10.420
We want to just a little bit past where it was before plus 13 is good.

01:10.860 --> 01:17.970
All right the next thing I want to adjust is I want to adjust his scarf so I'm going to go down and

01:17.970 --> 01:20.260
find the scarf layer.

01:22.440 --> 01:31.930
So I'll add a hue and saturation and this time we want the human saturation of above our color.

01:32.020 --> 01:34.270
This is because we want to affect the color.

01:34.270 --> 01:40.810
Anything that is underneath this hue and saturation within this clipping mask is going to be affected

01:41.620 --> 01:46.470
though our value is going to be affected and our color is going to be affected.

01:47.850 --> 01:51.130
So we want to bring down the saturation on this.

01:51.180 --> 01:56.240
Now I just want to bring down the saturation on this.

01:56.270 --> 01:58.270
I think that looks good.

01:58.280 --> 02:03.530
Now lastly I want to bring down the saturation on a shirt so we're going to do the same exact thing

02:03.530 --> 02:04.840
for a shirt.

02:05.240 --> 02:14.830
So find the shirt later we'll add a hue and saturation will bring that above the color layer.

02:16.780 --> 02:19.290
And then we're just going to bring down that saturation

02:22.390 --> 02:26.000
and while I'm at it I think I want a shirt just a little bit lighter too.

02:26.020 --> 02:31.600
So I'm going to bring that up to about there.

02:31.630 --> 02:40.620
Now lastly I want to change his boots so I'm going to come down to the boot later going to add a human

02:40.620 --> 02:44.780
saturation and this time I don't need to affect the color.

02:44.790 --> 02:46.750
I just want to bring down darkness

02:50.030 --> 02:50.880
great.

02:50.900 --> 02:53.240
I think that looks good.

02:53.240 --> 02:57.740
So if you're creating your own character right now go ahead and go through and play with the different

02:57.740 --> 03:00.650
adjustments until you get it looking the way you want it.

03:01.660 --> 03:03.010
Thank you for watching this lecture.

03:03.010 --> 03:05.240
And I can't wait to see you in the next one.
