When I teach on you to me I'm not just here to help myself I'm here to help you.

00:07.560 --> 00:09.250
I want you guys to succeed.

00:09.270 --> 00:15.580
It's one of the most important things to me here on you to me is to make sure that you guys succeed.

00:15.630 --> 00:20.570
One of the ways that I can help you guys succeed is by answering your questions.

00:20.670 --> 00:22.750
I know when you're taking an online course.

00:22.770 --> 00:29.840
A lot of questions will come up or you might have a special situation where you need answers to questions

00:30.840 --> 00:32.130
while you're on your way to me.

00:32.130 --> 00:37.800
You can go to the Q&amp;A section of the course and ask me any questions you have about character design

00:38.130 --> 00:40.720
and I will answer every single one of them.

00:40.730 --> 00:48.180
Now I might not get back to them within 24 hours but I will get back to them and I'll answer the questions

00:48.180 --> 00:51.040
to the best of my ability.

00:51.060 --> 00:55.890
All you'll do is you'll type right here and you can search a question to see if any other students have

00:55.890 --> 00:59.060
already asked it if they haven't asked the question yet.

00:59.070 --> 01:05.250
Go ahead and hit ask a new question and you'll type your question title and then type in what your question

01:05.250 --> 01:09.390
is and the description then post your question.

01:09.580 --> 01:13.080
And please don't be afraid to ask any questions.

01:13.090 --> 01:16.930
There is no such thing as a dumb question in my courses.

01:16.990 --> 01:20.700
Also I love to hear from my students and learn what they're doing.

01:21.190 --> 01:28.240
So I'd really appreciate it if you also typed in here a little message to me and all the other students

01:28.240 --> 01:30.690
in the course about who you are.

01:30.690 --> 01:35.740
What type of artist you are or if you're not an artist at all and you're looking to learn how to create

01:35.800 --> 01:36.880
art.

01:36.880 --> 01:39.310
We're all very interested in learning this.

01:39.370 --> 01:44.670
I want this to be a very big support group for all of us to learn and grow.

01:44.680 --> 01:49.840
It can be really hard to do something all by yourself but when you have the support of all these people

01:49.840 --> 01:52.560
behind you it can be a lot easier.

01:52.960 --> 01:57.050
I'm really excited to take you through this course and see your guys artwork.

01:57.340 --> 01:58.990
Thank you for watching this lecture.
