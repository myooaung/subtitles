00:01.440 --> 00:05.540
Write you guys let's go ahead and let's move on to our third frame.

00:05.550 --> 00:08.460
We're almost done creating the walk's cycle.

00:08.700 --> 00:15.090
So we're going to switch back over to our first frame and what we need to do first is we need to delete

00:15.180 --> 00:18.310
this flattened version of our character.

00:18.510 --> 00:21.290
So we're just going to hit delete to get rid of that.

00:21.520 --> 00:25.960
Next we're going to do is we need to scroll down to the body layer.

00:26.010 --> 00:31.160
Now what we need to happen here is we need these legs to switch side.

00:31.350 --> 00:37.830
We will do that is first we're going to start off with our front leg which is on its own layer.

00:37.830 --> 00:45.900
So all we have to do is grab it and move that over into position like so this edge of the leg should

00:45.900 --> 00:48.340
be lining up with this side of his body.

00:49.650 --> 00:56.210
Next we're going to come over to our body layer where other leg is then using the Lasso tool.

00:56.220 --> 00:59.180
We're going to go ahead and cut that out.

01:01.310 --> 01:07.420
Like so then using the grab move tool we can just grab that leg and move it over

01:10.620 --> 01:12.210
making sure they're about level.

01:12.570 --> 01:18.180
And what we want to do is we want to also make sure that this edge of this leg is lining up with this

01:18.180 --> 01:19.210
edge of that body.

01:19.230 --> 01:25.560
So this should become one line and this should become one line.

01:25.580 --> 01:29.200
I know it looks kind of jagged to you right now but we'll fix that in a sec.

01:29.690 --> 01:32.230
Go ahead and unselect out of this selection.

01:33.220 --> 01:39.580
Next we're going to do is we are going to go in there and we're going to race out some of this area

01:39.580 --> 01:48.330
that we don't want and what we'll do is we're going to select this color of skin tone and using the

01:48.330 --> 01:48.950
brush tool.

01:48.960 --> 01:52.500
We'll just go ahead and brush in the shape that we want.

01:52.510 --> 01:56.120
Like so now if you don't want to brush it in if that's too hard.

01:56.130 --> 02:01.900
You can go ahead and use the Lasso tool to trace out the shape that you want to paint in.

02:01.980 --> 02:03.030
Great.

02:03.030 --> 02:08.210
Next story we're going to do is we're going to use the selection tool to select this leg

02:11.200 --> 02:15.070
like so then we're going to cut it out of this layer.

02:15.070 --> 02:20.050
Now the way you cut it out is by getting control X or command x.

02:20.080 --> 02:23.690
If you're on a Mac and now that has just taken that leg away.

02:23.860 --> 02:29.590
But what it's done is it's holding it for us on the clipboard and we can paste it back in.

02:29.680 --> 02:35.330
The reason why we did that is because we need to pasted in above our loincloth.

02:35.350 --> 02:41.320
So we'll open up our loincloth layer and we're going to paste it above all the other layers in there.

02:41.410 --> 02:44.090
So control V or command V.

02:44.200 --> 02:49.960
If you're on a Mac and that will put that leg back in there then we want to try to get it back into

02:49.960 --> 02:54.670
position as best as possible like so.

02:54.910 --> 02:59.370
And as you can see there is some stuff underneath that loincloth that we couldn't see.

02:59.380 --> 03:00.920
So we need to fix that.

03:00.970 --> 03:06.220
So we're going to use the erase tool to erase away till we get the shape we want.

03:06.220 --> 03:10.530
And switching back over to our brush tool will fill in the areas that are empty.

03:10.540 --> 03:18.460
Now let's once again select our drawstring layer and we're going to cut out a section of that drawstring

03:18.790 --> 03:21.130
that's being covered up by the leg.

03:21.280 --> 03:23.570
Then we can go ahead and copy that.

03:23.680 --> 03:31.550
Then coming up to our top layer which is the legel layer we can taste that in on top then we'll move

03:31.550 --> 03:33.870
it and make sure it's in position.

03:33.920 --> 03:35.200
Awesome.

03:35.270 --> 03:39.690
Next what we're going to do is we're going to move our loincloth out of the way a bit.

03:40.160 --> 03:43.620
As of now it looks kind of like it's going through his thigh.

03:44.020 --> 03:50.570
But what we'll do is we're going to come down to our loincloth layer and also selecting the clipping

03:50.570 --> 03:53.080
mask that's attached to it.

03:53.150 --> 03:55.620
We're going to merge those two layers together.

03:57.390 --> 03:59.460
Now those are one layer.

03:59.460 --> 04:06.780
Next what we're going to do is we are going to use the Transform Tool then right clicking on our image

04:06.870 --> 04:10.710
we're going to come up to where it says work.

04:10.730 --> 04:16.310
Now what we can do with this is we can completely warp our image by clicking and dragging certain areas

04:16.370 --> 04:17.390
of the image.

04:17.690 --> 04:22.930
So if we click and drag here in the center we can start to warp that image.

04:23.980 --> 04:27.340
You can click in this corner and warp it over like so.

04:27.440 --> 04:32.500
So that way it's not cutting into his legs so much great.

04:32.630 --> 04:39.810
Let's go ahead and hit enter now that just created kind of a weird looking area right here on the drawstring.

04:39.880 --> 04:46.520
Let's just switch back over to the drawstring layer then let's select that same color.

04:46.990 --> 04:51.240
Then using our brush tool we can just go ahead and repaint in that little area.

04:52.900 --> 04:53.390
Ah.

04:53.700 --> 04:56.730
Our leg layer is still overlapping over our drawstring.

04:56.730 --> 05:02.940
So all we have to do is come over to our leg layer and using the erase tool we'll just erase that away

05:03.030 --> 05:04.170
like so.

05:04.650 --> 05:05.920
Great.

05:05.940 --> 05:11.940
Now let's go ahead and move on to this back leg because it needs a little bit of work so we can go ahead

05:11.970 --> 05:20.940
and close or loin cloth layer then let's come over to our back leg layer and using our erase tool.

05:20.940 --> 05:28.670
We're going to go ahead and erase away the area that we don't want.

05:28.820 --> 05:38.750
Just like so then respecting our skin tone we're going to go ahead and brush in any empty spaces.

05:38.750 --> 05:43.930
Great now because this back leg is behind this other front leg.

05:44.060 --> 05:46.580
We want to make sure that it's a darker tone.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.390
So it looks like it's in shadow.

05:48.860 --> 05:54.350
So what we'll do is we're going to create a new layer above it then we're going to make that layer a

05:54.350 --> 05:56.410
clipping mask.

05:56.600 --> 06:03.200
Now that it's a clipping mask we can go ahead and select this darker skin tone and fill this whole layer

06:03.200 --> 06:08.590
in with our fill tool and that will change the color of that back leg.

06:09.910 --> 06:14.060
Next what we need to do is we need to animate our arms.

06:14.170 --> 06:21.070
So what we're going to do is we're going to start off with our back arm which is this guy right here.

06:21.640 --> 06:27.150
And we're also going to select that spear folder and then using the transform tool.

06:27.190 --> 06:30.010
We're going to go ahead and rotate those.

06:30.280 --> 06:33.810
And on the third frame his arm is going to come up pretty high.

06:36.710 --> 06:41.760
So somewhere about there should be good we can go ahead and hit enter.

06:42.220 --> 06:45.430
Next we need to change the position of this arm.

06:45.670 --> 06:51.550
So we're going to come back to the body later and using our Lasso tool we can go ahead and cut that

06:51.580 --> 06:52.790
arm out.

06:56.160 --> 07:01.040
Just like so then using the Transform Tool will also rotate this arm

07:06.020 --> 07:09.910
and get it into position.

07:10.180 --> 07:14.060
Then we'll use the brush tool to fill in any empty spaces.

07:14.080 --> 07:20.550
So let's select our skin tone and we'll go ahead and we'll just brush that in real quickly.

07:20.590 --> 07:21.310
Great.

07:21.310 --> 07:23.790
We just finished our third Fring.

07:24.160 --> 07:30.910
So let's go ahead and let's make a copy of our character so we'll start with a spear folder and we'll

07:30.910 --> 07:34.130
slide everything all the way up to the mask folder.

07:35.020 --> 07:36.470
Then we'll copy it.

07:38.090 --> 07:40.610
And we'll merge those layers together.

07:41.630 --> 07:47.780
And keeping our flattened copy selected and coming all the way down to the background layer holding

07:47.780 --> 07:50.810
down control to make sure we select both of them.

07:50.840 --> 07:52.640
So now they're both selected.

07:52.640 --> 07:58.400
Now we can just click and drag those into our spreadsheet.

07:58.550 --> 08:01.590
We'll drop those in then.

08:01.640 --> 08:04.000
Let's just position that into place.

08:04.100 --> 08:05.240
Great.

08:05.240 --> 08:12.420
Now let's go ahead and delete that background then then let's open our walking folder back up and let's

08:12.420 --> 08:14.880
drag our new layer in there.

08:16.140 --> 08:22.750
And we're going to label that EF 3 4 frame 3 awesome.

08:22.750 --> 08:28.660
Now let's go ahead and go back into the frame we just created and we need to save this out as frame

08:28.720 --> 08:29.630
3.

08:29.710 --> 08:42.720
So we'll go file save as and we'll call it EF 3.

08:42.930 --> 08:46.010
Great now for this simple walk cycle.

08:46.020 --> 08:48.800
Those are all the frames we need to create.

08:49.050 --> 08:55.440
But coming back into our spreadsheet what we need to do is we need to copy this frame right here where

08:55.440 --> 09:02.640
his legs are crossing and paste a new one down here at the end so that way when the animation goes through

09:03.150 --> 09:05.310
it'll hit all of these.

09:05.470 --> 09:11.800
And then once it hits this guy again down at the concert all the way back over at the beginning.

09:11.800 --> 09:19.360
So what we need to do is we need to come back into our second frame layer and we still should have both

09:19.360 --> 09:23.750
our background and our flat and character selected.

09:23.920 --> 09:31.830
So just click and drag those into our sprite sheet and drop them in reposition it.

09:32.020 --> 09:40.120
And now we can go ahead and delete that background layer and let's label this new frame as frame for

09:43.750 --> 09:49.390
just completed our walk cycle and the next lecture we're going to create a mock up in Photoshop where

09:49.390 --> 09:53.640
you'll be able to actually see your character walking in action.

09:53.950 --> 09:58.140
I hope this lecture was useful for you and I can't wait to see you in the next one.
