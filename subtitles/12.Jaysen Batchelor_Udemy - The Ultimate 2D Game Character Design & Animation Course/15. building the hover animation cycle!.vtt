00:01.220 --> 00:05.860
OK let's go ahead and finish our last animation cycle.

00:06.210 --> 00:10.590
So the last animation cycle is just going to be our characters hover state.

00:10.710 --> 00:16.140
So when he's just standing around not doing any actions he'll still have a little bit of motion to him

00:16.410 --> 00:19.610
just to make it more interesting to the player.

00:19.620 --> 00:22.790
So the first thing we want to do is we want to open our frame.

00:22.800 --> 00:29.770
One of the standing pose once you have this opened up what we're going to do is we're going to make

00:30.370 --> 00:31.990
two copies of this character.

00:31.990 --> 00:35.940
One of the body and one of the mask and the feathers.

00:36.010 --> 00:37.800
So we're going to start with the body.

00:37.810 --> 00:42.490
So starting with the loincloth folder and coming all the way down to the spear.

00:43.090 --> 00:45.850
Let's go ahead and make a copy of those layers.

00:46.860 --> 00:54.840
And we're going to go ahead and merge those layers together and bring that to the top next.

00:54.850 --> 01:01.280
Let's select our mask and feather fuller and we're going to make a copy of those.

01:01.510 --> 01:09.090
Let's merge them together and we'll drag that to the very top of our layers.

01:09.100 --> 01:10.310
Great.

01:10.330 --> 01:17.680
Next we want to do is we want to select both of these layers by holding control and selecting both then

01:17.930 --> 01:24.190
hit control again and select your background and then we're going to drag and drop those into our Sprite

01:24.200 --> 01:24.520
she

01:28.280 --> 01:31.440
lets go ahead and put him into position.

01:31.440 --> 01:32.580
Great.

01:32.580 --> 01:34.900
Now he is in our jump right full there.

01:34.920 --> 01:41.060
So we want to drag him out of there and then we're going to place them into a folder.

01:41.760 --> 01:44.040
We'll call this folder hover right

01:47.290 --> 01:53.030
now let's go ahead and open that folder and we can delete that background layer.

01:53.290 --> 01:59.200
And with our two layers with the head and the body we're going to go ahead and merge those together

02:00.710 --> 02:10.380
and we're going to call that frame 1 great Next what we want to do is we want to create a new document.

02:10.390 --> 02:16.900
So we're going to go file new and we want this document to be 600.

02:18.610 --> 02:21.960
Six hundred.

02:21.980 --> 02:25.890
So this is the same size as our frame 1 document.

02:26.060 --> 02:29.500
What we're going to do is we're going to drag both these layers into that document.

02:32.170 --> 02:37.330
Like so I will grab it and make sure it locks into position.

02:37.390 --> 02:38.890
Great.

02:38.890 --> 02:44.010
Now the reason why we've done this is because we're going to use this as a base to create each frame.

02:44.050 --> 02:48.620
The only thing that's going to be happening animation wise is his head is going to be going up and down.

02:48.760 --> 02:51.670
So this will make the process very simple.

02:51.670 --> 02:53.140
Let me show you what I mean.

02:53.230 --> 02:56.070
So let's first delete this white background layer.

02:56.080 --> 02:57.870
I didn't mean to bring that in.

02:58.360 --> 02:59.200
Next.

02:59.200 --> 03:01.650
Let's go ahead and animate that head.

03:01.660 --> 03:06.830
So first off in animation we want his head to go down.

03:06.940 --> 03:12.460
So we're going to come up to the head layer then using the keys on our keyboard.

03:12.460 --> 03:15.880
We're going to nudge that down just the tiniest bit.

03:15.880 --> 03:17.850
I only hit my arrow keys twice.

03:18.820 --> 03:28.060
Now let's go ahead and save that out as a frame to go file save as and we'll just put to

03:33.630 --> 03:41.600
that next will we want to do is we want to select all three of our layers and we're going to drag and

03:41.600 --> 03:44.230
drop those into our spreadsheet.

03:47.720 --> 03:53.740
Then we can go ahead and delete that background layer and merge our two layers together.

03:55.120 --> 04:01.080
So that of us one will call this to great.

04:01.080 --> 04:05.030
Now let's go ahead and let's do that again for fring 3.

04:05.100 --> 04:09.070
So we'll grab our mask layer and then we're going to nudge it down.

04:09.900 --> 04:11.870
We're just going to go down twice.

04:13.710 --> 04:17.890
It now let's go ahead and save that out as frame three

04:25.200 --> 04:26.240
fantastic.

04:26.280 --> 04:32.550
And now we can go ahead and grab all three of those layers and drag them and drop them into our spreadsheet.

04:36.670 --> 04:42.480
Let's go ahead and to lead our background layer murder two layers together.

04:44.530 --> 04:49.040
More call EF 3.

04:49.210 --> 04:52.520
Now our character's head is going to begin to come back up.

04:52.630 --> 04:57.570
So we just want to replicate this frame right here and put it right there.

04:57.940 --> 05:00.320
So let's go ahead and open our frame to

05:06.270 --> 05:12.610
moments go ahead and select all of our layers and drag them and drop them into our spreadsheet

05:15.600 --> 05:24.000
then we can go ahead and delete that background layer merger two layers together and label that frame

05:24.000 --> 05:34.270
for now our next frame is going to be our frame 1 because it's going to start at midpoint he said is

05:34.280 --> 05:35.400
going to come down.

05:35.490 --> 05:40.300
It's going to come down further than it's going to come back up and then it's going to reach midpoints

05:40.390 --> 05:41.080
again.

05:42.370 --> 05:45.550
So let's go ahead and grab our frame one.

05:46.270 --> 05:56.140
Well grab both those layers drag and drop them in get him into position great.

05:56.250 --> 06:02.240
Let's go ahead and make a copy of these letters because we're actually going to want the same frame

06:02.300 --> 06:07.670
again because what we want to happen in our animation is we want him to take a breath where his head

06:07.670 --> 06:13.340
goes down comes back up and then he takes a pause of where his body doesn't move at all.

06:13.340 --> 06:17.050
So now we can go ahead and delete both those background layers.

06:19.840 --> 06:26.270
Then let's go ahead and merge both our layers together and we have to do this twice for each of the

06:26.270 --> 06:27.720
characters we just put in

06:31.670 --> 06:32.310
gripped.

06:32.310 --> 06:39.350
Now let's go ahead and label those five and six.

06:39.720 --> 06:41.100
Fantastic.

06:41.130 --> 06:45.600
We just created our final animation cycle and the next lecture we're going to go ahead and create our

06:45.600 --> 06:47.350
mock up and see how it looks.
