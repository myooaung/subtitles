00:00.830 --> 00:04.430
So the third frame is going to be where he's airborne.

00:04.440 --> 00:09.550
So let's have a look at our diagram and this is the third frame right here.

00:09.810 --> 00:14.970
So his feet have left the ground and his arms are going to come up a little bit and his head is going

00:14.970 --> 00:17.600
to tilt back just a little bit more.

00:17.700 --> 00:20.570
So let's go ahead and do that.

00:20.580 --> 00:27.710
So the first thing we're going to do is we're going to delete this copy that we made.

00:27.900 --> 00:34.770
Next we're going to select all of our folders and using the arrow keys on our keyboard.

00:34.830 --> 00:38.080
We're going to go ahead and nudge our character up into the air.

00:41.600 --> 00:44.810
But there should be high enough next.

00:44.850 --> 00:50.940
Let's select our back arm and our spear folder then using the Transform Tool.

00:51.020 --> 00:54.430
Go ahead and rotate that up.

00:54.530 --> 00:56.750
MIKE So you know a little bit more

01:01.300 --> 01:02.640
great.

01:02.750 --> 01:07.980
Now let's go ahead and switch over to our body layer and we'll cut this arm out.

01:14.300 --> 01:15.410
And let's rotate that

01:20.320 --> 01:24.040
Asa now using our brush tool.

01:24.060 --> 01:30.260
We can go ahead and select that skin tone painted in.

01:30.500 --> 01:35.960
And remember if you're uncomfortable with free handing in the paint you can go ahead and use your lasso

01:35.960 --> 01:39.540
tool to lasso that shape in there.

01:39.590 --> 01:40.640
Great.

01:40.640 --> 01:45.490
Now lastly what we want to do is rotate his head just a little bit more.

01:45.560 --> 01:52.160
So we're going to come up to our feather folder and our mask folder and using the transform tool make

01:52.160 --> 01:59.330
sure that your pivot point is down at his neck and we'll go ahead and rotate that a little bit more

02:00.080 --> 02:06.140
like So now as you can see his head is sort of coming off his neck.

02:06.430 --> 02:12.610
So we can just go ahead and use the arrow keys on the keyboard to push that down back over his neck.

02:12.610 --> 02:13.400
Great.

02:13.420 --> 02:20.050
So you just finished your third frame for your character so let's go ahead and select all of these folders

02:22.210 --> 02:31.620
and make a copy urged them and then we'll go ahead and drop this into our spreadsheet.

02:38.160 --> 02:39.210
Great.

02:39.220 --> 02:44.460
Now let's go ahead delete that background and rename this the.

02:44.930 --> 02:45.920
EF 3.

02:47.910 --> 02:50.870
Then let's not forget to save out our frame

02:54.070 --> 02:55.240
and we'll call this one.

02:55.260 --> 02:56.060
EF 3

02:59.510 --> 02:59.910
great.
