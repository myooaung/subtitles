00:00.810 --> 00:04.200
OK let's go ahead and let's make this mock up.

00:04.340 --> 00:10.720
Now the first thing we want to do is we want to save this out so we don't lose our Spryte sheet document.

00:11.030 --> 00:18.830
So I'll go file save as and I'm going to create a new folder and I'm just going to call it Spryte sheet

00:25.120 --> 00:27.540
and we'll just save it in there.

00:27.670 --> 00:32.340
I'm going to save it out as final Sprite she save.

00:33.010 --> 00:36.040
OK great.

00:36.130 --> 00:42.730
Now we're going to go ahead and receive this out as a different document so that way we can play with

00:42.730 --> 00:46.430
this document and not worry about losing what we had before.

00:46.750 --> 00:52.250
So we'll go file save as and let's call this one animation test

01:00.790 --> 01:03.510
now can start building our animation mock up.

01:03.730 --> 01:09.670
So the first thing we want to do is we want to grab all of our layers and drag them over so that they're

01:09.700 --> 01:11.380
all lined up with each other.

01:12.240 --> 01:15.510
So we can leave frame one in place.

01:15.510 --> 01:23.070
We're going to start with frame too and what we'll do is we'll just grab it and move him so that his

01:23.070 --> 01:29.930
mask lines up with the other mask we can zoom in just to make sure it's lined up.

01:31.770 --> 01:38.130
So now let's grab our next layer which is frame three and we'll drag that over and make sure that he

01:38.130 --> 01:39.890
is lining up with the other guys.

01:43.390 --> 01:47.840
Great now we'll come up to frame four.

01:48.310 --> 01:54.280
And even though he's not on our screen we can just go ahead and start dragging him over like so and

01:54.280 --> 01:56.970
we'll just make sure that he also lines up.

01:57.130 --> 01:57.800
Awesome.

01:58.030 --> 02:01.170
So now that those guys are all lined up it looks kind of funny.

02:01.180 --> 02:04.260
He looks like he has six legs and six arms.

02:04.390 --> 02:06.320
But we're going to fix that in a second.

02:06.340 --> 02:11.680
So what we're going to do is we're going to come up to window and then we're going to come down to where

02:11.680 --> 02:14.860
it says time line towards the bottom of the list.

02:15.220 --> 02:20.810
So we'll hit that and the ads and a timeline down here at the bottom of our Photoshop document.

02:21.630 --> 02:26.620
What we want to do is we want to click right here where it says create frame animation.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.760
Once we click that it's going to create our first frame.

02:31.230 --> 02:37.800
So the way this works is whatever layers are turned on while we have our frame selected is what's going

02:37.800 --> 02:39.960
to show on that frame.

02:39.960 --> 02:46.740
So let's go ahead and turn off all of our layers except for our frame one layer.

02:46.830 --> 02:54.210
Next we're going to add a new frame by hitting this little icon down here that looks like the new layer

02:54.510 --> 02:55.170
icon.

02:55.170 --> 02:56.540
So hit that.

02:56.790 --> 03:00.710
And now that's just added frame to now on frame 2.

03:00.720 --> 03:03.510
We want to show the layer that has frame 2 on it.

03:03.540 --> 03:10.380
So I'll turn on the frame to layer and turn off the frame one layer and we're just going to do this

03:10.380 --> 03:11.820
all the way up to frame 4.

03:11.820 --> 03:21.870
So add a new layer turn off frame to turn on frame 3 we'll add one more layer and we'll turn off frame

03:21.880 --> 03:27.480
3 and turn on frame for snails see if we start back at frame 1.

03:27.530 --> 03:34.730
It starts with the frame 1 and it will switch through each one of those layers.

03:34.740 --> 03:35.190
All right.

03:35.230 --> 03:36.410
Awesome.

03:36.430 --> 03:39.310
Now we can go ahead and play that and see how it looks.

03:39.490 --> 03:42.070
So down here is the play button at the bottom.

03:42.190 --> 03:45.490
Well go ahead and click that and it plays it.

03:45.490 --> 03:51.700
Now is only playing at once because right here you'll see it says Once we want to hit that drop down

03:51.700 --> 03:55.870
menu and we want to select for ever.

03:55.870 --> 03:59.360
Now let's try playing it again awesome.

03:59.510 --> 04:02.640
Now he's moving too fast at this point.

04:02.660 --> 04:07.160
It doesn't really matter because this is just a mockup to see his motion.

04:07.160 --> 04:10.320
But if you want to see what he looks like going slower.

04:10.340 --> 04:14.750
What you can do is go ahead and stop the animation.

04:14.750 --> 04:18.590
And what we need to do is we need to change the frames per second.

04:18.620 --> 04:22.650
Now what that means is how many frames are being shown per second.

04:22.670 --> 04:28.940
So what we'll do is we're going to select all of our frames by starting with the first one holding down

04:28.940 --> 04:32.560
shift and then clicking all the way down to our last frame.

04:32.630 --> 04:37.910
Next what we'll do is coming over to where it says 0 seconds at the bottom of our frame we're going

04:37.910 --> 04:42.120
to hit that and it's going to bring up this drop down menu.

04:42.380 --> 04:48.470
What we want to do is we want to add a little bit of a delay at this point to zero seconds of delay

04:48.650 --> 04:50.000
between each frame.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.310
So we want to add 0.1 seconds.

04:53.420 --> 04:54.780
So select that.

04:54.950 --> 04:56.360
Great.

04:56.360 --> 04:59.830
Now let's go ahead and play it and see how it looks.

04:59.960 --> 05:01.320
That looks much better.

05:01.460 --> 05:04.990
Now like I said this is not the final animation.

05:05.090 --> 05:10.080
This is just a mock up of the animation so you can see how the animation flows and looks.

05:10.130 --> 05:15.950
The worst thing is to upload all of your spreadsheets into your game and find out that the animation

05:15.950 --> 05:17.180
looks horrible.

05:17.180 --> 05:21.770
So this is a quick and easy way that you can check your animation and make sure that the movement looks

05:21.770 --> 05:22.490
good.

05:22.520 --> 05:27.440
Hope this lecture was really exciting for you and you're really starting to see the possibilities of

05:27.680 --> 05:31.160
how you can animate things and how easy it actually is.

05:31.160 --> 05:34.500
Thanks for watching and I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.
