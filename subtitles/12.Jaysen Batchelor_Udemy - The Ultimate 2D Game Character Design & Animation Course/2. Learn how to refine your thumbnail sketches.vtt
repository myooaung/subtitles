00:00.600 --> 00:06.450
Now that you've done all of your sketches you're going to go ahead and pick your favorite ones.

00:06.870 --> 00:10.470
I suggest picking two to three of them.

00:10.470 --> 00:13.600
So for me this one right here is my favorite.

00:13.890 --> 00:21.240
So we're going to go ahead and select the marquee tool and then we're going to select our sketch that

00:21.270 --> 00:31.720
we've chosen and then we're going to copy it by going Control-C on a Windows or command C on a Mac.

00:31.740 --> 00:33.970
Now we're going to create a new document.

00:34.050 --> 00:36.590
So we'll go file new.

00:36.870 --> 00:46.590
And let's make the width of our document about three hundred and fifty pixels and make the height 600.

00:46.950 --> 00:48.880
OK.

00:48.950 --> 00:57.050
And now what we're going to do is we'll copy our sketch into this document by going control V on a Windows

00:57.530 --> 01:01.800
or command VI on a Mac.

01:01.890 --> 01:08.100
So the next step after we've created all of our thumbnails and we've selected one is to start detailing

01:08.100 --> 01:11.890
out this little sketch because as of now he's not much of a character.

01:12.030 --> 01:16.420
He's just sort of some shapes that make up the idea of a pose.

01:16.560 --> 01:21.900
We're going to bring down the opacity of this layer first thing the way you do that is you come over

01:21.900 --> 01:26.280
here by the layers and there is a drop down menu that says opacity.

01:26.370 --> 01:31.800
You hit the down button and you can slide that back and forth.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.180
And that allows you to bring down the opacity.

01:34.380 --> 01:36.990
We want to add about 30 percent.

01:37.410 --> 01:42.280
So now let's add a new layer on this new layer.

01:42.300 --> 01:48.230
We're going to go ahead and start sketching out a more detailed image of our character.

01:48.330 --> 01:54.330
This will have more body form to it and we'll add in the arms and possibly add a little bit of costuming

01:54.330 --> 01:55.210
in there.

01:55.680 --> 01:57.300
So I'll start with the legs.

02:02.160 --> 02:07.740
So I'm going to speed this up a little bit so it doesn't take so long for you to watch me sketch this

02:07.740 --> 02:09.240
character out.

02:09.360 --> 02:14.950
So as you can see here I'm just starting to fill out the form of our character and given him legs feet.

02:15.020 --> 02:21.400
Now I'm going to start filling in that torso and also adding costume pieces such as a scarf.

02:21.600 --> 02:25.160
Then we can start adding in our arms and hands.

02:26.750 --> 02:29.260
And remember this doesn't have to be perfect.

02:29.330 --> 02:31.640
It can be pretty rough and rigid.

02:31.940 --> 02:33.980
There doesn't have to be a ton of definition.

02:33.980 --> 02:39.550
We just want to start seeing those shapes and figuring out what our character is going to look like.

02:44.780 --> 02:50.180
Don't be afraid to mess up because you can always erase it or undo a move.

02:50.180 --> 02:55.310
So really experiment in this phase and try all different types of things until you get the character

02:55.340 --> 02:56.520
looking how you want.

02:56.780 --> 02:59.840
You can also do multiple different sketches as you'll see her soon.

02:59.840 --> 03:02.350
We'll do a second sketch of the same character

03:08.680 --> 03:09.370
as you can see.

03:09.370 --> 03:12.080
I didn't like that nose so I just took it out.

03:16.790 --> 03:18.460
It in a little bit of hair here.

03:22.640 --> 03:25.880
OK so here's a first rendition of our character.

03:25.880 --> 03:26.840
It's very simple.

03:26.840 --> 03:29.700
It's not super detailed and it's a little bit scribbly.

03:29.870 --> 03:35.030
It's not super defined in certain areas like his arm here for example but it's just to get the point

03:35.030 --> 03:35.480
across.

03:35.480 --> 03:41.030
You can start to understand where your character is what they look like what their hairstyle might be

03:41.030 --> 03:45.970
if they're holding a weapon what their pose might be their neutral pose.

03:46.220 --> 03:51.490
Now just like the thumbnail sketches it's important to do multiple versions of these.

03:51.530 --> 03:58.190
So we're going to do a second one now so I'm going to add a new layer and I'm going to turn this sketch

03:58.190 --> 03:59.990
drawing off.

03:59.990 --> 04:04.380
Now in this new layer I'm going to do the same thing but try something different.

04:04.610 --> 04:10.670
So I might change the shapes a little bit do a different costume and a different weapon.

04:10.690 --> 04:12.120
We'll just see how it goes.

04:15.100 --> 04:20.710
So I'm going to start with the legs again so in the second sketch I want to try some different things

04:20.720 --> 04:26.410
so I'm going to do some different shapes for his legs as he saw before his legs were pretty narrow and

04:26.410 --> 04:27.260
skinny.

04:27.510 --> 04:31.000
Sam I want to add some wider legs and some bigger feet.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.320
Big old boots he's wearing.

04:32.590 --> 04:34.150
Maybe a circular body.

04:36.330 --> 04:37.920
No draw on those hands.

04:39.150 --> 04:49.800
Arms.

04:49.940 --> 04:52.000
And like I said it doesn't have to be perfect.

04:52.020 --> 04:56.160
You will probably find that a lot of the sketches you do just don't go in the direction you want or

04:56.160 --> 04:57.610
they just start to look terrible.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.310
And that's completely fine.

05:07.340 --> 05:13.490
Sometimes you might get a little bit stuck so just keep moving your pen or pencil or cursor around and

05:13.490 --> 05:14.810
just keep drawing and keep drawing.

05:14.810 --> 05:18.890
You can always erase take away but just just keep making shapes.

05:18.920 --> 05:21.890
Every now and then stop and think about what you're doing.

05:22.010 --> 05:24.860
But for the most part you just want to keep moving your pencil.

05:25.740 --> 05:26.240
OK.

05:26.300 --> 05:28.670
I'm now finished with my second drawing.

05:28.940 --> 05:30.040
I don't really like it.

05:30.050 --> 05:31.910
I think it looks kind of terrible.

05:31.910 --> 05:36.980
Don't think it looks like a good character but I do like his legs and his boots.

05:37.010 --> 05:41.420
So what if you want to add a part of one sketch to another sketch.

05:41.580 --> 05:43.050
Well I'm going to show you how to do that.

05:43.900 --> 05:49.540
So the first thing we're going to do is we're going to select the legs off of our character by using

05:49.600 --> 05:50.700
the Lasso tool.

05:50.740 --> 05:58.030
So we'll just draw a shape around him like so and then we're going to copy them which is Control-C on

05:58.030 --> 06:01.610
a Windows and command C on a Mac.

06:01.630 --> 06:03.860
Next we're going to add a new layer.

06:04.090 --> 06:11.520
And now we're going to paste those in which is control VI on a Windows and command VI on a Mac.

06:11.530 --> 06:16.990
Now let's use our grab and move tool and we're going to reposition those so that they line perfectly

06:16.990 --> 06:20.160
up with the original drawing.

06:20.170 --> 06:26.190
Now we're going to turn both these layers off and by the way the way you turn layers off is by hitting

06:26.190 --> 06:31.670
this little eye next to the layer and that will make it so you can't see the layer any more.

06:31.750 --> 06:34.700
Now you can still see these legs because we have this drawing on.

06:34.870 --> 06:41.050
But if we turn that off you'll see now we can't see any of the layers except for our one layer that's

06:41.050 --> 06:42.770
on and our background.

06:44.010 --> 06:47.280
So now let's turn on our original drawing.

06:47.280 --> 06:49.320
Make sure that you have the player selected.

06:49.320 --> 06:53.400
Otherwise you're not going to be able to copy from that layer.

06:54.330 --> 06:58.780
Let's use the Lasso tool to cut out the top half.

06:59.490 --> 07:02.720
And we're just going to copy and paste it as we did before.

07:05.530 --> 07:06.570
So we've copied it.

07:06.640 --> 07:10.500
Now we're going to turn on our layer with the laig.

07:10.720 --> 07:15.160
We can turn this original drawing off.

07:15.190 --> 07:22.930
Now let's come back up to the leg layer and we're going to paste in that half of his body.

07:23.190 --> 07:29.400
I'm using the grab move tool will move him into position.

07:29.770 --> 07:35.940
And now you can see we have the legs that we liked on the top half of the body that we like.

07:36.190 --> 07:43.000
And this is how you can start splicing and slicing your sketches to start creating the character exactly

07:43.000 --> 07:44.620
as you want them.

07:44.620 --> 07:48.380
Now let's try one more with another thumbnail sketch.

07:48.730 --> 07:50.970
So we're going to come back in here.

07:51.430 --> 07:53.950
And let's select a different body.

07:54.310 --> 07:57.010
So I'm going to select this guy with the Lasso tool.

07:57.010 --> 08:01.620
Now I'm using the Lasso tool because there's other sketches pretty close to them.

08:01.720 --> 08:07.930
And by using the square marquee tool it might select bits and pieces of them and I don't want them.

08:07.930 --> 08:13.110
So now let's copy this Scott and we're going to create a new document.

08:13.720 --> 08:22.160
So again let's bring up the size to about 350 and the height to about 600.

08:22.210 --> 08:33.810
OK now we'll paste our character in there and turn down the opacity on his layer to about 30 percent.

08:33.810 --> 08:39.840
Next we're going to add that second layer above it and using our brush tool we can go ahead and get

08:39.840 --> 08:41.490
to work and start sketching.

08:41.640 --> 09:39.570
Our second design for a character.

09:39.710 --> 09:44.910
OK so I finished my first sketch and I like the idea of this character.

09:45.010 --> 09:51.280
He just wasn't sketched out very well so I want to take parts of it and I'm going to continue on with

09:51.670 --> 09:54.970
refining the sketch until it looks the way I want it.

09:56.250 --> 10:02.610
I hope this lecture was helpful for you and you got some really good insight on how a character is brainstormed

10:02.670 --> 10:04.210
and designed.

10:04.440 --> 10:05.290
Thank you for watching.

10:05.340 --> 10:07.670
And I hope to see you in the next lecture.
