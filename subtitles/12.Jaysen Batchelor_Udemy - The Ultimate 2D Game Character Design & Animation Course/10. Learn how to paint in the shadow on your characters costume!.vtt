00:00.670 --> 00:05.440
Now we're going to work on the scarf the shirt and the gloves.

00:05.440 --> 00:07.040
So let's start with the scarf.

00:07.130 --> 00:12.670
So we'll come down to the scarf layer and what we want to do is we want to add a new clipping mask layer

00:12.670 --> 00:13.770
to it.

00:14.800 --> 00:19.800
But we want it to be above all the other clothing masks.

00:19.810 --> 00:28.010
Next we're going to select the color of our scarf then we're going to change the color to a little bit

00:28.010 --> 00:29.150
darker color.

00:31.900 --> 00:35.420
Next we're going to start painting in the shadows on our scarf.

00:39.960 --> 00:45.870
And once again like I said if I can get the shape perfect with the paint brush what I'll do is I'll

00:45.870 --> 00:49.680
come back in with the eraser and erase away until I get my shape.

01:02.040 --> 01:04.260
The Haughey for the eraser is her

02:31.970 --> 02:38.250
own.

02:39.690 --> 02:40.710
Awesome.

02:40.710 --> 02:48.030
Next what I want to do is I want to create another clipping mask so out another layer and drag the above

02:48.360 --> 02:54.390
this clipping mask then we're going to select our scarf color.

02:54.390 --> 02:57.520
Now I want a lighter version of this color.

02:57.570 --> 03:33.590
So going to come up I'm going to brush my highlights.

03:33.810 --> 03:34.870
Great.

03:34.980 --> 03:40.500
Now I think my shadows are looking a little bit too dark so I'm going to come back to my shadow layer

03:40.620 --> 03:45.000
and I'm going to bring down the opacity.

03:45.040 --> 03:46.520
Think about it looks good.

03:47.310 --> 03:50.280
And I think it's the same for my highlights.

03:50.280 --> 03:52.350
So I'm going to go to my highlight layer.

03:52.440 --> 03:55.000
I'm going to bring down the opacity on that also.

03:56.020 --> 03:57.450
Right about there should be good.

03:57.460 --> 03:59.740
Now let's label all of those layers.

04:00.010 --> 04:01.260
So I'll label this highlight

04:05.760 --> 04:07.090
label the next one.

04:07.080 --> 04:07.650
Chateau

04:11.250 --> 04:13.980
and will label this last one color.

04:18.100 --> 04:19.490
Now we can close this for.

04:21.370 --> 04:24.110
Next let's move on to the shirt.

04:24.760 --> 04:31.900
So we'll come to our shirt later and we're going to create a new clipping layer that will drag that

04:31.900 --> 04:33.790
to the top.

04:33.790 --> 04:42.270
Now let's select the color of our shirt we're going to darken that almost a black will hit.

04:42.320 --> 04:49.080
OK then let's start painting on the shadow on our shirt.

05:19.470 --> 05:27.010
Remember that you can use eraser to erase areas to better create your shapes as you see me doing here.

05:59.350 --> 06:02.410
Now let's bring down the opacity on that layer.

06:04.370 --> 06:07.840
I think about 50 percent should be good.

06:07.910 --> 06:09.880
Now let's create a new clipping mask.

06:09.890 --> 06:13.810
We want this one to be below our shadow layer.

06:14.030 --> 06:19.820
Now we're going to select this blue on his gloves and using our brush while we're going to paint in

06:19.820 --> 06:21.710
some cool designs onto a shirt

06:29.750 --> 06:34.100
remember not to worry about making mistakes because you can always undo them

07:01.420 --> 07:02.420
great.

07:02.470 --> 07:08.890
So now you can see why we wanted to put this layer underneath our shadow layer so that way that the

07:08.890 --> 07:13.430
Shadows were being cast on both the brown and the blue parts of the shirt.

07:14.900 --> 07:15.630
All right.

07:15.710 --> 07:17.690
Now let's label these layers.

07:17.930 --> 07:20.420
So I'll start with the top one McCullough's chateau

07:23.570 --> 07:27.350
and move on to the next one we'll call this blue

07:30.820 --> 07:31.280
then.

07:31.310 --> 07:33.510
Let's call this last one color.

07:38.760 --> 07:41.500
Now let's close out for their.

07:41.530 --> 07:44.080
Now we can move onto the gloves.

07:44.150 --> 07:47.270
Let's create a new clipping mask.

07:48.410 --> 07:51.870
And let's bring it above our color layer.

07:52.020 --> 07:56.360
Next we're going to select this dark blue right here that's in the shadow.

07:56.460 --> 08:02.150
So we want to grab that color and now we can start painting in the shadows on the gloves.

08:02.370 --> 08:05.370
This way the shadows match the shadows on a shirt.

08:42.810 --> 08:49.070
Now right here I'm trying to create the shape of the shadows that will give the form of a thumb and

08:49.070 --> 08:49.970
a fist.

09:00.510 --> 09:05.960
Now I know that the blue and the shadow and the blue in the shadows should match.

09:06.130 --> 09:11.950
But sometimes things just don't look right and you don't have to follow rules strictly when you're creating

09:11.950 --> 09:12.740
artwork.

09:12.940 --> 09:16.670
So I'm going to bring down the opacity on these guys because I think it'll look better.

09:18.930 --> 09:23.860
I think right about there should do at 75 percent awesome.

09:24.960 --> 09:27.090
Our character is really starting to come along.
