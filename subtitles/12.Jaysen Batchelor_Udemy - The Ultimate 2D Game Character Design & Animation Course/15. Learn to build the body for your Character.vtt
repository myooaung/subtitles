00:00.710 --> 00:04.680
OK now let's go ahead and let's get started on the body.

00:04.760 --> 00:09.920
Now the body's going to be very simple because all we have to do is trace it out and fill it with a

00:09.920 --> 00:13.110
color then add some very minor details.

00:13.520 --> 00:17.520
So let's add a new layer underneath our feather layer.

00:19.630 --> 00:27.130
Then using our Lasso tool we're going to go ahead and just trace his body out.

00:27.150 --> 01:16.090
Now I'm going to leave his hands and his feet out because I plan on using a shaped tool to create those.

01:17.190 --> 01:21.040
Right now let's go ahead and fill that in with the same color as his ear

01:25.530 --> 01:27.980
fantastic next.

01:27.990 --> 01:33.490
Let's add a new layer above that then using our circular marquee tool.

01:33.510 --> 01:35.660
We're going to create those hands

01:39.620 --> 01:39.980
out.

01:39.990 --> 01:41.920
Let's go ahead and fill that in.

01:42.930 --> 01:48.300
Next what we're going to do is we're going to re select that we want to make sure we select bigger than

01:48.300 --> 01:49.650
the actual selection.

01:49.890 --> 01:57.110
That way we get everything on the outer edge and we're going to copy it and paste it will move that

01:57.110 --> 01:59.180
over to the other hand.

01:59.780 --> 02:02.810
So it next.

02:02.850 --> 02:11.130
Let's add a new layer and using the rectangular marquee tool we're going to create a selection that

02:11.160 --> 02:13.000
is the size of his foot.

02:14.130 --> 02:17.890
Now we're going to fill that in awesome.

02:18.150 --> 02:19.530
Next let's add a new layer.

02:19.560 --> 02:24.110
But we're going to add this layer behind our first body shape layer.

02:24.120 --> 02:26.410
This is going to be for this arm back here.

02:26.530 --> 02:29.910
So we're going to make it a little bit darker since it's further away.

02:30.060 --> 02:33.030
So we're going to make it appear like it's in a shadow.

02:33.850 --> 02:37.950
So come up to our color and let's bring it down just a little bit.

02:39.640 --> 02:44.590
OK then let's use our Lasso tool to select this shape.

02:54.490 --> 02:59.010
Great fill that at Awesome.

02:59.030 --> 03:01.090
Now his body is basically done.

03:01.160 --> 03:04.270
The last thing I want to do is I just want to add his chest in.

03:04.340 --> 03:08.960
So we're going to darken our color just a little bit.

03:10.070 --> 03:17.630
Then we can bring down the opacity on our body layer so we can see our sketch underneath great.

03:17.650 --> 03:21.280
And now let's add a new layer to the very top of all our layers.

03:22.780 --> 03:27.070
And using the paintbrush tool we can go ahead and paint is just an

03:35.920 --> 03:38.720
lets bring the opacity back up on his body.

03:39.810 --> 03:40.700
Great.

03:40.980 --> 03:46.050
Now I'm noticing that I kind of drew over the edge of his body so I am going to come back up to that

03:46.050 --> 03:50.280
layer and I'll just erase away that edge.

03:50.310 --> 03:51.120
Perfect.

03:51.120 --> 03:53.060
Let's zoom out and see how that looks.

03:53.860 --> 03:56.020
Awesome looks very naked.

03:56.020 --> 03:56.740
But don't worry.

03:56.740 --> 04:01.390
In the next lecture we're going to add a loincloth form before we do.

04:01.400 --> 04:04.670
Let's go ahead and merge some of these layers together.

04:04.670 --> 04:06.690
Now we want his whole body to be one piece.

04:06.740 --> 04:09.380
And this back arm to be one piece.

04:09.380 --> 04:13.330
So first let's put this back arm and his hands together.

04:13.640 --> 04:15.680
Let's find his hand.

04:16.520 --> 04:20.410
So those are his hand and his back arm is the very bottom layer.

04:20.410 --> 04:24.500
So we're going to dry it drag this hand all the way down to the bottom.

04:24.530 --> 04:26.880
So now we can select both of them.

04:29.240 --> 04:30.480
Merging together.

04:32.450 --> 04:34.100
So now that's one.

04:34.190 --> 04:39.540
Now let's select all the other layers and merge those together.

04:39.590 --> 04:40.800
Great.

04:40.820 --> 04:46.910
Now looks like both of those and let's put them into a folder and we'll call this folder body.
