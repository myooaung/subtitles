Now the reason why freelancing sites are so great is because of the fact that you can work from anywhere

00:06.660 --> 00:12.440
in the world with anyone in the world as long as you have a wife connection.

00:12.870 --> 00:20.060
That means that you have a very very large pool of employers and projects that you can take from.

00:20.070 --> 00:22.250
Let me show you down here at the bottom.

00:22.560 --> 00:26.070
They have they tell you how many jobs are posted at this time.

00:26.070 --> 00:29.400
And right now it's almost 8.5 million.

00:29.460 --> 00:32.290
That is a ton of jobs.

00:32.370 --> 00:37.530
So if you wanted to travel the world and work at the same time this is definitely a way you could do

00:37.530 --> 00:38.290
it.

00:38.330 --> 00:39.760
I'm sure you where the work is.

00:39.870 --> 00:44.460
So if you come up here to the work tab and we come down to browse projects.

00:44.460 --> 00:47.800
Whoops I accidentally clicked something else.

00:48.570 --> 00:49.580
Try that again.

00:49.620 --> 00:51.510
So we come to the work tab.

00:51.510 --> 00:53.420
We go to browse projects

00:55.900 --> 00:58.950
and that will allow us to search projects.

00:58.940 --> 01:05.320
So right now I have the search word game in there and we also want to add some skill tags.

01:05.500 --> 01:07.450
So we're going to put in illustration

01:09.950 --> 01:11.420
and a graphic design

01:14.480 --> 01:21.080
great so now you'll see it gives us a bunch of jobs that have the word game in them and have the skill

01:21.080 --> 01:27.760
sets of illustration and graphic design and you'll see they just go on for ever and ever.

01:27.830 --> 01:31.840
Not really but there are a lot of jobs.

01:32.120 --> 01:34.360
Let's find one that we want to take a look at.

01:41.540 --> 01:47.180
Let's have a look at this guy.

01:47.510 --> 01:51.970
So they have their budget here and they have the average bid for you.

01:51.980 --> 01:56.890
How many bidders are are it freelancers are bidding on it.

01:56.930 --> 01:59.780
They have the full description here for the project.

01:59.990 --> 02:03.860
And then if you come down here you can see all the different freelancers that you're going up against

02:03.920 --> 02:07.940
and you can go to their profile pages and have a look at their portfolios.

02:08.240 --> 02:12.830
And it's a very good way to study your competition and figure out how you're going to differentiate

02:12.830 --> 02:17.000
yourself from the competition.

02:17.000 --> 02:22.280
Now if this was a full fledged account it would allow me to bid on the project but I can't because I

02:22.280 --> 02:24.630
don't have my information in this account.

02:24.800 --> 02:30.020
But if it were a real account there would be a button down here that would allow you to bid on the project

02:30.320 --> 02:32.580
and you would just click that and it would come up with a form.

02:32.600 --> 02:38.330
And on this form you would put in your bid and you would also put in a small message that you would

02:38.330 --> 02:44.480
send to the employer stating why you should have the job or what you think you could do for them that

02:44.480 --> 02:46.710
would benefit them more than everybody else.
