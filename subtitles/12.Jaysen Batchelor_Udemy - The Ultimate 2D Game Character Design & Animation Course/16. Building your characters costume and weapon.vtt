00:00.530 --> 00:07.490
Now let's go ahead and let's finish up our character so we're going to add a new layer above the body

00:07.490 --> 00:08.860
folder.

00:09.380 --> 00:12.560
Next let's select a light yellowish gray color.

00:12.560 --> 00:16.340
So somewhere in here will come down to the yellows.

00:16.460 --> 00:17.940
OK.

00:17.960 --> 00:18.960
And using our brush tool.

00:18.980 --> 00:22.880
We're just going to brush a string across his waist.

00:24.870 --> 00:26.590
Just like that.

00:26.590 --> 00:34.270
Next let's add a new layer above that and we're going to come back down to our body folder and we're

00:34.270 --> 00:42.070
going to turn down the opacity so we can see our sketch come back up to our new layer then we're going

00:42.070 --> 00:49.400
to select a color maybe more towards the orange side.

00:49.400 --> 00:51.850
Something around there should be good.

00:52.020 --> 01:06.430
Then using our Lasso tool we're going to trace out this loincloth.

01:06.490 --> 01:10.750
Now let's go ahead and fill that in with our tan color.

01:11.260 --> 01:14.650
Next we're going to grab a dark brown color.

01:16.840 --> 01:19.760
Some around there should be good.

01:19.870 --> 01:26.050
Then we're going to create a new layer and we're going to turn this layer into a clipping mask.

01:27.800 --> 01:31.570
And now this is a clipping mask for a loincloth.

01:31.570 --> 01:33.820
Now let's use our brush.

01:34.000 --> 01:42.530
Bring on the size then we're just going to paint in the edges of our loincloth like so

01:50.400 --> 01:51.330
awesome.

01:51.890 --> 01:54.640
Now we can unselect out of that.

01:54.650 --> 01:58.920
Now let's turn the opacity back up on our body layer.

02:00.460 --> 02:00.840
Cool.

02:00.850 --> 02:02.680
So you can see it's really coming along.

02:02.890 --> 02:06.300
Now let's go ahead and put all of these layers in a folder.

02:07.260 --> 02:14.210
We'll call that folder loincloth.

02:14.250 --> 02:15.920
Let's create a new layer.

02:15.990 --> 02:19.120
But we want to create this layer underneath the body folder.

02:20.210 --> 02:25.130
Now using our last tool we're going to trace out the shape of the spear handle

02:30.380 --> 02:35.510
like so and then we can probably use the same dark brown that we have here.

02:35.540 --> 02:38.400
So we'll go ahead and fill that in.

02:38.540 --> 02:44.450
And now we still have the shapes selected We're going to select this green color in his eye.

02:44.970 --> 02:46.480
Switching over to the brush tool.

02:46.520 --> 02:51.530
We're going to paint in two stripes on the handle.

02:51.530 --> 02:52.660
I just think that looks cool.

02:53.790 --> 03:00.000
Next let's add a new layer above that we can unselect out of this selection.

03:00.570 --> 03:06.480
Then let's switch over to the Lasso tool and make sure you're on the Lasso tool and not the polygon

03:06.480 --> 03:08.550
or Lasso tool.

03:08.710 --> 03:12.450
Then using this just trace out these feathers as best you can.

03:12.460 --> 03:13.540
You don't have to look perfect

03:19.930 --> 03:22.650
then select the red and his feathers.

03:22.930 --> 03:25.640
And we're going to fill these feathers in with the same color.

03:27.010 --> 03:34.060
Great then we're going to add a new layer and we're going to drag that layer underneath our feathers

03:34.060 --> 03:37.450
layer on our spear.

03:37.450 --> 03:43.450
Now on this new layer we're going to use this circular marquee tool and we're going to create an oval

03:43.660 --> 03:51.700
about the size of our spear head then we're going to select a dark gray color and we're going to drag

03:51.700 --> 03:53.530
it out more towards the blue side.

03:55.410 --> 03:57.450
We'll hit OK.

03:57.770 --> 04:00.660
Now let's fill that shapen.

04:01.150 --> 04:06.970
Now if you switch back over to your marquee tool if you were to click outside of this selection it would

04:07.060 --> 04:07.980
unselective this.

04:07.990 --> 04:13.540
But if you click on the inside what you're able to do is you're able to click and drag your selection

04:13.540 --> 04:17.210
around without moving the actual image itself.

04:17.230 --> 04:19.310
So that's what we want we're going to move it over.

04:20.100 --> 04:23.950
Too about there looks good.

04:24.170 --> 04:28.670
And then we want to invert the selection because what we want to do is we want to delete everything

04:28.700 --> 04:31.230
on this side of the Oval.

04:31.520 --> 04:35.690
So if we were to hit delete now it would delete everything inside the Oval.

04:35.690 --> 04:41.690
So the way we're going to invert our selection is by hitting control shift I if you're working on a

04:41.690 --> 04:48.530
Windows if you're working on a Mac you're going to hit command I and that will invert your selection.

04:48.710 --> 04:54.140
So you can see it's inverted r selection there's a dotted line on the outer edge of our document and

04:54.140 --> 04:55.870
there's also this dotted line here.

04:56.030 --> 05:00.610
So everything within this area is going to be deleted.

05:00.620 --> 05:04.890
So let's hit delete and that deletes it for us.

05:04.900 --> 05:10.300
Now let's grab and move this and we'll bring it down.

05:10.400 --> 05:14.770
So it's fitting into the spearhead now using my arrow keys on my keyboard.

05:14.780 --> 05:19.460
I'm just going to nudge it into place right about there should be good.

05:19.900 --> 05:21.990
Let's add a new layer above this one.

05:23.170 --> 05:26.460
Then let's make that layer a clipping mask.

05:27.880 --> 05:33.780
I'm going to grab a little bit lighter gray color but there should be good.

05:33.900 --> 05:40.560
Then using my brush and bringing the size down I'm just going to add sort of a stem through my spearhead

05:40.860 --> 05:43.160
like so.

05:43.200 --> 05:44.310
All right.

05:44.310 --> 05:45.810
We just finished the character.

05:46.110 --> 05:49.290
That was pretty quick for creating an entire character.

05:49.290 --> 05:53.280
Now we're going to go ahead and move on to actually animating this character.

05:53.400 --> 05:55.580
Can't wait to see you in the next lecture.

05:55.590 --> 05:56.510
See you there.
