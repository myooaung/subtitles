WEBVTT

00:00.940 --> 00:01.710
All right.

00:01.780 --> 00:08.380
Before we dive into the projects of this course I want to go over the basics of Photoshop and the basic

00:08.380 --> 00:11.040
tools we'll be using throughout this course.

00:11.080 --> 00:16.440
Now if you have experience with Photoshop I suggest that you go ahead and skip this lecture.

00:16.540 --> 00:18.830
As you probably already know all about it.

00:18.940 --> 00:24.310
If not I really suggest that you stick around and learn the tools that we'll be using throughout this

00:24.310 --> 00:24.970
course.

00:25.000 --> 00:30.410
You're going to need an understanding of this in order to create the projects that we do.

00:30.850 --> 00:33.060
So let's go ahead and let's get started.

00:33.490 --> 00:38.140
So the first thing I want to show you how to do in Photoshop is I want to show you how to create a new

00:38.140 --> 00:39.290
document.

00:39.310 --> 00:44.030
Now this is pretty simple but just in case you don't understand how to do it I'm going to show you.

00:44.080 --> 00:46.030
So you're going to come up to file.

00:46.390 --> 00:48.570
You're going to go to new.

00:48.640 --> 00:53.680
And now you have a box where you can fill out the information about your custom document so you can

00:53.680 --> 00:56.920
change the width the height and the resolution.

00:56.920 --> 01:02.960
You can also change the type of color mode but I suggest you don't mess with that.

01:03.250 --> 01:08.530
So we're going to keep it at the size it is now and the resolution if you want to change yours you can

01:08.530 --> 01:10.330
go ahead and do that.

01:10.330 --> 01:11.490
So let's go ahead and.

01:11.530 --> 01:12.820
OK.

01:12.880 --> 01:14.680
Now we have a new document.

01:14.980 --> 01:22.000
Now I'm going to hop back over into my other document because I want to show you some examples and demonstrations

01:22.090 --> 01:26.450
and I need an image to work on in order for me to be able to do this.

01:27.300 --> 01:29.990
Let's go ahead and let's get started with the first tool.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.170
So the first tool we're going to be using is the grabbing move tool.

01:34.170 --> 01:38.200
This tool can be used to click and grab objects on a layer.

01:38.610 --> 01:44.380
So if we click and grab as can't move them right now because his layer is locked on.

01:44.400 --> 01:45.860
I'll show you what that means.

01:46.050 --> 01:52.440
Over here in the right hand side of the screen where I'm circling is the layer that we're trying to

01:52.440 --> 01:53.510
select.

01:53.700 --> 01:55.760
Right now it has a lock symbol next to it.

01:55.770 --> 01:59.360
That means that the layer is locked and not much can be done to it.

01:59.580 --> 02:02.830
So if we go ahead and click that it will unlock the layer.

02:02.850 --> 02:09.400
Now if we come back to our image we can click it and drag it around and move it around.

02:09.420 --> 02:14.160
So that's what the grab and move tool does put him back into position.

02:14.160 --> 02:18.670
Now let's move on to the next tool the next tool is the marquee tool.

02:18.750 --> 02:25.440
Now with the marquee tool you can select an area and then you can grab and move that area.

02:25.440 --> 02:28.410
So now we come back to our grab and move tool.

02:28.440 --> 02:31.950
You can click and move that around.

02:32.190 --> 02:34.960
Put that back into position.

02:34.980 --> 02:40.740
There are multiple marquee tools so if you click and hold on the marquee tool will come up with a little

02:40.740 --> 02:41.930
window next to it.

02:41.970 --> 02:46.620
You can select these different types of marquee tools the ones we'll be using are the rectangular and

02:46.710 --> 02:48.390
the elliptical marquee tool.

02:48.570 --> 02:51.900
So let's select the elliptical and see what that does.

02:51.900 --> 02:59.040
So now if we click and drag it you'll see we can create an elliptical selection and then we can grab

02:59.100 --> 03:02.140
and move that selection.

03:02.220 --> 03:07.850
So the marquee tool is very useful for all kinds of things.

03:07.860 --> 03:12.570
Now I want to put this piece back into its position but I don't want to have to do it by hand.

03:12.570 --> 03:20.970
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to undo this by going up to add and undo move the next tool we're

03:20.970 --> 03:29.070
going to be going over is the Lasso tool the Lasso tool is right here underneath the grab a move tool.

03:29.070 --> 03:32.320
Now the Lasso tool is also a selection tool.

03:32.340 --> 03:36.580
The differences you can create organic shapes and custom shapes.

03:36.600 --> 03:37.710
I'll show you what I mean.

03:37.980 --> 03:42.830
So if I click with the Lasso tool you'll see a creates a line.

03:43.110 --> 03:46.740
And wherever I click Next it'll solidify that line.

03:46.740 --> 03:51.390
So if I click up here that line is now there permanently.

03:51.720 --> 03:59.430
And what I can do is I can just keep clicking around so I can click around my dog character and you

03:59.430 --> 04:02.850
get the idea that you can cut stuff out this way.

04:02.850 --> 04:08.250
Now this is a very rigid shape and it's not very organic.

04:08.250 --> 04:14.760
So what you would want to do in a real situation is you would want to very carefully do small lines

04:14.820 --> 04:17.550
all the way around your character to cut him out.

04:18.290 --> 04:23.800
But you'll see now if I use my grab a move tool I can click and drag my shape around.

04:23.930 --> 04:27.040
I'm going to undo that.

04:27.080 --> 04:29.050
Now there's a second Lasso tool.

04:29.100 --> 04:34.610
If we click and hold down the Lasso tool you'll see we have the regular Lasso tool.

04:34.610 --> 04:39.850
The one we were just using was the Polygonum Lasso tool which is this one right here.

04:39.950 --> 04:43.630
So we're going to go ahead and select the Lasso tool.

04:43.700 --> 04:48.230
You'll see what the last tool we can do is we can actually draw a selection.

04:48.230 --> 04:55.220
So if I click and start drawing with the Lasso tool it creates a very organic shape that I can then

04:55.550 --> 05:01.220
cut out and select If I grab my select tool we can move that around.

05:02.180 --> 05:05.950
So this too is also very useful.

05:05.960 --> 05:07.650
Let's undo that.

05:08.250 --> 05:09.170
OK.

05:09.260 --> 05:11.990
Now I want to go over hot keys with you.

05:12.210 --> 05:19.190
Well hockeys are there keys on your keyboard that you can press to quickly select a tool.

05:19.190 --> 05:26.900
So we're going to start with the hot key for the grab move tool grab a move tool is going to be the

05:26.900 --> 05:28.890
letter V on your keyboard.

05:29.120 --> 05:34.190
Now for demonstration purposes I'm going to select a different tool so you can see how it will switch

05:34.510 --> 05:35.950
when I hit the letter V.

05:36.230 --> 05:41.490
So I'm going to add the letter V now and you'll see my tool switches to the grab and move tool.

05:41.690 --> 05:44.890
So now I can grab move this.

05:45.040 --> 05:50.530
Now let's go over the hockey for the marquee tool the hot key for the marquee tool is going to be the

05:50.530 --> 05:51.400
letter M.

05:51.430 --> 05:52.210
So we'll hit.

05:53.330 --> 05:58.880
And you'll see that our tool changes to the marquee tool.

05:58.980 --> 06:06.150
Now lastly let's go over the last tool as you can probably guess the hot for the Lasso tool is the letter

06:06.370 --> 06:12.550
L L and now we have the Lasso tool selected and we can use that tool.

06:13.530 --> 06:17.490
Now you can imagine how useful these hot keys are while you're working.

06:17.520 --> 06:24.180
It makes your workflow so much faster because rather than having to go all the way over to other parts

06:24.180 --> 06:28.920
of the screen to select Tools you can just hit a key on your keyboard very quickly and a little switch

06:28.920 --> 06:32.380
between all the different tools that you need to be using.

06:32.520 --> 06:34.150
Let's go over the last tool.

06:34.170 --> 06:36.190
We'll be reviewing in this lecture.

06:36.330 --> 06:42.420
It's the brush tool the brush was very useful and Photoshop and it's just like it sounds.

06:42.450 --> 06:44.510
It's a paintbrush in Photoshop.

06:45.280 --> 06:49.840
So before we get started with it let's unselect out of this selection by just clicking somewhere else

06:49.840 --> 06:50.710
on the screen.

06:50.950 --> 06:53.320
And now we've unselected our selection.

06:53.710 --> 06:59.880
Now we're going to go to the brush tool which is this little paint brush icon on the left upper side.

07:00.130 --> 07:01.390
So click that.

07:01.810 --> 07:03.670
And now we have our brush selected.

07:03.760 --> 07:10.530
So now you'll see if we click and drag we can paint a line or if we just tap once we can create a circle.

07:10.600 --> 07:14.350
So it's just like a normal brush in real life.

07:14.350 --> 07:16.580
Now what if you want to change the color of your brush.

07:16.610 --> 07:17.400
Well it's very simple.

07:17.400 --> 07:23.500
You just come over here to the color on the left side of the screen and you click it and now you can

07:23.520 --> 07:29.170
select any color you want by clicking anywhere on the color palette or by moving up and down the color

07:29.170 --> 07:30.900
spectrum.

07:31.180 --> 07:37.870
So let's select a green and we'll make it as green as possible by pulling the all the way up to the

07:37.870 --> 07:39.530
corner and then we're going hit.

07:39.550 --> 07:41.320
OK.

07:41.590 --> 07:44.570
Now you'll see that we're painting with the color green.

07:44.590 --> 07:47.020
It's pretty cool and pretty useful.

07:47.140 --> 07:52.480
But now let's say that you want the edge of your brush to be a very hard sharp line instead of this

07:52.480 --> 07:54.620
soft line that it's creating right now.

07:54.880 --> 08:00.700
Well the way you change that is by coming over here to this icon that looks like a can with brushes

08:00.700 --> 08:02.780
in it and you're going to select it.

08:03.070 --> 08:06.360
Now you can see you have all these different brush types that you can select.

08:06.610 --> 08:11.860
So you'll see we have a hard edged brush which we can select down here in the preview window you can

08:11.860 --> 08:14.140
see what that brush will look like.

08:14.140 --> 08:21.940
You can select this more wispy brush or come down you can see that there are all kinds of brushes.

08:21.970 --> 08:25.270
Everything from grass to the leaves to rain drops.

08:25.270 --> 08:28.320
So it's like the leaf one and see what that looks like.

08:28.330 --> 08:32.280
And now you can see we can create a trail of leaves.

08:32.500 --> 08:34.940
But what if you want to see those leaves even better.

08:35.020 --> 08:41.680
You can spaced those leaves out by coming over here to the spacing bar and by dragging it up it'll put

08:41.680 --> 08:45.790
space between each stamp that it lays down.

08:45.790 --> 08:51.520
So now when we paint with it you can see the leaves a lot better if you want to change the size of your

08:51.520 --> 08:51.990
brush.

08:52.000 --> 08:57.670
You simply just come up here to the side bar and you can drag that up or down.

08:58.480 --> 09:03.850
So let's drag it way down and you'll see that are you can't even see or brush anymore because it's so

09:03.850 --> 09:04.450
small.

09:04.450 --> 09:09.150
Now let's bring it up and you'll see it's a lot bigger.

09:09.340 --> 09:14.950
Now you're probably thinking that this is going to be very time consuming to come up here every time.

09:14.950 --> 09:18.210
Select your brush change the size and the spacing.

09:18.350 --> 09:22.490
Well luckily there is a way that you can do this with your hockeys.

09:22.900 --> 09:26.660
So the hot key to select your brush is the letter B.

09:26.680 --> 09:31.690
So if we select a different tool and then we hit the letter B you'll see it switches over to our brush

09:31.690 --> 09:32.650
tool.

09:32.650 --> 09:37.880
Now if you want to change your size of the hockey it's going to be different in Windows and Mac.

09:38.140 --> 09:47.360
So I'll go over both the hocky for Windows is going to be Allt and then right click and then you'll

09:47.360 --> 09:54.470
see that when you drag your mouse back and forth it's going to increase and decrease the size of your

09:54.470 --> 09:55.230
brush.

09:56.150 --> 10:03.230
The Mac it's going to be option command and you're going to do the same thing you're going to hold down

10:03.290 --> 10:05.720
and drag back and forth.

10:05.720 --> 10:06.730
So let's try it now.

10:06.740 --> 10:14.120
So we'll go Olt Right-Click and on a Mac you're going to go option command.

10:14.340 --> 10:16.770
And now we're going to drag this back and forth.

10:16.860 --> 10:19.490
So let's make our brush very big.

10:21.900 --> 10:25.740
Now you'll see that we have a ginormous brush.

10:25.800 --> 10:26.100
All right.

10:26.100 --> 10:26.700
Cool.

10:26.790 --> 10:33.940
Let's undo that now another way you can change the size of your brush is by hitting the square brackets

10:33.970 --> 10:35.140
on your keyboard.

10:35.200 --> 10:40.360
So the left hand side the square bracket is going to decrease the size of your brush when you press

10:40.360 --> 10:45.810
it the right hand side square bracket is going to increase your brush size.

10:47.940 --> 10:54.290
Now another thing you can do with the hockeys is you can change the opacity of your brush.

10:54.310 --> 11:00.430
Now what the opacity is is it's just the see throughness of the brush color.

11:00.460 --> 11:06.850
Now the way you do this is by holding down Olt and then right click like you would on a Windows and

11:06.880 --> 11:09.480
you're going to go option command like you would on a Mac.

11:09.610 --> 11:15.760
But this time instead of dragging from left to right we're going to drag up and down and you'll see

11:15.820 --> 11:23.980
on our little meter that says diameter and opacity on the opacity you'll see that it's the percentage

11:24.040 --> 11:25.730
is going up and down.

11:26.080 --> 11:30.650
If we bring our opacity very low let's say 21 percent.

11:30.850 --> 11:36.610
Now we paint with it you'll see that our brush is a very see through changing the opacity of things

11:36.610 --> 11:41.200
and Photoshop is very useful and we'll be using it throughout the course.

11:41.200 --> 11:46.200
Another way you can change the opacity of your brush is by hitting the numbers at the top of your keyboard.

11:46.390 --> 11:52.460
So if we hit the number zero on her keyboard that will make our opacity 100 percent.

11:52.480 --> 11:54.850
So now you'll see it's not see through at all.

11:54.910 --> 11:58.010
If we come all the way down and hit the number four.

11:58.150 --> 12:05.710
It's a lot more see through the last hocky I want to go over with you is the edit undo hot key now rather

12:05.710 --> 12:08.660
than always coming up to edit undo to undo things.

12:08.890 --> 12:15.100
And believe me you will be undoing things a lot as you create your artwork in Photoshop.

12:15.100 --> 12:17.270
The key on Windows is going to be.

12:17.280 --> 12:18.720
Control Z.

12:19.850 --> 12:24.170
That will undo the last move that you did on your document.

12:24.170 --> 12:31.430
Now if you want to continue to undo movements on your document you're going to go control alt Z and

12:31.430 --> 12:36.000
you have to press that every time you want to continue to undo a step.

12:37.140 --> 12:40.110
On a Mac you're going to hit command shift.

12:40.120 --> 12:43.680
Easy to undo your last step.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.330
You made it through this lecture.

12:45.330 --> 12:46.250
Great job.

12:47.050 --> 12:52.870
Now your assignment is going to be to create something in photoshop with the tools I just showed you.

12:52.990 --> 12:54.950
It doesn't have to be very spectacular.

12:55.120 --> 13:01.700
You can just create anything to demonstrate that you understand the tools once you've created something.

13:01.700 --> 13:08.860
Go ahead and share it to the Q&amp;A section of this course so we can all see the progress that you're making.

13:08.900 --> 13:12.410
So I hope to see your artwork soon in the Q&amp;A section of the course.

13:12.650 --> 13:15.160
And I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.
