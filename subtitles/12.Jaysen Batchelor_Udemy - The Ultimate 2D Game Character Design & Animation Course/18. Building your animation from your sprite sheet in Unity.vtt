00:00.760 --> 00:04.920
OK you guys let's go ahead and let's bring our animation into unity.

00:05.230 --> 00:10.570
So the first thing we need to do and we create a new document and unity is we need to come down here

00:10.570 --> 00:16.720
to where it says assets in the bottom of the screen and we're going to right click in there and then

00:16.720 --> 00:21.580
we're going to come up to her says create and then we're going to create a folder which is the first

00:21.580 --> 00:23.010
one on that list.

00:23.110 --> 00:24.390
Go ahead and click that.

00:24.550 --> 00:28.630
And let's call her folder animation.

00:28.810 --> 00:30.000
Great.

00:30.020 --> 00:33.770
Now next we want to do is we want to import our sprite sheet.

00:33.880 --> 00:38.860
So the way we're going to do that is by right clicking on our folder coming up to where it says import

00:38.860 --> 00:46.040
new asset we'll click that and then we're going to grab our sprite sheet wherever you've saved as a

00:46.400 --> 00:50.680
ngi number going to import that great.

00:50.690 --> 00:52.280
So now that's imported.

00:52.370 --> 00:54.770
We need to change our sprite mode.

00:54.800 --> 01:00.360
Up here in the top right corner of the screen and we need to change that to multiple.

01:00.440 --> 01:05.530
This means that there is going to be multiple sprites on our sprite sheet which you can see down here

01:05.540 --> 01:09.350
obviously our characters are multiple frames.

01:09.410 --> 01:17.560
So next what we want to do is we want to change our compressed format to true color.

01:17.600 --> 01:22.460
What that's going to do is it's going to give us the true original color that we created our character

01:22.520 --> 01:29.410
in there we're going to go ahead and apply next roll we want to do is we want to come up here to where

01:29.410 --> 01:34.810
it says Spryte Ed. We're going to go ahead and click that and you'll see it brings up a little window

01:34.810 --> 01:36.650
here with our sprite sheet.

01:36.990 --> 01:41.060
But we need to do is we need to cut these out into separate sprites.

01:41.290 --> 01:46.180
Luckily in unity there is a software an algorithm that will automatically do that for you.

01:46.180 --> 01:52.300
So we're going to come up here to work a slice and we're going to leave the type automatic and the pivot

01:52.360 --> 01:54.960
at the Center for the purposes of this course.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.920
I'm just going to be showing you how to bring these into unity and get them set up for animation but

01:59.950 --> 02:04.410
I'm not really going to go into any detail on how you incorporate this into your game.

02:04.510 --> 02:10.910
So what we'll do is we'll just leave it as is and we're going to go ahead and slice.

02:11.060 --> 02:17.120
Now as you can see it's sliced each one of our character out and anything that has no pixels on it is

02:17.120 --> 02:18.570
going to be left out.

02:18.590 --> 02:21.920
So each one of these are their own individual Spryte now.

02:22.040 --> 02:26.710
Go ahead and hit apply appear in the top of the screen great.

02:26.780 --> 02:30.740
Once that's been applied we can go ahead and exit out of this window.

02:31.130 --> 02:36.310
And next what we want to do is we want to create a new game object.

02:36.320 --> 02:43.550
So over here in the create tab we're going to right click and come down to where it says create empty

02:45.020 --> 02:48.370
and not just created a new game object for us.

02:48.370 --> 02:53.350
Next what we want to do is we want to relabel that game object so up here and the top or right hand

02:53.350 --> 02:56.060
side of the screen where it says game object.

02:56.080 --> 02:58.060
We're going to rename that character

03:00.950 --> 03:04.260
next what we need to do is we need to add an animation tab.

03:04.310 --> 03:09.620
So coming over to the left side of our screen towards the top is a little drop down icon.

03:09.620 --> 03:14.360
We're going to go ahead and click that it's right next to this lock icon and then we're going to come

03:14.360 --> 03:15.710
down to add.

03:16.040 --> 03:21.230
And then we're going to come down all the way to animation and we're going to add that in Cinelli added

03:21.320 --> 03:23.610
an animation tab in there for us.

03:23.870 --> 03:26.970
You can go ahead and widen that if we like.

03:27.050 --> 03:32.330
Now what we need to do is we need to create our first animation so we're going to go ahead and hit create

03:34.510 --> 03:36.310
and we need to name our animation now.

03:36.310 --> 03:43.290
So the first one is going to be you walk right go ahead and save.

03:43.290 --> 03:43.700
Great.

03:43.720 --> 03:46.170
So we just created our first animation.

03:46.300 --> 03:51.820
But as of now there are no frames in our animation so we need to put those into our animation.

03:51.890 --> 03:55.200
We come down here to our sprites in the assets folder.

03:55.450 --> 03:59.730
You'll see that there is a arrow next to our sprite sheets.

03:59.740 --> 04:03.700
We need to click that and it'll open up each one of our sprites.

04:03.700 --> 04:09.810
And what we want to do is we want to select all of the sprites that are part of the walk right cycle.

04:09.820 --> 04:13.030
So that would be from this guy to this guy.

04:13.030 --> 04:18.890
We're going to click and drag those into our animation timeline and now they've been added in.

04:18.910 --> 04:23.430
Now let's go ahead and play it by hitting the play button here and see how it looks.

04:23.500 --> 04:24.040
All right.

04:24.100 --> 04:26.140
As you can see it's way too fast.

04:26.170 --> 04:31.390
So let's go ahead and pause that the way we can change the speed of our animation is by coming over

04:31.390 --> 04:37.480
here to where it says samples and then what we need to do is we need to change the number 60 to a smaller

04:37.480 --> 04:38.170
number.

04:38.470 --> 04:42.050
So I'm going to go with something more like 8.

04:42.300 --> 04:44.590
And now let's play that and see how it looks.

04:45.750 --> 04:47.660
Now looks much better.

04:47.670 --> 04:48.210
Great.

04:48.210 --> 04:51.550
Now let's go ahead and let's create our next animation.

04:51.870 --> 04:56.710
So what we'll do is coming right here to this dropdown tab that says Walk right.

04:56.820 --> 05:02.590
We're going to click that and then we can come down here to where it says create new clip and we're

05:02.590 --> 05:06.620
just going to do the same thing again but this time we're going to name our animation.

05:06.700 --> 05:08.410
Jump right.

05:10.550 --> 05:14.380
Go ahead save and let's do the same thing once again.

05:14.410 --> 05:21.790
We'll select all of our jump right sprites which would be this guy to this guy and we're going to click

05:21.850 --> 05:24.090
and drag them into the animation timeline.

05:25.240 --> 05:30.990
Now we can go ahead and change our sample rate or frame rate to eight frames per second.

05:31.590 --> 05:33.880
Then let's go ahead and play that and see how it looks.

05:35.270 --> 05:36.520
Great.

05:36.530 --> 05:42.080
Now you'll notice that when he jumps he's not actually moving up into the air like he was before.

05:42.080 --> 05:47.300
Now the reason for this is because when you're playing a game you don't want your character's animation

05:47.300 --> 05:47.930
to jump up.

05:47.930 --> 05:50.610
You want his actual object to jump up.

05:50.750 --> 05:55.760
So it needs to be built into the physics of the game that the character goes up when the spacebar or

05:55.760 --> 05:59.070
whatever key triggers the jump is pressed.

05:59.450 --> 06:02.230
So that's why he's not moving up.

06:02.270 --> 06:05.450
All right let's go ahead and create our final animation.

06:05.810 --> 06:12.200
So we'll go ahead and click where this bar says jump right we'll create a new clip we'll call this one

06:13.040 --> 06:22.520
hover right save and we'll grab all of our hover sprites and we'll drop them into our timeline.

06:23.400 --> 06:28.600
Change the sample rate to 8 and let's play that and see how it looks.

06:30.700 --> 06:32.070
Awesome.

06:32.110 --> 06:38.440
So now just go ahead and do that with the other left side of your sprites and you'll be set and ready

06:38.440 --> 06:40.300
to start creating your game.

06:40.350 --> 06:46.300
Now depending on whether you're a programmer or an artist you may not need this information but it's

06:46.300 --> 06:47.470
good information have.

06:47.500 --> 06:52.750
Even if you are an artist because it's good to understand parts of the process of programming if you're

06:52.750 --> 06:56.430
going to be creating game artwork for programmers.

06:56.860 --> 06:59.430
Well that brings us to the end of this course.

06:59.530 --> 07:04.510
I'm so glad that you decided to join me in this course and learn how to animate your own characters

07:04.510 --> 07:05.630
in Photoshop.

07:06.540 --> 07:11.760
If you have any questions at all go out and ask them in the Q&amp;A section of the course and I will answer

07:11.790 --> 07:14.620
every question guaranteed.

07:14.630 --> 07:18.560
Thanks for taking this course and I just want to let you know I appreciate you as a student.
