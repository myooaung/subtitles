00:00.850 --> 00:05.130
All right now let's start adding some real detail to our character.

00:05.370 --> 00:11.910
So we're going to start off with his facial features which will be in the head folder starting on the

00:11.910 --> 00:13.050
head layer.

00:13.290 --> 00:18.210
So we're going to add a new layer above our clipping mask.

00:18.210 --> 00:21.880
This way it won't create a clipping mask within the head.

00:21.930 --> 00:27.400
That's not what we want because we're going to create clipping masks within this layer.

00:27.420 --> 00:34.190
First we want to add a new layer above our clipping mask so add a new layer.

00:34.190 --> 00:42.060
Next we want to do is we want to use the circular murky tool to create an oval this oval is almost going

00:42.060 --> 00:46.580
to be a circle about like that.

00:46.580 --> 00:54.450
Next we're going to do is we're going to fill that in with our field tool and the color white and mastic.

00:54.470 --> 00:57.320
Now this is going to be the base for I.

00:57.560 --> 00:58.690
Now let's rotate it.

00:58.760 --> 01:06.260
So using the Transform Tool which is control t on a Windows and command on a Mac are going to rotate

01:06.870 --> 01:11.020
our eye just a little bit about there will be do.

01:11.030 --> 01:14.420
Now this new layer is going to be turned into a clipping mask.

01:14.420 --> 01:20.390
So once again we'll come up to layer and come down to create coping mass.

01:20.510 --> 01:24.840
Now using a brush tool going to use a hard edged brush.

01:26.550 --> 01:28.920
And about the size it is now will do.

01:29.200 --> 01:33.610
And we're going to create our iris.

01:33.640 --> 01:38.490
So I want to use a color very similar to this brown up here.

01:42.720 --> 01:48.750
So bring that up and I think I actually wanted to be a little bit more towards the yellow side so I'll

01:48.750 --> 01:50.500
bring that up also.

01:50.640 --> 01:51.190
OK.

01:52.450 --> 01:53.760
Switch back to the brush.

01:55.200 --> 01:58.150
And I'm going to enlarge the iris just by a little bit.

01:59.780 --> 02:03.530
And then I'm going to go ahead and put one dot in desirous.

02:04.390 --> 02:07.150
Now you'll have to play around with the placement of his iris.

02:07.150 --> 02:16.240
But luckily sensitizes own layer you can grab it and move it and change the direction of where his eyes

02:16.240 --> 02:17.110
looking.

02:17.110 --> 02:18.010
So it's pretty cool.

02:18.070 --> 02:21.020
So play around with that and decide where you want your character looking.

02:25.200 --> 02:26.960
I think about there is good for me.

02:27.620 --> 02:31.730
Next what I want to do is I want to paint in his pupil.

02:31.730 --> 02:36.520
So what we'll do is using the same exact color we had we're just going to darken it.

02:36.530 --> 02:40.830
So we're going to bring it down very close to the blacks about their will do.

02:40.970 --> 02:42.090
Oh OK.

02:42.440 --> 02:45.190
Next we're going to switch over to our brush.

02:45.740 --> 02:52.570
Make sure that your make sure that your brush size is a little bit smaller than the previous circle

02:52.570 --> 02:53.640
we created.

02:53.980 --> 02:58.080
So make that a tiny bit smaller and then we're going to fill that in.

02:58.150 --> 03:07.010
So Bret next we're going to do is we're going to really select this light brown and then using our brush

03:07.010 --> 03:16.440
tool again and bringing down the size we're going to add a highlight into his like so now I might play

03:16.440 --> 03:22.250
around with the position of this so we might undo that and try it in a different spot.

03:24.750 --> 03:26.030
Try it down here.

03:27.380 --> 03:30.680
I like it probably somewhere in the middle about there.

03:30.710 --> 03:31.700
Awesome.

03:31.700 --> 03:36.420
Now the next thing we want to do is we want to merge these two layers together so they're one.

03:36.560 --> 03:39.490
So this layer and that layer.

03:39.610 --> 03:41.020
So we're going to select both of them.

03:47.010 --> 03:56.630
Now what we can do is we can copy that selecting with the marquee tool and we copy it.

03:56.810 --> 03:57.300
Right.

03:57.380 --> 04:00.270
So now we have two eyes of the second.

04:00.290 --> 04:04.250
We're going to use the Transform Tool to put it in position and reshape it.

04:10.360 --> 04:16.060
So because of perspective this I will look different than that I think I'm going to rotate it just a

04:16.060 --> 04:16.310
bit.

04:16.310 --> 04:16.760
Also

04:24.600 --> 04:29.910
I think I'm also going to shrink it down vertically so turn the Transform Tool back on bring it down

04:29.910 --> 04:31.360
just a tiny bit.

04:31.380 --> 04:35.580
This is on the other side of his head and a little bit further away from the viewer.

04:35.610 --> 04:38.500
Therefore it's going to appear a little bit smaller.

04:40.890 --> 04:45.450
Now you can also play with the placement of things by using the arrow keys on your keyboard.

04:45.510 --> 04:50.060
So I'm just going to nudge this over just a little bit and see how that looks.

04:50.070 --> 04:52.980
So these two eyes are a little bit too close together for me.

04:53.040 --> 04:58.770
So what I can do is I can come over to my other eye and move him over with the arrows on my keyboard.

05:00.980 --> 05:03.300
I think that looks a little bit better.

05:03.320 --> 05:07.910
Now we want to add some eyelashes to our character now rather than drawing them on.

05:07.910 --> 05:11.240
That can be a little bit tricky especially if you're using a mouse.

05:11.270 --> 05:17.700
What we can do is we can select both or I are going to merge them together.

05:18.790 --> 05:21.120
So now they're on one layer.

05:21.120 --> 05:24.270
Next we're going to select their shape.

05:24.270 --> 05:30.540
Now the way you do this is by holding down control on a Windows or command on a Mac once you're holding

05:30.540 --> 05:31.100
that down.

05:31.110 --> 05:36.180
We're going to click this little thumbnail on the layer what that will do is it'll make a selection

05:36.210 --> 05:40.140
of everything on that layer you'll see here in a second.

05:40.150 --> 05:45.600
Now you can see that it's selected his eye shapes you want to do.

05:45.610 --> 05:52.030
Now we want to create a new layer underneath those eyes and then we're going to fill those in with a

05:52.030 --> 05:57.700
dark gray almost black somewhere about there.

05:57.990 --> 06:01.300
We'll hit OK then we're going to fill that in.

06:02.450 --> 06:05.480
You can't see it because the layer is behind those eyes.

06:05.770 --> 06:08.980
But what we're going to do now is using the arrows on our keyboard.

06:08.980 --> 06:14.120
We're going to nudge that layer up and it's going to create some eyelashes on the top of his eyes.

06:15.510 --> 06:20.810
So switch to the grab a move tool and then push those up once maybe twice.

06:24.310 --> 06:24.580
Right.

06:24.720 --> 06:28.280
Great character is really coming along now.

06:28.460 --> 06:35.200
The next thing we want to do is we want to add eyebrows to a character so using the same gray color

06:35.290 --> 06:40.270
and my brush tool I'm just going to paint in some eyebrows and see how they look.

06:40.270 --> 06:43.840
Now this might take some experimenting until you get the eyebrows look in the way you want.

06:44.800 --> 06:45.840
And that's OK.

06:45.840 --> 06:47.190
It's all part of the process.

06:59.170 --> 07:02.860
What we want to do is we want to add in a mouth.

07:03.070 --> 07:08.830
So I'm going to select this skin Tim and I'm going to darken it a little bit so I'll bring it down to

07:08.830 --> 07:10.390
about there.

07:10.390 --> 07:14.260
And then we might bring it more over to the saturated side.

07:15.960 --> 07:20.530
Then I want to bring it down more towards the red side of the color spectrum.

07:21.320 --> 07:21.920
OK.

07:23.310 --> 07:28.820
Now we can paint in some lips are usually what I'll do if I want to create a shape with a paintbrush

07:28.840 --> 07:33.590
is rather than trying to paint that shape or paint something pretty close to it.

07:34.130 --> 07:39.610
Then using my a race tool I can erase that away until I get the shape that I want.

07:42.730 --> 07:43.160
Right.

07:43.210 --> 07:47.500
I think I like that shape but I don't necessarily like the position.

07:47.500 --> 07:53.820
So what I can do is if I want to try other positions I can use my lasso tool to trace that out.

07:54.970 --> 07:59.870
And now using the grab move tool I can move that around and try different positions for his mouth.

08:06.230 --> 08:08.720
I think right about there's good.

08:09.180 --> 08:14.280
Now the last thing we want to do is we want to add a cast shadow from his goggles.

08:14.280 --> 08:18.130
This will just make the character a little bit more interesting and realistic look.

08:18.900 --> 08:20.120
The way will do that.

08:20.120 --> 08:25.670
We're going to create a new clipping mask on our headshake so I add a new layer above that.

08:26.270 --> 08:28.850
But we want this to be above our skin layer.

08:29.770 --> 08:35.310
Next what we're going to do is we're going to select a dark blue color.

08:35.740 --> 08:41.310
We're going to come up to the blue spectrum and then we're going to come down to a dark bluish gray

08:41.310 --> 08:42.940
ash about somewhere in there.

08:43.030 --> 08:47.670
OK then we're going to paint in that cast shadow.

08:47.710 --> 08:50.620
Now I know this looks really funny but it is a second.

08:50.620 --> 08:54.400
We're going to bring down the opacity and it'll look a lot more like Chateau

08:57.360 --> 08:58.500
great.

08:58.620 --> 09:03.490
So now coming over to the opacity on our layer we're going to bring that down.

09:04.640 --> 09:07.850
Tonight you can see it's looking a lot more like a shadow.

09:07.850 --> 09:14.000
Now the reason why we did a bluish gray ash color for the shadow is because shadows tend to be a cool

09:14.000 --> 09:17.300
color when you're creating shadows.

09:17.300 --> 09:20.510
Use cool colors when you're creating highlights.

09:20.510 --> 09:22.260
Use warm colors.

09:22.400 --> 09:25.060
That's just a good rule of thumb to go by.

09:25.250 --> 09:32.430
Next we want to create a new clipping that so what we'll do is we'll come down to the first Clokey mask

09:32.850 --> 09:34.510
and we'll add a new layer.

09:34.650 --> 09:40.110
And remember if you add a layer underneath a clipping mask it'll automatically turn it into a clipping

09:40.110 --> 09:41.210
that.

09:41.330 --> 09:47.010
But now we want to Dragon It's called The Mask above our shadow clipping mask.

09:47.040 --> 09:47.770
All right.

09:47.780 --> 09:53.900
Next what we're going to do is we're going to add in a darker shadow along this edge usually in corners

09:53.900 --> 09:56.720
of walls and crevices in cracks.

09:56.840 --> 10:01.680
Shadows get darker and so we're going to add that darker shadow along this edge.

10:01.850 --> 10:10.210
So selecting the same color that we have here we're going to darken that and we're also going to bring

10:10.210 --> 10:12.850
the saturation a little bit higher.

10:13.140 --> 10:16.540
So about there should do maybe a little bit darker.

10:16.910 --> 10:17.640
Well OK.

10:18.400 --> 10:22.500
Next using our brush tool and making sure we have a soft edged brush.

10:24.960 --> 10:28.810
Don't paint in that little edge just like so

10:35.830 --> 10:44.490
now if it looks too dark you can always bring down the opacity on this layer.

10:44.530 --> 10:45.390
Now really quick.

10:45.400 --> 10:49.790
We'll go ahead and list the label all of our layers within our head folder.

10:49.810 --> 10:57.740
So starting with the skin layer we're going to label that skin then we'll label our next layer which

10:57.740 --> 11:04.790
is the shadow layer and we'll call it Chateau the next layer is also the second part of the shadow.

11:04.830 --> 11:08.600
So we'll also call that shadow.

11:08.790 --> 11:11.520
Next is his eyebrows and mouth.

11:11.760 --> 11:15.050
So we'll call that features.

11:15.720 --> 11:17.790
And lastly are his eyes.

11:17.970 --> 11:22.040
So we'll call that layer eyes.

11:22.150 --> 11:27.900
Now we can close this folder down and move on to the next part of our character.

11:29.060 --> 11:33.860
Now if you're creating a character along with me or you're creating your own character I'd love to see

11:33.860 --> 11:34.880
what you're working on.

11:35.090 --> 11:40.940
So go ahead and save out your character and post the progress that you're making in the Q&amp;A section

11:40.940 --> 11:45.630
of this course or on the Facebook group page or both.

11:45.710 --> 11:49.010
Very interested in seeing how you as my student are doing.

11:49.010 --> 11:54.140
And I want to help you as best I can remember that if you have any questions please ask them in the

11:54.140 --> 11:57.190
Q&amp;A section and I will answer all of your questions.

11:57.200 --> 11:58.430
Guaranteed.

11:58.430 --> 12:02.410
I'd also like to say thank you for taking this course and I appreciate you as a student.
