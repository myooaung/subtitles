00:00.930 --> 00:04.610
All right let's go ahead and move on to the next frame.

00:04.920 --> 00:09.490
So let's keep this frame open because we're going to need it later.

00:09.720 --> 00:20.420
But for now let's go ahead and open our original standing frame one more use this as our base again.

00:20.450 --> 00:24.430
So the pose for this frame is going to be where he's pushing off the ground.

00:24.470 --> 00:30.500
His feet are still touching and his arms are going to come down just a little bit because of the force

00:30.560 --> 00:31.850
of him pushing up.

00:32.120 --> 00:36.750
So let's come back to our diagram and have a look at what that looks like.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.590
So his feet are still touching.

00:39.660 --> 00:44.280
Yeah he's almost on his tippy toes and his arms come down.

00:44.380 --> 00:45.040
All right.

00:45.380 --> 00:51.470
So the first thing we want to do is we want to create a marker for where the ground is because we're

00:51.470 --> 00:53.530
going to lift his body up a little bit.

00:53.560 --> 00:59.210
And once his feet have moved we're not going to know where exactly that ground used to be.

00:59.360 --> 01:04.790
So we're going to grab one of our ruler lines and we'll drag it down to the bottom of his feet like

01:04.790 --> 01:06.170
so.

01:06.290 --> 01:11.800
So now we can go ahead and move our whole character and we still know where that ground level is.

01:11.810 --> 01:17.690
So next what we want to do is we want to select all the layers that have our character on it and we're

01:17.690 --> 01:23.450
going to use the grab a move tool then we're going to use the arrow keys on a keyboard to nudge our

01:23.450 --> 01:25.310
character up.

01:25.340 --> 01:33.080
Now we use the keys on our keyboard to do this because we want him to push straight up about there should

01:33.080 --> 01:41.030
be good maybe a little bit higher next where we want to do is we want to come to our body folder where

01:41.090 --> 01:43.040
the legs and feet are.

01:43.370 --> 01:48.310
And first we're going to cut away this foot right here.

01:48.920 --> 01:54.830
And what we're going to do with this selection is we're going to use the Transform Tool to rotate it

01:55.670 --> 01:59.900
like so and then reposition it.

01:59.970 --> 02:03.480
So just the tip of his foot is touching that ground.

02:03.540 --> 02:05.390
Now we'll go ahead and hit enter.

02:05.850 --> 02:07.200
Awesome.

02:07.200 --> 02:12.410
Next hour we're going to do is we're going to select this skin tone than using our brush tool.

02:12.420 --> 02:15.010
We'll go ahead and paint in this empty area.

02:17.650 --> 02:24.000
And use the eraser to erase away any unwanted areas such as this little point right here.

02:24.930 --> 02:25.980
Great.

02:25.990 --> 02:29.730
Next what we're going to do is we're going to add a new layer.

02:30.730 --> 02:36.370
And on this layer we're going to create a shape that is about the size of this foot but it's going to

02:36.370 --> 02:41.060
be more like we're looking down on it rather than straight onto it like we are here.

02:50.770 --> 02:55.230
So now we can go ahead and fill that in.

02:55.390 --> 03:02.200
Then let's come back to our body layer and using the marquee tool we can go ahead and select this old

03:02.200 --> 03:10.290
foot and delete it next what we want to do is we want to animate these arms.

03:10.290 --> 03:12.850
So let's start with the spear arm.

03:13.050 --> 03:18.580
So we'll select the arm and the spear folder then using the transform tool.

03:18.600 --> 03:21.530
Let's just go ahead and rotate that down like so

03:24.640 --> 03:27.040
and then reposition it.

03:27.850 --> 03:29.730
Then let's move on to the next arm.

03:29.740 --> 03:33.930
So we'll come up to the body layer and then let's select this arm

03:37.400 --> 03:42.470
and using the transform tool we can go ahead and rotate that down.

03:42.470 --> 03:44.540
So get into position

03:47.200 --> 03:48.800
hit enter.

03:49.070 --> 03:49.780
Great.

03:49.820 --> 03:53.790
So now those bombs have been animated into position.

03:53.870 --> 03:59.420
Now lastly what we want to do is we want to begin to start to tilt his head up as he jumps up.

03:59.420 --> 04:03.670
We want him to begin to look up just for dramatic effect.

04:03.890 --> 04:12.080
So we're going to select the feather folder and the mask folder and then using the transform tool we

04:12.080 --> 04:14.200
can go ahead and rotate his head.

04:14.210 --> 04:20.720
Now we want to make sure like before we grab this pivot point and we put it where his neck would pivot

04:20.810 --> 04:21.790
naturally.

04:21.800 --> 04:24.010
So somewhere about there should be good.

04:24.320 --> 04:27.930
So now we can rotate it and it will rotate at that pivot point.

04:31.040 --> 04:32.490
That should be enough rotation.

04:32.540 --> 04:34.370
So I hit enter.

04:34.370 --> 04:35.080
Awesome.

04:35.240 --> 04:37.730
So we just finished our second Fring.

04:37.760 --> 04:40.730
Now let's go ahead and create a copy of this.

04:40.820 --> 04:48.770
So will select all of our folders and we'll copy them merge then.

04:48.800 --> 04:55.590
Now let's select the layer that we just created and our background and now we can drag both of those

04:55.680 --> 04:56.990
into our Spryte sheet.

04:57.000 --> 05:06.540
Once again we'll drop that into our grid get it into position and we can go ahead and delete that background

05:06.540 --> 05:07.530
layer.

05:08.060 --> 05:15.350
And let's go ahead and label this layer f 2 for frame 2 then.

05:15.400 --> 05:19.030
Let's not forget to save out our new frame.

05:19.030 --> 05:23.730
So we'll go file save as EF 2

05:28.410 --> 05:28.820
great.
