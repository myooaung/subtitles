00:00.930 --> 00:03.580
All right now let's go over the jump cycle.

00:03.900 --> 00:06.700
So the jump cycle is going to go like this.

00:06.840 --> 00:12.370
It's going to start out standi then it's going to go into a crouch where the needs are going to bend

00:12.740 --> 00:19.600
the arms are going to come up just a little bit and the back is going to lean forward a little bit then

00:19.600 --> 00:26.080
the next frame is going to be the up push where the feet are barely just going to be touching the ground

00:26.110 --> 00:27.580
as it's pushing off.

00:27.580 --> 00:32.360
The arms are going to come down a little bit because of wind resistance and force.

00:32.650 --> 00:38.410
And the head is going to tilt back just a tiny bit and start to look up then in the next frame is going

00:38.410 --> 00:41.110
to be where he's airborne.

00:41.470 --> 00:43.970
So the feet will leave the ground.

00:44.290 --> 00:45.750
The arms will start to come up.

00:46.790 --> 00:49.720
And the head will tilt back just a little bit more.

00:49.850 --> 00:54.150
The next room after that is going to be where our character is free falling.

00:54.200 --> 00:59.210
So whenever something jumps in the air there's a little bit of time where it almost seems like it's

00:59.210 --> 01:01.180
floating there in the air.

01:01.250 --> 01:07.640
So we add in a second frame where it's almost identical to this first airborne frame.

01:07.640 --> 01:14.300
The only difference is that the feet sort of start to come up and the arms start to float up just a

01:14.300 --> 01:15.210
little bit.

01:15.230 --> 01:20.540
So give that illusion that our character is free falling as he's coming down.

01:20.660 --> 01:28.830
Then the last one will be a copy of this frame right here where he'll land then it'll start back over

01:28.830 --> 01:30.000
where he's standing.

01:30.830 --> 01:37.490
So again your assignment for this lecture is going to be to draw each one of these and do each one three

01:37.490 --> 01:38.420
times.

01:38.420 --> 01:42.560
Once you've done that you can go ahead and move on to the next part of the lecture.

01:43.130 --> 01:48.380
And again if things aren't looking right go ahead and post your drawings to the Q&amp;A section of the Course

01:48.830 --> 01:52.420
and me or other students can help you work the problem out.
