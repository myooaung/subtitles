00:01.050 --> 00:06.720
OK let's go over the things you're going to need to complete this course.

00:06.720 --> 00:11.430
So the first thing you're going to need to complete this course is you're going to need photoshop.

00:11.700 --> 00:17.250
Photoshop is the main tool that we'll be using throughout this entire course to create our artwork and

00:17.250 --> 00:19.890
our characters.

00:20.070 --> 00:24.360
I'm here at the Adobes download page here at this page.

00:24.360 --> 00:29.510
You can download a 30 day free trial of Photoshop for free.

00:29.700 --> 00:36.500
So all you have to do is click on the Photoshop icon and that will take you to a new page where you'll

00:36.510 --> 00:41.190
fill out some information and from there it's pretty self-explanatory.

00:43.260 --> 00:51.050
Now I'll leave link for this page and I'll leave a link for all the pages that I go over in this course.

00:51.180 --> 00:56.790
Now if you're going to do commercial work and get paid for it or if you plan on doing this for the long

00:56.790 --> 01:00.540
run you're going to need to buy Photoshop now.

01:00.660 --> 01:05.610
The way Photoshop works is it's on a month to month subscription base.

01:05.610 --> 01:10.140
Now you can find some older versions of Photoshop that you can download onto your computer and keep

01:10.140 --> 01:11.100
it there forever.

01:11.370 --> 01:17.940
But the nice thing about doing a subscription based version of Photoshop is you constantly get the latest

01:17.940 --> 01:19.670
version of Photoshop.

01:20.070 --> 01:26.190
So any time they come out with an update you'll get that update because your monthly pain for it and

01:26.310 --> 01:31.230
it's also kind of like an installment payment where instead of paying a thousand dollars for Photoshop

01:31.230 --> 01:33.950
you're only paying $20 a month.

01:34.050 --> 01:39.660
Now that will be more expensive in the long run but that's just the way Adobe has decided to take things

01:39.950 --> 01:43.140
and so it's the way that you have to pay.

01:43.260 --> 01:49.830
You'll pay for it here at this page and it's going to be this single app package right here and you'll

01:49.830 --> 01:53.610
select Photoshop and you'll go ahead and buy now.

01:54.770 --> 02:00.860
Now the third thing you're going to need to complete this course which isn't essential but it's very

02:00.860 --> 02:02.360
recommended that you use.

02:02.360 --> 02:04.580
This is a drawing tablet.

02:04.880 --> 02:08.810
This is the device that you can hook into your computer and draw with.

02:08.840 --> 02:13.040
Now I recommend this because we're going to be doing some drawing in this course and it can be very

02:13.040 --> 02:15.330
difficult to do with a mouse.

02:15.350 --> 02:19.510
We're also going to be doing some detail work and some shading which can be difficult to do with the

02:19.510 --> 02:25.280
mouse though it is very possible and I've had many students create artwork with their mouses and even

02:25.340 --> 02:27.860
I have used my mouse in the past to create artwork.

02:27.860 --> 02:29.990
When I first got started.

02:30.020 --> 02:35.120
Another thing you can do is when we're designing our characters and sketching them out rather than doing

02:35.120 --> 02:42.230
them on the computer you can do that with a pen and a paper or pencil and paper and then you can take

02:42.230 --> 02:46.790
a picture of that or scan it in and use that as a base for your character.

02:46.790 --> 02:50.170
Now it's said that way Calment makes the best tablets.

02:50.480 --> 02:57.170
I don't really know because I've never used any other types of tablets besides Wakem tablets but from

02:57.170 --> 03:01.230
my experience they work very well and they're very high quality.

03:01.370 --> 03:05.960
And you can produce very good artwork with them here on Amazon.

03:05.960 --> 03:11.470
I did a quick search for Wakem tablets and you can see they have all different types.

03:11.570 --> 03:15.100
They can be pretty pricey and they can also be pretty cheap.

03:15.200 --> 03:20.700
Now the type of Wakem tablet that I'm using is called the bamboo tablet.

03:21.020 --> 03:22.590
It's right here.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.240
I'll also leave a link for this guy.

03:25.250 --> 03:28.620
Now this is one of their lower end tablets.

03:28.760 --> 03:35.360
I think it's just above their lowest grade tablet and it works completely fine for me.

03:35.360 --> 03:42.170
I know that other higher price tablets can do a lot more and they are a lot more sensitive to pressure.

03:42.380 --> 03:45.970
But this tablet does the job just fine for me.

03:46.040 --> 03:47.790
I've never had any problems with it.

03:47.870 --> 03:51.340
I'm still able to create really great artwork.

03:51.350 --> 03:54.520
It's very inexpensive as you can see here.

03:54.530 --> 04:01.950
It's not being sold by Amazon but you can buy some used ones for about a hundred dollars.

04:01.970 --> 04:04.790
I bought mine used for less than $100.

04:04.850 --> 04:11.010
So this is a tablet that I very much recommend to people just getting started with digital artwork.

04:11.030 --> 04:16.350
Now the last thing you're going to need to complete this course is unity 3D.

04:16.370 --> 04:19.030
Now many of you probably know what unity is.

04:19.220 --> 04:23.960
If you don't what it is is it's a game developer software.

04:24.170 --> 04:33.510
So with this software you can create games of all sorts from 3D to 2D to platform to pixel art any type

04:33.520 --> 04:34.450
of game you can think of.

04:34.460 --> 04:39.950
You can create it with unity and the nice thing about it is it's open source and it's free for personal

04:39.950 --> 04:40.730
use.

04:40.760 --> 04:46.610
All you have to do is come to this page which will also leave a link to and that you will just hit download.

04:46.630 --> 04:47.050
Now

04:50.480 --> 04:58.010
this is going to bring you to this page and you're just going to hit download installer.

04:58.250 --> 05:02.240
And then there goes it's going to start downloading onto your computer.

05:02.300 --> 05:07.340
After that all you have to do is just run it like a normal program and install.

05:07.340 --> 05:12.470
Now the reason for downloading unity is not because we're going to be building a game but because I

05:12.470 --> 05:18.200
want to demonstrate to you how you animi your character once you've created each individual frame and

05:18.200 --> 05:20.650
put it onto a spreadsheet.

05:20.690 --> 05:24.270
So once you've got all these things and you're ready to start the course.

05:24.320 --> 05:28.760
Let's go ahead and move on to the next parts of our course.

05:28.760 --> 05:32.810
I hope this letter was helpful for you and you're really excited to get started with this.

05:32.810 --> 05:34.360
I know I am.

05:34.370 --> 05:35.490
Thanks for watching.

05:35.590 --> 05:37.740
And I hope to see you in the next lecture.
