00:00.840 --> 00:06.480
So once you've decided what type of character you're going to be creating and decided on each individual

00:06.480 --> 00:12.790
aspect of the character the next step is to move on to research.

00:12.800 --> 00:19.100
Now research is a big part that a lot of people skip research is super important because it's going

00:19.100 --> 00:25.790
to give that extra detail and that extra level of realism to your character even if your character is

00:25.790 --> 00:28.570
a cartoon or a very stylized.

00:28.700 --> 00:32.610
There's still a level of research that needs to go into them.

00:32.870 --> 00:40.750
Also when you first starting your character you might feel a little stuck and you need some inspiration.

00:40.790 --> 00:41.820
A really good place.

00:41.840 --> 00:45.450
I loved come to for inspiration is Pinterest.

00:45.530 --> 00:51.200
Now if you don't have an account with Pinterest you can go ahead and create one and then have a look

00:51.200 --> 00:52.570
through all of their images.

00:52.730 --> 00:54.080
What Pinterest is.

00:54.090 --> 01:00.990
It's basically a visual library of images that people have pinned from all over the Internet.

01:01.940 --> 01:05.240
The nice thing about it is it filters out all the junk.

01:05.420 --> 01:09.130
You don't really get things that aren't visually pleasing on Pinterest.

01:09.170 --> 01:15.950
All of it is pretty good looking and that's why I like to do a lot of my image searches on Pinterest.

01:16.100 --> 01:21.710
So if I'm feeling stuck and I need some inspiration I'll very often come on to Pinterest and just start

01:21.710 --> 01:23.220
searching through images.

01:23.240 --> 01:26.960
So like right now we're trying to design a character.

01:27.170 --> 01:34.860
So the first thing I might do is I might do an image search on Pinterest for character and this is what

01:34.860 --> 01:36.040
comes up.

01:36.210 --> 01:41.670
Now these characters might not be exactly what you're going for but it might get the wheels turning

01:41.670 --> 01:44.610
in your head and gets you thinking about what you want to do.

01:44.610 --> 01:50.960
It might give you a couple little ideas that you can run with and also might give you some ideas for

01:50.960 --> 01:52.410
style.

01:52.490 --> 01:56.560
So say for example you wanted your game characters to have this type of a style.

01:56.990 --> 02:01.280
You could study this and see what kind of lines are they using what kind of corners do they have what

02:01.280 --> 02:03.340
colors are they using.

02:03.360 --> 02:07.840
That's a really good way to nail a style down for your character.

02:08.950 --> 02:15.610
Sometimes also if I feel really stuck what I'll do is I'll just go through a whole bunch of images of

02:15.610 --> 02:22.060
characters that I like or whatever I'm trying to create and I'll just recreate them I'll draw them and

02:22.090 --> 02:23.950
I'll draw them over and over again.

02:24.220 --> 02:31.150
So I might draw this girl and then I might also draw this girl if I'm doing a girl character I'll draw

02:31.150 --> 02:32.280
a whole bunch of girls.

02:32.280 --> 02:36.640
Now I'm not I don't take credit for the drawings and I never sell them and never do anything with them

02:37.150 --> 02:43.600
but it definitely helps my skills and it warms me up to start drawing that type of a character.

02:43.630 --> 02:49.420
It gets my brain thinking about what kind of lines and curves and different parts to that type of a

02:49.420 --> 02:50.170
character.

02:50.260 --> 02:54.850
There are to it so I very much recommend that you do that.

02:54.880 --> 03:00.170
Also just draw a lot of different types of characters even if you have to copy them.

03:00.170 --> 03:07.220
Now remember don't take credit for those drawings but it's ok to copy them if you're practicing.

03:07.250 --> 03:09.130
So now you're getting some ideas.

03:09.140 --> 03:11.620
Let's have a look at some game characters.

03:11.690 --> 03:16.400
So I did a search for game character design and it came up with some really cool designs.

03:16.400 --> 03:19.130
Also I'm really liking this style.

03:19.130 --> 03:25.100
This is a really cool style and I think I might possibly go in this direction for our characters in

03:25.100 --> 03:30.980
this course but if we keep scrolling down you'll see all different types of styles.

03:30.990 --> 03:37.510
Now when I'm doing searches for character design I'm usually not really looking for the actual design

03:37.580 --> 03:44.000
I'm looking for the style I just want to find a style that I like that I can kind of mimic and change

03:44.000 --> 03:46.540
a little bit to make it my own style.

03:47.710 --> 03:50.860
But that way I'm not just completely starting from scratch.

03:55.890 --> 03:57.870
I really like these guys too.

03:59.830 --> 04:04.610
And sometimes when you're trying to research for a character or get inspiration you want to look in

04:04.610 --> 04:10.130
other places so instead of just doing searches for character designs maybe we're looking for a style

04:10.170 --> 04:12.670
and we can't find it in character designs.

04:12.920 --> 04:18.800
So what I would do is I do a search for something else for example just game design by itself and you

04:18.800 --> 04:25.070
might begin the night you might get ideas just by looking at say backgrounds for games and you can take

04:25.070 --> 04:31.320
that idea the lines and shapes and colors and those backgrounds and incorporate them into your character.

04:35.320 --> 04:41.490
Have a look through some of these really really also liking this style too.

04:41.510 --> 04:42.800
Very cool.

04:42.800 --> 04:47.560
Liking the clean edges and the soft colors.

04:47.570 --> 04:53.480
So once you're really getting an idea of what you want to do for your character it's time to start specifically

04:53.480 --> 04:57.780
searching out research for that character.

04:58.010 --> 05:03.170
For example I'm thinking that the character that I want to create is going to be some sort of caveman

05:03.170 --> 05:04.500
type character.

05:04.760 --> 05:11.750
So on Pinterest I did a search for prehistoric man and this brought up some really cool images of some

05:11.810 --> 05:14.600
caveman like images.

05:15.170 --> 05:17.750
So I would just use these as reference.

05:17.810 --> 05:20.810
I'm not going to copy them but I would make mental notes.

05:20.800 --> 05:28.320
For example I would make a note that a caveman usually has a very large upper brow.

05:28.640 --> 05:33.200
They also usually have pretty big mouths and lips.

05:33.250 --> 05:39.590
I can also make note of what their hair is like and their facial hair their eye colors what they're

05:39.590 --> 05:40.200
wearing.

05:40.220 --> 05:45.650
So in this image for example he's wearing fur over here he looks like he's got some bones hanging from

05:45.650 --> 05:50.580
his ears and their hair is pretty wild and unkempt.

05:50.620 --> 05:53.490
It also appears that a lot of them have beards.

05:53.620 --> 05:55.970
So I can make notes of all of this.

05:55.990 --> 06:01.150
So like I said you don't have to copy these and make them your character you can just make notes of

06:01.150 --> 06:04.630
things that make a character seem like a caveman.

06:04.660 --> 06:10.900
So if you're doing say a pirate character you can do image searches for pirates and make notes of what

06:11.230 --> 06:13.120
all these pirates have in common.

06:13.150 --> 06:16.190
Maybe they all have bandanas Maybe they all have a sword.

06:16.210 --> 06:18.150
Maybe they all have a gold tooth.

06:18.280 --> 06:20.660
Or many of them have a gold tooth.

06:20.680 --> 06:24.780
These are the type of notes that you want to start creating as you're doing your research.

06:25.950 --> 06:31.230
So then I did an image search for cavemen on Google to see what I could find.

06:31.230 --> 06:35.980
It's always good to do research all over the place and not just in one area.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.550
So not just one book or one Web site.

06:39.780 --> 06:46.140
So I also make some mental notes here that a lot of these cavemen have really big arms and really broad

06:46.140 --> 06:48.130
shoulders.

06:48.140 --> 06:53.260
I also noticed that a lot of them are very hunched over as you can see.

06:53.380 --> 06:58.420
They're also wearing fur once again and they're usually carrying some sort of a weapon.

06:58.930 --> 07:03.790
So I can use these notes that I've made to help design my character.

07:05.540 --> 07:09.440
As you're doing your research you'll probably start to come up with a few more ideas and your character

07:09.440 --> 07:14.090
might evolve and change as you're designing him and thinking him up.

07:14.390 --> 07:21.320
So as I was designing my character and thinking him up I decided that I wanted my my caveman to be more

07:21.320 --> 07:25.950
of a jungle man slash caveman so kind of a mix.

07:25.970 --> 07:32.590
So then I did an image search for jungle tribal man and this came up with some really cool images too.

07:32.600 --> 07:38.990
So then what I'll do now is I'll take some mental notes of these images also such as the face painting

07:39.260 --> 07:43.850
the dreadlocks the types of clothes they're wearing the feathers.

07:43.850 --> 07:45.690
I make a note of all of this.

07:46.040 --> 07:51.950
And now when I go to design my character I'm going to incorporate all these things and maybe add some

07:51.950 --> 07:53.580
of my own little ideas.

07:53.690 --> 08:00.680
But this is basically how I do my research and get my inspiration for my character design or any of

08:00.680 --> 08:02.810
the type of artwork that I create.

08:02.870 --> 08:07.300
Go ahead and go on to Pinterest and Google look at books.

08:07.310 --> 08:13.910
Anything else you can think of to find research material or inspiration and go ahead and start developing

08:13.910 --> 08:19.040
your character and finding out what types of things that type of character would have how they would

08:19.040 --> 08:21.250
dress what they would wear.

08:22.180 --> 08:25.710
Hope this lecture was helpful for you and I appreciate you watching it.

08:25.750 --> 08:26.680
See in the next one.
