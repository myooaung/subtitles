00:00.710 --> 00:07.010
Before we finish creating our walk cycle we need to create a sprite sheet document that we can start

00:07.010 --> 00:11.520
dropping these frames into what is a spreadsheet document.

00:11.540 --> 00:19.340
Well a Spryte sheet is a file that a game can use to pull up multiple images without having to load

00:19.730 --> 00:21.740
more than one file.

00:21.740 --> 00:28.080
So basically what it does is it's one document that has a bunch of different frames on it for an animation.

00:28.290 --> 00:32.500
And what happens is the program for your game draws from each image.

00:32.510 --> 00:35.060
When it's called upon and displays it.

00:35.060 --> 00:38.350
And that's what creates the illusion of the animation.

00:38.420 --> 00:42.830
The key to a Sprite she is making sure that you create it on a grid system.

00:42.830 --> 00:48.790
So each one of our friends is going to have to be dropped into a grid on our document so that way they

00:48.790 --> 00:52.790
are found in the same exact position as the other ones.

00:52.790 --> 00:57.900
Even though their movement will be different their position will still be the same.

00:58.070 --> 01:00.020
And I'll show you what I mean in a second.

01:00.380 --> 01:08.990
So let's go ahead and create a new document so we'll go file new our document needs to be five times

01:08.990 --> 01:15.350
the width of our image so we can fit 5 across to it and it needs to be three times the height of our

01:15.350 --> 01:15.720
image.

01:15.740 --> 01:22.780
So we can fit three images down so our image is 600 pixels across.

01:23.070 --> 01:31.500
So we need to do six hundred times five which is going to be 3000 pixels next door height which is going

01:31.500 --> 01:37.200
to be 600 times three which will be 8300 pixels.

01:38.350 --> 01:40.680
And then we can hit OK.

01:41.080 --> 01:47.860
So now we have a new document what we want to do is we need to create our grid system that we can drop

01:47.890 --> 01:49.810
our images into.

01:49.810 --> 01:57.380
So the way we'll do that is by coming over to our edit tab and coming all the way down to preferences.

01:57.490 --> 02:03.310
Once we get there we want to come up to where it says guides grid and slices.

02:03.310 --> 02:07.550
So we'll select that and you'll see this window comes up.

02:07.570 --> 02:17.190
Now what we need to do is we need to change our inches into pixels so pixels now says grid line.

02:17.200 --> 02:19.280
Every one pixel.

02:19.330 --> 02:21.160
Now we don't want to every one pixel.

02:21.160 --> 02:24.280
Otherwise it would be a super small grid.

02:24.310 --> 02:30.790
What we want is we want it to be every six hundred pixels so every time we have the length of our image

02:30.790 --> 02:32.750
we want a grid line.

02:33.370 --> 02:35.980
So we're going to type in six hundred.

02:36.050 --> 02:40.150
Now if you like you can go ahead and change the color of your grid line.

02:40.160 --> 02:40.870
I don't really care.

02:40.870 --> 02:42.430
So I'm not going to do it.

02:42.600 --> 02:44.350
We'll hit OK.

02:44.480 --> 02:52.460
Next we're going to come up to view and then come down to show then we'll come down to where it says

02:52.460 --> 02:53.120
grid.

02:53.150 --> 02:55.460
And we want to select that.

02:55.700 --> 02:57.560
So now it shows our grid.

02:57.560 --> 02:58.250
Now don't worry.

02:58.250 --> 03:04.280
This grid isn't going to be here when we do the final export of our Sprite she.

03:04.350 --> 03:08.460
Now let's go ahead and let's drop in our first frame on Taurus right.

03:08.580 --> 03:15.450
So let's come back to our frame one of the walking cycle and what we need to do is we need to compress

03:15.540 --> 03:23.430
all of this into one image so we're going to select everything from the spear all the way up to the

03:23.430 --> 03:25.770
mask.

03:25.770 --> 03:33.120
Then we're going to hit Control J or command J on a Mac to make a copy of all those layers.

03:33.330 --> 03:34.780
Now that we have a copy of all those.

03:34.800 --> 03:39.110
Let's go ahead and select them and merge those layers together.

03:39.150 --> 03:45.090
So now we have one image of our character that's flattened and we still also have all of our layers

03:45.090 --> 03:48.640
so we can still edit it if we need to.

03:48.810 --> 03:55.350
Next what we need to do is we need to select our flattened image layer that we just created and then

03:55.350 --> 03:58.290
we're also going to select our background.

03:58.290 --> 04:04.410
Now the way you do this is by holding down control and then selecting your second layer and that will

04:04.410 --> 04:11.130
allow you to select two different layers or as many as you like but it allow you to skip all the layers

04:11.130 --> 04:18.180
in between now that we have those selected Let's go ahead and click them and we're going to drag them

04:18.750 --> 04:25.740
into our other document then we can just go ahead and drop it in and you'll see it brings both those

04:25.740 --> 04:26.800
layers.

04:27.360 --> 04:31.120
Now you may be wondering why I brought in the white background.

04:31.170 --> 04:36.450
The reason is is that if we don't bring in that white background this is not going to know where to

04:36.450 --> 04:37.670
snap to.

04:38.190 --> 04:42.840
So you can't really see the background but you'll notice that if I bring it over here into position

04:43.050 --> 04:45.690
it will kind of lock into place.

04:45.690 --> 04:49.310
And that's because that square background is there.

04:49.350 --> 04:53.370
So if we let it go there you'll see he's in position.

04:53.370 --> 04:59.780
If we were to turn this background off you'll see that white background that we brought in is snapping

04:59.780 --> 05:01.560
right to our grid.

05:01.610 --> 05:07.900
Now if yours is not snapping it's because you don't have your snap to grids and document bounds turned

05:07.910 --> 05:11.820
on the way you do this is by coming up to view.

05:12.350 --> 05:20.960
Then come down to snap to and make sure you have guides grids layers and document bounds selected.

05:20.960 --> 05:24.740
Now let's go ahead and on this turned off white background.

05:25.010 --> 05:27.860
We're going to go ahead and just delete it because we don't really need it.

05:27.860 --> 05:32.910
It's just making it hard to see where our square background is lining up with the grid.

05:32.960 --> 05:39.050
So we're going to go ahead and unlock it by hitting this lock icon right here and that will allow us

05:39.050 --> 05:39.910
to delete it.

05:39.920 --> 05:43.180
So now we just hit delete and it deletes that layer.

05:43.340 --> 05:48.530
Now that we have our character positioned in the grid we can also go ahead and delete this white square

05:48.530 --> 05:50.840
background's will hit delete.

05:50.840 --> 05:56.330
Now we're just left with our character which is the way we want this when we export it is each one of

05:56.330 --> 06:00.770
these will be filled with a different frame and then we can export the.

06:01.110 --> 06:05.490
I hope this lecture was helpful for you and you learned a lot about spreadsheets and how they work and

06:05.490 --> 06:07.140
how to create them.

06:07.140 --> 06:11.040
Now let's go ahead and let's jump back into creating our walk cycle.
