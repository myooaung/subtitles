00:00.570 --> 00:04.310
All right let's go ahead and add in some color to our tree.

00:04.590 --> 00:09.060
So the first thing we're going to do is we're going to add a new layer we're going to drag that layer

00:09.060 --> 00:14.300
underneath and then drag it back up so that way it automatically creates it into a clipping mask.

00:14.760 --> 00:17.240
Now this is a clipping mask for our trunk.

00:17.400 --> 00:20.360
So let's go ahead and fill this layer in with a color.

00:20.430 --> 00:22.710
So let's select a color for our trunk.

00:22.710 --> 00:27.700
So I'm thinking it's going to be a brown maybe a little bit more towards the Reds.

00:27.990 --> 00:28.740
OK.

00:28.980 --> 00:31.440
Now we can go ahead and fill that layer in.

00:31.440 --> 00:33.790
Now it's just filling in as a solid color.

00:33.810 --> 00:39.270
But what we can do is we can change the blend mode to something that works better like overlay.

00:39.300 --> 00:44.640
Now that doesn't work very well so we can try something like multiply and multiply works much better.

00:44.640 --> 00:47.880
Next let's add some green to our tree.

00:48.240 --> 00:54.480
So we're going to add a new layer above our tree leaves layer Right-Click and create a clipping mask

00:55.230 --> 00:58.450
and then we can go ahead and fill that layer in with a green.

00:58.500 --> 01:01.530
So I'm going to find green.

01:02.490 --> 01:05.040
Probably going to be pretty saturated and bright.

01:05.190 --> 01:05.720
OK.

01:05.730 --> 01:07.200
And then we can fill that in.

01:07.530 --> 01:12.480
Then let's change that to multiply awesome.

01:12.750 --> 01:16.590
Now lastly we want to add a couple of little lines to our tree.

01:16.800 --> 01:21.140
So the way we're going to do that is by first creating a new layer.

01:21.570 --> 01:23.110
Then let's zoom in here.

01:23.430 --> 01:27.630
And on a grid system we're going to create the lines that we want.

01:27.630 --> 01:30.410
Because they need to be an isometric perspective.

01:30.600 --> 01:36.690
So we're going to start right here and then come two squares over like so and then we're going to come

01:36.690 --> 01:42.990
to more squares over here and then we're going to come straight up and we're going to eyeball this civil

01:43.020 --> 01:50.010
come up to about there and then we can come over like so and just eyeballing it just guesstimate about

01:50.010 --> 01:53.480
how high up you should be from this line down here.

01:53.490 --> 01:55.570
We'll do the same thing over to this side.

01:55.860 --> 02:00.360
So about their straight down next.

02:00.410 --> 02:03.010
Let's go ahead and fill that in with a darker green.

02:03.050 --> 02:09.110
So going to grab my green and Durcan that a bit to maybe a little bit darker about there and we'll fill

02:09.110 --> 02:10.760
that in next.

02:10.790 --> 02:15.980
Let's go ahead and make this layer into a clipping layer mask by Dragon underneath our green layer and

02:15.980 --> 02:17.750
then dragging it above it.

02:17.750 --> 02:21.920
So now we can't see it any more because it's not within the shape.

02:21.920 --> 02:27.070
But if we use or grab a move tool you see we can move that into the correct position.

02:27.080 --> 02:30.740
So right now it's not being applied as a multiply layer.

02:30.770 --> 02:34.720
And so it's appearing brighter than the other parts of our tree.

02:34.760 --> 02:39.410
So what we want to do is we want to change it's layer type to multiply.

02:40.090 --> 02:42.630
And now that brings it to a darker color.

02:42.640 --> 02:45.140
Now let's go ahead and copy this layer.

02:45.260 --> 02:47.330
We're going to copy it two times.

02:47.330 --> 02:52.280
Now we need to grab both these layers and drag them underneath our other layer to turn them into clipping

02:52.280 --> 02:53.480
layer masks.

02:53.480 --> 02:58.940
And then one at a time we can go ahead and drag them up like so grab the next one.

02:58.940 --> 02:59.810
Drag it up.

03:01.340 --> 03:04.180
Perfect.

03:04.180 --> 03:04.500
All right.

03:04.510 --> 03:08.670
So now we have a pretty cool looking tree and this isometric perspective.

03:08.980 --> 03:13.870
Next we're going to add a little shadow down here because the Trude probably be casting a shadow on

03:13.870 --> 03:14.720
the ground.

03:15.040 --> 03:19.190
So the way we're going to do this is by selecting the shape of the top of our tree.

03:19.330 --> 03:21.120
So we need to come down to that layer.

03:21.340 --> 03:24.150
And I want to go ahead and select that shape.

03:24.220 --> 03:26.810
Now I have my tolerance turned up too high.

03:26.830 --> 03:31.470
And what that means is it's selecting colors that are similar instead of colors that are exact.

03:31.630 --> 03:36.020
So we only want it to select anything that is this exact color right here.

03:36.070 --> 03:41.020
So I'm going to turn my tolerance down to zero and then I'm going to select this.

03:41.020 --> 03:48.790
And so then I'm going to go ahead and add a new layer underneath all of my layers and I'm going to drag

03:48.820 --> 03:52.770
this selection down so it fits right into this corner.

03:53.650 --> 03:58.200
And then I can go ahead and fill this in with black.

03:59.800 --> 04:06.090
Then I'm going to turn my opacity down to 25 percent.

04:06.200 --> 04:08.660
Now my trunk is not very centered with my shadow.

04:08.660 --> 04:14.720
So what I can do is I can grab all my layers except for my shadow then using my grab move to an arrow

04:14.720 --> 04:19.450
keys on a keyboard I can nudge that up until it's about in the center.

04:19.460 --> 04:24.660
And we can tell it's in the center by drawing a straight line through here with our mind.

04:24.800 --> 04:29.220
And if it goes straight through these two points then you're about in the center.

04:29.600 --> 04:34.250
All right you just created your first crossroads game graphics.

04:34.250 --> 04:36.560
I hope you're really excited in the next lecture.

04:36.560 --> 04:40.340
We're actually going to build a semi truck out of these cubes.

04:40.340 --> 04:43.450
Thanks for watching and I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.
