00:00.840 --> 00:04.720
All right let's go ahead and paint the garden for our sword.

00:05.040 --> 00:09.690
So first what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and select all the layers that make up my handle

00:11.250 --> 00:13.040
and then I'm to put those into a folder for now.

00:13.050 --> 00:19.360
So they're out of the way then I can come up to the part of my sort that makes up the guard.

00:19.470 --> 00:21.600
I'm going to start with this bottom part.

00:21.600 --> 00:26.490
Now this is going to be very similar to painting this bottom part that we did before.

00:26.520 --> 00:31.630
The only difference is that this surface was rounded and this one is going to be flat.

00:31.680 --> 00:33.520
So let's go ahead and get started.

00:33.900 --> 00:39.360
So the first thing we're going to do is add a new layer above this layer and then we're going to turn

00:39.360 --> 00:43.920
it into a clipping mask and then we're going to grab our color white and we're going to start adding

00:43.920 --> 00:45.180
in those highlights.

00:45.480 --> 00:50.700
So because of this top piece is over this bottom piece there's going to be a cast shadow just like there

00:50.700 --> 00:52.920
is already here and also down here.

00:53.160 --> 00:55.140
So let's go ahead and make sure we paint that in.

00:55.280 --> 00:55.760
Whoops.

00:55.830 --> 01:01.600
Make sure your brush opacity is at 20 percent and then we're going to paint through the metal like a

01:02.450 --> 01:03.940
and you can do another layer of that

01:08.170 --> 01:13.140
and we'll just continue to do this until we get it pretty wide.

01:21.560 --> 01:25.210
You can change up the direction of our brush strokes to make it look more interesting.

01:30.270 --> 01:36.890
Remember that because this is a flat surface you want the shine on your metal to be consistent throughout

01:36.890 --> 01:37.610
the whole thing.

01:37.610 --> 01:42.410
You don't want it to start to fade off on these edges because that would make it look like it was a

01:42.410 --> 01:43.460
cylinder.

01:49.500 --> 01:55.360
I mean you go ahead and select this dark gray color here and paint along the bottom like so because

01:55.390 --> 01:58.300
you would still be seeing a little bit of shadow on that bottom edge.

01:58.820 --> 02:02.180
And then I might add just a little tiny bit of shadow on this edge.

02:02.320 --> 02:06.110
This is not a shadow that will be blended in to our highlight.

02:06.130 --> 02:08.360
It's going to be a pretty hard line.

02:08.620 --> 02:11.140
And that's just because there'd be shadow on those edges.

02:11.140 --> 02:14.840
Then I'm going to go ahead and add a little bit more of a drop shadow on this area.

02:24.700 --> 02:30.000
Now I'm going to go ahead and grab my rust colored so couldn't come down into my reddish oranges and

02:30.020 --> 02:31.450
be a little bit lower.

02:31.570 --> 02:33.260
Grab a color from about there.

02:33.490 --> 02:33.900
No no.

02:33.910 --> 02:36.710
Go ahead and brush some of that in a lot of my bottom edge

02:42.550 --> 02:46.540
and then I'm going to go ahead and grab my Durka rust colors somewhere down here.

02:46.870 --> 02:47.880
I can go out and start painting.

02:47.890 --> 02:54.100
And with that I can turn my brush opacity up to 50 percent or 80 percent if you want but I'm going to

02:54.100 --> 02:58.290
stick with 50 percent because I don't want it too bright.

02:58.450 --> 02:59.670
Great.

02:59.680 --> 03:03.190
Now let's go ahead and move up to the top part of our guard.

03:03.580 --> 03:07.900
So I'm going to go ahead and come up to that layer and we need to merge these two layers together so

03:07.900 --> 03:14.770
that they're one and then I'm going to add a layer above that and turn it into a clipping layer mask.

03:14.770 --> 03:17.080
So now let's go ahead and get painting on this.

03:17.080 --> 03:19.410
So switch over to my white collar.

03:19.520 --> 03:22.870
I'll go ahead and start by doing the highlight on the top area.

03:29.050 --> 03:35.380
Another thing is that this metal and the sword itself doesn't have to be exactly perfect because this

03:35.380 --> 03:37.270
is kind of an old looking sword.

03:37.480 --> 03:42.550
And so back in the days when they'd make swords where blacksmiths would actually hammer them out of

03:42.670 --> 03:44.210
hot steel.

03:44.470 --> 03:46.210
They would have little imperfections and stuff.

03:46.210 --> 03:46.990
So it's OK.

03:47.060 --> 03:52.990
Has imperfections it actually makes it look a little bit more interesting and look more like as character

03:55.340 --> 03:56.540
paint down here.

03:56.750 --> 04:16.900
I'm going to try to leave the bottom of this dark gray so that we have a shadow on that bottom edge.

04:17.010 --> 04:21.610
I'm going to bring my size up a little bit just so I can build this a little bit faster.

04:24.930 --> 04:29.860
Now I want these edges of my guard to actually taper off a little bit.

04:29.940 --> 04:34.470
So the way I'm going to make it look like it's tapering off is by making the middle a little bit brighter

04:34.500 --> 04:35.820
than the outside.

04:35.820 --> 04:42.680
So I'll go to there with my highlight come in a little bit closer towards the center and I'll keep doing

04:42.680 --> 04:47.570
that till I get to the center and I get to white and it would be looking like it's tapering off a little

04:47.570 --> 04:52.160
bit too much so I might kind of come back out there a little bit more then I'm going to go ahead and

04:52.160 --> 04:54.880
select this light gray that I have here.

04:54.950 --> 04:59.270
And then using my brush to go ahead and start painting with that just to get some more texture in there

05:00.050 --> 05:02.060
because I don't want it to just be solid white

05:06.710 --> 05:11.510
and I can also paint over this dirt gray under here because I don't want it to be that dark.

05:19.830 --> 05:22.100
Right cool.

05:22.130 --> 05:24.850
Now let's go ahead and select a rust color.

05:25.100 --> 05:27.590
So come down into our orange ish red.

05:27.590 --> 05:30.290
Grab that color and a little bit more saturated.

05:30.620 --> 05:32.270
And then I can go ahead and paint with that one.

05:32.280 --> 05:33.130
I brought them

05:45.940 --> 05:51.770
then I'm going to go ahead and grab a darker more saturated color.

05:51.900 --> 05:53.040
I'm not painting with that

05:57.830 --> 06:04.070
then I can grab a little bit darker version of that and bring my brush rapacity up to 5 percent.

06:04.180 --> 06:11.500
And I can go ahead and paint in some little pieces of rust like so next I'm going to go ahead and paint

06:11.530 --> 06:13.380
in some darker gray on these edges.

06:13.390 --> 06:19.000
So when it's like this work great here I'm just going to paint some of that in just like so saying over

06:19.000 --> 06:26.390
here and then I'm going to go ahead and select my white and paint a little bit more white in the center

06:26.390 --> 06:27.400
area.

06:27.740 --> 06:32.880
And I'm also going to fill this top area back in with white and then add white down.

06:32.930 --> 06:38.200
These edges in with here.

06:38.320 --> 06:39.290
Perfect.

06:39.310 --> 06:43.660
Now I'm also going to add a bound sleigh on the bottom of this part of the sword.

06:43.870 --> 06:51.970
So the way I'm going to do that is by grabbing my rust color and I'm going to go ahead and bring my

06:51.970 --> 06:59.200
brush capacity up to 50 percent and I'm going to brush along this bottom edge like so and just on these

06:59.200 --> 06:59.690
edges

07:02.450 --> 07:05.400
I'm going to do the same thing underneath here on this part of the sword.

07:10.260 --> 07:14.180
And this just makes it look a little bit more interesting even if you don't know where the bounce light

07:14.180 --> 07:14.980
is coming from.

07:14.990 --> 07:19.280
It's going to make it look a lot more realistic if you can add a little bit of bounce light somewhere.

07:19.550 --> 07:24.650
So I'll go ahead and come in to my folder also and I'm going to add that down here because I didn't

07:24.650 --> 07:26.210
do it down there.

07:26.210 --> 07:33.800
So we'll start with this part out and in right along this bottom area and then we're going to come to

07:34.430 --> 07:38.240
that top part and we'll come right along this bottom area also.

07:39.460 --> 07:41.330
Perfect.

07:41.330 --> 07:46.350
Now let's go ahead and close the folder and come back into our guard folder.

07:46.570 --> 07:50.900
And now we can start selecting colors and painting with them at full opacity.

07:50.900 --> 07:55.780
So I'm going to start with this color right here and then putting my brush opacity at 100 percent I'm

07:55.810 --> 08:01.120
going to go ahead and start painting with that same with on this side and then I can go and select the

08:01.120 --> 08:03.660
next color or painting with that

08:07.880 --> 08:12.830
and then I'm going to start selecting this rust color that's sort of a mix between my white and my rust

08:12.890 --> 08:20.340
and I can start painting in those areas just like so.

08:20.580 --> 08:21.270
Awesome.

08:21.270 --> 08:22.750
Let's go ahead and zoom out and see.

08:22.770 --> 08:25.920
That looks pretty good.

08:25.920 --> 08:27.890
That brings us to the end of this lecture.

08:27.960 --> 08:32.730
So in this lecture you learn how to paint the guard of your sword and you also learn how to add a little

08:32.730 --> 08:35.560
bit of bounce light in there to make it look more realistic.

08:35.580 --> 08:40.670
Now once we get a great background in there and it's more neutral you're going to see that bounce light

08:40.710 --> 08:43.590
a lot more and it'll look a lot better.

08:43.590 --> 08:46.940
Thanks for watching this lecture and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.
