00:00.690 --> 00:04.630
In this lecture we're going to go ahead and add some text to our sign.

00:04.770 --> 00:08.840
So we want to find a really cool typeface to type our message in.

00:09.120 --> 00:17.550
So a really good place you can go to to find typeface is a Web site called define That's da f o n t.

00:17.790 --> 00:18.720
I'll the link to this.

00:18.750 --> 00:19.980
After this lecture.

00:20.280 --> 00:25.560
Now if you're going to be building graphics for a game that are going to be used commercially you need

00:25.560 --> 00:29.210
to be careful when finding typefaces on the phone.

00:29.250 --> 00:31.410
There are always commercial free use.

00:31.440 --> 00:36.890
So you need to make sure that their licensing says that you're allowed to use it in commercial projects.

00:36.900 --> 00:42.500
So let's go ahead and let's go to their Web site so see here.

00:42.800 --> 00:46.720
They have a whole bunch of really interesting fonts you can choose from.

00:47.060 --> 00:49.280
None of these are the ones we want to choose from.

00:49.340 --> 00:50.660
You'll see here at the top.

00:50.660 --> 00:52.660
They have all these different categories.

00:52.900 --> 00:59.450
And so where we're going to be going is to the cartoons but just see here they have all these different

00:59.450 --> 01:01.280
types of typefaces.

01:01.320 --> 01:03.700
We can have a look at another category.

01:03.750 --> 01:13.040
Let's try looking at destroyer you know see you get these really cool fonts but the one we want to do

01:13.130 --> 01:16.970
is in cartoon and I've already pulled it up.

01:16.970 --> 01:18.680
It's called chlorine are.

01:18.740 --> 01:20.020
I think that's how you say it.

01:20.100 --> 01:23.810
So you can go out and search that and this will come up once you find it what you're going to want to

01:23.810 --> 01:26.120
do is you're going to want to come over here to download.

01:26.210 --> 01:29.340
And we're going to hit download them down here.

01:29.360 --> 01:37.250
Once that loads going to go ahead and open it and you're going to open up this true type font file.

01:37.640 --> 01:43.590
So double click that and open and then you're just going to hit install.

01:44.450 --> 01:50.800
Now I've already installed this on my computer so I'm not going to reinstall it but for you you're going

01:50.810 --> 01:53.920
to go ahead and install that once it's installed.

01:54.110 --> 01:57.300
It's just going to automatically put it into Photoshop for you.

01:57.530 --> 02:02.730
And now we can use it.

02:03.500 --> 02:05.710
So how do you add text in Photoshop.

02:05.720 --> 02:09.360
Well we use this text tool right here that looks like a T.

02:09.440 --> 02:15.830
And then we can go ahead and click and drag and create a text box like so that we can go ahead and type

02:15.830 --> 02:17.330
whatever we want in there.

02:17.540 --> 02:26.850
So I'm going to type a message that says get as many coins as possible.

02:28.650 --> 02:32.540
Now obviously this is not the font we want and it's also not the color.

02:32.550 --> 02:36.990
So the first thing we're going to do is we're going to select it and then we're going to come up here

02:36.990 --> 02:40.310
to where the pink is now for you it might be set to a different color.

02:40.320 --> 02:42.900
But that's just the color of your font.

02:42.960 --> 02:47.790
So we're going to go ahead and click that and we can drag this to wherever we want to in the color spectrum

02:48.090 --> 02:50.380
and get it to be whatever color we like.

02:50.400 --> 02:54.640
Now I'm just going to drag it down to my blacks and hit OK.

02:55.110 --> 02:57.710
Next I'm going to change the font type.

02:57.750 --> 03:02.820
So up here where I have my font type drop down I have it set to Arial right now.

03:02.820 --> 03:04.760
I want to set that to my new font.

03:04.770 --> 03:08.650
And so if we remember what it's called chlorine are.

03:08.980 --> 03:13.310
And then we can go ahead and search that in our font search bar.

03:13.310 --> 03:14.880
So we're going to start typing it in.

03:14.880 --> 03:16.330
C h l o.

03:16.350 --> 03:17.790
I think there is.

03:17.790 --> 03:21.600
And so then I'm just going to put my down arrow key to get to it and then hit enter.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.440
So now we have our font.

03:23.520 --> 03:26.580
Next we want to enlarge it just a little bit.

03:26.850 --> 03:28.290
So I'm going to select it again.

03:28.350 --> 03:31.030
Then come over to my character window over here.

03:31.050 --> 03:36.390
Now if you don't have a character option over here you want to turn it on by coming up to window and

03:36.390 --> 03:38.490
then coming down to where it says character.

03:38.910 --> 03:43.350
Then you'll have a character window over here and you'll be able to change your characters.

03:43.350 --> 03:47.190
So what we want to do is we just want to enlarge the size just a little bit.

03:47.220 --> 03:53.630
So maybe talk about their perfect next.

03:53.670 --> 04:00.230
Let's go ahead and grab them move tool and move this down.

04:00.360 --> 04:03.900
Now I want to change something based off of my design preferences.

04:03.900 --> 04:08.130
But if you're working on a project or someone else you may not be able to do this because they've already

04:08.130 --> 04:11.070
given you the copy for what it's supposed to say.

04:11.370 --> 04:18.710
But since I'm not limited to those rules I'm going to go ahead and type in their try.

04:18.710 --> 04:24.120
Now the reason why I did that is because my as in my other as were lining up kind of funny and it made

04:24.120 --> 04:25.780
it the design really bad.

04:25.890 --> 04:28.670
So that's why I added that try and there are two space all of this out.

04:28.670 --> 04:29.360
A little bit more

04:37.210 --> 04:41.110
then I'm also going to play with the distance between the two lines of text.

04:41.110 --> 04:44.080
So right here were these two A's or one above the other.

04:44.080 --> 04:49.930
I can go ahead and drag them back and forth like so that allow me to give more distance there.

04:50.020 --> 04:52.230
So I'm going to bring it to it out there.

04:52.450 --> 04:58.900
I can also play with the distance between each letter by coming up here where it says V.A that will

04:58.900 --> 05:00.390
change that distance.

05:03.400 --> 05:06.090
So don't keep it at about 10.

05:06.400 --> 05:11.070
Next what we want to do is we want to select the shape of our font face.

05:11.080 --> 05:15.190
Now we're not going to do this by actually clicking on the thumbnail because what we could do is we

05:15.190 --> 05:17.950
can hit control or command and select thumb no.

05:18.190 --> 05:19.440
And that would select or shape.

05:19.450 --> 05:25.000
But the problem with that is that the inside of our font face is hollow and we want to fill that in

05:25.000 --> 05:25.960
with white.

05:25.960 --> 05:28.170
And so right now we can't really fill it in.

05:28.210 --> 05:34.270
And if we invert the selection it's going to fill everything out here as well as inside of our lettering.

05:34.510 --> 05:38.230
So what we want to do is we want to use a tool called the wand tool.

05:38.260 --> 05:44.230
So up here right underneath our marquee tool and next to our lasso tool is a tool called the wand tool.

05:44.230 --> 05:49.720
Now if you're not on the magic wand tool it's because you have selected the quick selection tools so

05:49.720 --> 05:52.680
make sure you have the one tool selected.

05:52.870 --> 05:58.920
And then what we're going to do is we're just going to click on the outside of our text and see it selects

05:58.960 --> 06:01.220
everything on this outside area.

06:01.540 --> 06:04.880
Then we also want to select the inside of these holes.

06:04.960 --> 06:06.610
So I'm going to zoom in there.

06:07.330 --> 06:13.300
And the way I can do that is by holding down shift on my keyboard and then clicking within the space

06:13.780 --> 06:19.210
and by holding down shift that allows us to add selections to this already made selections so I can

06:19.210 --> 06:22.790
do it here also and I can add as many of those as I need.

06:22.810 --> 06:24.630
So there's also a horde there

06:32.410 --> 06:34.620
and I think we got them all great.

06:34.620 --> 06:36.840
Let's go ahead and zoom out next.

06:36.850 --> 06:42.370
Let's invert our selection by hitting control shift I command shift II and then we're going to add a

06:42.370 --> 06:46.080
new layer underneath our text layer then using the color white.

06:46.090 --> 06:48.900
I'm going to go ahead and fill that in like so.

06:49.360 --> 06:53.010
So now we have that nice white feel inside of our text.

06:53.140 --> 06:55.150
Now I missed a few spots over here.

06:55.330 --> 07:01.420
So what I can do is I can just go ahead and zoom in there I'm using my restall I can go ahead and erase

07:01.420 --> 07:02.920
that area away.

07:06.290 --> 07:07.130
Great.

07:07.530 --> 07:09.740
See that looks awesome.

07:10.040 --> 07:14.630
Next one I want to do is I want to add a dropdown shadow on this text.

07:14.750 --> 07:19.240
So we're going to do is we're going to come over to our layer that has the white text on it.

07:19.250 --> 07:25.520
We're going to come down to effects and then come down to drop shadow then we're going to get this panel

07:25.970 --> 07:33.440
and first off what we want to do is we want to change our capacity to about 75 percent and then we're

07:33.440 --> 07:38.450
going to change the size to a pretty small size somewhere about there.

07:38.450 --> 07:44.960
And we want to turn the speed up so we get a really hard edge all the way up to 98 percent and then

07:44.990 --> 07:47.800
we're going to bring down the size a little bit more.

07:48.110 --> 07:51.770
So that's a little bit too big so similar about there should be good.

07:51.920 --> 07:59.070
So I have it set at 6 pixels for the side and 96 percent for the speed next.

07:59.090 --> 08:00.970
Let's go ahead and select a different colors.

08:00.970 --> 08:04.840
I want to select this black and let's change it to a dark brown.

08:04.850 --> 08:09.170
In fact if we come out over here you can see we can select from our document.

08:09.170 --> 08:13.550
So let's select our darkest color that we have out there and then let's make that just a little bit

08:13.550 --> 08:14.350
darker.

08:15.440 --> 08:16.020
Perfect.

08:16.110 --> 08:17.160
So okay.

08:17.510 --> 08:19.050
And then right here it says disinterest.

08:19.070 --> 08:25.100
We're going to move that out so it comes a little bit underneath our text length so now you can also

08:25.100 --> 08:31.460
change the angle at which you were cast shadows going to be Kassa if I turn this you'll see it moves

08:31.460 --> 08:32.600
it over to that side.

08:32.630 --> 08:35.360
Or if I move under it's going to move up to the top.

08:35.420 --> 08:36.470
So we want to keep that.

08:36.470 --> 08:39.230
So it's at 90 degrees.

08:39.230 --> 08:39.920
Awesome.

08:39.920 --> 08:43.320
Once we have the all set up correctly we can go ahead and hit OK.

08:43.640 --> 08:45.390
And now we have our son.

08:45.440 --> 08:49.330
Now let's go ahead and see how this looks in a background from Ray man.

08:49.340 --> 08:54.010
So let's select all of our players make a copy.

08:54.410 --> 08:56.360
Let's merge those layers together.

08:57.500 --> 09:00.050
So now we have one flattened version of her song.

09:00.090 --> 09:02.840
Now we can select the rest and put them into a folder.

09:02.870 --> 09:08.540
So we still have those layers in case we ever want to change things then we can click or layer and drag

09:08.540 --> 09:11.210
it in to our background document.

09:12.800 --> 09:15.190
And then I can shrink it down just a little bit.

09:18.390 --> 09:23.190
I think we did a pretty good job at replicating the style of Raimon.

09:23.190 --> 09:28.880
Now rereading this I realize it doesn't make any sense because it says try get as many coins as possible.

09:29.070 --> 09:32.270
So I apologize for that and I hope you can forgive me.

09:32.290 --> 09:36.840
I hope you guys enjoyed working on this project and I look forward to seeing him in the next lecture.

09:37.020 --> 09:37.890
Thanks for watching.
