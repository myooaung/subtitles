00:00.710 --> 00:06.950
In this lecture we're going to go ahead and get started with creating our first asset in this course.

00:07.230 --> 00:10.230
So what we're going to do first is we're going to add a new layer.

00:10.500 --> 00:14.190
My document is 800 pixels by 450 pixels.

00:14.190 --> 00:19.590
If you're wondering what I'm going to do is on this new layer I'm going to go ahead and create a horizon

00:19.590 --> 00:20.430
line.

00:20.430 --> 00:24.990
Now we're going to be creating a wooden crate and that's why we need to create some perspective for

00:24.990 --> 00:25.830
this.

00:26.010 --> 00:30.190
Next I'm going to create two points so one here and one here.

00:30.990 --> 00:35.850
Then I'm going to decide where I want my middle line or the corner of my crate to be.

00:35.850 --> 00:39.280
So I'm going to place it about here.

00:39.840 --> 00:48.600
Then I'm going to go ahead and connect these points.

00:48.710 --> 00:52.570
So then we can go ahead and add our outer lines.

00:52.620 --> 00:55.100
So I'll add one right here.

00:55.220 --> 01:01.010
Whoops I had one right here and then I'll also add one right here.

01:01.530 --> 01:03.520
All these little lines that are sticking off.

01:03.580 --> 01:03.990
They're fine.

01:03.990 --> 01:05.970
We can go ahead and erase them.

01:09.400 --> 01:09.770
Next.

01:09.790 --> 01:13.540
Let's go ahead and erase away while these other lines that we don't want

01:20.820 --> 01:23.870
can also just go ahead and enlarge the size of our brush.

01:24.210 --> 01:26.370
Get rid of all of this over here.

01:28.700 --> 01:29.330
Perfect.

01:29.330 --> 01:35.250
So now we have the shape of our crate next to what we want to do is we want to create the actual plank

01:35.260 --> 01:41.390
pattern that's going to be on the face of our crate next to what we want to do is we want to grab our

01:41.390 --> 01:42.990
shape tool over here.

01:43.130 --> 01:47.510
Remember when you use this to create our circle or use the ellipse tool.

01:47.750 --> 01:52.010
Well this time we're going to use the rectangle tool and we're going to create a perfect square.

01:52.030 --> 01:59.010
So I click and drag and hold down shift to keep its proportions and to create a perfect square.

01:59.180 --> 02:01.190
And we can go ahead and let go.

02:01.280 --> 02:08.930
Now let's go ahead and change our stroke to our black color and then let's change the width of our line

02:09.080 --> 02:10.830
to 4 pixels.

02:12.460 --> 02:13.450
It's a little bit too thick.

02:13.450 --> 02:15.730
So let's change it to three.

02:15.730 --> 02:16.950
Perfect.

02:16.960 --> 02:20.150
Now let's go ahead and flatten this layer by trying to erase it.

02:20.590 --> 02:23.120
So now we can go ahead and erase that because it's flattened.

02:23.930 --> 02:28.570
Then we're going to go ahead and copy this layer by hitting control J on your keyboard or commanded

02:28.580 --> 02:29.050
J.

02:29.150 --> 02:35.450
If you're on a Mac and you see my Transform Tool which if you remember is control t on your keyboard

02:35.630 --> 02:42.600
or command t if you're on a Mac we're going to go ahead and shrink this down like step burna grab that

02:42.640 --> 02:45.430
and we're going to try to Centra as best as possible.

02:46.550 --> 02:51.530
Now if you have Photoshop set up correctly it should snap right into the center like so.

02:51.560 --> 02:53.340
Go ahead and enter.

02:53.360 --> 02:58.880
Now if yours is not snapping right into the center it's because you don't have your snap to turned on

02:59.360 --> 03:05.300
the way you turn that on is by coming up to view and coming down to snap to and make sure that you have

03:05.300 --> 03:05.970
guides.

03:06.060 --> 03:09.610
Layers and document bounds selected.

03:10.400 --> 03:16.490
Next we want to create the two criss crossing planks that will criss cross on the face of our crate.

03:16.580 --> 03:23.600
So the way we're going to do that is by adding a new layer switching over to a brush tool and then we're

03:23.600 --> 03:24.780
just going to guesstimate.

03:24.800 --> 03:30.540
So probably starting if we come straight down from here you can go ahead and make a dot or a point and

03:30.560 --> 03:36.530
holding down shift will come over and coming straight over from that corner to there well make a line

03:36.680 --> 03:42.950
just like so let's do the same for the other side so we'll come straight over like so make a point and

03:42.950 --> 03:47.060
then come straight over from this corner like so.

03:47.450 --> 03:50.680
So now we have our first plank going across there.

03:50.690 --> 03:55.740
Now let's create the other diagonal plank so we'll do the same thing comes straight down from there.

03:55.970 --> 03:58.460
Down shift come straight over from there.

04:01.090 --> 04:02.520
It once more for the site

04:07.730 --> 04:13.580
perfect next what you want to do is we want to erase away and you know this area that's hanging over

04:13.670 --> 04:14.680
so using my array's tool.

04:14.710 --> 04:16.520
Go ahead and race that away.

04:26.890 --> 04:31.120
Then lastly we want to erase away one of these two sets of lines.

04:31.150 --> 04:33.760
So one is going to be overlapping the other.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.740
So I'm going to choose this one.

04:36.100 --> 04:38.430
I'll just erase away those two lines.

04:38.470 --> 04:39.390
Perfect.

04:39.400 --> 04:45.580
So now we have the basic setup for the design of our crate next to what we want to do is we want to

04:45.580 --> 04:50.920
merge these three layers together so to select them all by starting with the top layer holding down

04:50.920 --> 04:56.210
shift and selecting the third layer down and that will select all of those.

04:56.230 --> 04:59.420
Then if I right click it can come over to merge layers.

04:59.680 --> 05:04.020
And now all of those layers have become one next.

05:04.060 --> 05:10.750
Let's go ahead and make a copy of this layer because we want to keep a flat version so that later we

05:10.750 --> 05:14.130
can come back to it and create the texture for crate.

05:14.560 --> 05:18.610
But for now we're just going to set up the mockup drawing for a crate.

05:18.610 --> 05:23.920
So using this guy right here we're going to go ahead and turn on the Transform Tool by hitting control

05:23.920 --> 05:25.130
T or command.

05:25.170 --> 05:28.480
If you're on a Mac then right click and come to distort.

05:28.840 --> 05:34.360
And just like we did with that circle we're going to go ahead and drag these points to the corners of

05:34.390 --> 05:35.100
our crate

05:39.530 --> 05:44.240
and now our Krait pattern is in the correct perspective for our cube.

05:44.420 --> 05:44.930
Go ahead.

05:44.960 --> 05:50.870
OK then let's go ahead and do the same thing again so we'll come back down to our original flat layer

05:51.050 --> 05:58.190
and we'll go ahead and copy that layer can drag that over turn on and Transform Tool Right-Click come

05:58.190 --> 05:59.510
down to distort.

05:59.870 --> 06:04.770
Now we can go and drag those to the corners of our cube.

06:09.080 --> 06:09.710
Perfect.

06:09.710 --> 06:11.750
Let's go ahead and hit enter.

06:11.750 --> 06:12.800
Great.

06:12.830 --> 06:17.470
Now the last thing we want to do is we want to add some dimension to these criss crossing points.

06:17.630 --> 06:22.580
So right now this all looks pretty flat the way we're going to add that dimension is by using our brush

06:22.580 --> 06:25.860
tool and bringing down the size all the way.

06:26.180 --> 06:33.110
And then we're going to add a new layer above these then we're going to click here and go straight across

06:33.980 --> 06:39.600
like so do the same here go straight across like so.

06:39.900 --> 06:45.290
And then all we have to do is use our arrays tool to erase away any area that went overboard.

06:45.570 --> 06:49.260
But now you see the adds a new dimension to these planks.

06:49.710 --> 06:54.330
Let's do the same for the other side so we're going to have a straight line going up right there and

06:54.330 --> 06:59.760
then we're also going to see a little bit of this top surface like so and a little bit of this bottom

06:59.760 --> 07:04.440
surface like so perfect.

07:04.440 --> 07:06.510
Now we want to do the same for the other side.

07:06.660 --> 07:11.090
So we'll click here come down and we'll click here

07:14.580 --> 07:20.670
and we can go ahead and race away any area that went over our planks then will go ahead and finish up

07:20.670 --> 07:29.980
by getting this side and we'll get this top edge and this bottom edge also.

07:30.440 --> 07:34.370
Let's go ahead and zoom out and see how that looks perfect.

07:34.400 --> 07:37.790
So now we have the mockup drawing for a crate in the next lecture.

07:37.790 --> 07:43.670
We're going to go ahead and create some wood texture for this flap design over here and then we're going

07:43.670 --> 07:47.350
to apply that to our actual crate over here.

07:47.810 --> 07:48.570
Thanks for watching.

07:48.590 --> 07:50.430
And I look forward to seeing you in the next election.
