00:00.480 --> 00:06.180
Many of you are probably familiar with the game the Raimon it's been rated as one of the number one

00:06.390 --> 00:10.500
most well-designed games as well as one of the most beautiful games.

00:10.530 --> 00:12.440
And I definitely agree with that.

00:12.450 --> 00:16.230
So today we're going to go ahead and try to create an asset from this game.

00:16.380 --> 00:20.650
So the asset we're going to be creating is this little bottle potion right here.

00:20.940 --> 00:25.560
So the first thing we want to do is we want to draw our sketch out for it.

00:25.620 --> 00:32.180
So we're going to add a new layer and then I'm going switch my color over to black or gray.

00:32.220 --> 00:37.230
I like to sketch with a little bit lighter colors than black and then I'm going to change my brush to

00:37.230 --> 00:38.960
a paint brush tool.

00:39.660 --> 00:41.450
And now we can go ahead and just get sketching.

00:41.490 --> 00:48.270
Now I have my canvas at the size of 1920 by 10 A.D. and the reason for this is because when you're playing

00:48.270 --> 00:53.810
a game such as in rain in this bottle sometimes will show up full size on your entire screen.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.330
So you want to create your assets at the largest size that they're ever going to be seen.

00:58.350 --> 01:03.510
And that way you can shrink it down and not resolute lose resolution if you create them too small.

01:03.510 --> 01:05.030
And then you try to enlarge them.

01:05.040 --> 01:09.290
They're going to lose all their resolution and become pixilated and blurry.

01:09.300 --> 01:11.090
So let's go ahead and get sketching.

01:11.280 --> 01:16.890
So the bottles basically just sort of like a circle so or an oval

01:20.810 --> 01:23.210
and this does not have to be perfect at all.

01:23.320 --> 01:24.820
Go ahead and clean it up later.

01:27.230 --> 01:28.410
And you have the stem

01:31.920 --> 01:34.170
and then you get the base down here.

01:41.930 --> 01:43.210
Then we have the top part.

01:43.210 --> 01:48.600
I'm going to draw an oval for that and we can add a little bit more detail later.

01:49.230 --> 02:02.150
And then we have the cork draw another oval on top to represent the top that cork.

02:02.210 --> 02:07.120
So once you're happy with the shape of your bottle you can go ahead and move forward.

02:07.130 --> 02:09.070
Now you can try a couple of different things.

02:09.080 --> 02:13.970
I recommend that you actually create a lot of different thumbnails when you're designing things and

02:13.970 --> 02:20.090
what that means is say for example our task was to create a bunch of potions and then we would want

02:20.090 --> 02:23.720
to do a bunch of different designs and try to find which one is the best one.

02:23.780 --> 02:25.540
And a thumbnail is just a small sketch.

02:25.550 --> 02:32.030
So we would maybe try one like this and the stem would be going like that with a cork like that.

02:32.030 --> 02:38.710
Or we might try one like this the stem like that or we might try one.

02:38.760 --> 02:43.030
That's a perfect circle stem like that.

02:43.250 --> 02:48.350
So we try a bunch of different types of bottles and then try to decide which ones are the best ones

02:48.440 --> 02:51.380
and then take those ones and develop them further.

02:51.410 --> 02:54.110
But in this case we're just going to be copying this one right here.

02:54.140 --> 02:59.240
So we're going to go ahead and delete all these and get started with this right here.

02:59.630 --> 03:03.940
So the first thing we want to do is we want to create a mirrored shape.

03:04.070 --> 03:08.240
So the first thing we're going to do is we're going to add a new layer then we're going to come over

03:08.240 --> 03:14.600
here to our marquee tool and we're going to change it to the elliptical marquee tool and they're going

03:14.600 --> 03:18.180
to go ahead and make an oval that's about the size that we just drew.

03:18.230 --> 03:22.400
So maybe somewhere about there you might have to grab it.

03:22.400 --> 03:29.060
Move it back into place then let's go ahead and fill that in with our gray color.

03:29.060 --> 03:32.930
Next we're going to go ahead and do this bottom part in the way we're going to do it is we're going

03:32.930 --> 03:41.290
to make a copy of this flayer control J or command J will drag that underneath and then we're going

03:41.290 --> 03:49.150
to move it down so it matches up with this bottom stand down here so we can use the arrow keys on a

03:49.150 --> 03:55.310
keyboard to push that down told me right there that we're going to go ahead and use our Eraste tool.

03:55.600 --> 03:59.720
We're going to bring up our brush size and we're going to go out and erase.

03:59.830 --> 04:05.830
I'm going to turn the opacity down on the Slayer so that I can see the drawing underneath.

04:06.760 --> 04:14.010
And we can go ahead and continue the racing.

04:14.790 --> 04:16.840
We can turn that opacity back up.

04:16.950 --> 04:17.370
Perfect.

04:17.370 --> 04:19.060
So now we have our little stand.

04:19.230 --> 04:25.100
Now I'm going to move it over just the tiniest bit because it seems a little off centered.

04:25.440 --> 04:25.970
Next.

04:26.100 --> 04:30.760
Let's go ahead and add the stem so I'm going to add a new layer.

04:30.870 --> 04:35.910
And on this new layer I'm going to use my rectangular marquee tool to create the stem

04:38.680 --> 04:40.670
so fill that in.

04:40.780 --> 04:45.550
Next I'm going to turn on my Transform Tool which is going to be control T and then I'm going to come

04:45.550 --> 04:47.390
down to warp.

04:47.650 --> 04:49.960
And then you get this grid system on your selection.

04:49.960 --> 04:55.240
What this allows you to do is allows you to grab an area and pull it wherever you'd like.

04:55.240 --> 04:56.890
So I'm going to pull mine in

05:00.470 --> 05:04.460
something like so so it lines up with our original drawing.

05:11.430 --> 05:13.000
You can hit enter.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.830
Next I'm going to create this top part.

05:14.950 --> 05:18.410
The switch back over to my elliptical marquee tool.

05:18.420 --> 05:20.500
I'm going to make that oval right there.

05:23.280 --> 05:24.640
There should be good.

05:25.170 --> 05:29.050
And then before I feel that I want to make sure I do this on a different layer.

05:29.160 --> 05:33.150
The reason why we're doing them on different layers is because we might want to move them and adjust

05:33.150 --> 05:33.510
them.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.840
And if they're on the same layer we're not going to be able to do that.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.890
So let's go and fill this in.

05:38.940 --> 05:45.320
They're going to make a copy of this paste it and drag it up above it like so.

05:45.880 --> 05:49.810
Now we're going to leave the cork out for now because it's not a part of the glass part of the bottle

05:49.870 --> 05:52.330
which is what we're going to work on first.

05:52.390 --> 05:56.730
So let's go ahead and turn off our background sketch and see how this looks.

05:57.320 --> 05:57.720
Right.

05:57.730 --> 05:58.860
It looks pretty good.

05:59.170 --> 06:05.140
Now if yours is really off and it's not very symmetrical what you can do is you can go ahead and merge

06:05.140 --> 06:06.310
all your layers together

06:09.730 --> 06:16.410
and then you can use your rectangular marquee tool to select right down the middle like so.

06:16.840 --> 06:23.190
And then you can copy that and paste it then using your Transform Tool.

06:23.290 --> 06:31.020
You'll right click come to flip horizontal and then you can line it up like so.

06:31.180 --> 06:34.840
And that will give you a more symmetrical shape.

06:34.840 --> 06:38.270
Now let's go ahead and merge both those letters together.

06:38.890 --> 06:42.950
And now we have the basic shape for our potion.

06:42.970 --> 06:48.160
Now the reason why we just created a gray silhouette of our potion is because we're going to create

06:48.220 --> 06:54.160
some clipping masks for this layer and we're going to paint within those gray silhouette is actually

06:54.160 --> 06:56.440
not even going to be a part of our final product.

06:56.440 --> 07:01.730
The only thing we're going to take away from it is the shape before we end this lecture.

07:01.750 --> 07:06.730
I'm going to go ahead and change my background to a different color so I'm going to change it to a more

07:06.790 --> 07:09.150
neutral gray.

07:09.210 --> 07:14.070
The reason why I'm doing that is because our bottle is actually going to be transparent that way if

07:14.070 --> 07:18.540
we apply this bottle to any background we're going to be able to see the background through it which

07:18.540 --> 07:22.170
would be really nice and make it look a lot more realistic.

07:22.260 --> 07:27.350
And so by changing it to gray it allows us to see the reflections and highlights on the glass.

07:27.390 --> 07:29.340
Once we start painting that.

07:29.460 --> 07:32.930
Thanks for watching this lecture and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.
