00:00.410 --> 00:06.080
Aren't in this lecture we're going to be creating a new prop which is going to be a potion book.

00:06.120 --> 00:08.170
So let's go ahead and get started.

00:08.370 --> 00:13.200
So the first thing we're going to do is we're going to make a top surface for a book and also add some

00:13.200 --> 00:14.610
texture to it.

00:14.610 --> 00:18.340
So I have a 1000 by 1000 pixel document here.

00:18.420 --> 00:21.180
I've filled the background in with this mid-tone gray.

00:21.290 --> 00:23.280
I'll show you the color right now.

00:23.880 --> 00:25.390
So here's the color out there.

00:25.440 --> 00:30.630
There it's color number and then I've added a new layer above that which is where I'm going to be creating

00:30.840 --> 00:32.540
my book.

00:32.580 --> 00:38.580
So first I only use my Marki tool and I'm going to select a rectangular shape like so then I'm going

00:38.580 --> 00:43.110
to go ahead and grab a dark purplish most burgundy color.

00:43.290 --> 00:48.810
So maybe somewhere in there maybe a little bit darker and go ahead and actually I think I want to make

00:48.810 --> 00:50.330
that just a tiny bit lighter.

00:50.340 --> 00:50.640
Go ahead.

00:50.640 --> 00:51.480
Hit OK.

00:51.540 --> 00:53.610
Gentlemen go ahead and fill that in.

00:53.700 --> 00:57.540
Next I'm going to go ahead and create a new layer above this.

00:57.540 --> 00:59.520
Then holding down alt or option.

00:59.520 --> 01:04.020
If you're on a Mac you're going to go ahead and hover between these two until you get this arrow pointing

01:04.020 --> 01:06.800
down at your other layer with a box next to it.

01:06.870 --> 01:10.920
Once you get that you can go ahead and click between the two of them and that will automatically create

01:10.920 --> 01:13.260
a layer mask for this layer.

01:13.260 --> 01:16.450
So this is a much quicker way to create clipping layer mask.

01:16.700 --> 01:21.790
Then let's go ahead and use then we're going to go ahead and use airbrush tool.

01:21.930 --> 01:24.270
And I'm going to be using this brush right here.

01:24.300 --> 01:26.340
So this is just a generic brush.

01:26.350 --> 01:31.230
You can find here in Photoshop down here towards the bottom and it has the number 100 underneath it

01:31.600 --> 01:33.900
and all it has is just a bunch of little spots.

01:33.900 --> 01:37.880
If we go ahead as base these out you'll see it's just a bunch of little dots all together.

01:38.040 --> 01:42.030
We want to keep that together so it's a nice brush.

01:42.030 --> 01:46.260
And then I'm going go ahead and bring my brushes a little bit and then I want to go ahead and select

01:46.350 --> 01:52.300
a Durka version of this so I need to come down there and maybe more into my purple's.

01:52.530 --> 01:53.390
OK.

01:53.710 --> 01:58.350
And then I'm going to bring my brush capacity down to 20 percent by hitting the number and keyboard

01:58.630 --> 02:04.260
and now going to began painting in a little bit more texture onto my book.

02:04.270 --> 02:07.150
Now I want the edges of my book to be darker than anywhere else.

02:07.150 --> 02:13.420
So that's why I'm painting mostly on these edges and I'm just adding in some random marks in there and

02:13.450 --> 02:17.830
don't worry it doesn't look perfect we can always go back and erase or we can even go back and paint

02:17.860 --> 02:20.600
over it which is what we're going to be doing in this case.

02:21.040 --> 02:24.550
So once we got some marks in there next what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and switch

02:24.550 --> 02:25.970
over to a lighter color.

02:25.990 --> 02:29.060
Someone to come up to about there maybe a little bit more saturated.

02:29.440 --> 02:34.250
And then I'm going to come down into more of my orange colors so maybe about there.

02:34.360 --> 02:35.210
Okay.

02:35.350 --> 02:36.640
And then I'm gonna start painting with this.

02:36.640 --> 02:41.230
And I'm still painting at 20 percent opacity and I'm just going to paint right across the top.

02:41.260 --> 02:45.020
So I just want to keep this very organic looking.

02:45.640 --> 02:49.690
And then I switch back over to this darker purple color by selecting it with my eyedropper and then

02:49.690 --> 03:03.200
I'll begin painting that over the top of this until I get this looking just the way I want.

03:03.500 --> 03:08.320
You can also grab a few other colors so we can go ahead and grab let's say a Brownson to come into my

03:08.320 --> 03:09.650
dirt Browns.

03:09.940 --> 03:11.410
I'll paint a little bit with that

03:15.750 --> 03:21.490
can also go ahead and grab the blue just add some more color in there and bring it up to somewhere in

03:21.490 --> 03:22.040
here.

03:22.110 --> 03:22.790
OK.

03:23.200 --> 03:27.460
I'll go ahead and add a few marks with this and I'm going to bring my brush opacity down to 10 percent

03:27.460 --> 03:28.020
now.

03:28.330 --> 03:29.350
So it's even lighter

03:34.450 --> 03:40.150
can also grab some read so come all the way up into my Reade's pay a little bit of some red in there

03:40.150 --> 03:44.070
just to give our book cover a little bit more color and more depth.

03:44.080 --> 03:48.160
Sometimes you don't realize it but in really good art you'll find that there are a lot of different

03:48.160 --> 03:49.580
colors in there.

03:49.750 --> 03:54.640
Then I'm going to go ahead and select this color right there that we originally had for highlight and

03:54.640 --> 03:59.740
I'm just going to paint over all this once again just to sort of bring it all together and I might add

03:59.740 --> 04:01.040
a few layers of this.

04:01.060 --> 04:03.850
Just go scribble across it.

04:07.600 --> 04:08.310
Great.

04:08.470 --> 04:13.920
You can also go in here and find maybe another brush spaced out and just add a little bit more of a

04:13.990 --> 04:14.940
different texture.

04:14.980 --> 04:21.340
Some of them are Bursar's up and then I'll go ahead and switch over to let's say a derk greyish brown

04:21.340 --> 04:22.740
color so maybe in there.

04:22.980 --> 04:23.430
OK.

04:23.440 --> 04:25.700
And then I'm going to add in just a few spots here.

04:25.750 --> 04:31.000
I'm going to bring my brush rapacity up to 20 percent then I'll just add in a few texture spots with

04:31.000 --> 04:33.770
this brush.

04:33.970 --> 04:37.140
Now noticing that it's a little bit darker up here at this top side.

04:37.150 --> 04:41.020
So what I'm going to do is to select this lighter color here and I'm going to paint this topside just

04:41.020 --> 04:42.640
a little bit more.

04:42.640 --> 04:42.960
All right.

04:42.970 --> 04:43.630
Perfect.

04:43.630 --> 04:46.130
I think that looks pretty good for our texture.

04:46.300 --> 04:50.410
Next what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and merge our clipping layer mask and our shape

04:50.410 --> 04:51.150
layer together.

04:51.160 --> 04:53.470
So that's all one layer.

04:53.470 --> 04:59.050
Then I'm going to go ahead and use my Transform Tool by hitting control T or command t if you're on

04:59.050 --> 04:59.700
a Mac.

04:59.890 --> 05:05.260
And what I want to do is I want to put this plane or this surface into perspective.

05:05.350 --> 05:10.270
So I'm in right click and I'm going to come to distort and then what I'm gonna do is going to grab this

05:10.310 --> 05:12.160
middle guy right here at the bottom.

05:12.220 --> 05:16.530
And now if I drag that you'll see it'll drag my two edge points out here with it.

05:16.600 --> 05:23.090
So I'm going to drag this so we can sort of slant our image over and also squash it a little bit.

05:23.410 --> 05:28.180
So maybe two right about there and we can bring this guy down maybe a little bit.

05:28.180 --> 05:29.300
All right perfect.

05:29.350 --> 05:33.250
But now we don't just want to have perspective going in this direction we want to also get a little

05:33.250 --> 05:36.510
bit perspective on our horizontal axis also.

05:36.670 --> 05:41.350
So I'm going to go ahead and grab this corner of here and I'm to bring it down to about there and then

05:41.350 --> 05:45.310
I want to grab this corner and bring this up to about there and I want to try to get the seam angle

05:45.310 --> 05:47.190
on the top as I have on the bottom.

05:47.290 --> 05:50.190
So this angle and this angle should be matching.

05:50.440 --> 05:52.280
Then I'll go ahead and hit enter.

05:52.690 --> 05:54.870
And now we have the top surface of our book.

05:54.880 --> 05:58.130
Next we want to go ahead and create the bottom surface of our book.

05:58.300 --> 06:01.500
So we're going to go ahead and hit Control J or commanded J.

06:01.510 --> 06:04.980
If you're on a Mac and now we have a copy of that.

06:05.020 --> 06:10.660
So I'm actually going to bring this bottom layer down so bring that down to you right about there and

06:10.660 --> 06:15.940
we can bring it straight down but since this isn't a perspective on our x and y access we need to go

06:15.940 --> 06:23.620
ahead and do this over a little bit so that these lines here are also going to be at a horizontal angle.

06:23.830 --> 06:27.100
Next we need to go ahead and create the spine for our book.

06:27.100 --> 06:31.390
So the way I'm going to do that is I'm going to go ahead and make a copy of this bottom layer and then

06:31.390 --> 06:35.890
I'm going to go ahead and use my Lasso tool and I'm just going to cut right through the middle of it

06:35.950 --> 06:39.550
maybe even a little past the middle and I'll go ahead and delete all of that here.

06:39.670 --> 06:43.690
You can't tell it's deleted but if I go ahead and move that letter you'll see that I've deleted all

06:43.690 --> 06:49.210
that then I'm going to go ahead and turn on the Transform Tool and then I'm going to right click come

06:49.210 --> 06:49.990
to work.

06:50.290 --> 06:55.270
And what I want to do is I want to work this up so this matches appear to that corner and then I want

06:55.270 --> 06:56.440
to work this side up.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.550
So it matches that corner also.

06:58.720 --> 07:02.820
But I want to make sure that it's also touching down here at the bottom corner.

07:02.890 --> 07:09.170
So right about there.

07:09.190 --> 07:10.280
All right great.

07:10.300 --> 07:11.950
I think that should work perfect.

07:11.950 --> 07:16.480
So now we're going to go ahead and enter in then what we want to do is we want to go ahead and use our

07:16.480 --> 07:21.880
Lasso tool on the switch over to my polygon a Lasso tool and I get a click from this corner all the

07:21.880 --> 07:22.580
way in to here.

07:22.600 --> 07:25.570
And then all the way down to there and then connected back.

07:25.570 --> 07:28.790
So I can delete everything that's underneath this front cover of the book.

07:28.840 --> 07:34.030
So I hit delete and then I want to go ahead and delete a straight line coming all the way across here

07:34.290 --> 07:41.500
like so just so that we can get this line a bit straighter and then using my earpiece tool and I want

07:41.500 --> 07:43.980
to make sure I'm on a hard edged brush.

07:44.230 --> 07:49.420
I'm going to go ahead anyway so away a little bit more of a curve into the spine of the book right there.

07:49.690 --> 07:52.710
So now that's curved just a little bit more.

07:52.810 --> 07:56.250
So now we have the basic parts of our book cover.

07:56.440 --> 08:00.820
But what we need to do now is we need to add a little bit of some shadowing in there to make this look

08:00.820 --> 08:02.330
a little bit more realistic.

08:02.380 --> 08:07.630
So I'm going to first off start with the bottom book cover then I to hit control you or command you

08:07.630 --> 08:11.860
if you're on a Mac and now you can go ahead and darken that a little bit because since it's on the bottom

08:11.860 --> 08:14.030
it's going to be getting a little bit more shadow.

08:14.260 --> 08:17.630
And then we can bring the saturation up just a tiny bit.

08:17.650 --> 08:21.530
The darker things get the more saturated they tend to become.

08:21.670 --> 08:22.490
So then we'll go ahead.

08:22.540 --> 08:23.450
OK.

08:23.860 --> 08:27.210
Then we want to do the same thing for the spine because we're going to say that the light source is

08:27.210 --> 08:28.410
coming from over here.

08:28.470 --> 08:32.470
So it's going to be hitting the top surface and the side surfaces over here that you can't see.

08:32.560 --> 08:36.960
So that means this surface over here on the spine is going to be a shadow surface.

08:36.970 --> 08:40.290
So once again we'll have control you or command you if you're on a Mac.

08:40.480 --> 08:45.580
We're going to go dark in that and I'm going to darken it a little bit darker than our bottom book cover.

08:45.640 --> 08:47.440
So right about there should be good.

08:47.620 --> 08:52.630
And then going to bring up the saturation just a tiny bit hit OK and then we're going to go ahead and

08:52.690 --> 08:54.690
merge our spine layer.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.830
And our top surface layer together.

08:56.890 --> 08:58.480
So that's all going to be one layer.

08:58.480 --> 09:02.410
Now we don't want to merge to this bottom layer because we're going to add some pages in here between

09:02.410 --> 09:04.660
the front and the back cover.

09:04.660 --> 09:09.690
And if those are merged together we're not going to be able to insert them underneath this from cover.

09:09.700 --> 09:14.320
Next I'm going to go ahead and zoom in here just a little bit and then I'm going select my dark color

09:14.320 --> 09:18.570
on the spine and then using my brush tool and I'm to bring down the brush size.

09:18.610 --> 09:22.190
And if you like you can stay on the textured brush you can use whatever box you'd like.

09:22.210 --> 09:30.220
I'm going to paint right along this edge and I'm going to start blending in this edge to the top surface

09:30.220 --> 09:31.690
of my book.

09:31.750 --> 09:37.330
So once it's blended to about this point I'm going go ahead and select this top book cover and I'll

09:37.330 --> 09:45.130
go ahead and blend into the spun then once I have that blended in I'm going to go ahead and select this

09:45.130 --> 09:46.740
in mid color that we have here.

09:46.960 --> 09:48.640
And then I'm going to switch over to a different brush.

09:48.640 --> 09:51.800
I think I can grab a different brush that will do a better job of this.

09:51.820 --> 09:53.970
So many this rush toward here.

09:54.190 --> 09:59.410
And also remember that we're painting at 20 percent opacity when we're doing this and I'm going to paint

09:59.470 --> 10:00.520
right along the edge

10:03.340 --> 10:04.710
and that just helps it blend in.

10:04.750 --> 10:10.710
So it's not such a hard edge between the top surface and the back of the spine aren't.

10:10.750 --> 10:15.040
Now lastly what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and shape the shape of our book cover a

10:15.040 --> 10:16.070
little bit more.

10:16.150 --> 10:21.460
So using my arrays tool and I'm going to switch over to this paint brush tool for my racer and what

10:21.460 --> 10:26.290
I want to do is just erase away some of these areas on the corners so they're not such hard edges or

10:26.350 --> 10:27.660
sharp corners.

10:27.850 --> 10:33.280
And then I'm also going to break up the lines of the edges of my book just a little bit so it looks

10:33.280 --> 10:39.550
a little bit older more tattered and beat to the same thing appear on the top can even add in maybe

10:39.550 --> 10:42.180
just a type of notch going in there.

10:42.280 --> 10:49.960
We also want to do the same thing down here on the bottom and maybe even shape out the spine a little

10:49.960 --> 10:50.460
bit more.

10:50.500 --> 10:52.980
So it's not such a straight line.

10:53.320 --> 10:57.460
Then we'll go ahead and switch down to the bottom book cover and we'll do the same thing.

10:57.460 --> 11:01.180
So going to race the way this corner a little bit and a little bit more shape in there

11:05.880 --> 11:06.290
all right.

11:06.330 --> 11:07.020
Perfect.

11:07.020 --> 11:09.080
I think that will work great.

11:09.090 --> 11:14.220
So now we have the basic setup for a book in the next lecture we're going to go ahead and create the

11:14.220 --> 11:17.010
book pages that go between our two covers.

11:17.040 --> 11:21.460
I really hope you enjoy this lecture and I'm looking forward to seeing you in the next one.
