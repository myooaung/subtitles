00:00.710 --> 00:05.680
In this lecture we're going to go ahead and take our two planks of wood and apply them toward drawing.

00:05.880 --> 00:12.350
So first let's go out and select both our layers and them let's merge them together and using my marquee.

00:12.360 --> 00:17.700
I'm going to go ahead and select one of them and then I'm going to copy and paste it into my drawing

00:17.700 --> 00:18.740
document.

00:19.320 --> 00:23.840
Then we can go ahead and shrink this down and rotate it.

00:23.910 --> 00:29.330
We're going to do the same like we did with our first crate that we created.

00:29.330 --> 00:33.920
And we're just going to create a panel of wooden boards.

00:36.740 --> 00:39.080
We can also go ahead and drag this up to the top.

00:39.080 --> 00:44.000
Above all of our drawing layers and we're also going to select all of our drawing layers and put those

00:44.000 --> 00:48.710
into a folder so that we can turn them off and on with one click.

00:49.040 --> 00:53.550
Now let's go ahead and come back into our document with our texture and let's select the other point

00:53.580 --> 01:03.350
Colwood copy it and paste it and we can go ahead and shrink that down rotate it

01:07.390 --> 01:10.130
and then we're going to go ahead and shrink that down to scale.

01:14.360 --> 01:19.390
Next let's go ahead and copy the sky right here.

01:19.910 --> 01:24.770
Paestum bring him to the top and just like we did before with our first crate.

01:24.770 --> 01:32.190
Let's go ahead and flip this guy or Azonto and then we're going to flip him vertical.

01:32.870 --> 01:33.740
Perfect.

01:33.740 --> 01:38.580
Now let's go ahead and grab this guy right here.

01:38.660 --> 01:41.990
They're going to select him copy them and paste them.

01:42.130 --> 01:43.550
We'll track that up to the top

01:46.610 --> 01:53.840
and then we're going to transform him and flip them horizontal then we're going to flip them vertical.

01:53.850 --> 01:55.750
Great center.

01:56.270 --> 01:58.480
And lastly let's go ahead and grab

02:01.340 --> 02:04.170
this guy right here.

02:04.170 --> 02:10.730
Copy and paste them and bring them to the top and get him into position.

02:10.740 --> 02:16.290
Now this guy's not making it all the way up to the very top of our box and that's OK because we're going

02:16.290 --> 02:19.390
to have the frame and the crossing boards going across this.

02:19.410 --> 02:22.500
And so you're not going to see this area of that board.

02:22.530 --> 02:25.350
Now let's go ahead and merge all these together.

02:27.710 --> 02:35.300
Now let's go ahead and make a copy of this letter and drag that copy over like so used the Transform

02:35.300 --> 02:40.820
Tool and then right click and come to distort and we'll just drag these points to the corner of our

02:40.820 --> 02:41.510
crate.

02:48.950 --> 02:49.470
Great.

02:49.520 --> 02:50.660
Let's hit enter.

02:50.810 --> 02:52.010
Let's do this once again.

02:52.070 --> 03:05.690
Copy drag this guy over and then use our Transform Tool to not distort and get these corners in the

03:05.690 --> 03:07.070
correct place.

03:17.580 --> 03:21.250
Enter And we have a little bit of gap right there.

03:21.270 --> 03:25.120
I want to go ahead and use the arrow keys on the keyboard not just over one.

03:25.290 --> 03:26.610
Perfect.

03:26.850 --> 03:33.590
Next let's go ahead and build our crossing pattern and our frame pattern so we can turn this guy off.

03:33.900 --> 03:40.060
And now we're going to go ahead and copy this guy Paestum in.

03:40.740 --> 03:47.860
And this is going to be exactly like what we did with the first crate.

03:48.220 --> 03:56.580
So make sure we get that guy's portion is correct and the right size enter we're off by one pixel but

03:56.590 --> 04:01.320
that's all we have to do is turn on the Transform Tool and drag it down.

04:01.330 --> 04:04.930
Now sometimes it won't let you drag it one pick so unless you zoomed in enough.

04:04.930 --> 04:13.510
So let's go ahead and hit enter so we can zoom in zoom all the way in there turn our transform and turn

04:13.510 --> 04:19.180
our Transform Tool back on drag right down like so.

04:19.730 --> 04:21.020
Perfect.

04:21.020 --> 04:26.160
Now let's go ahead and turn down the opacity on the Slayer so we can see this edge right here.

04:26.330 --> 04:27.870
Go ahead and just cut that away.

04:27.870 --> 04:34.240
He's in our marquee tool and we'll turn the opacity back up.

04:34.250 --> 04:41.730
Then let's select him copy them and paste them and we're going to rotate this guy.

04:41.750 --> 04:52.010
I remember that we want the shadow edge on the inside of our frame and get this guy into position.

04:52.120 --> 04:53.860
Now let's go ahead and flip this guy.

04:53.890 --> 04:55.670
So he's not identical to this one.

04:55.690 --> 05:00.220
So go control T and them are going to flip horizontal.

05:00.250 --> 05:04.960
You don't want to flip it vertically because that's going to put our shadow on the top on the bottom

05:05.670 --> 05:08.990
and hit enter and got noticed over.

05:09.010 --> 05:11.550
So nudging back over with our air Keys.

05:12.100 --> 05:14.960
Let's go ahead and select our other board.

05:17.850 --> 05:19.960
Paste that in.

05:20.970 --> 05:22.350
Shrink it down.

05:34.500 --> 05:38.810
Enter the word pretty close.

05:38.840 --> 05:42.070
It's gotten trinket just a little bit more air.

05:42.500 --> 05:43.730
Great.

05:43.730 --> 05:46.700
Now let's go ahead and check for on the edge.

05:46.820 --> 05:48.440
So we want to right there.

05:48.690 --> 05:52.180
Let's turn down the opacity so we can see the other end.

05:52.730 --> 05:59.520
Will select up to that black line and then delete the opacity back up.

05:59.520 --> 06:07.520
Now we'll go and select that copy it and paste it and rotate it.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.610
Then let's flip it horizontally.

06:09.620 --> 06:16.730
So it's the other opposite direction of the previous one but that in place needs to be stretched out

06:16.730 --> 06:18.620
one pixel on the side.

06:18.680 --> 06:21.930
Now we can hit enter and this guy right here.

06:22.070 --> 06:24.250
He's overlapping right here and he shouldn't be.

06:24.260 --> 06:28.460
So we're going to grab that layer drag it down beneath that layer.

06:28.520 --> 06:30.080
Perfect.

06:30.080 --> 06:35.180
Next what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and recopy this guy because we want the shadow

06:35.180 --> 06:37.000
on both edges.

06:37.180 --> 06:41.180
Paste them in and not shrink them down.

06:43.510 --> 06:51.260
And we're going to rotate them to 45 degrees and then let's go ahead and try to fit him on there as

06:51.260 --> 06:52.940
best as possible.

06:56.940 --> 07:03.510
About that looks good we're like so perfect to enter.

07:03.570 --> 07:04.830
Great.

07:04.890 --> 07:10.410
Now let's go ahead and drag this guy underneath all of our other boards and now we can go ahead and

07:10.410 --> 07:21.200
grab the other guy will copy and paste him and we'll rotate them 45 degrees shrink him down

07:25.630 --> 07:27.780
and get them lined up.

07:34.550 --> 07:40.300
Shrink them to about there get them into position and way enter.

07:40.810 --> 07:41.920
Perfect.

07:41.920 --> 07:45.180
Now I think this guy's supposed to be going across rather than that guy.

07:45.490 --> 07:48.530
So don't go out and drag him down like so great.

07:48.590 --> 07:54.250
Now before we can grab this pattern and apply it to our Krait what we need to do is we need to do a

07:54.250 --> 07:57.820
little bit more hand painting to make this look more realistic.

07:58.000 --> 08:03.070
So for example as these two boards meet up right here there's going to be just as much shadow on this

08:03.070 --> 08:05.350
side as there already is right there.

08:05.650 --> 08:11.250
So before we do this let's go ahead and merge all of these boards together.

08:11.500 --> 08:16.620
So now those are all one layer and now we can go ahead and select the shape of that layer.

08:16.660 --> 08:19.430
So we don't paint anywhere outside of it.

08:19.430 --> 08:21.830
And then let's select this dark shadow color.

08:21.940 --> 08:26.620
Then using my brush tool I can go ahead and paint in shadow on this side.

08:26.680 --> 08:35.150
So I going to put my brush opacity at 3 percent just going to paint it just like so.

08:35.450 --> 08:38.470
This just softens it and makes it look a little bit more realistic.

08:38.750 --> 08:43.520
It also makes it look like the pieces of wood are actually budding up next to each other rather than

08:43.520 --> 08:44.770
covering each other up

08:47.700 --> 08:49.520
do the same here.

09:12.260 --> 09:12.760
Whoops.

09:12.790 --> 09:15.140
I'm noticing that we forgot to merge the sky with them.

09:15.140 --> 09:17.710
So I'm going to go ahead and stop what I'm doing.

09:17.840 --> 09:19.570
And gets that layer right there and I'm a slug.

09:19.570 --> 09:21.700
Both these layers merge them together.

09:22.360 --> 09:27.610
And then I'm going to go ahead and cut off this edge because it's over by one pixel.

09:27.680 --> 09:31.810
Now we can go ahead and re select the shape of this and go back to what we were doing.

09:59.740 --> 10:04.420
And on these corners if you can kind of give it a rounded edge to the shadow it'll make it look a lot

10:04.420 --> 10:06.070
more realistic and natural

10:14.060 --> 10:15.310
Grint.

10:15.390 --> 10:18.460
Next what we want to do is we want to select our highlight color.

10:18.510 --> 10:23.610
So grab this Gary here and we're just going to add a highlight to some of these areas.

10:23.610 --> 10:29.150
So for example add it right here because the light is going to generally be coming down from the top.

10:29.160 --> 10:31.720
We're only going to add that highlight to these top areas.

10:37.160 --> 10:41.570
So and the reason why we're adding in this highlight is because like I said we want it to look like

10:41.630 --> 10:46.350
these pieces of wood are on the same level and not one on top of the other.

10:46.370 --> 10:50.630
And so by doing this it makes it look like there's more of a cavern going through right here rather

10:50.630 --> 10:54.150
than this piece would being on top of that limb.

10:54.350 --> 10:56.780
We can also add a little bit right there.

10:57.310 --> 11:01.870
They're there a little bit.

11:01.870 --> 11:02.290
They're

11:06.150 --> 11:07.230
seem with down here

11:11.250 --> 11:13.580
and pile up here.

11:13.770 --> 11:18.420
So like I said just make sure you only add it to the areas that are going to be getting hit with white

11:18.480 --> 11:19.670
on the top of them.

11:23.730 --> 11:24.650
All right great.

11:24.720 --> 11:29.090
Now we can go ahead and add this to our crate over here.

11:29.400 --> 11:33.060
So let's go ahead and make a copy of this letter.

11:33.090 --> 11:35.190
It's always important to keep copies.

11:35.250 --> 11:38.150
That way you can always come back and redo things.

11:39.760 --> 11:43.700
And then we're going to turn Transform Tool on distort.

11:44.170 --> 11:45.940
We'll get that all lined up.

11:52.090 --> 11:53.440
Let's do this once more.

11:53.580 --> 12:05.900
Copy drag that over turn on the Transform Tool distort drag it over like so making sure everything lines

12:05.900 --> 12:07.750
up correctly.

12:07.860 --> 12:13.510
We don't get it lined up as perfectly as possible the perspective is going to look really funny.

12:13.520 --> 12:13.790
All right.

12:13.790 --> 12:14.370
Great.

12:14.540 --> 12:19.050
Let's go ahead and just go over one so we get rid of that line that was in there.

12:19.100 --> 12:25.040
Next what we want to do is we want to add that edge to these boards if you remember with our first crate

12:25.040 --> 12:28.030
we added the edge on the inside of here to give it more dimension.

12:28.060 --> 12:29.880
We're going to do the same thing here.

12:29.980 --> 12:35.450
So let's go ahead and select the shape of our layer and then we're going to add a new layer underneath

12:35.450 --> 12:36.710
that.

12:36.710 --> 12:40.850
And then let's zoom in here and let's select our shadow color that's the color we want the edge of our

12:40.850 --> 12:45.030
board to be so select that then I'll fill that in.

12:45.170 --> 12:52.200
Then using my grab move tool and the arrow keys on my keyboard I can go ahead and nudge that over.

12:52.450 --> 12:55.540
So about two times should be good.

12:56.180 --> 13:01.100
If you're working on a larger scale you might have to nudge it over a little bit more next.

13:01.130 --> 13:02.880
Let's go ahead and do the other side.

13:02.960 --> 13:10.280
So going to select that shape add a new layer underneath it and fill that in with my shadow color then

13:10.280 --> 13:12.370
I'll match that over like so.

13:13.100 --> 13:18.320
We three times and then we can go ahead and use a murky tool to select this edge.

13:18.410 --> 13:20.310
We can delete that.

13:20.310 --> 13:21.590
Perfect.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.490
So now this is looking pretty good.

13:23.760 --> 13:29.970
Next let's go ahead and add in that dark shadow along the edges of the inside of these triangles like

13:29.970 --> 13:31.360
we did with the other crate.

13:31.620 --> 13:37.830
So I'm going to go ahead and select the shape again then add a new layer underneath it and we're going

13:37.830 --> 13:46.060
to fill it in with black and then if you remember we come up to our filters come down to a blur and

13:46.060 --> 13:48.390
come to a blur.

13:49.690 --> 13:53.950
And right about there should be good we can play with this a little bit more if we want see what looks

13:53.950 --> 13:55.240
best to us.

13:56.110 --> 13:58.670
And I'm going to leave it there at about three point eight.

13:59.040 --> 14:00.300
OK.

14:00.610 --> 14:03.220
And then we want to select the shape underneath it.

14:03.220 --> 14:08.710
So the shape right there and then will invert the selection and make sure you're still on the player

14:08.710 --> 14:10.460
that has the black shadow.

14:10.750 --> 14:18.530
And then we'll hit delete and let's go ahead and turn the opacity down to about 50 percent.

14:18.590 --> 14:19.910
I think that looks good.

14:20.240 --> 14:22.580
Let's do the same for our other side.

14:22.610 --> 14:30.010
So select that shape add a new layer underneath it fill it in with black and then since we already have

14:30.010 --> 14:36.410
a setting set up for the bowler we can go ahead and hit control f or Command F if you're on a Mac that

14:36.420 --> 14:44.690
will automatically apply that then we're going to select the shape underneath invert the selection hit

14:44.690 --> 14:45.870
delete.

14:46.430 --> 14:51.170
And then we can go ahead and bring that opacity down to 50 percent.

14:51.200 --> 14:55.880
Now the last thing we want to do is we want to go ahead and add a shadow to one of the sides.

14:55.910 --> 15:00.710
So there's an actual highlight and shadow for the entire cube in hole.

15:00.710 --> 15:07.160
So what we're going to do first is we're going to select all of our players make a copy of them.

15:07.550 --> 15:10.690
Put those into a folder so we have those as backup.

15:10.910 --> 15:16.760
And I'm going to turn that off then I'm going to go ahead and grab this guy right here and we're going

15:16.760 --> 15:21.950
to drag him down to the bottom so we don't select him in our selection when we merge them are going

15:21.950 --> 15:25.840
to select all of our other players and merge them together.

15:26.330 --> 15:29.660
So now that box is one whole layer.

15:29.660 --> 15:32.140
Now let's go ahead and add a layer above that.

15:32.270 --> 15:37.550
And this time rather than selecting the shape of our crate and then Paignton in our shadow what we're

15:37.550 --> 15:42.080
going to do is we're going to create something called a clipping mask and it could be masked does a

15:42.080 --> 15:45.050
much better job of doing of what we're trying to do.

15:45.050 --> 15:50.270
So what you need to do is you need to right click on your layer and then come up to where it says create

15:50.300 --> 15:55.790
Clippy mask and you'll see that layer has moved over and there's a little arrow pointing down to the

15:55.790 --> 15:57.110
layer underneath it.

15:57.110 --> 16:01.560
That means it's a clipping mask for the layer underneath it which is the crate.

16:01.780 --> 16:06.830
And what the clippy mask does is it doesn't allow you to paint anywhere else except for inside of the

16:06.830 --> 16:10.190
shape of the layer that it's a clipping mask for.

16:10.190 --> 16:11.690
So let me show you what I mean.

16:11.930 --> 16:13.650
Let's select our shadow color.

16:13.880 --> 16:16.310
So I'm going to grab a really dark blue

16:20.050 --> 16:22.040
somewhere in here should be good.

16:22.330 --> 16:28.090
And then using my brush tool and moving over to a hard edged brush I'm going to go ahead and paint in

16:28.180 --> 16:34.240
that shadow like so and you'll see it won't paint anywhere else on this layer.

16:34.240 --> 16:37.710
Even though I started clear up here it's still not painting outside of that.

16:38.020 --> 16:42.220
The reason why this method is a lot better is because it gets all the way to the edge.

16:42.250 --> 16:47.460
If you just select your shape there'll be a few pixels on the outside edges that don't get covered.

16:47.470 --> 16:53.470
So creating a clipping mask is a much better method when you want to paint within a shape sometimes

16:53.470 --> 16:55.890
a clipping mask doesn't work for what you're trying to do.

16:55.990 --> 16:59.110
But for the most part it's going to be your best option.

16:59.110 --> 17:04.690
Another nice thing about clipping masks is you can move the image around that's on the clipping layer

17:05.080 --> 17:08.000
and it still won't really affect your layer underneath.

17:08.020 --> 17:13.600
So what I mean by that is if I turn on my grab and move tool and then nudge my blue over with my arrow

17:13.600 --> 17:18.780
key you'll see I can knock it over until I get it lined up with the edge of my crate.

17:19.090 --> 17:22.830
But it also still stays within the shape of my crate.

17:22.900 --> 17:24.650
So that's really useful too.

17:25.000 --> 17:30.710
Now this time rather than change in our blood note from normal to overlay or multiply.

17:30.910 --> 17:34.360
What we're going to do is we're just going to bring the opacity down.

17:34.840 --> 17:36.830
Now I think my color is a little bit too light.

17:36.850 --> 17:43.570
So what I'm gonna do is to come back into my colors come down to about there and I'm going to refill

17:43.570 --> 17:47.530
that in and I'm getting this weird edge here that's pixilated.

17:47.530 --> 17:50.900
So going to go ahead and select that and delete it.

17:51.050 --> 17:56.430
And now let's go ahead and bring the opacity down on this layer and see how that looks.

17:56.470 --> 17:59.270
We're going to bring it to about 75 percent.

17:59.920 --> 18:05.160
And the reason why I'm leaving the blood note on normal is because I still want to keep that blue.

18:05.230 --> 18:07.710
I don't want it to blend with my other colors and values.

18:07.750 --> 18:10.150
I want it to look really blue on the side.

18:10.150 --> 18:12.070
This is definitely a style choice.

18:12.100 --> 18:17.080
And you don't have to do that but for me I think it looks much more interesting when my shadows are

18:17.080 --> 18:20.260
really deep and rich cool colors.

18:20.260 --> 18:22.220
So I'm going to leave it like that for now.

18:22.420 --> 18:24.330
That brings us to the end of this lecture.

18:24.340 --> 18:29.260
So in this lecture you were able to put your crate together and then you also learn how to create a

18:29.260 --> 18:32.750
different type of shadow with really rich cool colors.

18:33.010 --> 18:38.020
In the next lecture we're going to go ahead and add some more detail to the script such as nailheads.

18:38.050 --> 18:43.240
And we're also going to add some cuts and scrapes on to it and then we're also going to paint in this

18:43.240 --> 18:45.170
edge to be blunted a little bit more.

18:45.190 --> 18:47.720
So it looks more hand-painted.

18:47.740 --> 18:50.460
Thanks for watching and I look forward to seeing you in the next select.
