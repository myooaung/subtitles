00:01.230 --> 00:05.240
All right let's go ahead and add in the reflection on our bottle.

00:05.460 --> 00:07.290
So in a reference from Rainman.

00:07.320 --> 00:12.070
You see there's this nice white reflection that goes almost all the way around the bottle.

00:12.090 --> 00:14.260
This is what we're going to create right now.

00:14.580 --> 00:19.500
So first off what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and add a new layer above this then I'm going

00:19.500 --> 00:21.560
to select the shape of my bottle.

00:21.750 --> 00:28.450
So hold control or command and click my thumbnail on my lÃ©a next I'm going to go ahead and grab a white

00:31.020 --> 00:36.420
and then switch over to my brush tool and I want to make sure I'm on a soft edged brush to start off

00:36.420 --> 00:42.450
with next I'm going to go ahead and start painting around these edges and I want to make sure that my

00:42.450 --> 00:44.260
brush opacity is set to two.

00:44.280 --> 00:53.960
So we can slowly layer this up.

00:54.140 --> 00:59.600
Also it's important to notice that every single spot does not have a highlight around it and some areas

00:59.630 --> 01:01.370
are fatter and thicker than others.

01:01.370 --> 01:07.510
So for example on the round edge of our bottle right here you'll see that it's a lot fatter.

01:07.550 --> 01:10.340
And then on this edge it's a lot thinner on that side.

01:10.340 --> 01:14.640
It's a lot fatter and a lot of this just has to do with lightsource.

01:14.660 --> 01:19.550
Now don't worry too much about the light source just any time you're creating a glass object in your

01:19.550 --> 01:20.180
game.

01:20.180 --> 01:25.910
Go ahead and add a highlighted edge around the edge of it an area that wouldn't be getting much reflection

01:25.940 --> 01:27.590
or highlight don't highlight it.

01:27.590 --> 01:32.730
Like for example down here at the bottom at the base there's not really going to be much highlight there.

01:32.730 --> 01:33.020
All right.

01:33.050 --> 01:34.300
Let's go ahead and continue.

01:34.370 --> 01:37.210
So just kind of copping what we're seeing here.

01:37.250 --> 01:44.850
We're going to go ahead and just add that highlight in and the top part of our bottle is basically completely

01:44.850 --> 01:49.580
highlighted some highlighted there.

01:53.220 --> 01:54.300
Come around this edge

01:58.560 --> 02:03.390
then we have a little bit of highlights here and a little bit of highlight right there.

02:03.520 --> 02:05.590
So now we have the base for a highlight.

02:05.650 --> 02:08.740
Let's go ahead and really detail this in and fill it in.

02:08.740 --> 02:13.540
So first I'm to shrink my breast size down because there's going to be some areas like down here at

02:13.540 --> 02:19.690
the bottom where I'm going to want to make it really small so go ahead and keep layering this until

02:19.690 --> 02:24.580
we get it to the brightness that we want it because basically on these edges it's going to be completely

02:24.580 --> 02:25.000
white

02:33.650 --> 02:37.670
I'm going to come down around the bottom like so it doesn't have to be completely perfect.

02:37.670 --> 02:39.470
We can always come back any real stuff

03:03.290 --> 03:09.400
in over here we have this pretty fat thick highlight So we'll add that in and it might take a couple

03:09.400 --> 03:12.100
of layers.

03:12.260 --> 03:19.490
Now just like our wood texture this is going to be a process of layering and erasing and using our color

03:19.490 --> 03:21.660
picker to find mid-tone colors.

03:45.630 --> 03:50.940
And you'll notice that every time I add a new layer on top of the other one it gets brighter because

03:51.330 --> 03:52.740
that white is being layered.

03:52.740 --> 03:57.640
So it's a little transparent right now but as we layer it it becomes more and more opaque.

03:57.930 --> 04:02.820
And if we layer it enough eventually it's going to be completely opaque which just means it's not going

04:02.820 --> 04:04.830
to be see through at all.

04:46.110 --> 04:51.460
So remember that as we get down here we don't want it to be as bright but sometimes we might paint it

04:51.460 --> 04:55.740
in a little bit too bright so we can always come back in with our eraser like this.

04:55.750 --> 05:01.660
So I just switched over to my raised tool and I'm going to bring the opacity of my eraser down to 1

05:01.660 --> 05:04.160
percent by hitting the number one on my keyboard.

05:04.320 --> 05:10.230
And we can go ahead and slowly erase this away to kind of faded out.

05:28.170 --> 05:34.050
Now I want to create a shadow between these two highlights because this part of the bottle is sitting

05:34.050 --> 05:36.130
on top of the stand.

05:36.150 --> 05:39.440
And so I want to have a little bit of a distinction between them.

05:39.480 --> 05:45.500
So I want to switch over to my race to bring my brush size down and then I can kind of a race that way.

05:45.520 --> 05:46.050
Slowly

05:49.980 --> 05:58.220
perfect switch back over to my brush tool and I'm going to continue adding the highlight along the edge.

05:58.220 --> 06:04.040
Another reason why I like to add it in layers is because it can be pretty difficult to just paint a

06:04.040 --> 06:07.080
perfect curved line around the edge.

06:07.130 --> 06:12.440
And so I painted it in layers you can slowly build it up and erase away until you get that perfect curve

06:12.440 --> 06:13.450
in there.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.860
So even if you're using a mouse it makes it a lot easier to get that curve because you can always come

06:18.860 --> 07:00.520
back and take little bits away at a time and add little bits at a time.

07:02.130 --> 07:06.900
So once you get to about this point you're going to want to start really filling in these edges so they

07:06.900 --> 07:12.710
become really opaque because once we fill our bottle with our liquid we don't want to see the liquid

07:12.720 --> 07:14.500
through the white part of the bottle.

07:14.520 --> 07:17.140
We want that to be a complete solid white.

07:17.280 --> 07:19.150
So now we really need to start filling that in.

07:19.170 --> 07:24.030
I'm going to bring my brush opacity up to 50 percent by hitting the number five on my keyboard.

07:24.410 --> 07:27.330
And now I can really fill that in.

07:27.480 --> 07:32.060
And we just want this on the ED or the center of the bottle over here.

07:32.060 --> 07:35.360
We want it to start blending in and fading into transparent

07:54.240 --> 07:55.270
great next.

07:55.290 --> 07:58.960
Let's go ahead and add in some of these little highlights that you see on the bottle.

07:58.960 --> 08:07.850
So like down here we're going to go ahead and start to paint this guy in so now I might bring my brush

08:07.850 --> 08:14.460
and opacity down to 1 percent because we want to really soften this and blend it into the transparency.

08:16.920 --> 08:19.800
What is basically just a curved little lips

08:22.940 --> 08:29.210
just like so and then when my brush is at one percent opacity we can go ahead and kind of blending in.

08:30.670 --> 08:44.940
On these edges into our transparent area.

08:45.560 --> 08:48.840
And if you do mess up you can always go ahead and undo that move.

08:48.840 --> 08:51.540
You can and do as many moves as you want.

09:08.160 --> 09:13.680
But now these edges that are supposed to be blended in they look a little bit too rough for me and not

09:13.680 --> 09:14.540
smooth enough.

09:14.580 --> 09:19.290
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and take my eraser and then I'm going to make sure

09:19.320 --> 09:21.750
I'm on a soft edged brush.

09:21.750 --> 09:24.410
I'll bring up my size them.

09:24.480 --> 09:30.480
Then I'm going to bring my opacity down to 20 percent and then I'm going to go ahead and slowly start

09:30.480 --> 09:37.410
erasing into this and that's going to help it blend into the transparency because transparency is not

09:37.410 --> 09:39.360
an actual color that you can blend with.

09:39.390 --> 09:44.520
You can't really take the mid color and then start blending it because if you remember we're not going

09:44.520 --> 09:47.570
to have this dark gray shape back here when we're done.

09:47.580 --> 09:51.510
That's going to be gone so if we turn that off you'll see we'll be left with this.

09:51.570 --> 10:27.010
So we want to make sure that we're blending into transparency and not blending into a color.

10:27.020 --> 10:27.540
All right.

10:27.620 --> 10:28.240
Great.

10:28.310 --> 10:32.610
Next to what we want to do is we want to add this really big highlight right here.

10:32.750 --> 10:36.350
Now this highlight is pretty solid and has pretty hard edges.

10:36.350 --> 10:41.370
So the way we're going to carry it is we're going to add a new layer above this layer and then using

10:41.380 --> 10:46.850
my circular marquee tool I'm going to go ahead and create a perfect circle like so.

10:46.970 --> 10:48.990
And then I'm going to fill that in with white.

10:49.010 --> 10:52.940
So switching over to my fill tool I'll fill that in.

10:52.940 --> 10:58.260
Next I'm going to go ahead and use my Transform Tool and drag it over here into place then I'm going

10:58.310 --> 11:02.330
I right click and use my work tool so I'll click that.

11:02.420 --> 11:07.180
And now what I can do is I can grab this grid and I can work this into whatever shape I want.

11:07.220 --> 11:10.270
So I'm going to try to replicate this little shape right there on the bottle

11:32.250 --> 11:32.840
great.

11:32.850 --> 11:38.220
Now let's go ahead and hit enter then we're going to turn the Transform Tool on once again and then

11:38.240 --> 11:41.840
you'll see that grid system is gone and it's solidified that shape.

11:42.060 --> 11:45.990
So let's go ahead and rotate this a little bit so it fits onto a bottle better.

11:46.110 --> 11:48.900
Now we're going to shrink it down.

11:49.080 --> 11:54.390
Hold down shift to keep the apportions and then I'm going to work this again.

11:54.390 --> 11:56.530
So when I right click and come to work.

11:56.790 --> 12:01.140
And the reason for this is that now that I have in position I want to make sure that it lines up with

12:01.140 --> 12:02.690
the curve of our ball.

12:02.730 --> 12:07.020
So as this battle comes around it's going to have a different curve in each area.

12:07.170 --> 12:11.030
So if we're looking at the curve right here in the center it's just going to be a straight line.

12:11.130 --> 12:15.820
If we're looking at it between the center and this curve it's going to be somewhere in the middle.

12:16.080 --> 12:21.090
So if you can imagine a pumpkin you see this with a pumpkin the middle line is straight.

12:21.090 --> 12:27.160
And the ones further away are more curved and the ones on the very edge are the most curved lines.

12:27.460 --> 12:31.190
And so we want to make this look like it's actually reflected onto our ball.

12:31.380 --> 12:37.140
So we're just going to try to mimic the curve of our bottle as best as possible.

12:45.190 --> 12:46.600
Since Mike so should be good.

12:46.620 --> 12:48.660
Go ahead and hit enter.

12:48.720 --> 12:49.280
Perfect.

12:49.290 --> 12:55.250
I'm going to shrink it down just a little bit more.

12:55.620 --> 12:57.890
That brings us to the end of this lecture.

12:57.900 --> 13:03.630
So in this lecture you learn how to create the highlights and the reflections on your bottle in the

13:03.630 --> 13:04.380
next lecture.

13:04.380 --> 13:08.880
We're going to go ahead and fill the bottle with some of this golden contents.

13:08.880 --> 13:11.860
Thanks for watching and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.
