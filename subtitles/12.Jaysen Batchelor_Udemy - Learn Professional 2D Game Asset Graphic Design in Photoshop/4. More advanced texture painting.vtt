00:00.890 --> 00:06.620
In this lecture we're going to go ahead and create some more advanced texture for it correct.

00:06.690 --> 00:11.850
Now before we move forward with this let's go ahead and save this out so we don't lose it.

00:11.850 --> 00:17.050
So come to save as and I'm just going to save now as wooden crate

00:20.590 --> 00:20.990
next.

00:21.010 --> 00:25.990
I'm going to go ahead and take all of my wooden crate layers that have Textron them and I'm going to

00:26.050 --> 00:31.160
put them into their own folder that I'm going to turn that folder off and drag it to the bottom.

00:31.240 --> 00:33.200
That way we don't have to worry about that right now.

00:33.220 --> 00:36.440
We creating our second texture next.

00:36.460 --> 00:41.710
Let's go ahead and jump back into our document that has our two pieces of wood on it and we're going

00:41.710 --> 00:43.000
to save these out also.

00:43.030 --> 00:48.030
So we'll come up to File Save As I don't recall this would texture

00:51.350 --> 00:56.830
and then I'm going to add the number one at the end because we're going to create a second wooden texture.

00:56.960 --> 00:58.190
So let's hit enter.

00:58.190 --> 00:59.390
Save that.

00:59.810 --> 01:00.720
OK.

01:01.040 --> 01:02.420
Perfect.

01:02.420 --> 01:07.390
Now we can go ahead and select both these and delete them now.

01:07.430 --> 01:12.590
Last time we kind of had the problem that our pieces of wood weren't long enough to stretch the span

01:13.130 --> 01:14.960
of our pattern.

01:15.080 --> 01:20.250
So we want to make sure this time we create a little bit skinnier pieces of wood.

01:20.300 --> 01:22.450
So maybe something like that.

01:22.640 --> 01:27.440
And what we're going to do is we're going to fill us in with sort of a grayish orange color.

01:27.450 --> 01:32.630
So when it come down to our oranges some are about there should be good and we want to come in somewhere

01:32.630 --> 01:35.570
around here OK.

01:36.030 --> 01:38.960
Let's go ahead and fill that in now.

01:38.990 --> 01:41.210
This is our base color from here.

01:41.210 --> 01:46.460
We're going to build on top of this starting with the darker highlights and moving up all the way to

01:46.460 --> 01:48.050
the brightest highlight.

01:48.050 --> 01:53.780
So now I'm going to go ahead and select a more orange color and I'm going to bring up the lightness

01:53.780 --> 01:58.550
a little bit to about there maybe a little bit more towards the saturated side.

01:58.770 --> 01:59.830
OK.

02:00.170 --> 02:05.360
Now we want to do is we want to start painting out the basic shapes and forms that are going to be in

02:05.360 --> 02:06.610
our woodgrain now.

02:06.770 --> 02:11.690
Last time it was a lot more simple to paint in the wood grain because all we had to do was draw the

02:11.690 --> 02:17.700
lines and then create a highlight side to that and then just turn down the opacity on those.

02:17.750 --> 02:22.040
This time it's going to be more complicated and you're going to have to have a little bit more understanding

02:22.040 --> 02:23.280
about light and shadow.

02:23.450 --> 02:29.780
So if you're having a hard time with this part of the course go ahead and go back to the basics of drawing

02:30.020 --> 02:34.780
and values and that's going to help you a lot with this section of the course.

02:34.910 --> 02:40.260
So let's go ahead and start painting in those base shapes for the form of our wood grain.

02:40.270 --> 02:43.160
Now again go ahead and do a google search for woodgrain.

02:43.160 --> 02:47.960
If you're having a hard time remembering what woodgrain looks like last time you were just looking for

02:47.960 --> 02:49.500
the pattern this time.

02:49.520 --> 02:52.850
You actually want to look for the form of woodgrain.

02:52.910 --> 02:57.180
Now you don't have to make your woodgrain look exactly the way it looks in real life.

02:57.210 --> 03:01.730
You can go ahead and use a little bit of your imagination but for the most part you want it to be based

03:01.730 --> 03:08.900
off of real life woodgrain everything that looks really nice and good in the art world usually is based

03:08.900 --> 03:12.580
off of the real world.

03:14.730 --> 03:19.530
So you can see here I'm just creating really simple shapes for my woodgrain.

03:20.510 --> 03:21.200
So

03:32.020 --> 03:32.940
awesome.

03:32.980 --> 03:38.590
Next we're going to go ahead and create a made of ground color between these two colors and we're going

03:38.590 --> 03:44.170
to do that by bringing our brush size down to 5 percent by hitting the number five on our keyboard.

03:44.170 --> 03:49.420
And now we can go ahead and paint on the edge like so and then you'll see if we zoom in there you can

03:49.420 --> 03:52.330
see we get this color that's in between those two colors.

03:52.330 --> 03:57.430
Let's go ahead and select that with our eyedropper and switching back over to our brush tool and bring

03:57.430 --> 04:00.110
in our brush capacity back up to 100 percent.

04:00.340 --> 04:07.000
That's going to allow us to paint with that color but without being transparent like so we can also

04:07.000 --> 04:08.560
bring down a brush size.

04:08.560 --> 04:12.280
Now I want to switch my brush over to more of a print paint brush.

04:12.310 --> 04:14.490
Right now I'm on as hard edged brush.

04:14.530 --> 04:19.270
I want to switch over to this guy right here and that's just going to allow me to get more organic and

04:19.270 --> 04:23.230
wispy type of brush strokes.

04:23.230 --> 04:29.440
So now we're just going to kind of randomly paint the edges of these in just a blended in a little bit

04:29.440 --> 04:31.260
more.

04:31.360 --> 04:36.960
Now this is definitely a process the way we're going to be painting this texture and it can take a while

04:37.360 --> 04:42.250
but just know that things that look really good usually take a good amount of time to create

05:40.480 --> 05:41.530
perfect.

05:41.530 --> 05:41.900
All right.

05:41.920 --> 05:46.810
So now we're kind of getting to our basic setup next what we want to do is we want to add some more

05:46.810 --> 05:47.910
texture in there.

05:48.250 --> 05:53.380
So I'm going to go ahead and select this lighter color and then I'm going to find an even lighter version

05:53.380 --> 05:54.510
of that.

05:54.910 --> 06:00.240
Somewhere out there and maybe more towards the orange side some are about there should be good.

06:00.490 --> 06:04.180
And using my brush I can go ahead and start painting in more texture.

06:04.450 --> 06:08.590
So the what I'm going to do is I'm going to kind of create a pattern texture

06:11.330 --> 06:20.210
that kind of looks like football shapes or ice shapes they're kind of like a Elliptic ellipses but the

06:20.300 --> 06:22.410
edges of them are pinched.

06:22.730 --> 06:27.530
So if you ever look at wood that's been carved you'll see the same pattern in it.

06:27.560 --> 06:29.870
Now this is a little bit too light for me.

06:29.930 --> 06:34.940
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to bring down my brush opacity to 30 percent by hitting the number

06:34.940 --> 06:36.510
three on my keyboard.

06:36.740 --> 06:41.270
And now I can go ahead and paint and it's a lot lighter and if I want it to be darker I can go ahead

06:41.300 --> 06:47.810
and paint on top of that again and just keep layering that on the whole process of this type of painting

06:47.840 --> 06:49.330
is all about layering.

06:49.340 --> 06:53.810
We're just going to keep layering and layering and layering until we get the look that we want.

07:17.870 --> 07:22.520
Now in this case honestly I'm not really following any rules about where the light source is coming

07:22.520 --> 07:22.960
from.

07:22.970 --> 07:28.640
It's kind of coming from everywhere all around it because once we add this to our crate drawing We're

07:28.640 --> 07:31.160
going to be flipping these back and forth up and down.

07:31.340 --> 07:35.470
And so if they have a light source it's going to make it look incorrect.

07:35.570 --> 07:42.290
When we flipped upside down so I'm trying to keep it very neutral in the way that the light is hitting

07:42.290 --> 07:44.530
it.

07:44.930 --> 07:49.460
So you'll see down here there's highlight on that side and then we're also going to add highlight on

07:49.460 --> 07:52.540
the other side to.

07:52.600 --> 07:56.240
So just try to keep it as neutral as possible.

09:11.470 --> 09:12.290
Great.

09:12.370 --> 09:17.030
So now we have the first layer of real highlight I guess you could say.

09:17.530 --> 09:20.940
And next to it we're going to do is we're going to add a little bit more color into that.

09:21.070 --> 09:25.560
So we're going to come over to our color picker and we're going to grab pretty saturated Brown.

09:25.600 --> 09:27.640
We want it to be on the darker side.

09:27.700 --> 09:29.140
So somewhere around there.

09:29.250 --> 09:30.320
OK.

09:30.550 --> 09:36.080
And now we're going to start adding some of that into these cracks and crevices.

09:36.160 --> 09:38.540
This is just to make it look a little bit more interesting.

09:38.710 --> 09:44.440
Sometimes you might find that when you start adding colors and different hues and saturations to your

09:44.530 --> 09:47.440
artwork it doesn't really work out and that's OK.

09:47.650 --> 09:49.750
All you have to do is undo it.

09:49.750 --> 09:53.710
Honestly we should probably be doing this on a separate layer but I'm not really worried about it right

09:53.710 --> 09:54.310
now.

09:54.520 --> 09:59.140
But if you're worried about something not looking good do it on a separate layer and then you can always

09:59.140 --> 10:01.970
just delete that layer.

10:41.190 --> 10:41.800
Great.

10:41.930 --> 10:44.520
Now I want to go ahead and find an even lighter highlight color.

10:44.540 --> 10:52.270
So select this color down here and then come up to about there should be good come up more towards the

10:52.270 --> 10:54.700
yellows and these are my brush tool.

10:54.730 --> 10:58.260
Go ahead and start painting even brighter highlights.

11:26.520 --> 11:32.260
Now I'm going to bring my brush opacity down to 20 percent now by hitting the number two on the keyboard.

11:32.650 --> 11:40.970
Because at this point I want it to be pretty sensitive as to how much highlight it's adding to my artwork.

12:16.520 --> 12:17.530
Great.

12:17.630 --> 12:20.000
Next one I want to do is I want to brighten this a little bit.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.480
It's looking a little bit too dark for me and it's not looking enough like wood.

12:23.720 --> 12:28.380
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to select this mid color right there and use my brush.

12:28.400 --> 12:32.080
I'm just going to start filling in large areas with that color.

12:32.330 --> 12:38.150
Like I said this is all a process and you just have to work back and forth back and forth and find what

12:38.150 --> 12:40.210
works for you and what you like.

12:53.590 --> 12:59.570
Then when I grab another highlight color but an even wider one to start filling in more areas.

13:01.890 --> 13:02.340
So

13:10.630 --> 13:11.260
great.

13:11.460 --> 13:13.730
Let's go ahead and add a little bit more highlights to this.

13:13.730 --> 13:18.580
I'm going to select my brightest highlight color and then I'm going to bring it up even more.

13:18.760 --> 13:22.940
I'm going to come way more towards the yellows and saturate that a little bit more.

13:22.940 --> 13:26.680
Also I want to go ahead and start painting in new highlights.

13:28.440 --> 13:33.630
Is

14:10.910 --> 14:16.400
Now if you're feeling a little bit confused about what's going on here just remember that when you're

14:16.400 --> 14:21.380
creating artwork like this you're just building up on the highlights so you generally start with shadow

14:21.950 --> 14:26.210
and then you add a little bit lighter of a highlight on top of that and then a lighter highlight and

14:26.210 --> 14:28.580
a lighter highlight and you keep building and building.

14:28.790 --> 14:33.500
And then sometimes you have to change things like I did when I grabbed my mid color and I painted on

14:33.500 --> 14:38.340
top of some of the stuff so I can neutralize it all out and start from the beginning.

14:38.390 --> 14:44.330
But basically that's what's going to be doing is building up highlights and also make a note that when

14:44.330 --> 14:50.480
you have a highlight that slowly blends into a darker color and it's going to give it sort of a look

14:50.780 --> 14:54.090
as though are surfaces doing this.

14:54.200 --> 14:59.550
If we're looking at your surface from the side it's going to look like it's doing something like that.

14:59.600 --> 15:05.480
If you have a nice soft blend into it so such as this area right there it's kind of like looking like

15:05.480 --> 15:06.350
it's doing that.

15:06.500 --> 15:13.700
If you have a really hard edged like this it's going to look like it's doing this.

15:13.750 --> 15:16.740
So just keep that in mind while you're creating your artwork.

15:47.130 --> 15:52.210
You'll notice that I'm using my eyedropper tool to select the colors which are the colors that are being

15:52.230 --> 15:57.870
mixed between two colors and I'll select those colors and then I'll start painting with that to help

15:57.960 --> 16:00.180
blend two colors together.

16:05.200 --> 16:09.870
And then I'm just going to try some glue in there and add a little bit of blue gray just to see how

16:09.870 --> 16:10.740
that looks.

16:10.980 --> 16:14.690
And it turns out that I like it pretty well.

16:14.770 --> 16:16.830
Remember to just experiment with things.

16:16.830 --> 16:33.810
Experiment with colors the values of things do a lot of experimenting.

16:33.990 --> 16:36.760
All right that brings us to the end of this lecture.

16:36.960 --> 16:42.960
So in this lecture we got the basic paint set up for our wood textured in the next lecture.

16:42.960 --> 16:47.070
We're going to go ahead and take this wood plank and painted a little bit more to look a little bit

16:47.070 --> 16:47.740
better.

16:48.030 --> 16:53.340
And then we're going to make a copy of it move it over and sort of reshape the painting landscape on

16:53.340 --> 16:56.580
it to make it look like a different piece of wood.

16:56.580 --> 16:59.340
Thanks for watching and I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.
