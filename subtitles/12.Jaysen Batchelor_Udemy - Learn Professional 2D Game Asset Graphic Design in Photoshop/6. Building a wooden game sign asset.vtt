00:00.530 --> 00:04.920
In this lecture we're going to go ahead and create this sign right here.

00:04.920 --> 00:06.890
So let's go ahead and get started.

00:07.170 --> 00:14.380
So the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to create a new document my document is 1920 by 10 80 pixels.

00:14.400 --> 00:19.350
The reason why it's so large is just like with the potion we may want it to fill up the entire screen.

00:19.590 --> 00:22.700
But if we don't that's OK we can always shrink it down.

00:22.920 --> 00:28.320
So the first thing I want to do is I'm going to add a new layer and I'm going to grab my brush tool

00:29.070 --> 00:36.410
and switch it over to my paintbrush and then select a blue color to paint with.

00:36.510 --> 00:42.210
Generally I just like to paint the color blue because that's kind of the color that animators use to

00:42.210 --> 00:43.470
draw their rough sketches.

00:43.470 --> 00:46.260
If you look at old Disney sketches that's what they used a lot.

00:46.260 --> 00:48.650
So I just like to draw that.

00:48.680 --> 00:50.390
Now let's go ahead and draw this.

00:50.400 --> 00:52.650
So it's going to be a solid plank of wood

00:58.810 --> 01:03.550
and then we can just hold down shift and click on the other side of our screen to get to the other side.

01:03.750 --> 01:04.770
That was not very straight.

01:04.830 --> 01:06.040
Try that again.

01:06.480 --> 01:07.180
Perfect.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.950
Something like that should work next.

01:18.970 --> 01:25.450
Let's go ahead and grab our Lasso tool and we want to make sure we're on the Polygonum Lasso tool and

01:25.450 --> 01:29.520
then we're going to go ahead and select the shape out like so

01:34.450 --> 01:35.860
we're going to go all the way around

01:39.680 --> 01:42.990
and connect it if we're going to add a new layer.

01:43.190 --> 01:45.910
And then we're going to fill that in with a brown.

01:46.270 --> 01:52.460
Come into my browns someone there should do let's fill that in.

01:52.460 --> 01:55.440
Now we can go ahead and turn that background sketch off.

01:55.640 --> 02:00.460
Next what we're going to do is we're going to make a copy of the Slayers will have control J.

02:00.700 --> 02:02.640
I'm going to drag that layer underneath.

02:02.930 --> 02:06.990
Then what we want to do is we want to nudge that layer down just a little bit.

02:07.490 --> 02:12.340
So we can't really see it very well right now because both our layers are the same color.

02:12.590 --> 02:18.120
But now we're going to hit control you or command you on a Mac and that will bring up your hue and saturations

02:18.140 --> 02:20.900
panel and we just want to darken that just a little bit.

02:20.900 --> 02:22.320
So too about there.

02:22.520 --> 02:24.490
And you can bring up the saturation too.

02:24.530 --> 02:29.230
As things get darker they tend to become a little bit more saturated sometimes.

02:29.520 --> 02:30.350
OK.

02:30.560 --> 02:33.150
And then we're going to nudge that down just a little bit further.

02:33.170 --> 02:39.440
So about there next we're going to go ahead and go in there then we're going to select this darker color

02:39.440 --> 02:47.460
here and we're going to paint in these edges like so so that way it becomes one solid piece.

03:00.430 --> 03:01.290
Great.

03:01.510 --> 03:02.980
See how that looks from far away.

03:03.250 --> 03:04.850
Perfect next.

03:04.870 --> 03:07.280
Let's go ahead and add in some of that wood texture.

03:07.420 --> 03:12.240
So I'm going to come up to my top layer which is this layer right here and I'm going to add a new layer.

03:12.250 --> 03:14.940
But we want to make this layer into a clipping mask.

03:14.950 --> 03:17.750
So I get it right click it and come to create clipping mask.

03:17.920 --> 03:23.660
And now we can paint that texture within this wood and it's not going to go outside of the shape.

03:23.660 --> 03:28.030
Now let's select our color and we're going to make a little bit lighter version of that.

03:28.030 --> 03:33.760
So about there not too much lighter and a little bit more towards the yellow than using my brush tool.

03:33.760 --> 03:40.810
I'm going to go ahead and paint in some textured now I'm going to zoom out really far because the smaller

03:40.810 --> 03:45.250
you paint the easier it's going to be to get really nice strokes in there.

03:45.250 --> 03:49.900
So basically what we're going to do is we're just going to paint some lines like so maybe some loops

03:49.900 --> 03:53.590
also something like that.

03:53.920 --> 03:58.280
And that's just going to start giving it a very interesting look to grain.

04:06.260 --> 04:06.690
Great.

04:06.710 --> 04:08.800
So that's the top layer of grain.

04:08.960 --> 04:14.090
Let's add a new layer underneath this and that will automatically be turned into a clipping layer mask

04:14.090 --> 04:17.200
when we add underneath another clipping layer mask.

04:17.360 --> 04:22.160
And now we're going to grab a little bit darker color so we're going to select our main color then we're

04:22.160 --> 04:27.660
going to bring that down just a little bit and we can bring it a little more towards the red and using

04:27.660 --> 04:28.260
a brush tool.

04:28.260 --> 04:32.640
We're going to bring my brush size up a little bit more this time and we can go ahead and start painting

04:32.640 --> 04:38.240
in some other woodgrain maybe something like so

04:41.340 --> 04:45.580
and for the most part we generally want to stick with the same shapes.

04:51.620 --> 04:52.860
Great.

04:52.950 --> 04:55.740
Now these might be a little bit too dark.

04:55.910 --> 05:02.410
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to turn down the opacity on it to about 75 percent.

05:02.540 --> 05:05.730
Same with my highlight one.

05:05.990 --> 05:09.880
Next I'm going to add another layer of woodgrain just to make this look even more interesting.

05:09.890 --> 05:15.060
So I'm going to add it underneath my clipping layer mask and then I can drag that up to the top.

05:15.200 --> 05:18.680
That way it automatically creates it into a clipping by a mask.

05:18.680 --> 05:22.300
And I don't actually have to right click it and turn into a clipping layer mask.

05:22.520 --> 05:27.410
So I'm to select or highlight color right here then I'm going to come a little bit more towards the

05:27.410 --> 05:32.350
yellow side but I'm not really going to change the brightness on it.

05:32.660 --> 05:37.280
And I'll bring my purse I was down and then I'm going to add a little bit more texture and in here we

05:37.280 --> 05:39.500
can get pretty wild with this.

05:39.500 --> 05:44.330
Remember this is texture and it's also going to be covered by text and design so don't worry if it doesn't

05:44.330 --> 05:50.110
look perfect just go wild with it and try different things.

05:59.710 --> 06:02.020
Now this is looking a little bit too yellow for me.

06:02.020 --> 06:07.290
So what I'm going to do is bring up my human saturation panel and I'm going to change the hue on it.

06:07.540 --> 06:12.190
So if I drag it more towards the left it's going to become more brown into the purples.

06:12.190 --> 06:17.870
So I want it to be a little less yellow and a little more Browns about there should be good.

06:17.980 --> 06:18.660
Great.

06:18.970 --> 06:21.050
So now we got this really cool texture.

06:21.070 --> 06:23.440
Now this area right here is looking a little empty.

06:23.440 --> 06:28.380
So going to go ahead and select this color here paint a little bit more texture in there.

06:29.970 --> 06:32.660
It's like so perfect.

06:32.660 --> 06:38.340
Next let's add some of this wood green texture on to the edge of our board.

06:38.420 --> 06:43.460
So I'm going to select one color at a time starting with my bottom color I'll select that dark color

06:44.090 --> 06:48.660
and then coming down to my back layer I'm going to add a new layer above that.

06:48.740 --> 06:51.090
Right click it and turn it into a clipping layer mask.

06:51.230 --> 06:56.640
So now everything I paint on this layer is going to be within the bounds of my under shape.

06:56.660 --> 07:01.910
Next I'm going to go ahead and grab my collar and I'm going to darken it quite a bit somewhere about

07:01.910 --> 07:04.390
there should be good maybe just a little bit darker.

07:04.610 --> 07:08.880
And the reason why I'm Darchinyan it is because the woodgrain on the edge of a board where the shadow

07:08.880 --> 07:11.730
is is going to be a little bit darker.

07:11.780 --> 07:14.310
So let's go ahead and paint that in.

07:14.510 --> 07:17.110
So I have some there there.

07:17.140 --> 07:18.910
It's a little bit right there.

07:19.430 --> 07:24.040
And we might have some going all the way along here so we can go ahead and paint that in by hand and

07:24.050 --> 07:30.420
maybe a little piece there comes straight down right there and we have some right there also next.

07:30.440 --> 07:32.590
Let's go ahead and select our next color.

07:32.690 --> 07:37.560
So our next highlight color is going to be this winery here and we'll darken that just a little bit.

07:37.580 --> 07:39.390
So we'll come down to about there.

07:39.920 --> 07:41.200
And then we can start painting that.

07:41.210 --> 07:44.030
So there's a piece right there.

07:44.440 --> 07:48.860
There big piece right here.

07:49.350 --> 07:51.690
This piece there.

07:51.910 --> 07:54.780
And there's one not there.

07:55.210 --> 07:56.930
I think there's a little bit up here.

07:57.050 --> 08:01.730
Then let's select our last highlight color which is this more yellow one and it will darken a little

08:01.730 --> 08:02.410
bit.

08:02.440 --> 08:06.930
It's come down to that there and then we'll go ahead and follow that one is.

08:07.010 --> 08:14.600
Add one there is a little bit over here some there and we might add a little bit here just to make a

08:14.600 --> 08:18.570
little interesting one there.

08:18.950 --> 08:20.440
And that's about it.

08:20.450 --> 08:21.920
Perfect.

08:21.950 --> 08:24.920
Now this background part of the board isn't looking dark enough for me.

08:24.920 --> 08:28.060
So what I'm going to do is I'm gonna merge these two layers together.

08:28.490 --> 08:30.570
Now that's all one layer back there.

08:30.860 --> 08:36.320
And then I'm going to bring it my human saturation panel and drag down the darkness just a little bit

08:36.320 --> 08:36.770
more.

08:36.890 --> 08:38.230
So maybe about there.

08:38.390 --> 08:43.820
OK next what don't want to do is I want to merge all these layers together so they're one.

08:43.870 --> 08:45.660
So now that's all one layer.

08:46.030 --> 08:48.790
And now going to start hand-painted in some detail.

08:48.830 --> 08:53.150
So if we zoom in here we want this edge to have a little bit of a highlight as it curves around.

08:53.180 --> 08:57.440
There might be a light source coming from over here and it's hitting that tiny little curved surface

08:57.530 --> 09:00.750
and it's going to be brighter than both the sides put together.

09:00.980 --> 09:06.590
So I'm going to go ahead and first blend these together so I'll select this color here and bring them

09:06.590 --> 09:06.850
down.

09:06.850 --> 09:13.670
My brush is going to go ahead and paint at 50 percent opacity like so and then I can select that mid

09:13.680 --> 09:23.100
color and paint that in at 100 percent opacity great and we're going to do this all over.

09:23.130 --> 09:35.610
So I go ahead and select this color painted at 50 percent opacity and select that color.

09:35.800 --> 09:40.950
We can do this all the way around the edges just to make it look a little bit more interesting.

10:14.590 --> 10:17.410
Next let's go ahead and Abda highlight on all these corners.

10:17.410 --> 10:21.280
So I'm going to go ahead and select a really like color.

10:21.280 --> 10:22.720
So somewhere around there.

10:22.850 --> 10:29.580
Then using my brush and putting it at 3 percent opacity I'm going to go ahead and paint that in like

10:29.590 --> 10:34.640
so we want to give it a little bit of texture since it's wood.

10:35.110 --> 10:38.230
So it might not just be one solid highlight line.

10:42.520 --> 10:44.580
And let's add one down here also

10:57.950 --> 10:59.460
and also add it to this side

11:10.230 --> 11:13.500
and lastly we'll add it to this top area.

11:22.930 --> 11:26.130
Zoom out and see it looks great.

11:26.210 --> 11:31.940
Now lastly let's go ahead and add a couple of little divots cutting into the sides of our board.

11:31.990 --> 11:36.250
So the way we're going to do that is by grabbing our lasso tool and then we're just going to go ahead

11:36.280 --> 11:42.220
and cut out a section like so much is going to do that anywhere.

11:42.250 --> 11:52.830
We want to have sort of a crack or a divot in our board and then maybe we'll add one more right here.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.080
Perfect next.

11:59.120 --> 12:02.980
Let's go ahead and zoom in there and we're going to start hand painting this divot in.

12:03.140 --> 12:08.000
So the way we'll do that is by selecting this color right here and then going to grab just a little

12:08.000 --> 12:11.330
bit darker version of it and using a brush tool.

12:11.360 --> 12:14.060
We're going to hand paint a division.

12:14.420 --> 12:21.200
Make sure your brushes at 0 percent opacity.

12:21.360 --> 12:24.020
So we painted that side in next.

12:24.030 --> 12:29.250
Let's go ahead and re select our color and then we're going to grab a little bit brighter version of

12:29.250 --> 12:34.350
that and we'll paint this side of the division.

12:34.440 --> 12:41.100
So now if we zoom out you see it looks like we took a little chunk out let's do the same up here.

12:41.310 --> 12:43.760
Now up here it's going to be really simple.

12:43.770 --> 12:44.410
All we have to do.

12:44.420 --> 12:50.010
Select our shadow color and then we'll go ahead and fill that in like so

13:00.440 --> 13:03.300
see how that looks great.

13:03.630 --> 13:08.400
And then up here we actually don't do anything to that because we can't see that side of its surface

13:08.610 --> 13:10.560
so we can just leave that the way it is.

13:11.070 --> 13:11.660
Awesome.

13:11.700 --> 13:15.990
So you just created the board and the base for your sign in the next lecture.

13:16.020 --> 13:20.120
We're going to go ahead and create some design work to apply to our sign.

13:20.160 --> 13:23.150
Thanks for watching and I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.
