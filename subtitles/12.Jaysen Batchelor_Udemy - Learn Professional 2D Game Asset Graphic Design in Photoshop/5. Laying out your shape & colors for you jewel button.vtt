WEBVTT

00:00.690 --> 00:06.150
All right now we're going to go ahead and create a journal button for our game.

00:06.180 --> 00:10.390
So let's start off by coloring in our background with a grade.

00:10.740 --> 00:13.200
So I have a gray already selected.

00:13.230 --> 00:15.230
It's a relatively darker grade.

00:15.240 --> 00:17.510
Go ahead and fill our background in with that.

00:17.550 --> 00:20.070
So now we have a more neutral background.

00:20.070 --> 00:27.180
Next what we want to do is we want to grab our shape tool and we want to grab our lips tool and they're

00:27.180 --> 00:33.360
going to go ahead and create an ellipse and holding down shift to create a perfect circle and we'll

00:33.360 --> 00:36.110
make it about that size next.

00:36.120 --> 00:41.700
Let's go ahead and change the width of our stroke so we're going to come right over here and we're going

00:41.700 --> 00:44.370
to type in the number 45.

00:44.700 --> 00:46.930
Hit enter Let's see how that looks.

00:47.520 --> 00:49.240
Let's make it a little bit wider.

00:49.260 --> 00:53.960
So I'm going to put 55 and her perfect next.

00:54.030 --> 00:58.590
Let's change the color of our stroke so we're going to come over here to this boxa has a stroke around

00:58.590 --> 00:58.860
it.

00:58.890 --> 01:03.960
We're going to select that and I'm going to come over here to a color picker in that corner and we need

01:03.960 --> 01:09.180
to select a yellow color and a selected color probably some over here maybe a little bit more towards

01:09.180 --> 01:12.480
the oranges and maybe a little bit lighter.

01:12.580 --> 01:13.980
So some are about there should be good.

01:14.100 --> 01:16.340
Okay great.

01:16.450 --> 01:19.100
Next let's go ahead and create the jewel part.

01:19.110 --> 01:22.760
So this is going to be the gold part that goes around our jewel.

01:22.920 --> 01:27.180
Next let's create the jewel that will go in the center of our gold ring.

01:27.180 --> 01:34.140
So I'm going to use my shape to once again starting in the middle and hold down shift and then we'll

01:34.140 --> 01:40.860
bring it up to a about that size and then we're going to grab that and we're going to turn off the stroke

01:40.950 --> 01:42.440
by hitting this white box.

01:42.450 --> 01:43.280
The slash right.

01:43.320 --> 01:49.200
And we can turn on a fill by coming into our fill box and we want to fill it with a gradient.

01:49.230 --> 01:52.800
So let's select a gradient and we actually want to flip this around.

01:52.800 --> 01:56.110
We want the dark part to be on top and the light part to be on the bottom.

01:56.400 --> 02:00.490
So let's go ahead and click on this little tab right here.

02:01.120 --> 02:04.110
Well double click and then we can drag that color up to white.

02:04.310 --> 02:08.280
You know we'll do the same thing on the other side of double click the white over here and then we'll

02:08.280 --> 02:10.010
put drag that down to the black.

02:10.290 --> 02:11.150
OK.

02:11.640 --> 02:12.570
Perfect.

02:12.570 --> 02:18.510
Next what we want to do is we want to center this in the middle of our document so Center it right there

02:19.320 --> 02:22.710
and then we want to grab our yellow ring and drag it above this.

02:22.800 --> 02:24.450
And we also want to center that.

02:24.450 --> 02:26.200
So get that to the center.

02:26.460 --> 02:31.060
Next we're going to add some little rivets around the edges of our gold ring.

02:31.290 --> 02:37.020
So using my circular tool I'm going to go ahead and create a small circle.

02:37.020 --> 02:39.040
Hold down Shift keep its proportion.

02:39.270 --> 02:44.260
So we want it a little bit smaller than the width of our of our ring.

02:44.610 --> 02:49.530
Now we can go ahead and drag that into place to make sure it fits perfect next what we want to do is

02:49.530 --> 02:53.010
we want to add and then Bevil to our circle.

02:53.010 --> 02:59.760
So we're going to come down to F X and then we're going to come up to and Bevell and box and what we

02:59.760 --> 03:06.520
want to do is we want to change where it says pillow emboss we want to change that to inner emboss.

03:06.600 --> 03:10.710
So once we have that selected we can go ahead and change our depth to what we want.

03:10.710 --> 03:15.000
And so you see that kind of hardens and softens the depth of the embossing.

03:15.000 --> 03:22.650
So we're going to put it about that all are going to bring the size up to about 16 pixels and then are

03:22.650 --> 03:28.080
going to soften that we might bring that up a little bit more on the size.

03:28.160 --> 03:29.780
Some are about there should be good.

03:29.970 --> 03:34.400
So another gives us a three dimensional rivet on our rim.

03:34.410 --> 03:40.270
Now I have my highlight set to 81 percent and my opacity is set to 70 percent.

03:40.650 --> 03:44.830
So once this is all set up correctly we can go ahead and hit OK.

03:44.940 --> 03:48.510
Next we're going to add a drop shadow to that so we're going to come back down to our facts and come

03:48.510 --> 03:50.350
to drop shadow.

03:50.790 --> 03:56.610
And I'm going to bring my opacity down to about 50 percent maybe a little bit higher about 60 percent

03:57.360 --> 04:04.650
and I'm going to have the distance and the speed is going to be brought up so has a harder edge and

04:04.650 --> 04:08.640
then I'm going to bring the size down so it's a little bit smaller than my actual Rivett then I can

04:08.640 --> 04:11.980
turn that speed back up because I want it to be a little bit softer.

04:12.030 --> 04:14.130
So I'm going to turn it down actually sorry.

04:14.220 --> 04:19.590
So turn it down to about there and then I'm going to go ahead and change the distance so it comes up

04:19.590 --> 04:23.110
a little bit more snow out of that nice little drop shadow there.

04:23.280 --> 04:24.140
Let's go ahead and hit.

04:24.150 --> 04:25.250
OK.

04:25.260 --> 04:30.060
Next what I'm going to do is I'm going to turn on my rollers by coming up to the view then coming down

04:30.060 --> 04:31.650
to rulers.

04:31.650 --> 04:34.990
And now I get these rulers on the sides of my document.

04:35.010 --> 04:40.350
What I can do is I can click that roller and drag down like so and it should click right into the center

04:40.350 --> 04:46.500
of my document and I'll do the same thing from this side and that allows me to find out where the center

04:46.500 --> 04:48.810
of my document is next.

04:48.870 --> 04:55.530
What I'm to do is I'm going to go ahead and grab my Rivett and I'm going to place him right here in

04:55.530 --> 05:01.320
the center like so and then I'm going to nudge him over so he's centered with in my room.

05:01.320 --> 05:06.030
And next we're going to go ahead and turn on our Transform Tool and this little guy right in the middle

05:06.030 --> 05:07.730
of our transform selection.

05:07.890 --> 05:09.060
That's the pivot point.

05:09.060 --> 05:13.590
So we can drag that wherever we want and wherever we drop it that's where it's going to pivot from.

05:13.590 --> 05:16.720
So if I drop it there it's going to pivot around there.

05:16.920 --> 05:24.210
So what we want to do is we want to drag that right to the center of our document and we can tell her

05:24.210 --> 05:28.560
that is because we pulled out these earlier lines and that tells us where it is.

05:28.560 --> 05:33.550
So we just want to make sure we get it lined up with that just like so they're going to go ahead and

05:33.850 --> 05:34.780
rotate this around.

05:34.780 --> 05:39.910
But we want to make sure that we're holding down shift while we do that so we can rotate it to a perfect

05:39.910 --> 05:41.550
45 degree angle.

05:41.710 --> 05:43.590
Now we can hit enter next.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.920
Let's go ahead and make a copy of this layer.

05:45.940 --> 05:47.660
So I have control J.

05:47.920 --> 05:51.800
And then we're going to go ahead and turn on the Transform Tool for that layer and we're going to drag

05:51.820 --> 05:54.940
it's pivot point right to the center like we did with the other one.

05:57.020 --> 06:01.880
And then we're going to go ahead and rotate that 90 degrees.

06:01.900 --> 06:08.320
Now the reason why we rotated that 90 degrees was because from here to here is only 45 degrees from

06:08.320 --> 06:12.910
there to there is 90 degrees because you have your 45 and you're 45 there.

06:12.910 --> 06:15.430
And that's why we rotated back 90 degrees.

06:15.490 --> 06:17.630
They're all going to be 90 degrees after this.

06:17.630 --> 06:22.000
So let's go ahead and hit enter then we're going to make a copy of this layer and we'll turn on the

06:22.000 --> 06:28.630
Transform Tool and drag the pivot point to the center of our document just like so and then we'll go

06:28.630 --> 06:32.890
ahead and rotate that another 90 degrees enter.

06:33.130 --> 06:39.940
Make a copy of that layer and then we're going to turn on the Transform Tool and grab that pivot point

06:40.090 --> 06:48.210
and place it just like so and then go ahead and rotate that another 90 degrees and enter.

06:48.220 --> 06:50.550
Now we're getting a little bit close to the edge over here.

06:50.560 --> 06:52.420
So something was a little bit off.

06:52.420 --> 06:52.950
That's all right.

06:52.960 --> 06:57.130
We can go ahead and use our arrow keys to kind of nudge it into place because we have a general idea

06:57.520 --> 07:00.270
of where that 45 degree angle area should be.

07:00.490 --> 07:08.130
So I'm going to go ahead and nudge this guy down maybe twice and over twice maybe back and then come

07:08.200 --> 07:14.020
down to this guy over here and I'm going to nudge him down twice and then over twice.

07:14.050 --> 07:15.240
Perfect.

07:15.250 --> 07:20.680
Now you'll notice that when we rotated these the shadows didn't rotate with it which is really nice.

07:20.680 --> 07:26.370
They all stayed facing downwards because each one is still having the effect applied to it.

07:26.380 --> 07:28.820
It's not an actual pasteurised image.

07:28.900 --> 07:34.850
And so Photoshop is smart enough that they can apply that same effect in the same angle of lighting.

07:35.110 --> 07:39.120
Next what we want to do is we want to merge all these rivet layers together.

07:39.160 --> 07:46.090
So let's go ahead and select them all and then we're going to right click and merge shapes.

07:46.090 --> 07:47.860
So now those are all one layer.

07:48.220 --> 07:51.690
And now it's right click and we're going to create this into a clipping mask.

07:51.910 --> 07:56.110
And the reason why we've done that is so that it clips off the edge of the shadows that are hanging

07:56.110 --> 07:57.510
over the edge.

07:57.520 --> 08:03.010
Now the last thing we want to do is we want to add a dark edge around the edge of our inner circle.

08:03.010 --> 08:09.880
So I'm going to come down to this layer that has the gradient on it and I'm going to go ahead and turn

08:09.880 --> 08:13.690
on an effect and the effect we're going to use is inner glow.

08:13.840 --> 08:15.460
Now this isn't going to be a glow.

08:15.490 --> 08:17.110
It's actually going to be a shadow.

08:17.380 --> 08:23.170
So right now we can't see our white glow around the edge because we have our blood mode set to darken.

08:23.200 --> 08:25.120
So it's only going to show dark colors.

08:25.150 --> 08:28.750
So first off we want to change our right color to the color black.

08:29.230 --> 08:29.720
OK.

08:29.830 --> 08:32.760
And you can see that edge a lot better next.

08:32.770 --> 08:38.170
Let's go ahead and turn down the opacity just a little bit to about 75 percent and then we're going

08:38.170 --> 08:40.500
to turn that size up a little bit more.

08:40.510 --> 08:42.320
You can also play with a choke a little bit.

08:42.370 --> 08:47.590
But for the most part I think we're just going to leave that at about 6 percent.

08:47.590 --> 08:48.540
That should be good.

08:48.790 --> 08:50.260
And then we can go ahead and hit.

08:50.290 --> 08:52.370
OK great.

08:52.390 --> 08:54.520
That brings us to the end of this lecture.

08:54.760 --> 08:59.860
So in this lecture you were able to lay out all the shapes and the shadows and highlights for your jewel

08:59.860 --> 09:02.250
button in the next lecture.

09:02.260 --> 09:06.550
We're going to go ahead and paint this rim to look a lot more realistic.

09:06.550 --> 09:09.370
Thanks for watching and I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.
