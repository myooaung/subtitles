00:00.650 --> 00:06.120
In this lecture we're going to go ahead and create this criss cross pattern and frame pattern for our

00:06.120 --> 00:07.100
wedding crypt.

00:07.470 --> 00:13.650
So let's go ahead and jump back into our document that has our two wooden pieces of texture and what

00:13.650 --> 00:18.100
we're going to do is we're going to add a Shadowline along the edge of both of these.

00:18.150 --> 00:24.690
So I'm going to zoom in there and using my marquee tool I'm going to go ahead and make a selection all

00:24.690 --> 00:25.990
the way down the side.

00:28.050 --> 00:33.490
Slugs this whole purple side like so then I'm going to go ahead and fill that in with our dirt.

00:33.510 --> 00:36.220
Purple that we selected before foreshadow.

00:36.690 --> 00:42.060
So I'll fill that in and then I'm going to use my Marki tool again and I'm going to click within the

00:42.060 --> 00:46.890
center of my selection and that's going to allow me to take that selection and move it to wherever I

00:46.890 --> 00:53.820
like without moving the content within it that I'm going to go ahead and fill in on the other piece

00:53.820 --> 00:55.720
of wood just like it did before.

00:55.830 --> 00:57.750
Like so.

00:57.770 --> 01:02.540
So that's going to help us differentiate between the two pieces of wood when we're using them.

01:02.540 --> 01:07.590
Now let's go ahead and use or marking tool to select one of these and copy it and we'll bring it in

01:07.590 --> 01:09.740
to our document.

01:09.860 --> 01:12.940
Let's go ahead and shrink that down with our Transform Tool.

01:15.110 --> 01:20.390
Now for Chris cross-pieces we're going to have to rotate these the way you rotate is by coming up to

01:20.450 --> 01:27.110
the corner of your transform selection and you'll see you get this bent arrow sort of icon.

01:27.110 --> 01:31.720
What we want to do is we want to rotate it by clicking and dragging like so.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.780
But if you just click and drag it's going to not necessarily be an exact angle that you want it.

01:37.790 --> 01:40.620
So what we're going to do is we're going to undo that.

01:40.770 --> 01:44.630
And what we want to do is we want to hold down shift as we rotate.

01:44.630 --> 01:50.360
And what that's going to allow us to do is it's going to allow us to rotate in two standard angles.

01:50.390 --> 01:53.120
So if I hold down shift and then start rotating.

01:53.120 --> 01:54.600
You'll see this little tab up here.

01:54.620 --> 02:01.250
The black one it says negative 15 degrees I can go again and now it says negative 30 now says negative

02:01.250 --> 02:05.980
45 and that's what we want we want it to be at a 45 degree angle.

02:05.990 --> 02:11.930
Now let's go ahead and move that into place and then we can go ahead and start shrinking that into the

02:11.930 --> 02:13.150
correct size.

02:13.430 --> 02:17.460
So remember to hold down shift to keep us portions.

02:17.540 --> 02:19.830
Now this piece of wood isn't long enough.

02:19.850 --> 02:24.990
So what I can do is I can grab this little tab on the end here and I can just pull that out like so.

02:25.040 --> 02:26.960
Same with the other side.

02:26.960 --> 02:27.680
Perfect.

02:27.830 --> 02:29.870
Let's go ahead and enter.

02:29.870 --> 02:31.030
Great.

02:31.040 --> 02:34.870
Now let's go ahead and grab our other piece of wood.

02:35.840 --> 02:40.230
Well go ahead and copy that paste that in.

02:40.880 --> 02:41.980
Shrink it down.

02:42.110 --> 02:49.300
And we're going to do the exact same thing that we did with our other plank wooden so hold down Shift

02:49.780 --> 02:54.790
rotate to 45 degrees get that in place.

03:01.700 --> 03:07.940
Then we're going to stretch that out so grab this tab pull it out there pull it out there.

03:07.940 --> 03:10.270
Now we can go ahead and hit enter.

03:10.270 --> 03:13.180
Now let's turn these off to see which way these are going.

03:13.190 --> 03:15.950
So this guy needs to be on top of that guy.

03:15.950 --> 03:18.210
So going to drag this layer underneath.

03:18.590 --> 03:21.480
And that works just perfect next.

03:21.500 --> 03:24.560
Let's go ahead and add in our frame pieces.

03:24.560 --> 03:30.890
So I'm going to come back into my document and I'll copy this guy and I'm going to paste them in like

03:30.890 --> 03:38.200
so and what we want to do is we want to keep this shadow side on the inner side of our document.

03:38.270 --> 03:41.090
So this piece of wood is going to go on this side.

03:41.090 --> 03:44.380
So let's shrink them down.

03:48.510 --> 03:49.740
But there should be good

03:52.740 --> 03:58.040
now we're going to shrink it down until it lines up at the top the bottom of our crate.

03:58.350 --> 04:05.460
Let's go ahead and enter and what we want is we want this edge right here to be lined up with the drawing

04:05.460 --> 04:06.890
line that's underneath it.

04:06.960 --> 04:08.330
So right there.

04:08.610 --> 04:10.710
So it seems like it's already pretty lined up.

04:11.070 --> 04:16.270
And what we're going to do now is we're going to turn down the opacity on that layer so we can see this

04:16.290 --> 04:17.340
other edge.

04:17.490 --> 04:23.490
Now using a marquee tool we're going to go ahead and select up to that black edge and then we're going

04:23.490 --> 04:25.710
to go ahead and hit delete.

04:25.710 --> 04:31.440
Now we did delete the purple edge which is kind of our shadow edge but that's OK because in this case

04:31.710 --> 04:38.010
we actually don't want to have a shadow edge on the corners of our crate or the edges of our Creator.

04:38.280 --> 04:39.720
So this works perfectly.

04:39.720 --> 04:41.560
Let's turn that back up.

04:41.580 --> 04:48.660
Now what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and take this and copy it then we're going to

04:48.660 --> 04:55.950
go ahead and paste it and then we want to rotate it 90 degrees like so now we're going to drag that

04:55.950 --> 04:58.280
into place over here.

04:58.610 --> 04:59.620
Enter.

05:00.060 --> 05:01.250
Perfect.

05:01.260 --> 05:06.790
Now we have a little bit hanging out over the edge on this guy so we're going to come back to his lair.

05:06.990 --> 05:10.400
He's my marquis told just go ahead and delete that.

05:10.450 --> 05:11.280
Great.

05:11.550 --> 05:15.840
Now we need to drag both these layers up so that they're not being covered by these criss cross pieces

05:15.840 --> 05:16.560
of wood.

05:16.740 --> 05:22.810
So select both of them and I'm going to drag them up above both of those pieces of wood next.

05:22.860 --> 05:25.660
Let's go ahead and do the other side and the top side.

05:25.890 --> 05:28.410
So I'm going to select my other piece of wood now.

05:29.920 --> 05:33.470
And copy that and bring it in.

05:33.760 --> 05:35.760
Shrink it down.

05:40.710 --> 05:49.290
And we want to make sure that we have it in the correct proportions and also the correct size.

05:49.390 --> 05:56.440
That to about there enter and then I'm going to go ahead and flip this because I want this darker side

05:56.440 --> 05:57.720
on the inside.

05:57.760 --> 06:04.180
So the way I do that is by using my Transform Tool then right clicking and coming down to flip horizontal

06:05.030 --> 06:07.330
it just flipped over to the other side.

06:07.330 --> 06:09.630
Let's go ahead and hit enter next.

06:09.640 --> 06:13.690
Let's go ahead and turn down that opacity so we can see what's going on.

06:13.690 --> 06:17.150
And you'll see it's moving over the edge a little bit too much over here.

06:17.220 --> 06:19.470
So use my keys on my keyboard.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.260
I can go out and notice that over.

06:21.530 --> 06:27.620
Then using my Marki tool I'm going to go ahead and select up to that black edge and hit delete.

06:27.620 --> 06:31.170
Now you also see that this guy right here is hanging over a little bit too much.

06:31.460 --> 06:33.290
So I can come to that layer.

06:33.470 --> 06:34.870
Hit delete also.

06:35.270 --> 06:37.250
And that just took care of that.

06:37.250 --> 06:42.510
Now let's come back up to this player and turn the opacity back up so we can see what's going on.

06:42.530 --> 06:43.580
Perfect.

06:43.580 --> 06:47.020
Now we want this guy to be underneath this bottom plank of wood.

06:47.270 --> 06:49.280
So I'm going to drag him under like so.

06:49.920 --> 06:53.050
And now we're going to go ahead and copy this letter.

06:53.230 --> 07:01.910
So the markets will select him copy and then months Paestum and then we're going to rotate them 90 degrees

07:01.970 --> 07:04.140
and this will be our top piece.

07:04.160 --> 07:08.350
So put that guy right there enter.

07:08.810 --> 07:09.700
Perfect.

07:10.070 --> 07:12.150
So now we have our pattern.

07:12.200 --> 07:14.930
Let's go ahead and merge all these letters together.

07:14.930 --> 07:19.400
So starting with the top one I'm going to go ahead and come all the way down to my bottom layer which

07:19.400 --> 07:24.540
is the sky and select all of those and we'll go ahead and merge.

07:24.720 --> 07:27.140
So now those are all one layer.

07:27.260 --> 07:34.160
Next let's go ahead and copy that layer and let's drag a guy over like so let's make sure he's above

07:35.100 --> 07:38.010
our other extra patterns.

07:38.380 --> 07:44.420
And now we're going to go ahead and shape them and distort them so that he fits to our perspective.

07:44.640 --> 07:51.160
So he's my Transform Tool come into the store or go ahead and line him up with our corners and because

07:51.160 --> 07:56.350
we already have a square there that's basically the same size should click right into place are just

07:56.350 --> 07:58.990
about perfect.

07:59.110 --> 08:01.210
Let's go ahead and hit enter.

08:01.210 --> 08:02.650
Fantastic.

08:02.770 --> 08:05.430
Let's make another copy of this pattern.

08:06.220 --> 08:10.100
And we'll drag them up to the top then we'll drag him over.

08:11.870 --> 08:13.850
NIMAL do the distortion once more

08:18.770 --> 08:22.750
that I will be tracked there that get to that corner.

08:23.210 --> 08:32.660
This one to that corner and this one to that corner and why enter perfect out this is looking kind of

08:32.660 --> 08:33.420
flat.

08:33.560 --> 08:36.070
But don't worry we're going to fix that in a second.

08:36.080 --> 08:41.540
The reason why it's looking flat is because there should be an edge on the edge of these planks of wood

08:41.720 --> 08:44.260
as well as the top on and the bottom one.

08:44.480 --> 08:46.510
So we're going to add that in right now.

08:46.910 --> 08:52.820
So the way we do that is by coming over to our layers and then we're going to hold down control or command

08:53.270 --> 08:58.580
and then we're going to click our thumbnail on our layer and you can see what that does is it selects

08:58.580 --> 09:01.050
the entire shape on that layer.

09:01.070 --> 09:06.440
Next we're going to add a new layer underneath that layer and then we're going to go ahead and fill

09:06.500 --> 09:09.830
that in with our dark purple color that we had before.

09:10.250 --> 09:15.980
I can't see it because it's behind the Slayer but if we unselect out of this and then use the grab and

09:15.980 --> 09:21.510
move tool and then use the arrow keys on our keyboard we can nudge that out like so.

09:21.670 --> 09:24.710
Nancy see that gives it a nice little edge.

09:24.710 --> 09:28.840
Now we also have this little bit that's sticking out over this edge and we don't want that.

09:28.850 --> 09:31.350
So we're going to go ahead and select that and then hit delete.

09:32.490 --> 09:33.380
Perfect.

09:33.390 --> 09:35.790
Now let's do the same for the other side.

09:35.790 --> 09:37.530
So we're going to come to that layer.

09:37.720 --> 09:41.250
Hold down control or command and select that thumbnail.

09:41.280 --> 09:44.050
So now we have our layer shape selected.

09:44.190 --> 09:51.190
Let's add a new layer underneath that fill it in with our derk purple and using the arrow keys on a

09:51.190 --> 09:51.930
keyboard.

09:52.030 --> 09:55.670
We can go ahead and nudge that over great.

09:55.890 --> 10:00.300
Now to make this look a little bit more interesting we can also add a little bit of shading around the

10:00.300 --> 10:04.350
edges of each one of these triangles to make its pattern stand out.

10:04.590 --> 10:07.980
So the way we'll do that is exactly how we just added the shadow.

10:07.980 --> 10:12.570
The only differences is we're not going to move it and we're going to blur the image.

10:12.750 --> 10:14.360
You'll see what I mean here in a second.

10:14.370 --> 10:19.600
So let's go ahead and come to our outer layer and we're going to select that shape.

10:19.830 --> 10:27.020
Then add a new layer underneath it and we're going to fill this in with black.

10:27.360 --> 10:32.820
Next we're going to come into our filters around and come down to blur and then we're going to come

10:32.820 --> 10:34.640
over to Jane blar.

10:34.920 --> 10:37.960
And now what that does is it adds a blur to our black image.

10:38.070 --> 10:43.210
But I also see some of that black out because it's blurring outwards.

10:43.210 --> 10:50.640
So let's go ahead and play with this see how much blur we want summer about there should be good.

10:50.650 --> 10:51.750
FLATOW OK.

10:52.200 --> 10:56.380
But now you see we have a little bit sticking out over these edges and we do not want that.

10:56.400 --> 11:01.410
So the way we'll take care of that is by coming down to this bottom layer and we'll select that shape

11:01.890 --> 11:06.450
and making sure you're still on your black layer that we just created.

11:06.510 --> 11:11.250
We're going to go ahead and invert the selection and if you remember the way we invert the selection

11:11.250 --> 11:14.290
is by hitting control shift I command a shift.

11:14.370 --> 11:15.420
If you're on a Mac.

11:15.720 --> 11:17.380
And then we can go ahead and hit delete.

11:17.760 --> 11:23.170
That gets rid of all of the area that was hanging out over the edge of our crypt.

11:23.190 --> 11:27.440
Now we can also bring down the opacity on this layer if it looks like too much to you.

11:27.690 --> 11:32.880
So we're going to bring it down to about 75 percent.

11:32.890 --> 11:35.250
Now let's do the same for the other side.

11:35.710 --> 11:43.060
So I'm going to select that shape add a new layer underneath it fill it in with black and now what I

11:43.060 --> 11:47.680
can do is because I still have that setting set up in my filters you'll see we have guavas and blur

11:47.680 --> 11:48.500
right there.

11:48.520 --> 11:55.090
We can go ahead and click that or we can hit control f and that we'll just apply the same effect with

11:55.090 --> 11:57.770
the scene settings to our image.

11:57.880 --> 12:01.900
If you're on a Mac you're going to hit command f next.

12:01.930 --> 12:06.220
Let's go ahead and select the under shape so that would be the sky down here.

12:06.400 --> 12:11.290
So now that we have that shapes selected Let's come back up to our shadow layer and then we're going

12:11.290 --> 12:18.400
to invert the selection and hit delete then let's not forget to bring down the opacity so it matches

12:18.460 --> 12:19.450
our other side.

12:19.450 --> 12:23.870
So bring it to about 75 percent perfect bright.

12:23.870 --> 12:28.570
This is looking pretty good next to what we want to do is we want to add a shadow to one side.

12:28.760 --> 12:33.260
So we need to decide which side is going to be our highlight side and which side is going to be the

12:33.260 --> 12:34.580
shadow side.

12:34.700 --> 12:39.660
I'm going to pick this side right here as the shadow side but you can pick whatever side you'd like.

12:39.670 --> 12:44.450
Now before we do this let's go ahead and merge all these layers together and also make a copy of all

12:44.450 --> 12:45.370
these layers.

12:45.590 --> 12:51.350
So I'm going to select all of them and then I'm going to go ahead and make a copy.

12:52.610 --> 12:58.850
So now I have a copy of all those layers and then I'm going to put those into a folder and then I can

12:58.850 --> 13:05.000
select all the rest of them and merge those together.

13:05.120 --> 13:07.980
So now I have one we turn this off.

13:08.090 --> 13:10.770
Now we have one that's one whole piece.

13:11.060 --> 13:15.170
And if I turn this folder on I have a folder that has all of my original pieces in it.

13:15.200 --> 13:18.890
So that way I can go ahead and change things later if I want.

13:18.920 --> 13:22.670
It's always important to keep all of your layers before you merge them.

13:22.670 --> 13:28.450
That way if you ever need to change anything you can let's come back to this one that we created.

13:28.610 --> 13:30.140
That's its own piece.

13:30.140 --> 13:32.540
So as you can see there it's all one piece.

13:32.660 --> 13:38.360
And what we're going to do is we're going to select that shape that we're going to add new layer above

13:38.360 --> 13:39.200
it.

13:39.200 --> 13:44.040
And what we want to do on this layer is we want to grab our color black and our brush tool and I'm going

13:44.050 --> 13:51.550
to switch over to a hard edged brush and I'm going to paint a line straight down the side a little bit

13:51.550 --> 13:53.670
too far over like so.

13:53.860 --> 13:58.510
So we want to right on the edge of this side of our crate and we can completely filled that him with

13:58.510 --> 14:05.180
black and then we're going to go ahead and bring down the opacity on that to about there.

14:05.380 --> 14:09.550
And what we can do to make us look even more interesting is we can change or blend mode from normal

14:10.690 --> 14:17.490
to overlay and that's just going to apply that color that's underneath it to our value.

14:17.830 --> 14:22.390
So let's play with the opacity real quick and see what looks best.

14:24.310 --> 14:27.180
Something about there I think looks pretty interesting.

14:27.460 --> 14:33.550
Next let's go ahead and add a little bit of some cool color to our shadow so I'm going to add a new

14:33.550 --> 14:37.930
layer above this and then I'm going to select my black layer.

14:37.960 --> 14:42.460
So now I have this little area selected where shadows and what I'm going to do is I'm going to fill

14:42.460 --> 14:45.160
that in with a blue.

14:45.160 --> 14:48.750
So somewhere in there come more down to the blues actually.

14:48.840 --> 14:51.940
Let's keep it in the purple's go ahead.

14:52.000 --> 14:58.840
OK then I'm going to fill that in like so now I'm going to change that layer to overlay and I'm going

14:58.840 --> 15:02.180
to bring my opacity down.

15:02.650 --> 15:04.570
Now that's looking a little bit too violent for me.

15:04.600 --> 15:07.900
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to fill that in with more of a blue color.

15:07.930 --> 15:11.200
And I think that will give me more of the purple color that I'm looking for.

15:12.940 --> 15:14.290
Yep there we go.

15:14.600 --> 15:18.250
I was bring the opacity down on that a little bit too much for me.

15:18.870 --> 15:23.100
So about 50 percent would be good great.

15:23.110 --> 15:26.660
Now let's go ahead and merge all of these layers together.

15:27.550 --> 15:30.710
So now that's all one layer and let's have a look at this.

15:30.730 --> 15:32.650
At 100 percent scale.

15:32.950 --> 15:35.420
So I'll just hit Olt to zoom out.

15:35.590 --> 15:41.800
Now click until it comes out to 100 percent and that's what it's going to look like in your game.

15:41.800 --> 15:42.480
All right.

15:42.490 --> 15:45.610
You just created your first game Assa in Photoshop.

15:45.620 --> 15:48.460
I hope you're really proud of yourself and excited.

15:48.460 --> 15:54.310
Now in the next lecture we're going to go over how to create even more advanced textures for your wooden

15:54.310 --> 15:55.100
crate.

15:55.450 --> 15:58.750
Thanks for watching and I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.
