00:01.260 --> 00:05.720
Are you guys let's go ahead and add some content to this bottle.

00:05.790 --> 00:09.540
So it appears like there's some sort of a gold liquid inside it.

00:09.630 --> 00:13.340
And so the first thing we want to do is we want to fill our bottle.

00:13.410 --> 00:16.330
So I'm going to go ahead and select our shape down here.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.850
The gray one that's the shape of our bottle.

00:19.050 --> 00:21.030
I'm going to add a new layer above it.

00:21.030 --> 00:25.480
So it's going to be underneath my highlight layers and then I'm going to go ahead and use my eyedropper

00:25.590 --> 00:27.550
tool and select this yellow here.

00:27.840 --> 00:32.070
Now if you don't have this image you can go ahead and look at this number right here to get the exact

00:32.070 --> 00:33.370
color that I'm using.

00:33.450 --> 00:36.450
Or you can just look here and see about where my color is.

00:36.630 --> 00:37.890
So it's pretty saturated.

00:37.890 --> 00:42.770
We're going to go ahead and select that then we're going to go ahead and fill this in.

00:42.810 --> 00:45.280
Next we're going to go ahead and unselect out of this.

00:45.380 --> 00:46.750
Then using my last one too.

00:46.770 --> 00:51.300
I'm going to go ahead and draw a line of where I want the edge of my liquid to be.

00:51.360 --> 00:56.330
So I'm going to put it somewhere about there.

00:56.430 --> 00:59.300
Now the quicker you can draw that line the smoother it's going to be.

00:59.300 --> 01:01.700
If you go really slowly it's going to get all jaggery.

01:01.800 --> 01:06.690
So just try to quickly go across if you can't get it right the first time just keep trying and eventually

01:06.690 --> 01:09.110
you'll get the right shape that you want.

01:09.120 --> 01:12.220
Now that we have the shape selected Let's go ahead and hit delete.

01:12.540 --> 01:15.580
And now that gets rid of that top area next.

01:15.590 --> 01:19.070
Let's go ahead and add this top surface to our liquid.

01:19.070 --> 01:21.110
So I'm going to add a new layer for it.

01:21.320 --> 01:27.380
Then using my circular marquee to you know go ahead and make an oval that's about the same size as my

01:27.380 --> 01:27.990
bottle.

01:28.010 --> 01:33.160
I want it to be a little bit bigger then I'm going to go ahead and select this color right here.

01:33.170 --> 01:35.040
That makes up the top surface.

01:35.190 --> 01:38.150
See what color that is there is it's color right there.

01:38.150 --> 01:42.270
There's it's position right over here towards the white.

01:42.310 --> 01:44.520
Fill that in next.

01:44.560 --> 01:49.090
Let's go ahead and turn on the Transform Tool and then turn on the warp tool.

01:49.090 --> 01:52.900
This way we can custom we make the surface of our liquid.

01:52.990 --> 01:57.650
So I'm going to drag this over to the edge of my bottle there and this over to the edge of my bottle.

01:57.670 --> 02:03.600
There then I'm going to go ahead and start morphing the shape.

02:03.640 --> 02:05.710
Now you don't have to copy their bottle exactly.

02:05.710 --> 02:07.560
You can make a liquid whatever color you want.

02:07.560 --> 02:09.760
You can make it in whatever shape you want.

02:09.760 --> 02:11.020
You don't you have to put liquid in it.

02:11.020 --> 02:13.680
You can put anything you want to this bottle.

02:13.720 --> 02:17.980
The concept that I teach you on how to create the glass part of it will allow you to create a bottle

02:17.980 --> 02:22.880
for anything and then allow you to add anything into it.

02:28.640 --> 02:28.970
All right.

02:28.970 --> 02:29.420
Great.

02:29.420 --> 02:31.080
Let's go ahead enter.

02:31.100 --> 02:31.540
Perfect.

02:31.550 --> 02:32.750
Looks good.

02:32.750 --> 02:34.630
Now it's hanging over a little bit on the side.

02:34.640 --> 02:37.080
Solmonese my razor and erase that away.

02:38.350 --> 02:43.410
And I can also kind of see through the white part a part of my bottle right here.

02:43.480 --> 02:48.850
So what I want to do is I want to come back up to my white highlight layer then I'm going to select

02:48.850 --> 02:52.000
the shape again so that I can paint outside of it.

02:52.000 --> 02:57.030
And then coming back to the color white men to go ahead and paint in around these edges once more and

02:57.070 --> 03:00.580
I bring my brush opacity up to 50 percent.

03:00.750 --> 03:02.670
Now they'll see it covers that all up.

03:02.960 --> 03:08.230
We want to make sure these edges are really white at least and most of the areas and the place where

03:08.230 --> 03:09.290
it's supposed to be white.

03:09.310 --> 03:13.190
We want it to be white which means you can't see through.

03:17.440 --> 03:19.480
You'll see as I fill this edgin right here.

03:19.480 --> 03:21.390
It's going to cover that up.

03:21.430 --> 03:23.030
That's exactly what we want.

03:31.130 --> 03:35.020
Perfect now the surface shape up here is looking a little bit boring.

03:35.030 --> 03:41.480
So I'm going to come back down to that layer then using my last or two I can go ahead and draw like

03:41.480 --> 03:47.180
that and go ahead and hit delete to sort of make it look a little bit more interesting.

03:47.180 --> 03:52.450
Same with this side and go like that back and delete.

03:52.450 --> 03:53.570
See how that looks.

03:54.500 --> 04:02.180
Awesome in races where a little bit next let's go ahead and add a top pillow to the surface because

04:02.180 --> 04:02.830
it's gold.

04:02.960 --> 04:05.120
I think it should be going just a little bit.

04:05.120 --> 04:09.980
The way we're going to do that is by coming over to its layer selecting it and then coming down to effects

04:10.670 --> 04:14.900
and then coming over to outer glow.

04:14.900 --> 04:20.220
Now you see we can create an outer glow on it and it makes it look a lot more interesting.

04:20.270 --> 04:22.770
So we're going to select an orange like we have right now.

04:22.790 --> 04:29.510
We might make it a little bit more orange skin and then we're going to bring the opacity down just a

04:29.510 --> 04:32.070
little bit to about 75 percent.

04:32.420 --> 04:38.660
Then my size is at 43 pixels and this is just the distance it's going to throw that glow.

04:38.990 --> 04:42.520
So you'll see if we bring it down to zero pixels you can't see it at all.

04:42.530 --> 04:44.580
And as you bring it up it gets bigger and bigger.

04:44.600 --> 04:51.800
So I'm going to make mine pretty large probably about 100 pixels Mago and hit OK.

04:52.880 --> 04:53.950
Great.

04:53.990 --> 04:58.580
Next what we want to do is if we look at this bottle there's sort of these little glowing orbs inside

04:58.580 --> 04:59.130
of it.

04:59.360 --> 05:01.240
So let's create those.

05:01.250 --> 05:03.770
So first what I'm going to do is almost like my brush tool.

05:03.890 --> 05:11.060
And then I want to make sure I'm on a soft edged brush so I get a copy to my soft brush and then using

05:11.060 --> 05:16.040
my color white and bringing my brush opacity all the way up to 100 percent.

05:16.370 --> 05:22.130
I'm going to go ahead and make a dot like so and you'll see because we're still on this layer that has

05:22.130 --> 05:23.340
the glow effect on it.

05:23.440 --> 05:25.150
It automatically applies to us.

05:25.160 --> 05:29.030
I can add another one here and we get that really cool glowing effect.

05:29.510 --> 05:32.800
Next we're going to go ahead and add some shading to our liquid.

05:33.020 --> 05:38.860
So I'm going to select my liquid color and then I'm going to darken that a little bit to about there

05:39.010 --> 05:41.510
and come a little bit more down into the oranges.

05:41.540 --> 05:42.560
OK.

05:42.920 --> 05:48.200
And now I'm going to select my bottle shape so I don't paint outside of it and then I'm going to add

05:48.200 --> 05:54.860
a new layer above my content layer and then we can go ahead and start painting that in I'm going to

05:54.860 --> 06:03.410
bring my brush opacity down to 2 percent and we can start painting in like so and where we want to paint

06:03.410 --> 06:03.600
in.

06:03.620 --> 06:06.370
It's just along this edge over here.

06:06.650 --> 06:08.670
And also a little bit on this edge.

06:08.810 --> 06:14.600
We don't want to paint too much but just enough to look a little bit more realistic and add a little

06:14.600 --> 06:16.370
bit more shadow to it.

06:16.370 --> 06:20.080
We also want this right here to sand out a lot more of this reflection.

06:20.120 --> 06:23.990
And so by putting the darker color behind it it really does that for us.

06:27.790 --> 06:30.530
All right that brings us to the end of this lecture.

06:30.550 --> 06:35.060
So in this lecture you learn how to add the liquid contents of your potion.

06:35.080 --> 06:39.010
You also learn how to create this really cool glow effect and then you learn how to add a little bit

06:39.010 --> 06:41.200
of shadow to your liquid.

06:41.200 --> 06:42.510
Thanks for watching this water.

06:42.550 --> 06:43.820
And I look for it.

06:44.080 --> 06:45.300
Thanks for watching this lecture.

06:45.340 --> 06:48.040
And I look forward to seeing you in the next one.
