00:00.620 --> 00:03.690
In this lecture we're going to go ahead and add in that Coorg.

00:04.020 --> 00:09.770
So I'm going to add a new layer above all of my layers and the way we're going to create this cork is

00:09.770 --> 00:16.760
first we're going to go ahead and just select a cork color off of our cork reference there is its color

00:16.760 --> 00:18.020
right there.

00:18.140 --> 00:19.860
It's in that position.

00:20.370 --> 00:30.200
Ok then just using a hard edged brush we're just going to go ahead and paint in a basic cork shape.

00:31.720 --> 00:37.330
Don't worry if this isn't perfect we can go ahead and you race away to create the exact shape that we

00:37.330 --> 00:40.310
want.

00:44.370 --> 00:49.060
So something about like so should you get that rounded bottom.

00:49.070 --> 00:57.560
Next we're going to go ahead and erase away these edges to get the shape we want so just like so perfect.

00:57.920 --> 01:00.860
Now we're going to go ahead and achieve this rounded top.

01:00.860 --> 01:04.190
So the way we're going to do that is by using our circular marquee.

01:04.670 --> 01:10.070
And then we're going to make a selection that's about the size and width of our cork.

01:10.310 --> 01:16.130
And then we want to get the right angle in there so the angle would be how squashed your circle is.

01:16.130 --> 01:18.550
So something about like that should be good.

01:18.600 --> 01:23.100
We're going to invert the selection by adding control shift or command shift II.

01:23.360 --> 01:28.280
So now what this is going to allow us to do is it's going to allow us to erase this edge away and leave

01:28.310 --> 01:31.030
the middle the same.

01:31.430 --> 01:32.360
Let's do this once more.

01:32.360 --> 01:35.870
But down here down here we're going to have a little bit more of a rounded curve.

01:35.900 --> 01:41.150
So we can bring our circle down a little bit more.

01:41.180 --> 01:42.670
So there should be good.

01:42.700 --> 01:44.060
We'll get that all lined up.

01:44.100 --> 01:51.650
So then will it control shift I to invert it and erase away this edge.

01:51.650 --> 01:52.960
Perfect.

01:52.990 --> 01:55.350
See that looks awesome.

01:55.440 --> 01:59.910
Now I'm going to nudge it over just a little bit with my arrow keys and maybe down a little bit.

02:00.100 --> 02:07.100
So about they're perfect must go into you Reesa way these little edges that we missed.

02:07.100 --> 02:08.120
Great.

02:08.120 --> 02:13.550
Next let's go ahead and select the shape of our layer and then we're going to add a new layer above

02:13.550 --> 02:14.370
that.

02:14.540 --> 02:17.990
And then let's select this color over here that they're using for their highlight.

02:17.990 --> 02:20.950
So it's just a lighter brown.

02:20.950 --> 02:22.560
There's the color number right there.

02:22.560 --> 02:29.120
There's it's position and then using my brush tool making sure I'm on a soft edged brush.

02:29.210 --> 02:35.980
Go ahead and start painting in those highlights when I bring my brush opacity down to 20 percent.

02:36.130 --> 02:39.710
And first we're just going to paint in the basic shape of those highlights.

02:45.310 --> 02:50.080
Something like so that I'm going to bring my brushes down and now we're really going to start getting

02:50.080 --> 02:52.000
into the real detail of it.

03:07.570 --> 03:11.950
So basically we're getting the highlight on this edge because a light source is coming from over here

03:12.340 --> 03:15.130
and we're also getting a light source coming from somewhere over here.

03:15.130 --> 03:16.510
And so it's hitting the surface

03:32.010 --> 03:32.980
right next.

03:32.990 --> 03:38.420
Let's go ahead and grab an even lighter highlight color so we're going to come up to about there and

03:38.420 --> 03:39.890
come into our yellow's.

03:39.890 --> 03:41.670
So there should be good.

03:41.730 --> 03:47.810
Now we'll go ahead and add our second layer of highlight.

03:49.100 --> 03:52.130
You'll notice here that I'm kind of doing a little small strokes.

03:52.420 --> 03:55.310
That's to add some texture to make it look more interesting

04:02.050 --> 04:05.240
then we can follow this edge with our highlight.

04:05.890 --> 04:08.480
Same with this back edge over here.

04:16.190 --> 04:17.290
Perfect.

04:17.360 --> 04:21.530
Now let's grab one more highlight color and we're going to make this one a little bit brighter and a

04:21.530 --> 04:26.180
little bit more yellow and we can start painting in this highlight

04:53.330 --> 04:55.320
not going to go ahead and select out of fear.

04:55.400 --> 05:00.020
And what I'm going to do now is I'm going to paint over this a little bit more just to make it look

05:00.020 --> 05:01.440
a little bit more hand-painted.

05:01.460 --> 05:06.710
So I'm going to select colors in here so that color right there and switch over to my brush tool and

05:06.710 --> 05:09.820
bring in my brush opacity up to 100 percent.

05:09.830 --> 05:14.340
Now go ahead and paint along that edge like so there.

05:14.380 --> 05:20.720
And so I'm just going to keep selecting my colors and then painting with them.

05:22.580 --> 05:27.980
By the way if you pull down I to switch over to your eyedropper tool and then you select your color

05:28.010 --> 05:28.770
and then let go.

05:28.790 --> 05:33.710
That will allow you to switch back over to your brush tool really quickly rather than having to switch

05:33.710 --> 05:35.450
between the two of them manually.

05:35.450 --> 05:38.330
You can just keep holding down I select your color and let go.

05:38.330 --> 05:43.070
Just make sure you don't just press the eye because that's going to select your eyedropper and keep

05:43.070 --> 06:21.020
it on your eyedropper.

06:21.260 --> 06:21.830
Great.

06:21.830 --> 06:26.990
Next we don't want to do is I want to paint a little bit over this edge right here because it doesn't

06:26.990 --> 06:31.680
really look like it's going into the glass so I'm going to select the color we have around here and

06:31.720 --> 06:34.270
I'm going to go ahead and sort of paint that in by hand.

06:39.360 --> 06:42.690
And then I'm like this even lighter white color.

06:42.960 --> 06:45.050
Paint a little bit more highlight in.

06:45.150 --> 06:49.650
Now I know I'm not on my highlight layer right now but that's OK because we're about to merge this all

06:49.650 --> 06:50.130
together.

06:50.130 --> 06:56.270
So it's one layer we're going to select a little bit darker version of that still pretty light.

06:56.310 --> 06:58.510
And I'll add it right around the edge.

07:05.460 --> 07:07.290
One a little bit too much over the edge here.

07:07.290 --> 07:09.720
So just go ahead and paint some of that back in.

07:09.720 --> 07:10.570
Perfect.

07:10.920 --> 07:13.510
Let's go ahead and zoom out and see how that looks.

07:14.610 --> 07:16.060
Awesome.

07:16.080 --> 07:19.810
Now we can go ahead and turn off our back round shape.

07:19.830 --> 07:24.060
So this first shave that we made we can go and turn that off and see how it looks now.

07:24.260 --> 07:28.560
So you can see how we can see through the bottle and see this gray background that's really nice.

07:28.560 --> 07:32.780
And it's going to make your bottle look a lot more realistic in your game.

07:32.910 --> 07:35.630
Now let's go ahead and merge all these layers together.

07:35.640 --> 07:41.960
But before we do that we want to select them all and then we're going to make a copy and then we can

07:41.960 --> 07:43.650
merge those layers together.

07:43.820 --> 07:50.180
Then we'll take the rest of these layers select them and put them into a folder so we still have those

07:50.800 --> 07:51.680
also.

07:51.710 --> 07:58.280
Now that this layer is merged you'll see here on this edge where we had the glowing effect on our gold

07:58.280 --> 08:03.460
part it kind of came out outside of our bottle and sense it's an effect you can't really cut it off.

08:03.470 --> 08:09.860
And so now that it's one layer and pasteurized we can go ahead any reset away with our waste tool as

08:09.860 --> 08:11.340
best as possible.

08:11.570 --> 08:14.500
And you can get in there really close if you'd like and get it really well.

08:14.510 --> 08:19.240
But I don't think most people are really going to notice that.

08:19.580 --> 08:21.290
Perfect.

08:21.350 --> 08:25.250
Now I'm really curious to know what this looks like in the world of Raimon.

08:25.250 --> 08:28.990
So let's go ahead and bring in a background and see how it looks.

08:29.480 --> 08:35.780
So I have this background from Ray man going to go ahead and drag this layer by clicking it and dragging

08:35.780 --> 08:42.640
it into my radioman background so that we can shrink that down.

08:42.650 --> 08:43.950
See how that looks.

08:45.870 --> 08:51.240
So let's say that was a potion in the corner just saying you have 10 potions or whatever.

08:51.240 --> 08:52.110
It looks pretty good.

08:52.110 --> 08:54.220
It fits right in there.

08:54.280 --> 08:54.930
All right.

08:54.990 --> 08:56.360
Now how do you see this out.

08:56.370 --> 09:02.820
So it has a transparent background and it's not PTSD file because you can't use PTSD files in your game.

09:03.060 --> 09:08.190
Well let's come back into our document and let's go ahead and turn off this background layer and turn

09:08.190 --> 09:09.850
off this reference image.

09:10.260 --> 09:17.370
Then we're going to come up to file save as and we're going to change this from a Photoshop document

09:17.370 --> 09:19.280
to a P.A. document.

09:19.320 --> 09:24.580
What this allows us to do is allow us to save out with transparent backgrounds.

09:24.720 --> 09:26.680
So let's go ahead and save.

09:27.330 --> 09:33.810
So now we have that perfect your assignment for this lecture is to create this project if you haven't

09:33.810 --> 09:34.590
already.

09:34.620 --> 09:39.420
Once you create it I want you to apply it to a game background so it can be a background that you've

09:39.420 --> 09:44.240
already created or it can be a background of a game that's already out there.

09:44.250 --> 09:47.780
Once you've done that go ahead and post it to the Q and A section of the course.

09:47.940 --> 09:50.130
And I can't wait to see your work.

09:50.130 --> 09:53.500
Thanks for watching this lecture and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.
