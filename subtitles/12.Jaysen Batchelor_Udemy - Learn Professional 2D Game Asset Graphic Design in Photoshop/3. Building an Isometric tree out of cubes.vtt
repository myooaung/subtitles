00:00.540 --> 00:04.590
All right let's go ahead and build our first cube asset.

00:04.770 --> 00:09.140
So what we want to do is we first want to make a copy of this letter.

00:09.510 --> 00:15.180
Then we want to make sure that this copy right here the original one we want to keep that there forever

00:15.210 --> 00:16.440
we never want to get rid of that.

00:16.440 --> 00:21.050
We always want to have one large cue that we can always draw from if we need more cubes.

00:21.120 --> 00:26.580
For now I'm going to go ahead and grab that cube and drag it to the corner of my screen like so and

00:26.580 --> 00:29.710
then I'm going to grab my other cube and drag it over here.

00:29.940 --> 00:34.890
So the first asset we're going to be creating is going to be a very simple treat.

00:35.040 --> 00:37.740
So let's go ahead and zoom in there a little bit.

00:37.740 --> 00:42.150
Then using my transform to what I can go ahead and shrink this down to the size I want.

00:42.270 --> 00:46.190
So I'm going to start with the leaf part of my tree.

00:46.200 --> 00:51.370
And the reason for this is because I want the leaf part to be larger than the trunk.

00:51.510 --> 00:57.360
And if I shrink it down too small for the trunk I won't be able to resize it to a larger size for that

00:57.450 --> 01:00.230
leaves without losing my resolution.

01:00.360 --> 01:03.980
So that's why I'm starting with the leaves of the tree first.

01:03.990 --> 01:06.860
So you can make this whatever size you like.

01:07.170 --> 01:09.600
So I'm going to make it about that size.

01:09.710 --> 01:13.280
I'll enter then I'm going to go ahead and copy this layer.

01:13.290 --> 01:14.770
So I had control J.

01:14.790 --> 01:15.990
So now I have a second one.

01:15.990 --> 01:20.800
The cool thing is I can drag that up and you see how it makes it look like it's grown and I can stack

01:20.860 --> 01:23.790
it right on top of the other one or I can drag it right above it.

01:23.850 --> 01:28.680
So I'm going to not start it right on top of the other one but make it just a little bit taller.

01:28.680 --> 01:30.920
So somewhere about there should be good.

01:30.930 --> 01:33.680
So now we have the leaf section of our tree.

01:33.990 --> 01:40.680
Next let's go ahead and copy this layer and then we're going to drag that layer beneath all of our other

01:40.680 --> 01:41.260
layers.

01:41.280 --> 01:43.680
We're going to drag that down below it like so.

01:43.920 --> 01:46.170
Now this is going to be the trunk of our tree.

01:46.200 --> 01:49.380
So I'm going to go ahead and shrink that down so it's really small.

01:49.630 --> 01:53.380
It's going to shrink it down to about half its size.

01:53.400 --> 01:59.330
Somewhere between half the size and a third of the size so maybe a little bit smaller.

01:59.890 --> 02:00.660
So yeah.

02:00.810 --> 02:02.950
More towards the third of the size of the tree.

02:03.180 --> 02:03.900
Perfect.

02:03.900 --> 02:09.270
Now let's go ahead and hit enter and now what we can do is we can drag that up like so and then we can

02:09.270 --> 02:16.410
make another copy of this and we can drag it over and under like so and then we want to drag the layer

02:16.410 --> 02:17.650
underneath the other one.

02:17.850 --> 02:22.640
So that way it starts to build that trunk and let's do one more.

02:22.650 --> 02:29.760
So I control Jane copy the dreck underneath our layer and we can drag it down like so now I'm going

02:29.760 --> 02:35.150
to bring this right into the corner of my grid just like that.

02:35.160 --> 02:37.920
Now this tree trunk is looking a little bit too large for me.

02:37.920 --> 02:43.980
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to select all of my trunk cubes and I'm going to merge them together

02:44.910 --> 02:50.740
and then I'm going to shrink that down and I can shrink down and keep us from portions by holding down

02:50.740 --> 02:53.750
shift and I can keep it in the center by holding down old.

02:53.820 --> 02:57.610
So you'll see that I'll keep that right in the center as I shrink it down so I'm going to shrink it

02:57.610 --> 03:00.100
down to about there.

03:00.100 --> 03:04.110
And now I need to select all of my layers merge them together.

03:04.540 --> 03:10.090
Next let's go ahead and select the cubes that are making up our leaves and we're going to merge those

03:10.090 --> 03:10.510
together.

03:10.510 --> 03:15.220
So we want each individual part of our asset to be its own layer.

03:15.220 --> 03:21.340
Next we're going to add a drop shadow on our shrunk because this big body we use are looming over this

03:21.340 --> 03:21.990
trunk.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.090
It's going to be creating a shadow down here.

03:24.280 --> 03:30.550
So the way we're going to create that shadow is by selecting the shape of our body of leaves and then

03:30.550 --> 03:37.840
we're going to go ahead and add a new layer underneath that and fill that in with the color black once

03:37.840 --> 03:39.840
we've done that we can go ahead and use the air.

03:39.850 --> 03:44.920
He's on our keyboard and pushed that down like so we can push it down as far as we want that shadow

03:44.920 --> 03:46.930
to go next.

03:46.930 --> 03:52.160
Let's go ahead and right click this layer and we're going to create a clipping mask.

03:52.240 --> 03:54.870
So now that's a clipping mask for the trunk.

03:55.130 --> 04:01.170
Now we need to turn down the opacity on this layer so we can actually see through it like a real shadow.

04:01.390 --> 04:05.420
So I'm going to turn it down to about 25 percent.

04:05.680 --> 04:11.530
So we want to make sure that everything within our graphics for this game looks exactly the same.

04:11.530 --> 04:17.700
So every time we do a shadow we need to make sure that the opacity is at 25 percent and it doesn't vary.

04:17.710 --> 04:22.860
The only time this will be an exception is when we have our car right up against the ground.

04:22.900 --> 04:27.340
It's going to be creating a lot darker shadows so that shadow will be darker.

04:27.340 --> 04:27.850
All right.

04:27.850 --> 04:29.820
That brings us to the end of this lecture.

04:29.920 --> 04:35.950
So in this lecture you learn how to create this cool tree in Photoshop.

04:35.950 --> 04:38.600
Now I know it doesn't look exactly like a tree right now.

04:38.620 --> 04:42.700
But in the next lecture we're going to go ahead and add some color to it and it'll read way more like

04:42.700 --> 04:43.350
a tree.

04:43.780 --> 04:44.980
Thanks for watching this lecture.

04:45.010 --> 04:47.320
And I look forward to seeing you in the next one.
