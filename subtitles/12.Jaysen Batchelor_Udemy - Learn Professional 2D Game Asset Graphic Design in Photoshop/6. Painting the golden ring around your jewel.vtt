WEBVTT

00:00.510 --> 00:05.930
All right let's go ahead and start painting the golden ring around her Gem.

00:05.940 --> 00:09.960
So the first thing we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and switch over to grab a move tool

00:10.340 --> 00:14.980
and then we're just going to click on our ruler lines and drag them off.

00:15.600 --> 00:18.240
So that way they're no longer in the way.

00:18.240 --> 00:23.670
Next we're going to go ahead and wrasse dries this layer that has our rivets on it because we're about

00:23.670 --> 00:28.990
to merge them together and we don't want the effect on the rivets to be applied to our ring.

00:29.070 --> 00:34.620
So we're going to right click on that layer and then we're going to come up to raster layer.

00:34.890 --> 00:39.430
And then we're going to select both our layers and merge them together.

00:39.660 --> 00:42.170
So now the whole ring is one layer.

00:42.300 --> 00:47.310
Next let's go ahead and create a new layer above that and we're going to right click that layer and

00:47.310 --> 00:50.390
transform it into a clipping layer mask.

00:50.400 --> 00:55.890
Now the way we paint this is going to be the exact same way we painted the blade on our sword and the

00:55.890 --> 00:57.990
metal part of the handle of our support.

00:58.140 --> 01:00.090
So let's go ahead and get started.

01:00.300 --> 01:05.540
So first off I'm going to go ahead and select my yellow and then I'm going to grab a really bright yellow

01:05.550 --> 01:07.970
so somewhere about there should be good.

01:08.250 --> 01:08.990
OK.

01:09.270 --> 01:10.890
And now I'm to start painting with this.

01:10.890 --> 01:13.410
Now I'm going to switch over to a brush that has more texture.

01:13.440 --> 01:18.240
So maybe we can try this guy out right next to our paintbrush and we're going to go ahead and start

01:18.240 --> 01:19.200
painting with that.

01:19.200 --> 01:26.470
I'm going to paint at 10 percent opacity and actually I'll switch that to 20 percent capacity and I'm

01:26.470 --> 01:31.950
just going to start painting like so just getting my highlights in there.

01:32.040 --> 01:35.050
Now basically the entire surface is going to have high light on it.

01:42.160 --> 01:47.110
Except for this underside there's going to be a shadow as this ring is going to be a little bit and

01:47.200 --> 01:47.720
beveled

02:15.380 --> 02:15.830
next.

02:15.860 --> 02:19.590
I'm going to go ahead and grab it Durka version of this yellow.

02:19.610 --> 02:22.600
So grab that yellow and come down like so.

02:22.700 --> 02:26.170
And since this is going to be a shadow I'm going to make it a little bit cooler.

02:26.200 --> 02:27.830
So I'm going to come up towards my greens.

02:27.920 --> 02:30.040
So it's almost going to be a greenish yellow.

02:30.260 --> 02:30.920
OK.

02:30.930 --> 02:35.840
Now let's go ahead and start filling in bottom areas of our rings so right around here it's going to

02:35.840 --> 02:37.700
get that shadow color

02:40.740 --> 02:42.290
same with underneath here.

03:07.970 --> 03:13.240
Now because this jewel is going to be rounded like a sphere it's going to be blocking the light.

03:13.250 --> 03:15.560
That would be hitting the top surface right here.

03:15.710 --> 03:19.130
So rather than getting to highlight this edge is going to get a shadow

03:26.890 --> 03:32.860
just like so now we can go ahead and select this dark shadow color that we have right here for our rivets

03:32.920 --> 03:35.540
and we're going to start painting with that for next layer.

03:35.800 --> 03:39.340
So start adding in just like this.

03:44.370 --> 03:50.100
And for this style it's OK if you mess up a little bit because what I'm going for is I'm trying to go

03:50.100 --> 04:15.780
for something that looks handmade like it was almost like hammered out a gold or forged out of gold.

04:15.790 --> 04:16.220
All right.

04:16.240 --> 04:18.300
Now let's start getting some more detail in there.

04:18.550 --> 04:22.270
So I'm going to slide this even Durka version of our shadow color over here.

04:22.280 --> 04:25.660
I'm going to start painting with it but with a smaller brush size.

04:25.660 --> 04:30.430
And I'm just going to start painting in like so and I'm insert blending that shadow from my rivet onto

04:30.430 --> 04:31.730
the surface together

04:36.660 --> 04:41.370
and over here it started being covered up I'm going to go ahead and start painting that back in

04:52.370 --> 04:58.020
great and that we can see her adding some more detailed shadows on the edges.

05:39.110 --> 05:39.790
Great.

05:39.800 --> 05:45.660
Now let's go ahead and grab a white collar or almost white someone to come to about their come into

05:45.670 --> 05:50.900
my yellow's And now let's go ahead and start painting even brighter highlights especially along these

05:50.900 --> 05:51.680
edges.

05:55.050 --> 06:02.200
Also on the top of our rivets we're going to add some highlight specially in these areas I got painted

06:02.200 --> 06:02.640
over

06:17.290 --> 06:20.830
and then them to go ahead and switch over to a larger brush size.

06:20.830 --> 06:26.200
And I'm going to go ahead and start painting and some of this more light color all over the flat surface

06:26.260 --> 06:26.890
of the ring

06:39.610 --> 06:40.180
great.

06:40.180 --> 06:44.110
Now I got a little paint over the edges of my rivets someone to go ahead and come back to my Rivett

06:44.110 --> 06:45.040
color.

06:45.030 --> 06:46.690
Go ahead and fix those.

06:46.690 --> 06:49.770
So just paint back over it seems here.

06:49.960 --> 06:51.060
It's we're here.

06:52.590 --> 06:55.620
And we'll fix that also.

06:57.370 --> 06:58.210
Right.

06:58.500 --> 07:01.230
Next let's go ahead and introduce a bounce light.

07:01.260 --> 07:05.610
So I'm going to come in to my colors and I'm going to come into my blues because we want to bounce light

07:05.610 --> 07:10.250
to be cool color because a cool color with a warm color will look nice together.

07:10.560 --> 07:15.750
And I'm going to come up to a light blue summer about like so and using my brush tool and putting my

07:15.750 --> 07:17.580
brush opacity at 10 percent.

07:17.580 --> 07:22.170
I'm going to go ahead and add bounce light to the bottom of my Rivett.

07:22.200 --> 07:25.220
So I'll probably add it right about there.

07:25.230 --> 07:30.000
And we're just going to have it round around this edge like so and blended in we'll do another one over

07:30.000 --> 07:37.830
here and we'll put it on the opposite side on the bottom and then we'll go ahead and add that to the

07:37.830 --> 07:43.890
bottom or if it's on a bottom rivets we can have it come all the way around.

07:45.710 --> 07:51.440
And I'll explain why here in a second.

07:51.450 --> 07:55.920
Now the reason why we had to come all the way around was because there's nothing over here and there's

07:55.920 --> 07:56.610
nothing over here.

07:56.610 --> 08:02.460
So it can get anything bouncing off onto the bottom of here from both sides right here.

08:02.550 --> 08:06.860
The bounce on this side is going to be the bounce light coming from the glow of our gym.

08:07.050 --> 08:08.540
So that's why we left that out.

08:08.790 --> 08:13.790
So now we can go ahead and switch over to a yellow color.

08:14.280 --> 08:17.390
I'm going to go ahead and paint in the bounce light on this side.

08:17.400 --> 08:18.180
But with yellow

08:23.020 --> 08:29.200
great now I'm going to go ahead and select my dark shadow color hair again and what I want to do is

08:29.260 --> 08:31.410
I want to change it more towards the Greens.

08:31.420 --> 08:36.400
So coming into my color picker I'm going to drag it up towards my greens and I'm going to start painting

08:36.400 --> 08:38.680
a little bit of green shadow there.

08:38.680 --> 08:45.330
Now the reason for this is because if you look at reference of gold gold tends to have a green shadow.

08:45.520 --> 08:49.180
So we're going to add just the tiniest bit of a green tent towards shadows.

08:49.300 --> 08:53.810
So we'll go ahead and start painting that in.

08:54.080 --> 08:57.250
But this will make it look a lot more realistic.

09:25.400 --> 09:28.300
Next let's go ahead and introduce some oranges here.

09:28.490 --> 09:30.830
So I'm going to select my neutral yellow color.

09:30.860 --> 09:36.950
I can find them right there on that Rivet and then I'm going to come and bring it down into the oranges

09:36.950 --> 09:38.200
about there should be good.

09:38.360 --> 09:39.020
OK.

09:39.380 --> 09:42.770
And now I just want to start painting in a little bit of orange in there.

09:43.810 --> 09:50.140
So we have another layer of color and it doesn't have to be everywhere just in some areas and there's

09:50.140 --> 09:53.080
not necessarily any specific spots you have to add it in.

09:53.100 --> 09:57.970
You just want to add some of that orange in there generally probably keep it towards the edge of the

09:57.970 --> 09:59.440
shadows.

10:15.290 --> 10:15.990
Awesome.

10:16.040 --> 10:22.740
Next let's go ahead and add a really bright highlight so I'm going to change my color to a solid white.

10:22.920 --> 10:25.930
Then bring in my brush opacity all the way up to 80 percent.

10:25.940 --> 10:29.560
I'm going to go ahead and paint along the top of our room like so

10:38.690 --> 10:43.560
then I'm going to go ahead and add some to the top of my ribbon also.

10:43.610 --> 10:44.700
So just right there

10:53.290 --> 10:58.810
next I'm going to go ahead and bring my brush opacity down to 30 percent and then I'm going start blending

10:58.810 --> 11:00.190
this in a little bit more

11:04.020 --> 11:05.460
with on top of my rivets.

11:08.330 --> 11:14.510
And then we're going to add a little bit of some transparent white down the middle of it in some white

11:14.510 --> 11:22.830
down this middle also blend that in and finish it all the way around our ring to this point.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.260
Great.

11:24.260 --> 11:29.750
Now what we want to do is we want to start selecting colors and painting with them at full opacity.

11:29.750 --> 11:34.730
So I'm going to switch over to my color picker and go ahead and select that color and I'll start painting

11:34.730 --> 11:37.510
with that at full capacity.

11:37.630 --> 11:40.840
Then I select another color so maybe that color it there.

11:41.030 --> 11:45.320
And also like this one and you don't have to select every color you just want to select some of them

11:45.320 --> 11:49.420
and start painting with them in areas at full capacity.

11:49.430 --> 11:51.200
This is going to make it look more like a painting.

11:51.200 --> 11:52.210
Like I said before

12:33.250 --> 12:33.830
great.

12:33.890 --> 12:36.230
Now let's go ahead and zoom out and see how this looks.

12:36.230 --> 12:38.060
From far away.

12:38.090 --> 12:38.400
All right.

12:38.450 --> 12:39.970
I think it's looking pretty good.

12:40.190 --> 12:44.810
I think we need a little bit more Shatto along these bottom edges so I'm going to go ahead and select

12:45.740 --> 12:50.660
my shadow color and then I'll go ahead and paint in some more shadows and I'm going paint them in at

12:50.660 --> 12:52.510
30 percent opacity.

12:52.860 --> 12:55.660
And I think what we need is we just need them to be thicker

13:03.330 --> 13:06.570
and then I'll do the same thing on this side.

13:07.830 --> 13:12.360
I'm going to bring my brush opacity down to 10 percent because it's looking a little bit too dark for

13:12.360 --> 13:13.980
me.

13:16.820 --> 13:21.160
Then I'll do the same thing on the top side bring my brush opacity up to 20 percent

13:27.290 --> 13:29.870
and then I'm going to go ahead and select my yellow.

13:29.870 --> 13:34.400
So there's some yellow right here and I'm going to go ahead and paint in some yellow back into this

13:34.400 --> 13:38.540
area because we're sort of losing the yellow and it's looking too white.

13:38.600 --> 13:45.980
So we'll go ahead and paint that in and maybe a little bit over here also a little bit over here.

13:46.150 --> 13:46.490
Right.

13:46.490 --> 13:48.110
I think that looks a little bit better.

13:48.470 --> 13:53.930
Now I'm noticing that we forgot to add a blue bounce light to this bottom part of our ring.

13:53.960 --> 14:03.050
So I'm going to go ahead and select this blue and then I'm going to come up so that it's lighter then

14:03.050 --> 14:05.230
we can go ahead and paint that back in.

14:05.240 --> 14:08.060
So we're going to put it at 20 percent opacity.

14:08.060 --> 14:10.100
I'm just going to paint along the bottom just like so

14:30.610 --> 14:35.920
and then we also want to add some bounce light work low light whatever you want to call it to this inside

14:35.920 --> 14:40.930
edge because if this is getting bounce light right there then this also needs to be getting some of

14:40.930 --> 14:41.580
that bounce light.

14:41.620 --> 14:46.000
So I'm going to select this yellow right here and I'm going to begin painting with it right along the

14:46.000 --> 14:46.920
edge like so

15:07.080 --> 15:09.350
and then we can come down here and do the same thing.

15:20.300 --> 15:25.460
Now my color is a little bit too dark so I'm going to lighten it just a little bit for down here.

15:25.660 --> 15:27.850
Well go ahead and start painting again.

15:27.860 --> 15:29.060
That works much better.

15:48.450 --> 15:49.240
All right.

15:49.280 --> 15:54.990
Now just to skip redundancy I went ahead and skipped forward in this part of the course and all I did

15:54.990 --> 16:00.660
is I went through there and I grabbed those mid colors and then painted them in with 100 percent opacity

16:00.720 --> 16:02.190
like we've done before.

16:02.250 --> 16:07.140
Just to give it that painter look and then I went in there and I painted in some scratches and divots

16:07.230 --> 16:09.770
and now we're going to go ahead and add in some highlights for those.

16:09.810 --> 16:15.630
So these scratches and divots are just like when we did scratches and divots for our sword blade.

16:15.630 --> 16:19.680
Now the color that I selected was the shadow color from my rivets.

16:19.890 --> 16:21.530
So let's go ahead and get started.

16:21.810 --> 16:27.420
So let's select a light yellow color I'm going to select this color here then switch over to my brush

16:27.420 --> 16:31.220
to go ahead and start adding those highlights in so I add one in right.

16:31.320 --> 16:36.920
They're allowed one on the bottom of here and so just remember the light sources come in from the top.

16:36.960 --> 16:45.830
And so we're going to be getting these highlights on the bottom of our scratches and rivets divot.

16:45.840 --> 16:46.800
Sorry about that.

16:47.070 --> 16:51.780
And then we're going to go ahead and select this yellow color right here and use that for the highlight

16:51.780 --> 16:54.290
on this guy because he's in shadow.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.420
All right let's go ahead and zoom out.

16:57.430 --> 17:00.430
See that looks perfect.

17:00.470 --> 17:02.480
Now he could maybe use one more over here.

17:02.560 --> 17:06.950
Going to go out and select this color and I'll go ahead and paint in a scratch right across.

17:06.950 --> 17:13.430
Like so and maybe I'll give it a little bit of a curve and then I'll come back to my yellow color and

17:13.430 --> 17:18.550
look at it in that highlight.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.050
All right that brings us to the end of this lecture.

17:22.270 --> 17:27.790
So in this lecture you learn how to paint the golden ring on your gem you learn how to do the highlights

17:27.820 --> 17:33.050
and the shadows and you also learn how to add a bounce light to it to make it look more realistic.

17:33.070 --> 17:37.850
And lastly you added in some scratches and texture in to your ring.

17:38.290 --> 17:41.620
Thanks for watching this lecture and I look forward to seeing you in the next one where we're going

17:41.620 --> 17:43.610
to go ahead and start creating the Jim.
