00:00.660 --> 00:05.400
In this lecture we're going to go ahead and add some finishing touches to our book to really make it

00:05.400 --> 00:06.200
pop.

00:06.420 --> 00:11.400
So first off we're going to go ahead and add a little bit more of an edge to this gem piece and the

00:11.400 --> 00:15.390
way we'll do that is we're going to add a new layer underneath that then we're going to go ahead and

00:15.390 --> 00:20.310
select the shape of this by holding down control or command and selecting the thumbnail shape and then

00:20.310 --> 00:24.600
we're going to go ahead and select the great that our piece is made out of.

00:24.870 --> 00:27.020
And then we're going to go ahead and grab an even Durka version.

00:27.030 --> 00:32.240
That's a really close to our blacks that will go ahead and fill that in then using the arrow keys on

00:32.240 --> 00:35.790
a keyboard we're going to go ahead and nudge that down to about there.

00:35.880 --> 00:38.330
Now that's actually not looking dark enough for me.

00:38.580 --> 00:43.830
So what I'm going to do is I'm not hit control you or command you and I'm going to Durkan that to about

00:43.830 --> 00:44.440
there.

00:44.570 --> 00:45.860
OK next.

00:45.900 --> 00:48.870
Let's go ahead and paint an edge to the book cover.

00:48.870 --> 00:53.010
Because right now it looks really thin because we can't really see an edge on it.

00:53.010 --> 00:57.600
So what I'll do is I'm going to select the color of my book and then I'm going to go ahead and grab

00:57.600 --> 01:02.130
a little tiny bit of a lighter version of that color some maybe two right there.

01:02.220 --> 01:03.020
OK.

01:03.260 --> 01:07.530
And I'm going to come down to my book cover layer and I'm going to add a new layer above that.

01:07.680 --> 01:12.240
So that way if I want to change anything about this it doesn't affect my other layers than using my

01:12.240 --> 01:15.820
brush to go ahead and just hand paint in a wedge in there.

01:15.990 --> 01:19.570
So right across here we can go ahead and hold down shift and paint it crossed.

01:19.590 --> 01:25.430
So we get a nice straight line but then we want to go in there by hand and sort of make that edge a

01:25.430 --> 01:30.990
little bit more organic by hand painting it in.

01:31.130 --> 01:32.680
Now we'll go ahead and paint down here.

01:32.700 --> 01:36.600
Now at this point I'm going to go ahead and bring down the lightness of this just a tiny bit so maybe

01:36.600 --> 01:43.370
two there and I'll go and paint this edge and I will go ahead painted this edge and rehearsal hold down

01:43.410 --> 01:47.480
shift to get across there not go ahead.

01:47.690 --> 01:52.810
Paint and a little bit more of an organic shape on there.

01:53.310 --> 01:54.520
Let's go ahead and zoom out.

01:54.540 --> 01:56.100
See how that looks.

01:56.160 --> 01:56.450
All right.

01:56.460 --> 01:59.000
I think that looks much better next.

01:59.010 --> 02:03.420
Let's go ahead and add in some scratches onto our book surface because I think this will make it look

02:03.420 --> 02:04.560
much more interesting.

02:04.570 --> 02:10.080
Also someone add a new layer above the law or we just created and then I'm going to go ahead and select

02:10.140 --> 02:15.420
this dark red color down here on my book spine and then on the top surface I'll go ahead and just paint

02:15.480 --> 02:20.110
in some very simple lines for scratches so that might be a little bit too dark.

02:20.130 --> 02:24.780
So I want to bring my brush opacity down to 50 percent and then I'm going go ahead and just paint in

02:24.840 --> 02:28.490
some lines so not to be perfect.

02:28.740 --> 02:35.120
Maybe in some spots in there then I'm going to go ahead and grab an even darker version of this.

02:35.130 --> 02:38.790
And in fact I'm going to come all the way down to black and I'm going add in a few little scratches

02:38.790 --> 02:41.100
on the spine of my book.

02:41.760 --> 02:44.870
And then what we want to do is we want to go in there with a lighter color.

02:44.880 --> 02:51.210
So let's select this color on our book spine and then what we want to do is we just want to go ahead

02:51.240 --> 02:54.750
and paint right along the edge of these scratches.

02:55.160 --> 02:58.150
Go and do the same thing right here.

02:58.260 --> 03:03.410
We want to do this for all of the scratches and spots that we added to our book cover.

03:19.850 --> 03:22.380
Now this is looking a little bit too light on our book's spine.

03:22.400 --> 03:26.990
So what I'm going to do is I'm to bring my brush opacity down to 20 percent that way.

03:26.990 --> 03:30.610
It's a little bit lighter down here on the book's spine.

03:32.450 --> 03:32.780
All right.

03:32.810 --> 03:33.410
Great.

03:33.410 --> 03:35.890
Let's go ahead and zoom out and see how that looks.

03:36.260 --> 03:37.920
So now we have a little bit more texture in there.

03:37.940 --> 03:39.740
I think that looks really good.

03:39.980 --> 03:43.580
Next let's go ahead and add a little bit of detail in between our pages.

03:43.580 --> 03:48.660
So what we want to do is add a few pages that look like they're sticking it out of our book.

03:48.710 --> 03:53.510
So the way we'll do that is we're going to go in there with a brush tool and I'm going to select this

03:54.470 --> 04:00.620
like color that we have here for our book and on a new layer I'm going to go ahead and brush in sort

04:00.620 --> 04:02.190
of some pages sticking out of here.

04:02.240 --> 04:07.190
I want to make sure I'm at 100 percent opacity and it's OK if the shape is imperfect because we can

04:07.190 --> 04:09.150
always go back in there and you race.

04:09.190 --> 04:13.400
So get to add one page sort of sticking out like this.

04:13.640 --> 04:17.630
Go ahead and fill that in.

04:17.720 --> 04:22.390
I want to go ahead and add a few more down here so maybe one coming across like this.

04:24.660 --> 04:28.060
And another one sticking out right here.

04:29.200 --> 04:34.330
Then using my eraser on going go ahead and just erase away so that these become more of a hard edged

04:34.420 --> 04:35.640
line.

04:35.650 --> 04:40.150
Same with this one can hold them shift to click across there.

04:40.180 --> 04:42.110
That way we get a nice hard edge.

04:42.160 --> 04:43.790
The same thing here.

04:44.320 --> 04:44.950
Great.

04:45.040 --> 04:47.590
Then I'm going to go ahead and use my lasso tool for this part.

04:47.590 --> 04:53.170
So I get a really nice straight line and I'm going to cut across the top edges of these so that they're

04:53.170 --> 04:56.710
going at the same angle as my pages then hit delete.

04:56.920 --> 05:05.080
And that's going to make it look like the pages are actually coming out of the book.

05:05.090 --> 05:11.550
Mostly we'll do this one.

05:11.560 --> 05:11.980
Great.

05:12.010 --> 05:14.330
So now we have some pages you can out of the book.

05:14.410 --> 05:18.990
Next what we need to do is each one of these pages need a little bit more of some chÃ¢teaux.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.780
Now this one right here I'm actually not really liking how far it's sticking out so don't go ahead and

05:22.780 --> 05:27.650
erase that just a little bit more until I get it to my liking.

05:27.650 --> 05:27.990
All right.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.850
I think that works much better.

05:30.010 --> 05:35.800
So I'm going to add a layer underneath this layer and then using the color black because we wanted to

05:35.800 --> 05:38.690
match this shadow right here from the top part of our book.

05:38.800 --> 05:44.040
We're going to go ahead and paint in some shapes that are very similar to the shapes right here.

05:44.350 --> 05:48.460
And we want to make sure that they're going downwards instead of coming out.

05:48.760 --> 05:53.350
And we want to make sure that each corner is touching the corner of our shadow so our shadow needs to

05:53.350 --> 05:59.820
be touching the corner of this page and come down like this and it's OK if your shape isn't perfect

05:59.830 --> 06:03.760
because again we can go back in there and erase it and use or lasso tool to get the shape looking the

06:03.760 --> 06:08.940
way we want it.

06:08.980 --> 06:09.460
Great.

06:09.460 --> 06:15.010
Now let's go ahead and use our research tool and we're going to go ahead and erase away the areas we

06:15.010 --> 06:20.680
don't want and we'll go ahead and also reshape the shape of our shadows so this guy might come over

06:20.680 --> 06:21.910
a little bit more like this

06:32.070 --> 06:32.830
perfect.

06:32.850 --> 06:37.700
Now let's go ahead and bring down the opacity on these two about what's.

06:37.740 --> 06:43.850
And 90 percent and use my research tool and coming to a hard edged brush or soft edged brush sorry.

06:43.860 --> 06:46.700
I'm going to go ahead and erase away these bottom edges like I did up here.

06:46.800 --> 06:51.990
Now you want to be a racing at 20 percent capacity so you're not completely racing in a way.

06:52.620 --> 06:59.240
And these ones might actually even be a little bit lighter so we might even do two overpasses of a race

06:59.240 --> 07:03.550
in that let's go and zoom out see how that looks.

07:03.570 --> 07:06.010
Those look a little bit too hard to me.

07:06.030 --> 07:08.930
So what I want to do is to bring down the opacity a tiny bit.

07:08.940 --> 07:13.460
I know they don't match the shadow up here but I think they look better when they're lighter.

07:13.470 --> 07:13.790
All right.

07:13.800 --> 07:14.450
Great.

07:14.460 --> 07:18.280
Next let's go ahead and add a ribbon bookmark sticking out of here.

07:18.450 --> 07:23.510
So I'm going to add a new layer above these layers and then I'm going go ahead and select a red color.

07:23.520 --> 07:30.210
So when it come into sort of my reddish purplish colors and I want to grab a darker red but I want it

07:30.210 --> 07:32.780
to be pretty saturated still so maybe somewhere in here.

07:32.840 --> 07:33.530
OK.

07:33.720 --> 07:39.680
Then using my brush to go ahead and paint in the shape of my ribbon bookmark.

07:40.380 --> 07:42.500
So maybe something like this should work.

07:46.820 --> 07:47.440
Great.

07:47.450 --> 07:50.390
Now I don't really like the placement so don't go ahead and use my grab move tool.

07:50.400 --> 07:51.730
Move this over.

07:51.740 --> 07:56.160
We can also go ahead and use the word tool so we'll use a transform right click.

07:56.160 --> 07:57.180
Come to work.

07:57.350 --> 08:01.340
And we can go ahead and work this a little bit more until it sort of shaped a little bit more the way

08:01.340 --> 08:02.670
we want it.

08:05.030 --> 08:07.100
We'll go ahead and enter.

08:07.340 --> 08:11.300
And now we're going to go ahead and go in there with our race to what we're going to erase the shape

08:11.300 --> 08:12.600
out a little bit more.

08:12.650 --> 08:16.070
I want to make sure I'm on a hard edged brush.

08:16.090 --> 08:19.620
It is a race edge a little bit more.

08:19.690 --> 08:21.050
I was a little bit too much

08:27.630 --> 08:29.580
and then I'm a go ahead and use this edge

08:33.870 --> 08:41.400
and then use my Lasso tool I can go ahead and clip out more of a hard edge for this snake tongue my

08:41.510 --> 08:42.680
delete.

08:42.820 --> 08:43.640
All right.

08:43.650 --> 08:44.360
Perfect.

08:44.370 --> 08:46.740
So now you have the shape for our ribbon.

08:46.860 --> 08:51.540
Next will we want to do is you want to kind of off this top edge so that it's all lined up with the

08:51.540 --> 08:53.270
angle of our pages.

08:53.280 --> 08:54.310
What do we eat.

08:54.330 --> 08:57.620
So now it looks like it's actually coming out of the book next.

08:57.660 --> 09:01.590
Let's go ahead and add in some highlights and here to make this look more realistic.

09:01.680 --> 09:04.800
So I'm going to go ahead and select the shape of my layer.

09:04.830 --> 09:08.280
Now you can do this on a clipping layer mask to make it more accurate.

09:08.490 --> 09:11.070
But in this case I think it will be fine.

09:11.070 --> 09:13.640
So now what I want to do is I'm going to go ahead and select my red color.

09:13.680 --> 09:17.310
I'm going to grab an even lighter version of this quite a bit lighter actually.

09:17.310 --> 09:22.640
So about there should I do then using my brush to bring in my brush opacity down to 10 percent.

09:22.650 --> 09:25.970
I'm going to go ahead and slowly layer in my highlight.

09:25.970 --> 09:30.720
So I want to add a little bit of some highlight or reflection down here at the bottom because this is

09:30.720 --> 09:32.890
going to be a little bit glossy.

09:33.120 --> 09:43.680
That's why we're adding this in.

09:43.750 --> 09:44.060
All right.

09:44.080 --> 09:47.710
Now let's go ahead and unselect that see how that looks great.

09:47.710 --> 09:53.950
I think that looks better than I'm going to go ahead and select the shape and then add a new layer underneath

09:53.950 --> 09:58.900
it and I'm going to go ahead and select my original red color that I had for it and I'm going to grab

09:58.900 --> 10:00.370
an even darker version of that.

10:00.370 --> 10:02.980
So about there should be good maybe even darker.

10:03.040 --> 10:05.510
I'm going to go and fill that shapen on this new layer.

10:05.530 --> 10:07.570
So it's underneath there you can't see it yet.

10:07.660 --> 10:11.090
But if I nudged down using my arrow keys you'll see you can just barely see it now.

10:11.140 --> 10:13.560
Going a merger over to the left also.

10:13.870 --> 10:19.600
So that way it gives the ribbon a little bit more of an edge and more of a three dimensional look.

10:19.600 --> 10:22.710
Now I can go ahead and merge my two ribbon layers together.

10:22.780 --> 10:30.290
So the top layer and this bottom layer Let's go and zoom out and see how our book looks all together.

10:30.430 --> 10:31.420
Great.

10:31.420 --> 10:35.740
Now the last thing I want to do is I want to go ahead and add a little bit of a shadow underneath this

10:35.740 --> 10:38.300
book so it stands out a little bit more.

10:38.320 --> 10:43.180
So what I want to do is I want to go ahead and select all the layers that are making up my book then

10:43.180 --> 10:48.340
I'm going to go ahead and hit Control J to make a copy of all those layers right click them and merge

10:48.340 --> 10:49.080
them together.

10:49.120 --> 10:54.900
So now we have a merge version but we also still have all of our original layer pieces.

10:54.910 --> 10:58.710
So now this what we want to do is we want to go ahead and select the shape of it.

10:58.900 --> 11:02.620
Then we're going to go ahead and fill that in with a black on a new layer.

11:02.650 --> 11:05.110
So I'm to go ahead and select the color black.

11:05.110 --> 11:06.550
Fill that in.

11:06.820 --> 11:11.860
At this point we can go out and delete this copy merge layer because we don't need to any longer.

11:11.860 --> 11:16.510
And then we're going to go ahead and drag this black colored inversion all the way down to the bottom

11:16.740 --> 11:18.100
and bring it to there.

11:18.500 --> 11:22.960
So now you can't see it but if we go ahead use or nudge arrow keys we can go ahead and nudge that out

11:22.960 --> 11:28.140
a little bit and then I'm going to come up to filter and then come down to blur.

11:28.690 --> 11:34.150
And then we want to come down to guanine Blar then we want to bring that down because that's blurred

11:34.150 --> 11:34.910
way too much.

11:34.930 --> 11:38.440
So maybe two about there will hit OK.

11:38.610 --> 11:42.300
And we're going to nudge that down a little bit further so we can see a little bit more of that shadow.

11:42.310 --> 11:45.220
We also want to nudge a little bit more over to the left side.

11:45.550 --> 11:46.050
Perfect.

11:46.060 --> 11:48.010
I think that looks pretty good.

11:48.040 --> 11:52.090
Next what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and use or Transform Tool and then we're going

11:52.090 --> 11:54.280
to right click and come to work.

11:54.520 --> 11:58.810
And what I want to do is I want to work this bottom area a little bit so that it's leaning more up with

11:58.900 --> 12:00.430
this ribbon.

12:00.430 --> 12:04.400
But then we also want to pull this out so it comes back to its normal position.

12:04.650 --> 12:06.200
So about there should be good.

12:06.270 --> 12:08.050
We'll go ahead and hit enter.

12:08.050 --> 12:11.620
Then using my race tool and I want to make sure I'm on a soft edged brush.

12:11.620 --> 12:14.270
I'm going to raise some of these areas that shouldn't have shadows.

12:14.440 --> 12:19.670
So the only places that should have the shadow are the surfaces that are touching the surface.

12:19.720 --> 12:20.470
It's sitting on.

12:20.470 --> 12:24.250
So up here there shouldn't be a shadow because that's actually above the surface.

12:24.250 --> 12:26.410
Same way over here this book spine.

12:26.410 --> 12:32.170
And we can bring down our opacity to 20 percent to slowly layer this in so that way we get more of a

12:32.170 --> 12:36.260
soft edge on our race.

12:36.260 --> 12:36.600
All right.

12:36.640 --> 12:37.330
Great.

12:37.330 --> 12:39.910
Let's go and zoom out and see how that looks.

12:39.910 --> 12:42.160
I think that looks much better.

12:42.160 --> 12:46.160
That brings us to the end of this lecture in the end of this project.

12:46.300 --> 12:52.120
So in this project we went ahead and created this entire portion book that looks relatively realistic

12:52.330 --> 12:53.710
at least for again.

12:53.860 --> 12:58.630
And we also added in some realistic things such as these cast shadows these paper sticking out and we

12:58.630 --> 13:04.600
even added in some scratches on the top surface of our book just to give it some more texture.

13:04.630 --> 13:09.780
I really hope you enjoyed this project and I'm really looking forward to seeing you in the next one.

13:09.940 --> 13:11.060
Thanks for watching.
