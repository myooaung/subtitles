00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.030
- [Instructor] My name is Chris Anatalio

2
00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:04.080
and I'm a senior software engineer.

3
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.000
I have over a decade of experience

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.060
crafting scalable modular web applications.

5
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.030
Modern application development is more demanding than ever.

6
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.090
You need to support mobile and tablet apps

7
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.010
as well as web applications.

8
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.000
A well built rest API can provide the data

9
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.080
to power all three.

10
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.000
In this course, we're going to build a rest API

11
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.010
with Java and Spring Boot.

12
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.010
We will also build a responsive modern front end

13
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.050
using Angular JS 2.

14
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.070
We will walk through how to design and model your resources.

15
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.080
Finally we will go over how to test and document your API.

16
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.060
After completing this course,

17
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.030
you will have a solid foundation

18
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.040
for creating a modern, scalable API.

19
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.090
You will also have a foundation

20
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.000
for building a fast, responsive front end.

21
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Now, let's get started.
