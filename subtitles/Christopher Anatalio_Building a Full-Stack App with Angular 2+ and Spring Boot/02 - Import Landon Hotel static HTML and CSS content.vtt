00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.050
- [Instructor] First off, let's add

2
00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.010
the typescript plugin for Eclipse

3
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.030
so that we have proper syntax highlighting

4
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.090
on our .ts files.

5
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:18.030
Let's navigate to github.com/palantir/eclipse-typescript.

6
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.090
Next, let's copy the update site link.

7
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.060
Okay, let's head back to Eclipse,

8
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.040
click on Help, Install New Software.

9
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.050
Let's click on Add,

10
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.040
and then let's copy the update site link

11
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.010
into the location and name field.

12
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.080
Click on the typescript plugin, then Next,

13
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.090
and Next again, then Accept, and Finish.

14
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.090
Then, let's restart.

15
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.060
Okay, now let's click on the project root, and refresh.

16
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.010
Let's take a look

17
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.030
at the angular JST project files we generated.

18
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.030
Let's navigate into source, main, webapp, angular2,

19
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.010
source, and then app.

20
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.060
We're going to go ahead and reuse some static HTML

21
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.010
and styles from an existing LinkedIn learning brand,

22
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.070
landonhotel.com.

23
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.010
Having an actual branded front-end

24
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.020
will add context and meaning to what we're building.

25
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.010
First, get the exercise file labeled Landon-Hotel.zip.

26
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.040
Double-click to extract,

27
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.040
and then open up the files.

28
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.030
First, let's open up the file labeled home.html.

29
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.060
Let's right-click, Open With, Other,

30
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.030
and then STS, or Eclipse.

31
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.080
Next, let's open up the file labeled app.component.html.

32
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.000
Let's go ahead and copy the content from home.html

33
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.050
into our component, then save.

34
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.040
Next, let's copy the image directory

35
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.000
and then copy the images into our app directory.

36
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.060
Finally, let's grab the styles

37
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.050
from the landon-hotel.css file.

38
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.030
Let's right-click, Open With, Other,

39
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.060
and double-click on STS or Eclipse.

40
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.080
Let's copy all the content from landon-hotel.css

41
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.010
and then paste it into app.component.css, and Save.

42
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.060
Next, let's head to a terminal.

43
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.060
Let's start up our application

44
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.010
using the command ng serve.

45
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.000
Let's head to a browser,

46
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.050
and let's navigate to localhost:4200.

47
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.000
We can now see our new homepage.

48
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.050
If you scroll down,

49
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.040
we can see the message app works.

50
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.000
This has been populated dynamically from angular JS2.
