00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:04.000
an application called Postman.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Postman is a GUI tool to make API development

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.050
faster and easier.

5
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.070
It can help you test, document,

6
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.090
and share your API endpoints.

7
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.070
In a browser, let's navigate to getpostman.com

Let's navigate to the Downloaded file,

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.020
Then, let's Double click on the Application.

14
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.040

15
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.060
you may be prompted to create an account.

16
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.010
On the left-hand side,

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.070

18
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.010
Let's click into the Collections tab,

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.010
and then click on the Add Collection button.

20
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.040
Let's name it Reservation.

21
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.070
Then, click Create.

22
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.030

Enter in http://localhost8080/room/reservation/v1,

24
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.070
and then add the parameter checkin, and let's set it to

25
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:23.080
2017-03-18, then Add a second parameter, Checkout,

26
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:31.080

27
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.050
On the right-hand side, let's navigate to the Save button,

28
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.020
and click on the Dropdown, and click Save As.

29
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.080
Let's clear out the Request Name field.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:48.030
Let's name the request Get available room reservations.

31
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.080
Then, let's Save it to the existing collection Reservation.

32
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.090
And click Save.

33
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.040
Next, let's make sure our application is running.

34
00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.050
So let's go back to clips.

35
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.050
Click on the Root Project directory,

36
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.050
click Run As, Spring Boot App.

37
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.060
Okay, so now that our application is started,

38
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.040
let's head back to Postman.

39
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.090

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.090
request, and click Send.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.050
and in the request body,

43
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.000
we have a empty reservation response.
