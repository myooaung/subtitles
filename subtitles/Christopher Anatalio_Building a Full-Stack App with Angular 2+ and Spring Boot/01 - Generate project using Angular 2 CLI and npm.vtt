00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:02.060
- [Instructor] Okay, now that we've a working REST API

2
00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.000
on the back end, let's start working on the front end.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.080
Let's open up a terminal, and do a global install

4
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.060
of the AngularJS 2 command line interface or CLI,

5
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:18.080
using the Node Package Manager or NPM.

6
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.070
Next, let's set up the front end, using the Angular CLI.

7
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.050
Let's go ahead and navigate to our project directory.

8
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.030
CD into source, CD into main.

9
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.010
Then, let's create a new directory called Webapp.

10
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.060
Next up, we will generate the base project,

11
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.040
using the Angular CLI command ng new.

12
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.020
Ng new will generate a project scaffold,

13
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.000
with everything you need to run AngularJS 2.

14
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.020
By default, ng new will initialize your project

15
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.080
as a Git Repository.

16
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.080
Since we want our Java Spring re: project directory

17
00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:01.010
to be a Git Repo, instead of the AngularJS 2 project route,

18
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.060
we will be passing in the flag skip-git.

19
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.060
Let's CD into the Webapp directory.

20
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.020
Next, let's run the ng new command,

21
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.030
passing in the name Angular2, and the flag skip-git.

22
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.080
Okay, now that we created the Angular2 application,

23
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.010
let's CD into the folder we just created.

24
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.010
Next, let's install Twitter Bootstrap three, using NPM.

25
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.030
Twitter Bootstap is a grid based UI component framework.

26
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.070
It will provide us with some good looking,

27
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.070
out of the box, UI components to use.

28
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.000
Don't worry, prior knowledge of this framework,

29
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.060
is not necessary, since we are just using

30
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.000
the basic pre-build components.

31
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.060
Finally, let's install Fuel UX.

32
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.000
Fuel UX extends Twitter Bootstrap,

33
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.080
and adds some additional UI components such as a datepicker.

34
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.090
Okay, now that we're all set up,

35
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.060
let's insure it starts up correctly,

36
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.040
using the Angular CLI command ng serve.

37
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.010
By default, ng serve will run the app

38
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.040
on local host on port 4200.

39
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.010
Okay, now that we're started up,

40
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.030
let's try to hit that endpoint in a browser.

41
00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.000
If you see that message, it means your app is running.

42
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Next up, let's work on customizing our UI.
