00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.030
- [Instructor] Let's talk about documenting your API.

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.070
Within Postman, you have the ability to export a collection.

3
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.070
If you mouse over your collection,

4
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.070
click on the elipses, click on export,

5
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.080
Collection v2, and export,

6
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.040
you can export your collection in JSON format.

7
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.060
There are many tools online

8
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.060
that allow you to document your API.

9
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.030
One example, is apimatic.io.

10
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:34.000
If you go to apimatic.io and sign up for a free account,

11
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.010
go to /transformer, click on convert now,

12
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.090
and upload your collection.

13
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.090
Add a file descriptor.

14
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.070
Let's select API Blueprint Format 1A,

15
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.010
and click convert now.

16
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.020
If you go to a site like apiary.io,

17
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.030
which also requires a free account,

18
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.060
if you open the file you downloaded,

19
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.080
copy the API blueprint,

20
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.020
and then paste it into your apiary,

21
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.000
you will then have a live documentation of your API,

22
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.090
which will describe each end point,

23
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.010
and also the required parameters.

24
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.080
So, for instance, we see our get,

25
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.020
our post, our put and our delete.

26
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.010
If you click on an end point,

27
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.080
such as get available rooms,

28
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.070
scroll down and click try,

29
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.030
it'll give you an example on how to call that end point.

30
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.020
Let's add in the check-in and check-out fields

31
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.080
and click call resource.

32
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.030
We got a 404 in this case,

33
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.090
because we don't have a hosted URL for our API.

34
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.050
But if we did, that'd be a good way to test it out.

35
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.040
The 1A format is pretty universal,

36
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.090
so you'll be able to use it on many sites

37
00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.090
other than apiary.io.

38
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.050
Swagger.io also provides hosted documentation.

39
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:12.050
If you go to apimatic and convert your Postman export

40
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.010
to a Swagger JSON or YAML,

41
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.000
you could also host it on SwaggerHub.
