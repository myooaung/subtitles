your development environment.

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.060
You will need to install node JS and Gradle

and execute the following command here.

11
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.050
Now that we have Brew installed,

12
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.080
let's make sure it is up to date.

13
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.010
Okay now let's verify it is configured correctly

14
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.010
by running Brew Doctor.

15
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.000
Okay it looks like we have Brew installed correctly.

16
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.010
Now, let's add it to the path.

17
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:52.020
Type in export path /usr/local/bin path.

18
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.050
Okay now that we have brew set up

19
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.050
let's install node JS using Brew.

20
00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.090
Type in brew install node.

21
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.070
Okay so now we have node installed.

22
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.050
Next let's install get

23
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.030
and then finally let's install Gradle.

24
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.000
