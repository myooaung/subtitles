00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.050
- [Instructor] Now let's create our Spring Boot project

2
00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.020
using Spring Initializer.

3
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.060
We will navigate to start.spring.io.

4
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:15.030
Select Gradle Project with the latest stable release.

5
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.020
Gradle is a build and dependency management tool

6
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.060
similar to Maven.

7
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.050
Gradle uses a Groovy DSL instead of XML.

8
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.010
This makes Gradle files less verbose,

9
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.070
more readable, and more scriptable.

10
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.080
For the Group field,

11
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.000
enter in communication.linkedin.learning.

12
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.040
Note that the names and folder structure I chose

13
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.090
are arbitrary.

14
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.000
You can choose your own names and folder structure,

15
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.090
and this will not impact the functionality of the project.

16
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.070
For the artifact name, enter in

17
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:59.010
linked-in-learning-full-stack-app-angular-spring-boot.

18
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.040
This artifact name will define the name of the

19
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.010
self executable JAR.

20
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.050
Next you want to click on Switch to the full version.

21
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.060
For their description, enter in Building a Full-stack App

22
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.010
with AngularJS 2 and Spring Boot.

23
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.020
Next we will add the following dependencies.

24
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.050
Web, JPA, and H2.

25
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.060
Web will allow us to define our end points

26
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.060
using a annotation-based system.

27
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.010
JPA will allow us to implement JPA-based repositories

28
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.010
to interact with the data.

29
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.080
H2 is a really fast embedded database

30
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.000
that will start up when you start your application.

31
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.060
Next let's click Generate Project.

32
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.070
This will generate a Zip file that will

33
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.050
automatically be downloaded.

34
00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.080
Extract the Zip folder into your projects directory.

35
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.030
Let's grab the file we just downloaded.

36
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.000
Let's copy the file, navigate to our home directory,

37
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.020
create a new folder, rename it to EclipseProjects.

38
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.000
Let's go into that directory and paste in our Zip file

39
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and then extract it.
