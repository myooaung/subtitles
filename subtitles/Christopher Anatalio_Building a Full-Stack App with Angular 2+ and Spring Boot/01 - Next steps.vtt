00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.070
- [Instructor] Okay, we have built a fully functional

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.000
full stack application together.

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
To learn more on your own, you can implement the PUT

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.010
and DELETE endpoints.

5
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.000
You can also experiment with client and server side

6
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.070
filtering in our GET available rooms endpoint.

7
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.060
For example, you could filter on fields such as price.

8
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.050
In this course, we only touched on unit testing.

9
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.090
However, it is very important.

10
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.080
You want to have automated testing in place for all major

11
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.050
functionality.

12
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.050
You want to be sure to test your Java code as well as

13
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.000
your AngularJS 2 code.

14
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.060
Back-end testing frameworks we used include JUnit

15
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.040
and Rest Assured.

16
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.040
Testing frameworks on the front-end provided by AngularJS 2

17
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.090
are Karma, Jasmine and Selenium.

18
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.040
You have many types of testing.

19
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.000
The most basic type is unit testing.

20
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.020
Examples of unit testing frameworks are JUnit, Karma

21
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.080
and Jasmine.

22
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.040
Examples of integration testing frameworks

23
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.070
are the spring test runner.

24
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.070
An example of a end-to-end testing framework is Selenium.

25
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.070
There are lots of great courses on testing here

26
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.030
on LinkedIn Learning, so go check them out.

27
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.070
As we have learned, Spring Boot and AngularJS 2

28
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.060
are powerful and flexible tools.

29
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.000
So I recommend you get out there and build something.
