00:02.410 --> 00:05.520
We want to learn more about the DAX basics,

00:05.530 --> 00:08.200
let's do this in the next videos.

00:08.290 --> 00:15.430
So here we are in the DIM-AgeGroup table and I selected the column that we just created with that two

00:15.430 --> 00:17.200
concatenate formulas.

00:17.200 --> 00:23.290
Now if we look at the syntax of such a DAX formula, we can see that the first part, so in front of

00:23.290 --> 00:26.510
the equals sign is simply the name of that formula

00:26.680 --> 00:33.460
and by that, the name of the column in case of a calculated column which we have right here and which

00:33.460 --> 00:36.010
we'll talk about in the next videos.

00:36.230 --> 00:40.210
Now after the equals sign which is right here, you can find the function,

00:40.210 --> 00:42.000
in that case the concatenate

00:42.010 --> 00:43.420
and here we have the reference,

00:43.420 --> 00:46.280
in that case it's a column reference.

00:46.320 --> 00:52.450
Now we could keep talking about the syntax and how such a formula works but I think it makes more sense

00:52.720 --> 00:58.750
if we now take a look at the official documentation of DAX formula because this will allow you to see

00:58.990 --> 01:04.560
how many formulas we actually have and for how many areas we can apply those formulas,

01:04.780 --> 01:08.560
because of that, let's change to the official documentation right now.

01:08.830 --> 01:13.310
So this is the official DAX function reference documentation of Microsoft

01:13.450 --> 01:19.930
and if you look at the first sentence, you can see that we have more than 200 functions used in DAX formulas

01:20.230 --> 01:23.610
which is quite a lot. To get a better overview of that,

01:23.680 --> 01:24.820
you can click onto that

01:24.850 --> 01:26.110
arrow right here

01:26.860 --> 01:31.820
and then you can see that you have these functions categorized to different topics.

01:32.050 --> 01:37.480
So you have date and time functions, time intelligence, mathematical functions, other functions, statistical

01:37.480 --> 01:39.760
functions and many more.

01:39.760 --> 01:44.980
As we cannot cover all of those topics throughout that course, I think it makes sense if we just take a look

01:45.040 --> 01:51.320
at a basic formula and see what else we can do to get a basic understanding of the DAX formulas.

01:51.340 --> 01:55.340
Now let's start with the date and time functions maybe, if we click right here

01:56.550 --> 02:01.380
and here we have different date and time functions for different topics.

02:01.390 --> 02:04.790
Now a good thing that we could do is for instance a calendar function,

02:04.860 --> 02:06.220
let's click that

02:06.510 --> 02:11.200
and this function allows us to simply create a calendar in Power BI.

02:11.460 --> 02:12.870
I think this is a good idea

02:13.050 --> 02:18.060
and if you look down at the syntax, you can simply see that we have to write the calendar function,

02:18.360 --> 02:20.490
then the start date and the end date

02:20.700 --> 02:27.020
but if you scroll down a little bit more, you can see in the example what this formula should look right

02:27.060 --> 02:33.750
in the end. Now I think the best thing is if we just go back to our project and see how we can apply

02:33.750 --> 02:37.020
that formula and how we can create such a calendar, right?

02:37.020 --> 02:38.070
So let's do that

02:38.400 --> 02:44.640
and here I am back in the project and as we don't need a calendar in our project actually because we

02:44.640 --> 02:49.710
only have annual data, so we don't need exact dates and we cannot create that because we don't have

02:49.960 --> 02:50.550
daily data

02:50.550 --> 02:56.090
for instance, we could simply create a new table and create that calendar in this table.

02:56.490 --> 03:02.130
So to create a new table in the data model, you'll simply go to the modeling ribbon right here and press

03:02.220 --> 03:04.360
new table, like this

03:04.650 --> 03:08.910
and now you see already that you can write a formula up here in the formula bar.

03:08.910 --> 03:15.670
Now let's first rename that formula and call it calendar maybe, calendar like this

03:15.670 --> 03:17.570
and now after the equals sign,

03:17.610 --> 03:19.600
well we have to write a function

03:19.800 --> 03:25.080
and you remember in the documentation, we saw that this function would be called calendar.

03:25.180 --> 03:26.220
Now let's write

03:26.220 --> 03:35.310
CAL and you can see that we now have three functions that refer or that start with CAL.

03:35.510 --> 03:38.900
Now we will use the second function the calendar function

03:39.200 --> 03:44.670
and by the way I'm navigating through the functions using the up and down arrow keys on the keyboard.

03:44.990 --> 03:49.430
Now as soon as we selected the function that we want to have and this is the calendar function, we can

03:49.430 --> 03:51.130
simply press tab right now

03:51.470 --> 03:55.430
and now we have to define the start date and the end date

03:55.430 --> 03:59.650
and you remember, in the documentation we saw that we have to write date first.

03:59.690 --> 04:02.430
So let's write date, we can find it

04:02.450 --> 04:07.180
so we can scroll down and press tab again and now define the year,

04:07.430 --> 04:11.210
let's say we want to start in 2014,

04:11.270 --> 04:17.440
now define the month, let's say January and the day, let's say the first of January. Let's close the bracket

04:17.450 --> 04:23.830
then and now write a comma and define the end date and to define the end date, we simply have to write

04:23.840 --> 04:25.030
date again,

04:25.200 --> 04:27.590
select it down here and press tab,

04:27.840 --> 04:36.270
now write the year, let's say 2016, the December 31st for instance, close the bracket.

04:36.850 --> 04:44.450
If we now press enter, then we can see that Power BI automatically created a calendar starting in January

04:44.450 --> 04:49.470
2014 and ending in December 2016.

04:49.870 --> 04:55.280
Now that we got that, if you look at the name of that column, you can see that this is called date and

04:55.280 --> 04:59.950
the function value calendar is referring to the whole calendar table that we created right now.

05:00.230 --> 05:06.020
So let's change that by clicking on to date two times and change the name to date

05:06.230 --> 05:09.770
daily maybe, like this and press enter.

05:10.070 --> 05:17.160
Now we got that, we might want to format that column because we have the date and the time in here but

05:17.150 --> 05:18.690
we only need the date actually,

05:18.920 --> 05:23.570
so the first thing we have to do is we have to go to the modeling ribbon and work on that formatting

05:23.570 --> 05:29.390
area and we can cannot do that at the moment because Power BI does not recognize the date in our date

05:29.410 --> 05:30.500
daily column.

05:30.500 --> 05:37.640
So to change that, we can simply click onto the calendar and re-open that to make sure that it now identified

05:37.640 --> 05:39.990
the dates correctly, which it did right now.

05:40.310 --> 05:46.640
So if you click on to a data type right here and select dates, then you can see that this changed already

05:46.700 --> 05:52.190
a little bit but we still have our day in here and I don't want that,

05:52.290 --> 05:57.830
I only want to have the date without the weekday. To change that also, you can go to format right

05:57.830 --> 06:04.760
there, click onto that button, go to date and time and now select the way you want the data to be displayed,

06:04.760 --> 06:11.290
in this case I want to have it like that and now that you can see that we have a column with the formatted

06:11.290 --> 06:12.260
dates already,

06:12.310 --> 06:14.020
this was quite easy actually, right

06:14.320 --> 06:15.530
but we can do more.

06:15.880 --> 06:18.410
Let's create another column by clicking right here

06:18.970 --> 06:20.490
and let's call that column month

06:24.690 --> 06:34.310
like this and if you now write those square brackets like this and write date or D, then you can see

06:34.310 --> 06:37.370
that you can refer to that date daily column,

06:37.670 --> 06:44.060
if you then press tab, then you can select what information you want to retrieve out of that first column.

06:44.510 --> 06:50.870
Now in our case, we want to have the months, so we go down to month, press tab and now press enter

06:51.410 --> 06:57.940
and now we can see that we immediately retrieved the month out of our date column in the first column.

06:57.980 --> 06:58.850
This is great,

06:58.880 --> 07:02.710
let's maybe add one more column just that you see how this works.

07:02.960 --> 07:05.540
So we can add another column, a new column right here

07:06.520 --> 07:13.420
and now call that quarter and you might already know how this works right now. We simply provide the

07:13.430 --> 07:22.900
square brackets, type D, press tab and now move down to quarter, press tab again and press enter 

07:23.240 --> 07:31.130
and now you have a list with all the dates by month and by quarter and of course we could play around with

07:31.130 --> 07:32.050
that even more

07:32.210 --> 07:37.080
but as I said for our project, we don't need that type of information.

07:37.130 --> 07:42.200
So the important thing for you at the moment is that you know how this works and that you created your

07:42.230 --> 07:44.220
first DAX formulas right now.

07:44.540 --> 07:50.930
However as we don't need that data in our model, we can simply click right onto that calendar here and

07:50.930 --> 07:52.730
press hide and report view.

07:52.940 --> 07:53.920
You know what this means,

07:54.020 --> 07:59.250
now we cannot see that data in our report and this is fine because we don't need it.

07:59.620 --> 08:04.610
Now that you wrote the first formulas, you might want to know more like what else can we do with that

08:04.610 --> 08:07.050
DAX formulas and we will take a look at that

08:07.070 --> 08:09.200
in another example in the next video.
