00:02.540 --> 00:10.160
We applied a lot of steps to clean our queries, time to format the data format of that queries correctly,

00:10.570 --> 00:12.050
let's see how we can do that.

00:12.410 --> 00:15.450
So let's move to the first column first

00:15.490 --> 00:22.730
where we will start with our data formatting and if we select that, we see that this column should be formatted

00:22.820 --> 00:26.450
as a whole number because the country ID is a number

00:26.870 --> 00:32.900
but if you look into that column, to that little symbol right here, you see that this ABC is probably

00:32.900 --> 00:34.300
not a whole number

00:34.700 --> 00:40.330
and if we left-click that, we see that it's actually text as it is displayed right here.

00:40.340 --> 00:41.610
Now we should change that

00:41.690 --> 00:50.010
and again, this format changing step is again something that can be done in multiple ways in Power BI desktop.

00:50.020 --> 00:53.300
Now let me show you some of the ways how we can do that.

00:53.720 --> 00:57.270
So we have the text that should be turned into a whole number

00:57.470 --> 01:02.810
and the most intuitive thing is to simply press whole number right here

01:02.810 --> 01:06.040
and as you can see, we turned that text,

01:06.110 --> 01:12.470
so we had that ABC before into a whole number and we now also see that again in the applied steps, right

01:12.470 --> 01:12.860
here.

01:14.040 --> 01:15.980
So this is one way on how we can do that.

01:17.140 --> 01:23.230
If we go to the third column because the second column as text is correct and select that, we can also

01:23.230 --> 01:29.510
go to the transform ribbon right here and select the data type option

01:29.590 --> 01:31.020
we can see right here

01:31.330 --> 01:37.110
and if we select that, we see that we actually have the same menu that we had before but without the

01:37.120 --> 01:40.410
symbols but the functionality is the same.

01:40.420 --> 01:47.100
So if I select a whole number right here, we see that the symbol changed and that the formatting changed.

01:47.140 --> 01:48.390
So this is good,

01:48.400 --> 01:53.740
let's now continue our format change and we see that the age group is fine,

01:53.740 --> 01:58.310
this is a text but as it just defines a range, we can leave it like that

01:58.510 --> 02:02.230
but the last three columns are formatted wrong.

02:02.230 --> 02:07.700
Now we could of course click all of the columns and then change the format manually

02:08.020 --> 02:09.760
or we can do something else.

02:10.150 --> 02:15.940
Let's first select all of the columns by selecting the first column, press and hold shift and select

02:15.940 --> 02:19.800
the last column to select the whole range of those columns

02:20.020 --> 02:23.450
and if we now go to the transform ribbon where we already are

02:23.680 --> 02:26.870
and then we see that detect data type option,

02:27.190 --> 02:34.270
this let's Power BI automatically detect and select the data type of the columns you selected.

02:34.570 --> 02:41.160
Let's press that and we see that the format of the data was changed.

02:41.190 --> 02:50.420
Now this is nice but now we have to do something else because now we changed data formats and we still

02:50.420 --> 02:57.230
have to make sure that Power BI desktop doesn't create any errors because it might not have been able

02:57.560 --> 03:03.080
to really transform all of the rows into the data format that we selected.

03:03.360 --> 03:10.380
Now let's see if that worked correctly and to do that, we have to go to the home ribbon,

03:10.460 --> 03:17.300
now go to close and apply but again, select the lower part to be able to specify what we want because

03:17.330 --> 03:19.060
we can apply the changes,

03:19.070 --> 03:25.220
this will apply that format change to the entire data that we have right here or we can close and apply,

03:25.340 --> 03:32.030
then we would apply the changes and leave the query editor or we can just close that, then we would simply

03:32.030 --> 03:37.220
go to the Data-Model and close the query editor without that changes being applied.

03:37.220 --> 03:43.550
Now we have to press apply of course because we want to stay in the query editor and see if our changes

03:43.550 --> 03:43.980
worked

03:44.060 --> 03:51.320
so let's press apply, now this takes a few seconds and we see that we have an error.

03:51.390 --> 03:55.760
Now let's see what happened by clicking on the view errors

03:55.960 --> 03:58.550
and now we see that we have a new group right here,

03:58.560 --> 04:06.560
we will talk about that soon and that we have errors in our dataset, in the population combined dataset,

04:06.670 --> 04:12.130
so we had some data which were wrong and which could not be converted by then.

04:12.310 --> 04:18.850
So we should get rid of those data and an easy way to do that is if we go back to the population combined

04:18.910 --> 04:27.910
query and now you remember, we could not use that reduce errors function in the initial cleaning of the

04:27.910 --> 04:31.170
second query because we had N/A's but not N/A's

04:31.180 --> 04:37.750
in terms of an error that could be identified by Power BI desktop. Now we formatted the data and now

04:37.750 --> 04:42.440
Power BI desktop is able to identify that rows as errors,

04:42.670 --> 04:44.080
so let's try that.

04:44.230 --> 04:49.290
So we are in the home ribbon, go to remove rows and remove errors,

04:49.510 --> 04:50.830
let's see how this works.

04:50.890 --> 04:54.990
So we press it and now if we now press apply again,

04:55.090 --> 04:57.130
then this should be fine.

04:57.340 --> 05:07.500
Let's do that, now again takes a few seconds and we see that we don't have any errors now,

05:07.800 --> 05:14.250
so this worked. Let's now delete that group with the error because we don't need that by simply selecting

05:14.250 --> 05:18.420
it and pressing delete and again delete,

05:18.540 --> 05:23.850
so we will talk about that groups in a few seconds as I just said and select the population combined

05:24.030 --> 05:26.080
dataset again

05:26.670 --> 05:31.610
and now I want to make sure of something else because we had that errors

05:31.700 --> 05:33.560
but remember back a few minutes,

05:33.630 --> 05:38.030
we also saw that we have blank rows in that year column,

05:38.070 --> 05:43.080
let's see if these are still here and let's filter them in case this is true.

05:43.170 --> 05:45.270
So I'm selecting that error right here,

05:46.230 --> 05:53.280
press load more and wait a few seconds and now we see we have that nulls and we don't need that nulls

05:53.310 --> 05:57.010
because we want a clean database for our data model,

05:57.240 --> 06:01.020
so let's unselect that nulls and press OK

06:02.680 --> 06:11.860
and now we made sure that we have a clean dataset without errors and without any blank rows or null values.

06:11.860 --> 06:17.460
So as we did this, we now formatted the data and we made a big step because of that

06:17.740 --> 06:22.430
but still, I see things that I don't like. What that is,

06:22.690 --> 06:24.290
let's see that in the next video.
