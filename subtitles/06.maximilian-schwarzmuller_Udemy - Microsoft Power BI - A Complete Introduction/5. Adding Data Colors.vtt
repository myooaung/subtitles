00:02.570 --> 00:07.900
In the last lecture, I talked about the color saturation which allows us to change the color of our different

00:07.950 --> 00:10.140
bars right here in the chart.

00:10.190 --> 00:14.700
Now as you saw in the pop-up window and also if you click onto the chart right here,

00:14.890 --> 00:18.430
well this color saturation field apparently is gone.

00:18.430 --> 00:24.670
The reason for that is that Power BI gets constantly updated by Microsoft, it's updated, improved,

00:24.730 --> 00:30.440
new features are added and other features, older features are not available anymore.

00:30.670 --> 00:34.520
That's not totally true to be honest because the color saturation is still here,

00:34.540 --> 00:38.420
it just can be found in a different location right here in Power BI.

00:38.770 --> 00:43.780
So for us, this means if you want to change the color of our bars, we can simply click right here onto

00:43.780 --> 00:45.800
our format menu, right there

00:46.090 --> 00:48.650
and here we can find the data colors menu,

00:48.700 --> 00:56.170
this one. If we click onto that, you can see that we can change the overall color of our different bars

00:56.380 --> 00:58.790
or go to the advanced controls,

00:58.810 --> 01:00.600
we'll have a look at that in a few seconds.

01:00.610 --> 01:05.130
Let's first click onto the default control and change it to red for example and as you can see,

01:05.200 --> 01:06.580
no big surprise here,

01:06.590 --> 01:10.810
the color of all our bars inside our visual changed.

01:10.810 --> 01:13.600
Now let's switch it back to the third one right here

01:13.600 --> 01:19.330
and let's now select show all right here because this would allow us to change the color of each bar in a chart

01:19.420 --> 01:20.340
individually.

01:20.560 --> 01:25.000
For example, we could go to Africa right here and switch it to yellow, like that,

01:25.000 --> 01:30.780
so with that, we could change the color individually for each single bar in our chart.

01:30.820 --> 01:36.670
I'd stick to the default value though, like that because actually I would like to change the colors automatically

01:36.880 --> 01:39.460
depending on a certain value.

01:39.460 --> 01:45.640
Now this sounds kind of strange but if you go to the advanced controls right here, then you can see

01:45.700 --> 01:52.450
what I mean by that because in this menu, we can now change the color of different bars in our chart

01:52.630 --> 01:54.490
depending of certain parameters.

01:54.490 --> 01:56.460
Now I will not dive into all of these now, 

01:56.500 --> 01:58.480
just into the most important ones,

01:58.570 --> 02:04.810
so let's get started by making sure that we format our bars by the color scale because that's what we wanted

02:04.810 --> 02:05.380
to do,

02:05.380 --> 02:10.020
remember we talked about color saturation in the older version of Power BI.

02:10.510 --> 02:16.430
Now we can base our colors, so that color change of our charts on a field right here.

02:16.750 --> 02:19.440
The default is the sum of the population right here,

02:19.450 --> 02:21.460
that's the default value that is selected.

02:21.460 --> 02:29.010
This simply means that our colors will change depending on the population number in a certain region,

02:29.080 --> 02:35.560
so if Asia has a higher population than Europe which is normally the case, then Asia would have a different

02:35.560 --> 02:38.030
color than the chart for Europe,

02:38.200 --> 02:39.440
that's what is meant by that.

02:39.490 --> 02:43.410
So you can click on to this and also select other values for that,

02:43.420 --> 02:50.020
this could be for example, let's say the female population, just as an example, we'll stick to the total

02:50.020 --> 02:51.350
population right here though,

02:51.610 --> 02:55.340
so let's click right here once again to let this menu disappear.

02:55.690 --> 03:01.390
Here we can define how this color change should be calculated, so what this color change should be based

03:01.390 --> 03:01.950
on,

03:02.080 --> 03:04.900
in our case it's the sum of the population value,

03:05.020 --> 03:08.820
you could also take something like the average, the minimum, the maximum and so on,

03:08.850 --> 03:11.430
also something we don't dive too deep into here right now,

03:11.470 --> 03:13.050
it's more about the general logic,

03:13.050 --> 03:15.550
so for us the sum is totally sufficient.

03:15.730 --> 03:22.090
Here we have the default formatting which simply allows us to define how missing values or gaps in

03:22.090 --> 03:23.430
our data should be displayed,

03:23.440 --> 03:26.680
so these could be displayed as well not formatted values at all,

03:26.750 --> 03:33.280
zero or with a specific color, I'll stick to a zero right here and then we can finally define the color

03:33.370 --> 03:39.310
range right here. As you can see for the lowest value, we now have a default value of red which I would

03:39.310 --> 03:43.720
like to change to this lighter, well blue, let's call it blue right here

03:44.290 --> 03:47.280
and then we can also define the maximum maximum, so our highest value.

03:47.290 --> 03:48.110
This is right here,

03:48.160 --> 03:55.890
this darker blue color. You can also change the criteria for that color change, so it could be the lowest

03:55.890 --> 03:57.270
value or a specific number,

03:57.270 --> 04:00.030
same thing is true for the highest value, could also be a number

04:00.180 --> 04:03.080
but in our case, this is actually what I would like to achieve.

04:03.240 --> 04:08.400
So this basically means that if we have a higher amount of the population in a certain region, then the

04:08.400 --> 04:09.300
color gets darker,

04:09.360 --> 04:13.190
if we have a lower amount of the population, our color gets lighter.

04:13.200 --> 04:19.350
So I felt like OK now, you can see that the color of our bars in the chart changed automatically,

04:19.410 --> 04:21.600
so Asia has the highest population,

04:21.630 --> 04:27.570
so we have the darkest color and Oceania or South America for example, North America have a lighter color

04:27.600 --> 04:29.850
because the population is less right there.

04:30.210 --> 04:36.330
So this is the updated color saturation right, so you have lots of options, how you can change the color of

04:36.330 --> 04:42.000
the different bars in our charts which again helps us to make our visuals, our reports a bit more individual,

04:42.240 --> 04:46.550
a bit more customized you could say. Of course this doesn't only work for the regions here,

04:46.800 --> 04:53.110
if we go back right here to our fields ribbon, then we could also say that we don't want to display

04:53.190 --> 04:59.760
our data by the different region names but we could also say that we go right here to our DIM-Region

05:00.260 --> 05:06.220
field right here and drag the country as the axis value. If we now remove the region name,

05:06.330 --> 05:09.470
we can now see that the formating also works on country level,

05:09.480 --> 05:13.160
so if you go right here, you can see that the color gets a bit lighter

05:13.260 --> 05:19.200
the less population a specific country has. Now of course we could add a broader color range right here

05:19.380 --> 05:21.670
to make this differentiation a bit more clear

05:21.810 --> 05:24.630
but the general logic works totally fine.

05:24.630 --> 05:29.460
Now let's change it back to region name though because we want to stick to these data and let's get rid of

05:29.460 --> 05:30.370
the country

05:30.810 --> 05:35.730
and with that, we got our chart back which looks nice but it wasn't really comfortable you could say

05:35.910 --> 05:40.480
because I had to drag the country right here as our axis,

05:40.560 --> 05:45.670
then I had to delete the region name and then I had to drag the region name back into the country.

05:46.020 --> 05:50.860
Wouldn't it be easier if we could kind of combine these two features in one single chart,

05:51.000 --> 05:56.190
so if I would be able to switch between the region level view and the country view, well as I said in one

05:56.190 --> 05:57.130
single chart?

05:57.450 --> 06:00.470
Well the good thing is this is also possible in Power BI,

06:00.660 --> 06:03.180
so we'll have to look at that feature in the next lecture.
