00:02.840 --> 00:06.800
We want to create an app workspace to collaborate with our colleagues,

00:07.190 --> 00:08.200
let's do that now.

00:09.220 --> 00:16.300
So we are back again in our Power BI service overview and now we go to the workspace section, right

00:16.300 --> 00:16.700
here

00:17.810 --> 00:22.820
and as you can see, at the moment we only have one workspace, my workspace

00:23.300 --> 00:26.790
and down here we can create an app workspace.

00:26.930 --> 00:32.440
So this workspace that we need to be able to collaborate with other people in our organization.

00:32.780 --> 00:35.900
So let's click on create app workspace then right here.

00:37.060 --> 00:39.580
Now we have to define a name of our group,

00:39.580 --> 00:40.430
let's name it

00:40.470 --> 00:44.480
test-collab for collaborate,

00:44.560 --> 00:46.060
we got that.

00:46.210 --> 00:51.370
Now we have to decide if this is private or public.

00:51.460 --> 00:53.790
I would say we leave it as private, right here

00:54.760 --> 00:55.710
and let's scroll down

00:55.960 --> 01:00.010
and now we want to decide what the people can do in that group.

01:00.010 --> 01:06.610
Well I would say that members can edit that because we want to collaborate in that file, so we can set

01:06.610 --> 01:13.420
it too here and now you have to add the e-mail addresses of your group members.

01:13.450 --> 01:16.320
I will do that right now and you can do the same,

01:16.390 --> 01:19.280
so I added Maximillian right here and press add,

01:19.750 --> 01:21.970
now you can see that Max is a member of that group

01:22.090 --> 01:23.470
and if I press save now,

01:26.270 --> 01:29.650
then we can see that we have a new app workspace right here.

01:29.960 --> 01:31.240
And we selected that already,

01:31.280 --> 01:36.800
so if I clicked right here, then we are in that new workspace that we created.

01:36.800 --> 01:43.360
Now if we click right here, you can see that this workspace is empty of course because previously, we

01:43.360 --> 01:45.720
work in our private workspace,

01:45.740 --> 01:48.180
now we work in our app workspace.

01:48.350 --> 01:54.200
So the first thing we have to do in this app workspace, we have to reconnect our app workspace or our

01:54.270 --> 01:59.890
Power BI service application with the Power BI Desktop file. We know how to do that,

01:59.900 --> 02:06.310
so we simply click onto files and get, select our local fire right now,

02:06.690 --> 02:13.420
press right here and open and we now got the same structure that we had before.

02:13.540 --> 02:15.260
Let me maybe close that right here.

02:15.610 --> 02:18.260
So we have the dataset right there,

02:19.360 --> 02:26.620
we have the report right here with the same visualizations of course and we have the empty dashboard,

02:26.710 --> 02:27.370
right there.

02:28.600 --> 02:33.150
Now let's maybe quickly pin one visual to that dashboard.

02:33.150 --> 02:42.220
So we go to report right here, select that chart maybe and press pin right here and we would like

02:42.220 --> 02:44.050
to pin it to the existing dashboard.

02:44.050 --> 02:44.910
This is fine,

02:44.950 --> 02:46.700
so let's press pin right there

02:47.780 --> 02:54.390
and close that message again, go to the dashboard and see that we have this information now in our

02:54.720 --> 02:57.130
dashboard in the app workspace.

02:57.270 --> 03:00.990
That's the important difference to my workspace that we had before

03:01.740 --> 03:06.310
and Maximillian can now also edit that visualization if he wants to.

03:06.480 --> 03:11.770
So he's free to work in that workspace just the way we saw it in the personal workspace before

03:11.970 --> 03:15.000
but now we can collaborate with two or more people

03:15.150 --> 03:21.990
and if we want to see how many group members you actually have in your app workspace, then simply go to

03:22.080 --> 03:26.040
work spaces right here and next to the workspace name,

03:26.040 --> 03:32.010
so right here, you can find those dots and if you click onto those, then you can either leave the group

03:32.160 --> 03:37.900
which doesn't make a lot of sense right now or you can edit the group, like this. And then you can see

03:37.900 --> 03:39.190
what the group looks like,

03:39.190 --> 03:40.840
so what the settings are like

03:40.990 --> 03:44.750
and then you can also view the group and you can see the members of the group,

03:44.830 --> 03:48.270
in that case it's me and Maximillian. We know that,

03:48.310 --> 03:53.900
so we can press cancel right here and go back to our dashboard maybe.

03:54.230 --> 03:57.030
Now we have an app workspace, right

03:57.110 --> 04:02.450
and let's assume we worked together on this beautiful dashboard and we now want to share this dashboard

04:02.450 --> 04:07.520
with other people and by sharing, I mean that they shouldn't be able to edit that but they simply want

04:07.520 --> 04:09.410
to see the results in the end,

04:09.950 --> 04:14.960
so we have to create an app, that's why we have that app option right here.

04:16.150 --> 04:22.000
Let's see how we can create such an app and how we can then share our content with other people in the

04:22.000 --> 04:22.850
next video.
