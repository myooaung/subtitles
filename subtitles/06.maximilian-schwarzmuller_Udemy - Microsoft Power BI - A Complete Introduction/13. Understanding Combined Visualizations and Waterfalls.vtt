Time to show you the last two visualizations in that module, combined charts and bridges,

00:10.320 --> 00:12.010
let's start.

00:12.230 --> 00:17.290
So the first thing I want to do is I want to separate our cards from the two visualizations

00:17.300 --> 00:24.520
we will create in this video. To do that, we can go to the home ribbon and select shapes and maybe select

00:24.520 --> 00:25.440
a line.

00:25.640 --> 00:33.400
We learned that in the interface video, position it right here right, click right there and increase it and maybe drag it to the left

00:33.410 --> 00:34.470
a little bit.

00:34.520 --> 00:35.810
Now we get that,

00:35.810 --> 00:42.840
so I want to show you combined charts and I will use the line and cluster column chart,

00:42.940 --> 00:48.980
so this is this one right here. Let me click that, position it right here,

00:49.180 --> 00:52.190
increase the size a little bit like that

00:52.450 --> 00:55.530
and now we have to bring that chart to life.

00:55.540 --> 01:00.870
What I want to display in that chart actually, I want to show you the development of the total population

01:00.880 --> 01:06.530
again as columns and I want to show you the share of the female population,

01:06.670 --> 01:12.480
so our measure as a line chart and everything combined in that single visualization.

01:12.790 --> 01:14.890
Let's see how this works.

01:14.890 --> 01:18.030
So the first thing we have to decide is the shared axis,

01:18.250 --> 01:21.300
well one thing both will have in common is the year,

01:21.590 --> 01:27.200
so let's go to the FACT-Population table, select the year and drag it right there.

01:29.470 --> 01:32.100
So far this doesn't help a lot,

01:32.110 --> 01:39.280
the next thing we have to decide is the column values and let's say I want to display the population in

01:39.280 --> 01:40.250
different columns,

01:40.450 --> 01:45.480
so it might make sense to drag the population to this field. So I'm selecting it right here and drag

01:45.480 --> 01:46.280
it right there.

01:47.300 --> 01:49.330
Now this looks good already, right,

01:49.370 --> 01:54.080
the only thing that's missing is the share of the female population

01:54.350 --> 01:59.540
and we can define that when we select a dataset for the line values,

01:59.690 --> 02:03.260
so right here because we want to display it as a line.

02:03.260 --> 02:11.070
Now if I take our population share measure and drag it right here, then we're already done with our chart.

02:11.540 --> 02:17.440
The only thing that I don't like is the scaling of that second y-axis because it starts up here,

02:17.540 --> 02:19.130
so with the almost 50%

02:19.250 --> 02:23.320
but this is quite misleading actually. To change that,

02:23.390 --> 02:32.180
we simply select a visualization, go to the format area right here, press that, now go to y-axis and now

02:32.180 --> 02:36.920
we have to be careful because we have two y-axis, the y-axis column,

02:36.920 --> 02:38.040
this one right here

02:38.880 --> 02:43.950
and if we scroll down, we have the y-axis line, that one right here

02:44.250 --> 02:47.610
and we want to change the y-axis of the line,

02:47.640 --> 02:55.490
so we have to select this one and now define the start at 0.4955 because it's a percentage

02:56.370 --> 03:00.490
and the end maybe at 0.505,

03:01.780 --> 03:04.040
yes I think this looks better.

03:04.400 --> 03:05.890
So we can close that now

03:06.380 --> 03:10.720
and now we can see that we quickly created a combined chart.

03:11.210 --> 03:19.070
Let me show you one last visualization then, the waterfall chart or I also refer to that as bridge chart sometimes.

03:19.130 --> 03:25.230
So to find that, you click simply right here and it says waterfall chart in Power BI,

03:25.370 --> 03:34.540
so we click that, now drag it right here and right there and in this chart, you only have to define

03:34.600 --> 03:40.480
two things, the category and the y-axis. The category in our case,

03:40.480 --> 03:42.590
well this could be our category,

03:42.640 --> 03:50.590
so our age group category, let's select that. If we go to the the DIM-AgeGroup table, go to category and drag it right

03:50.590 --> 03:51.060
here.

03:52.510 --> 03:56.650
Now we don't see a lot of things because we have to define the y-axis

03:57.010 --> 04:00.950
and in this case, the y-axis is again the population.

04:00.970 --> 04:09.370
So if you scroll down, go to population and drag it right here, then you can see that we quickly created a waterfall

04:09.400 --> 04:09.910
chart.

04:11.030 --> 04:12.340
So this is it,

04:12.380 --> 04:17.540
those were the last two visualizations that I wanted to show you in this module.

04:17.570 --> 04:24.630
This means we are now ready for a module summary and we will do that in the next video.
