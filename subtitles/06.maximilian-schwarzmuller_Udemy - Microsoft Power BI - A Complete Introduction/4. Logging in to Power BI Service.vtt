00:02.730 --> 00:06.680
Time for our first Power BI service login.

00:06.750 --> 00:09.940
So this is the landing page of Power BI service,

00:09.990 --> 00:14.100
if you have already an account like I have, you can simply sign-in right here,

00:14.430 --> 00:18.200
if you don't have an account, simply create a new one quickly and sign-in

00:18.210 --> 00:22.460
then. There is only one important thing that you have to know.

00:22.620 --> 00:28.520
If you only have a private domain like a gmail address, you cannot sign into Power BI service,

00:28.800 --> 00:34.700
so you need a work or a school or university e-mail domain to be able to use Power BI.

00:35.310 --> 00:39.220
As soon as you get that, you can simply click onto sign-in right here,

00:41.850 --> 00:44.820
then you can select the account that you want to sign-in with,

00:44.820 --> 00:46.250
in my case this is the first one

00:46.260 --> 00:50.250
right here, then enter your password which I will not show you right now

00:50.580 --> 00:52.260
and then we are here.

00:52.260 --> 00:57.180
So this is the first time we logged into Power BI service together.

00:57.300 --> 01:02.800
Now we could start directly and think about how to get data and how to work with that

01:03.090 --> 01:09.510
but I think again, it makes more sense if we take a first closer look at the interface of Power BI

01:09.510 --> 01:10.450
service.

01:10.710 --> 01:12.710
Let's do that in the next video.
