Welcome to this module, a really important module because we now finished the work in our Power BI

00:09.630 --> 00:11.100
desktop application,

00:11.100 --> 00:13.650
so we have our final report.

00:13.830 --> 00:17.240
Now we have to think about the question, what now?

00:17.640 --> 00:23.960
And depending on the answer on this question, we might have to use other BI tools like Power BI

00:23.970 --> 00:27.620
service or even the Power BI mobile apps.

00:27.840 --> 00:32.830
Let's see what we can do right now and how these tools work in this module.
