00:02.480 --> 00:06.520
We now want to publish our app, let's do this.

00:06.990 --> 00:13.560
So I am back in the app workspace, so in our test-collab workspace and now we want to share the information

00:13.560 --> 00:17.610
we have right here with other people. To do this, well

00:17.670 --> 00:22.860
we have to publish our app and if we click onto that button in the upper right part of the screen, this

00:22.860 --> 00:24.540
might be a good idea to do this.

00:24.750 --> 00:26.610
Let's press that

00:26.610 --> 00:29.200
and as you can see, we have a new menu right here.

00:29.370 --> 00:31.840
Well let's add a description first right here,

00:31.950 --> 00:39.220
so test app maybe, here we can change the background color just as we prefer,

00:39.250 --> 00:41.760
we can set it to red for instance, like this,

00:42.870 --> 00:45.950
then we have to decide what content we want to share.

00:46.200 --> 00:50.730
Well in our case, we only have that single dataset with the report in the dashboard,

00:50.820 --> 00:56.940
so we cannot select a thing right here but we can select what should be displayed as the app landing

00:56.940 --> 00:57.580
page.

00:57.810 --> 01:02.940
So either nothing or a specific content, I would like to have a specific content

01:03.000 --> 01:04.830
and I would like to have the dashboard,

01:04.920 --> 01:12.990
so if we click right here and select the dashboard, then we got that and now we have to decide who has

01:13.080 --> 01:19.640
access to that information. Either the entire organization you're in or specific individuals,

01:19.680 --> 01:24.790
in my case, this should be Maximillian again, like this

01:24.790 --> 01:29.470
and if you're now happy with what you've got here and you are sure you shared the right content with

01:29.470 --> 01:34.390
the right people, then you can simply press finish right here, like that.

01:35.250 --> 01:37.000
And yes we give them access to the app,

01:37.000 --> 01:43.230
this is fine, so we can press publish right here and now we get a link,

01:43.230 --> 01:49.380
so if you want to access the app using the link or you can add the app simply to your workspace.

01:49.480 --> 01:50.780
And this is what you want to do right now,

01:50.880 --> 02:01.200
so we can simply click onto go to app and now confirm that we want to add it, like this

02:01.270 --> 02:03.900
and here we are, already in the app.

02:04.120 --> 02:05.030
Important thing,

02:05.080 --> 02:11.110
we are in the personal workspace again because we cannot share the app with the group that shares

02:11.110 --> 02:11.430
it,

02:11.440 --> 02:12.740
this doesn't make sense.

02:12.820 --> 02:18.120
So the app is now visible in my workspace and in the app space of Maximilian

02:18.580 --> 02:24.970
and if you look at the app, so in the app menu right here, then we have the dashboard. As we said, if we click

02:24.970 --> 02:25.930
right here,

02:26.260 --> 02:30.030
then we can select the app and right there, then we see the dashboard

02:30.280 --> 02:34.510
and if we click into the dashboard, we can also access the report.

02:34.630 --> 02:41.170
So everything just as it used to be. This was the actual publishing of the app,

02:41.170 --> 02:48.340
now what if we want to unpublish the app again? We can also do this quite easy. To do that, we simply have

02:48.340 --> 02:49.820
to go to our workspace

02:49.840 --> 02:51.640
right here. Now this is wrong,

02:51.640 --> 02:54.010
we have to go to the app workspace of course,

02:54.010 --> 02:54.710
sorry for that

02:54.730 --> 02:56.800
we have to click right here and there,

02:56.860 --> 02:57.720
now it works

02:57.970 --> 03:04.600
and now we don't publish the app but we click onto those dots right here and press unpublish app right

03:04.600 --> 03:05.580
there.

03:05.650 --> 03:09.360
We won't do that right here but this is how it generally works.

03:09.610 --> 03:11.320
So this is it,

03:11.320 --> 03:13.450
we now have our app right there

03:13.630 --> 03:20.030
and the only thing I want to show you right now is, well we talked about that report and about that publishing

03:20.030 --> 03:26.500
to the app because this was publishing to a specific group but you can also publish a report, just a

03:26.500 --> 03:30.470
report, to the app, so with a browser link. To do this,

03:30.550 --> 03:33.390
you'll simply go to this menu right here,

03:33.460 --> 03:40.300
so I'm opening it, go to report and now you can find that file option up here.

03:40.650 --> 03:48.980
If you click that and select the publish to web option, then it warns you again and then you could create

03:49.010 --> 03:54.800
such a code or a link basically which would then allow you to access the content of your report in the

03:54.800 --> 03:55.810
browser.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.560
I won't do that right now,

03:57.560 --> 04:00.660
I just wanted to show you that you also have that option,

04:00.980 --> 04:07.530
so let's close that, this and close that and go back to our workspace, like that.

04:07.550 --> 04:08.990
So this is it right,

04:09.130 --> 04:14.720
we now talked a lot about the connection between Power BI desktop and the service interface, how to work

04:14.720 --> 04:16.980
together on the data and how to share the data

04:16.990 --> 04:24.020
in the end. In the next video, I want to show you some other sources that we have seen there.
