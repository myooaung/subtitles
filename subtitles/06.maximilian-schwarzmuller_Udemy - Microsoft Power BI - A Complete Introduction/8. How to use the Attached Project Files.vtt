Throughout the course, you and Manuel are going to work

1
00:04.500 --> 00:06.100
on a course dataset

2
00:06.180 --> 00:12.890
and of course this starts basic at importing itm then adjusting the import to your needs and so on and

3
00:12.890 --> 00:18.840
therefore, the course project, the Power BI file will also change.

4
00:18.860 --> 00:24.230
Now to give you a chance of catching up if you are lost or if you want to compare Manuel's solution

5
00:24.230 --> 00:30.750
with yours, you can download the latest version of the project from time to time and you will therefore find

6
00:30.750 --> 00:36.210
the zipped files attached to some of the course lectures. Now I'm going to show you how to use these files because you'll

7
00:36.210 --> 00:37.990
have to adjust your import paths

8
00:38.060 --> 00:43.130
since of course, you download them to your machine and the paths will vary or differ from the

9
00:43.130 --> 00:44.490
ones Manuel used.

10
00:44.750 --> 00:46.060
So here's how to do that.

11
00:46.070 --> 00:53.360
You of course extract that file and once you did this, you will have the Power BI file and the source folder.

12
00:53.360 --> 00:59.750
Now we can open the Power BI file and it will open Power BI Desktop but as soon as this is finished,

13
00:59.870 --> 01:02.980
you will see that we have an issue.

14
01:03.140 --> 01:10.640
If we go to the query editor in our case here and let it load, you see of course it doesn't find the source

15
01:10.640 --> 01:18.500
file because it still references the path on Manuel's machine and unfortunately, there's no way of avoiding

16
01:18.500 --> 01:21.840
this since Power BI needs absolute paths.

17
01:21.980 --> 01:28.400
So what you will have to do to fix this is you will have to go to the advanced editor here and here,

18
01:28.430 --> 01:34.990
you can edit this path and you should simply adjust it so that it points to your CSV file.

19
01:35.030 --> 01:43.760
So in my case where I also store this on the desktop, I'll go back to my Explorer, grab this path here which

20
01:43.760 --> 01:50.830
is where the Power BI file lives, go back to the advanced editor and replace everything in front of source,

21
01:50.840 --> 01:54.460
because I still have that folder in there with my path.

22
01:54.920 --> 01:59.890
Now with that being done, we can hit done and you see the data is there.

23
02:00.080 --> 02:06.200
If you still experience issues, you should hit refresh preview to really force Power BI to update your

24
02:06.200 --> 02:07.080
paths

25
02:07.430 --> 02:13.690
and with that, unfortunately you'll have to do that for all your imports here.

26
02:13.880 --> 02:18.960
I know this can be inconvenient but this is the only way of fixing these paths.

27
02:18.960 --> 02:23.810
However once you do have the new path copied or stored in your clipboard,

28
02:23.810 --> 02:29.300
it's really easy to go in there and exchange it in all the places where it is used.

29
02:29.420 --> 02:32.580
Once you did exchange it everywhere where it was used,

30
02:32.780 --> 02:39.530
all the other queries which are based on other queries where you did actually import it should update

31
02:39.560 --> 02:44.450
automatically. So you don't need to exchange it in all the queries, only in queries where you of course referenced

32
02:44.450 --> 02:49.710
these files. Queries depending on queries where you referenced it, will be updated automatically,

33
02:49.790 --> 02:56.210
if they aren't, hit this refresh preview button I was mentioning earlier. And with that, you should be good to

34
02:56.210 --> 03:02.570
go and you should be good to use the source files if you want to compare Manuel's set up with yours and

35
03:02.570 --> 03:06.530
want to see what he actually did there and if something is unclear.

36
03:06.860 --> 03:08.840
So that is just a little help,

37
03:08.840 --> 03:09.830
enjoy the course.
