I hope that this lecture was helpful to you.

00:05.740 --> 00:11.560
Whilst we of course only had a look at the basics of creating our own visuals and you can dive much more

00:11.560 --> 00:12.670
into that,

00:12.880 --> 00:18.850
you hopefully saw how it works, how you create your own visuals, how you connect everything and what the

00:18.850 --> 00:21.700
idea behind visuals is in Power BI

00:21.760 --> 00:30.040
from a technical perspective. You also saw how you can add colors, data binding and options to your visual

00:30.280 --> 00:35.410
and how you can then package it to either distribute it, share it with other people or use it in your

00:35.410 --> 00:37.360
desktop version.

00:37.360 --> 00:41.590
Now I can only encourage you to dive deeper into that if that's interesting to you,

00:41.590 --> 00:42.970
read some blog articles,

00:42.970 --> 00:45.670
play around with it, that really is the most important thing

00:45.910 --> 00:53.200
and of course learn Javascript, most importantly Typescript and a bit of svg or more about the d3.js

00:53.200 --> 00:59.920
package to fully unleash all the power you can unleash when it comes to custom visuals.

01:00.130 --> 01:01.540
Have fun with that,

01:01.540 --> 01:02.470
have a great time,

01:02.520 --> 01:02.830
bye.
