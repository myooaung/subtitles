00:02.310 --> 00:05.120
In the last lecture, we set up a dummy

00:05.130 --> 00:07.570
MySQL server on our local machine

00:07.580 --> 00:13.490
so that we actually have a server to connect to and if you already have a running server, definitely use that.

00:13.500 --> 00:20.430
Now in Power BI, we want to connect to that, we want to use that SQL server as a data source. For that

00:20.430 --> 00:21.840
we can click on get data

00:21.900 --> 00:24.840
and now you could think that we can click on SQL server,

00:24.960 --> 00:27.780
let's do that. In the newly opened window,

00:27.900 --> 00:34.680
you can choose your address, so that would be a localhost, then 3306 was the port number,

00:34.680 --> 00:40.230
remember that from the set up process, of course choose your address and then the database you want to

00:40.230 --> 00:41.180
connect to,

00:41.190 --> 00:44.760
so that would be pbi-test.

00:44.760 --> 00:49.450
Now you have the choice between two options, import or direct query,

00:49.530 --> 00:51.030
what's the difference?

00:51.030 --> 00:58.330
Import basically takes a snapshot of your data and copies it into your Power BI project file here.

00:58.530 --> 01:00.260
So the data is taken from the database,

01:00.270 --> 01:07.200
a SQL query is executed but the returning data is then taken and stored in your Power BI project. Direct

01:07.200 --> 01:14.250
query only stores the query command and whenever it needs to update a chart or anything else which requires

01:14.250 --> 01:15.600
the up-to-date data,

01:15.630 --> 01:22.260
it will rerun that query. So that is the option you should choose if you need live updating, if you want

01:22.260 --> 01:31.570
to update your visuals, your analysis on everything you change, so to be always on the most latest version

01:31.700 --> 01:33.270
of your data so to say.

01:33.540 --> 01:40.200
And that might sound like the always to choose option but actually for a lot of analysis, you don't need

01:40.200 --> 01:42.400
the latest data all the time,

01:42.480 --> 01:47.020
taking a snapshot which you then might update from time to time might be all you need.

01:47.160 --> 01:51.140
So typically, you choose import but you have the option of using direct query

01:51.180 --> 01:55.650
if you need that live data. Under advanced options,

01:55.710 --> 02:02.040
you can specify a timeout period and you can run your own SQL command if you have some specific command

02:02.040 --> 02:03.690
you want to execute.

02:03.690 --> 02:11.580
Now if we hit OK with import selected, you're queried or you're prompted to enter your credentials, so

02:11.610 --> 02:13.250
let's choose database,

02:13.440 --> 02:16.000
we have a root user by default,

02:16.010 --> 02:21.010
so let's create or use the root user and use the password we set up.

02:21.080 --> 02:25.660
If you now hit connect, you get an error that you're not able to connect.

02:25.710 --> 02:32.610
The reason for this is that SQL server might sound like you can connect to MySQL database but

02:32.610 --> 02:39.000
actually, a MySQL database is kind of a special case and we will see that we have a separate data source

02:39.000 --> 02:39.730
for that.

02:40.020 --> 02:46.800
If you have some other database driver or database software, running your own SQL server somewhere

02:46.830 --> 02:48.840
in the web or on your machine,

02:49.170 --> 02:52.440
these steps, these steps we walked through, this data source,

02:52.470 --> 02:57.360
SQL server might be the appropriate one. If you use a MySQL database,

02:57.360 --> 03:03.760
we have to follow a different approach. So let's hit cancel, for demo purposes

03:03.760 --> 03:09.120
I go to file options and data source settings and I'll remove the data source settings here,

03:09.270 --> 03:15.640
this is basically where the credentials I entered were stored and now I can click on get data more

03:15.900 --> 03:19.010
and here you see MySQL database.

03:19.230 --> 03:25.910
If you now choose this, you see we can't connect to it because we need to install additional components.

03:26.130 --> 03:28.250
Let's click on that learn more link then

03:28.290 --> 03:34.860
and this actually redirects us to the MySQL webpage because we need to install a connector. Connector

03:34.860 --> 03:41.570
is a software running on your machine which allows Power BI to use it to connect to the MySQL database.

03:41.880 --> 03:45.670
So Power BI doesn't have the logic to connect to it on its own,

03:45.840 --> 03:50.940
instead you have to use that connector, you have to install it so that Power BI can use it.

03:51.060 --> 03:51.610
That is

03:51.690 --> 03:54.920
when a SQL server import wasn't working,

03:54.930 --> 03:56.500
we need that connector.

03:56.740 --> 04:02.400
So on that page, we can scroll down and just start to download and this will now download the connector

04:02.520 --> 04:08.600
and once this is finished, we can walk through the installer to install it on our machine which should then enable

04:08.650 --> 04:13.420
Power BI to connect to that MySQL server, so I'll be back once this is finished.

04:13.620 --> 04:16.380
So I started the installer, let's go through it

04:16.500 --> 04:19.710
and here you can choose custom but all the settings should be fine,

04:19.710 --> 04:24.910
click next, click install and this will now install this connector on your machine.

04:25.120 --> 04:27.680
Now you'll need to restart Power BI,

04:28.110 --> 04:34.190
so I'm restarting it right now and once it did restart, you can go to get data

04:34.190 --> 04:40.430
again, more, go to MySQL database, click connect and now you should be able to proceed

04:40.560 --> 04:46.700
and here again, we enter our server address which is on our localhost, on our local machine and port

04:46.890 --> 04:47.590
3306

04:47.640 --> 04:48.540
and

04:48.900 --> 04:53.170
then the database. The database still is pbi-test.

04:53.220 --> 04:55.460
We can also specify advanced options here,

04:55.500 --> 04:57.530
a timeout in a SQL statement

04:57.750 --> 05:04.840
but one thing we can't do is choosing direct query. For MySQL, it's always going to be the import, the

05:04.840 --> 05:05.690
snapshot,

05:05.710 --> 05:10.810
you can't choose direct query, it's just not possible because the connector is being used. If you need to do that, you'll

05:10.810 --> 05:13.010
need to use a different SQL server,

05:13.030 --> 05:15.550
you can't use MySQL with Power BI.

05:15.790 --> 05:17.100
So that's just not an option

05:17.110 --> 05:23.620
but keep in mind, often times, maybe most of the times, a snapshot is all you need and the direct query

05:23.620 --> 05:29.830
thing might sound very awesome but we actually don't need to update your data on every tiny change you

05:29.830 --> 05:30.520
make.

05:30.850 --> 05:32.590
So let's go with these settings,

05:32.620 --> 05:33.440
click OK

05:33.670 --> 05:37.390
and again we reached a page where we have to enter our credentials.

05:37.480 --> 05:38.960
So let's click database

05:39.160 --> 05:47.460
and again, let's enter our username which is root by default and then our password and click connect.

05:47.500 --> 05:53.680
Now we can hit OK here on this encryption warning and you will be presented with this navigator.

05:53.890 --> 05:58.950
Here you see all your tables in the database you connected to,

05:59.230 --> 06:06.010
if you check this, you'll see the data and the team and you can now load it or edited it. If I click edit,

06:06.220 --> 06:10.590
you'll see it detected the types correctly so we can click close and apply

06:10.840 --> 06:15.070
and now it's importing the data as a snapshot from our database.

06:15.070 --> 06:25.240
Therefore if I add my column chart here and I drag volume in here and then region as an axis, you see my volume

06:25.340 --> 06:27.840
region data from the database.

06:28.030 --> 06:32.860
And this is how you can use MySQL as a source for Power BI

06:32.950 --> 06:35.710
and as you saw, you confused SQL server too.
