00:03.070 --> 00:06.800
Before we dive deeper into Power BI service,

00:06.850 --> 00:08.540
let's take a look at that,

00:08.620 --> 00:11.470
the ways to continue as I would call it.

00:11.470 --> 00:14.140
Let's take a look at the ways that we can take.

00:14.650 --> 00:17.420
So at the moment, we have you or me,

00:17.470 --> 00:18.910
so a single user,

00:19.120 --> 00:26.850
so this means we are in this area right now to the left, a single user finishing his local Power BI

00:26.850 --> 00:28.330
Desktop work.

00:28.460 --> 00:31.870
Now one option will be that you say well we did that,

00:31.990 --> 00:37.780
we are really happy with what we have right now and we don't want to share that with other people or on

00:37.790 --> 00:39.180
other platforms.

00:39.190 --> 00:44.620
This will mean we only keep the file locally and can only access it when we're are using it with

00:44.620 --> 00:45.390
the computer

00:45.420 --> 00:52.180
where the file is saved. If this is the case, then we stop right here because you have your file and you

00:52.180 --> 00:53.980
can use it on your computer,

00:54.010 --> 00:55.340
everything is fine.

00:55.780 --> 01:01.270
This is one option when you are a single user but you might have other plans,

01:01.330 --> 01:05.860
one of these other plans could be that you are still working with your local file but you would like

01:05.860 --> 01:08.950
to access that file from other computers,

01:08.950 --> 01:14.650
so you would like to have your data in kind of a cloud solution where you can always access the data

01:14.830 --> 01:17.990
and have a look at the dataset and the visualizations.

01:18.580 --> 01:22.210
If you want to do that, then you have to do the following - 

01:22.240 --> 01:24.620
you need to publish your data,

01:24.670 --> 01:30.910
so your Power BI Desktop data and you will publish that data to Power BI service.

01:30.940 --> 01:34.320
The important thing is that we are still talking about the single user,

01:34.420 --> 01:35.690
so about you or me.

01:35.950 --> 01:38.240
So you don't want to share this with other people,

01:38.260 --> 01:43.740
so the only purpose is that you upload your data or connect Power BI service to your Power BI desktop

01:43.750 --> 01:50.760
file and by that are able to access the data from anywhere. And talking about anywhere,

01:50.950 --> 01:54.790
maybe you don't only want to access the data using another computer,

01:55.060 --> 01:59.130
you might also want to access your data using an app on your mobile phone

01:59.350 --> 02:00.750
and this is also possible,

02:00.850 --> 02:06.910
so you could use the Power BI mobile app to be able to access the data from your mobile phone.

02:06.940 --> 02:09.960
So this is the single user case that we have right here

02:10.360 --> 02:15.490
but what if you not a single user, what if you're part of an organization right here?

02:15.760 --> 02:19.440
So the starting point in the organization is actually the same,

02:19.540 --> 02:24.890
so it's still you as the single user and the creator of that Power BI Desktop file

02:25.480 --> 02:29.970
and again, you want to publish it or share it with Power BI Service.

02:30.280 --> 02:33.180
So far, no difference to the single user case

02:33.670 --> 02:36.880
but what if you now want to collaborate with other people,

02:37.030 --> 02:43.900
so from the IT department for instance, like this? Collaboration could mean that you work together on new

02:44.020 --> 02:49.000
visualizations based on the initial data you prepared in the Power BI desktop file.

02:49.540 --> 02:54.170
This is one thing that you might want to do, as soon as you've finished your collaboration,

02:54.220 --> 03:00.070
you might want to share that result and by sharing, I mean that you don't want other people to be able

03:00.310 --> 03:06.610
to change the results but only to be able to look at the results, like the people from the marketing

03:06.610 --> 03:08.520
division for instance.

03:08.560 --> 03:11.170
Now this is the last thing you might want to do.

03:11.260 --> 03:16.100
You might want to share it with the Power BI Service application of the marketing department

03:16.570 --> 03:22.240
and also with that mobile apps maybe, so that the marketing people can have a look at the data

03:22.240 --> 03:28.900
also on the computer with the service application or from the mobile phone with the mobile apps. Now

03:28.900 --> 03:33.970
those are the ways to continue that we might consider in this module.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.850
So to summarize what we just talked about, we want to answer the following questions.

03:39.780 --> 03:45.250
How can we publish our data from Power BI desktop to Power BI service,

03:45.450 --> 03:48.900
how can we collaborate in Power BI service with other colleagues,

03:48.960 --> 03:55.590
so really work on the data basically and create new visualizations or dashboards for instance and how can

03:55.590 --> 04:00.690
we share the data and specify what data we want to share?

04:00.740 --> 04:07.440
Now we will answer all of those questions in this module but before we do that, we have to take a look

04:07.530 --> 04:14.690
at Power BI again because there is not only one version of Power BI existing, there are more versions

04:14.850 --> 04:19.040
and before we dive deeper, you have to understand what the differences are.

04:19.470 --> 04:22.210
Let's take a look at the differences in the next video.
