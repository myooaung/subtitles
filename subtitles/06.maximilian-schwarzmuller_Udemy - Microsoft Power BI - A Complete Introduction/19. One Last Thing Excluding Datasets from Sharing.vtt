00:02.780 --> 00:09.560
Well this is not the summary of this module to be honest because there is one important thing that we

00:09.560 --> 00:11.050
should really take a look at

00:11.270 --> 00:16.870
and this refers to the sharing actually because in this module, we talked a lot about sharing,

00:16.910 --> 00:24.740
we talked about creating app workspaces and about using an app to publish the information that we created.

00:24.740 --> 00:30.470
This is a great feature but there is one thing that might not be that good depending on what you need,

00:31.040 --> 00:36.980
because whenever you create an app to share your information or your project, you share everything,

00:36.980 --> 00:42.020
this means this app includes the dashboard, the report and the dataset.

00:42.020 --> 00:45.370
Now this can be really amazing and a great feature if you need that

00:45.650 --> 00:50.660
but there might be cases where you only want to share the dashboard and the report

00:50.960 --> 00:53.660
and for this purpose, we don't need an app,

00:53.840 --> 00:56.090
we don't even need an app workspace actually,

00:56.270 --> 00:58.750
the only thing we need is a workspace.

00:58.790 --> 01:03.770
Now when I said we don't need an app workspace, this can of course also be an app workspace and I will

01:03.770 --> 01:06.590
show you how this works in our app workspace.

01:06.590 --> 01:12.460
I just wanted to make sure that you know that this feature is available in each workspace type actually.

01:12.470 --> 01:13.910
Now I talked about the feature,

01:13.910 --> 01:18.720
let's take a look at now how we can share our dashboard and our report only.

01:18.920 --> 01:21.620
So I'm back in our app workspace that we created,

01:21.650 --> 01:22.910
you can see this right here,

01:22.970 --> 01:27.940
so I'm in this workspace right here and up there, we have that yellow button that was named published app,

01:28.040 --> 01:29.390
now we can update the app

01:29.510 --> 01:32.780
but this is always referring to the publishing function

01:32.930 --> 01:37.960
and again, we publish the dashboard, the report and the dataset.

01:37.970 --> 01:44.400
Now if we want to share the dashboard and the report only, then we can simply click right here onto our dashboard,

01:45.020 --> 01:50.540
well and then we go back to this share button I mentioned in one of the earlier videos and if you click

01:50.540 --> 01:52.140
onto the share button right here,

01:52.580 --> 01:54.460
well then you can share the data,

01:54.500 --> 02:00.710
it says share dashboard but the sharing will include the dashboard and the underlying report with other

02:00.710 --> 02:01.510
people.

02:01.730 --> 02:06.330
As you can see, the other person must be a Power BI pro user,

02:06.380 --> 02:08.040
that's the only requirement that you have

02:08.150 --> 02:12.470
but this person can use the trial if you just want to try out that feature.

02:12.480 --> 02:14.450
However, how does this work now?

02:14.660 --> 02:17.920
Well the first thing you have to do is you have to enter an e-mail address

02:18.110 --> 02:19.410
and that's important,

02:19.430 --> 02:25.860
this can be an e-mail address within your organization or also an e-mail address outside your organization.

02:26.090 --> 02:31.640
Now I will show you this now in the an example, so I will use another e-mail address of mine which is

02:31.910 --> 02:33.330
outside the organization,

02:33.440 --> 02:34.230
that's important

02:34.400 --> 02:39.650
but as I said, the same thing is of course possible with an e-mail address inside your organization.

02:39.650 --> 02:43.080
However I will now enter my e-mail address,

02:43.100 --> 02:46.140
now I wrote my e-mail and if I now click right here,

02:46.400 --> 02:48.840
well then we see this warning.

02:48.950 --> 02:52.830
As I said I'm using e-mail address outside my organization

02:52.970 --> 02:56.810
but the good thing is with that warning that this doesn't mean that it doesn't work,

02:56.810 --> 03:02.240
it's just a warning to make sure that you are aware of the fact that you would share content that might

03:02.240 --> 03:06.200
be internal content with one person outside of the organization.

03:06.200 --> 03:08.500
However in this case, this is fine,

03:08.600 --> 03:14.660
so if we scroll down now, then we can define if the other person should be allowed to even share this

03:14.660 --> 03:16.220
dashboard with other people,

03:16.230 --> 03:23.030
well I would say no in this case and then we can define if we want to send an e-mail notification to

03:23.030 --> 03:24.120
the recipient.

03:24.170 --> 03:26.090
I think this is something that we want to do,

03:26.150 --> 03:32.170
so let's tick that, well and that's it actually. We now can simply press onto share down here,

03:33.800 --> 03:39.950
now we can see that the dashboard was shared successfully and if I now quickly change to my emails,

03:40.010 --> 03:44.360
then I see that I now received an invitation to a dashboard.

03:44.360 --> 03:49.220
The important thing here is of course that the account in Power BI and that this account are not the

03:49.220 --> 03:49.970
same accounts,

03:50.030 --> 03:54.520
just to make sure that you are aware of that fact. However I now receive that invitation

03:54.560 --> 03:58.630
and if I click right here then onto this link, well then this is German now,

03:58.630 --> 04:03.230
I'm sorry for that but if you just clicked down here, this should be something like sign-in in English, like

04:03.230 --> 04:09.070
that and then simply select the e-mail address that you invited to Power BI,

04:09.200 --> 04:11.180
then we can see this.

04:11.270 --> 04:13.820
So we only see our dashboard right here, right,

04:13.820 --> 04:20.330
so not a lot to do besides that and we can click into this dashboard of course and then we see our

04:20.330 --> 04:21.500
report

04:21.500 --> 04:26.780
and of course we see our report with the different pages, the relationships, the measures and all the other

04:26.780 --> 04:29.100
beautiful pages that we created.

04:29.150 --> 04:32.320
We can also add some filters right here, like this

04:32.750 --> 04:38.660
but as we can see, even if I click into a report or try to do whatever I want to do, there is no way

04:38.750 --> 04:42.090
to access the entire dataset.

04:42.110 --> 04:48.350
One limitation of course, if I click onto a chart right here for example and then click onto the dots, then

04:48.350 --> 04:50.170
you can of course export the data. 

04:50.510 --> 04:51.390
But important,

04:51.500 --> 04:55.730
this only refers to the data that are used in that visual, well

04:55.820 --> 05:00.030
and as the person sees the visual, that data shouldn't be too confidential regarding that

05:00.260 --> 05:06.510
but the rest, so the entire dataset is not included if you use this sharing option in Power BI.

05:07.040 --> 05:13.130
And this is it actually, now that we also know this, we are really done with this module and now is the

05:13.130 --> 05:15.260
time to take a look at what we learned.

05:15.470 --> 05:19.300
So in the next video, we will have our module summary then.
