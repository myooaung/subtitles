Welcome to this module. In this and next module, I will take over and whilst I will show you how to create

00:08.160 --> 00:14.070
and add your own custom visuals to Power BI projects in the next module, in this module,

00:14.100 --> 00:17.090
I will have a look at other data sources,

00:17.130 --> 00:23.700
so other sources we can query and get our data into Power BI. Throughout the course, we mostly look at

00:23.700 --> 00:27.460
csv files and also how we could import data from a webpage

00:27.600 --> 00:30.270
but of course there are other important data sources too

00:30.510 --> 00:35.740
and in this module, we'll have a look at three other important data sources. That will be a database,

00:35.870 --> 00:36.810
MySQL database

00:36.840 --> 00:41.490
since it's a common use case that you have data in the database which you want to query and then analyze

00:41.490 --> 00:41.620
in

00:41.680 --> 00:44.740
Power BI. We'll have a look at JSON,

00:44.910 --> 00:51.150
JSON is a data format, kind of an alternative to csv you could say but it's structured a bit differently,

00:51.150 --> 00:57.420
it stands for Javascript Object Notation and it's often used in web development and a lot of restful

00:57.480 --> 01:03.840
APIs, so web services you can query return data in that format and that will also be the third data

01:03.840 --> 01:07.210
source, querying such restful APIs,

01:07.220 --> 01:14.170
so sending HTTP requests to URLs which don't return a webpage but just some structured data.

01:14.430 --> 01:16.580
So these are the three sources I want to have a look at

01:16.640 --> 01:19.320
and in the next lecture, we're going to start with JSON.
