00:02.580 --> 00:07.000
So we learned some basic formulas to use calculated columns

00:07.260 --> 00:12.480
but if you look at that illustration here or at the title of the illustration to be more precise, you

00:12.480 --> 00:16.380
can see that it's called calculated columns versus measures.

00:16.830 --> 00:17.390
What's that

00:17.400 --> 00:19.950
and what's the difference to a calculated column?

00:19.950 --> 00:22.900
Well, the calculated column works as follows.

00:23.160 --> 00:29.640
You perform an operation that generates results for each row of a table or of a column in your table

00:29.670 --> 00:31.090
to be more precise.

00:31.110 --> 00:33.350
This is what we just saw in the last video

00:33.450 --> 00:35.330
and also in the data example.

00:35.550 --> 00:39.450
So in this case, you use calculated columns.

00:39.640 --> 00:44.770
Now what if you want to create an average of a column or the sum of a column,

00:44.830 --> 00:48.780
so a single aggregated value, something like this.

00:49.240 --> 00:55.930
Well in this case, you cannot calculate a calculated column because this retrieves results for each row

00:56.050 --> 00:58.850
and you only want to have one result in the end

00:59.020 --> 01:01.860
and this is where the measures come into play.

01:01.870 --> 01:08.940
Now what these measures are and how these measures work especially, let's learn that in the next video.
