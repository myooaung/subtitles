WEBVTT

00:02.720 --> 00:06.140
We logged into Power BI Service the first time,

00:06.140 --> 00:08.800
time to get to know the interface a little bit better.

00:09.930 --> 00:14.290
So we have this overview right now or this landing page actually,

00:14.790 --> 00:16.830
let's start in the left column again,

00:16.830 --> 00:23.810
so in this area. The first thing you might note is that button up here, if you click that button,

00:24.430 --> 00:28.580
then you can see that you can have access to different Microsoft services.

00:28.870 --> 00:30.610
So nothing really related to Power BI

00:30.610 --> 00:33.880
service at the moment, so we can close that by clicking it again.

00:34.690 --> 00:37.900
Below that, you can find the navigation pane,

00:38.170 --> 00:39.310
if you click right here,

00:39.550 --> 00:44.920
the navigation pane is minimized, if you click it again, you can see the details of the navigation pane

00:45.370 --> 00:48.310
and I will keep it like that because we need the information right here.

00:49.470 --> 00:52.030
The first thing you can see right there are the favorites.

00:52.200 --> 00:57.900
If you click right here, you can see that we don't have any favorites yet but we will learn in the next

00:57.910 --> 01:02.410
videos how to create such a favorite content really easily.

01:02.550 --> 01:04.990
The next thing are the recent projects

01:05.220 --> 01:10.440
and as you can see right here, of course I didn't look into Power BI Services the first time, I have various

01:10.440 --> 01:11.820
projects in here,

01:11.940 --> 01:18.110
so in your case, this might either be empty or if also work with it, you might also have some projects in there.

01:19.340 --> 01:21.500
The next thing we have our apps,

01:21.750 --> 01:23.020
now what are apps?

01:23.060 --> 01:29.320
This sounds really interesting and the good thing is we will create apps in this module,

01:29.570 --> 01:32.010
I don't want to raise the wrong expectations,

01:32.030 --> 01:38.000
we will not create a gaming app of course, an app simply describes a specific content,

01:38.030 --> 01:44.340
so a combination of a dataset, a report and a dashboard that we can save and access in such an app.

01:44.430 --> 01:46.390
We will of course learn how this works.

01:47.570 --> 01:51.430
In the next position, we can find the shared with me content,

01:51.440 --> 01:57.590
so if other users in your organization for instance shared content with you, this can be found in this

01:57.590 --> 01:58.420
area

01:59.180 --> 02:02.550
and now we have a really interesting position,

02:02.580 --> 02:07.870
the workspaces. If we click that, we can see that we only have one workspace,

02:08.000 --> 02:14.090
your personal workspace that you automatically get when you log into Power BI service and down here,

02:14.300 --> 02:21.200
you can see that create app workspace button, we want to create such an app workspace as this will be

02:21.200 --> 02:25.580
required to create the app that we just talked about a few seconds ago.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.130
Now you might not understand everything at the moment of course when I talk about app workspaces and

02:31.130 --> 02:34.510
apps, you will learn that really step-by-step,

02:34.520 --> 02:35.810
so don't worry.

02:36.020 --> 02:42.380
The only important thing at the moment is that you can have different workspaces and these workspaces

02:42.440 --> 02:47.670
can contain different or the same data depending on what you import into that workspace.

02:47.680 --> 02:51.790
Now at the moment, we are in the personal workspace that we have,

02:52.010 --> 02:58.970
so if we click right here and then click right there, then we can see that we have various get data

02:58.970 --> 03:00.290
options,

03:00.290 --> 03:06.440
we will talk about that in a few minutes. Before we do that, let's click onto that arrow next to the workspace

03:06.660 --> 03:07.280
right there.

03:08.650 --> 03:13.280
Here you can see that your workspace is organized in four different categories,

03:13.320 --> 03:15.710
we have datasets at the bottom,

03:15.750 --> 03:19.220
we know that from Power BI Desktop, we have workbooks,

03:19.260 --> 03:22.610
those are actually Excel workbooks so we will not talk about that.

03:22.610 --> 03:26.090
Now we have reports, we know that right,

03:26.160 --> 03:28.410
we created a report in Power BI desktop,

03:28.530 --> 03:31.090
so we might see that report also right here

03:31.710 --> 03:33.070
and we have dashboards.

03:33.360 --> 03:37.450
We didn't create dashboard so far but dashboards are these,

03:37.560 --> 03:42.160
I would say summary pages or that great introduction pages, so a single page here

03:42.240 --> 03:47.310
that shows you the core information of your dataset or of your report.

03:47.340 --> 03:48.910
So this is what we can see right here

03:49.110 --> 03:51.630
and this is how your workspace is organized.

03:51.630 --> 03:58.250
Now before we talk about that area, that get data area, let's focus onto the options that we have up here.

03:58.380 --> 04:05.380
The important ones are the settings right there, here you can see how many storage you have for instance and manage

04:05.390 --> 04:06.300
gateways,

04:06.570 --> 04:13.990
we will talk about that of course. Right here, we have three core options that we need in this module.

04:14.040 --> 04:17.840
We have the Power BI Desktop download option but we got that already right,

04:17.880 --> 04:20.080
so no need to re-download it.

04:20.100 --> 04:23.690
We got the data gateway and we will use such a gateway

04:23.760 --> 04:29.350
and of course learn what it is actually and why we might need it and we can download Power BI for Mobile

04:29.550 --> 04:31.590
but we will not download it right here,

04:31.590 --> 04:36.120
we will download it in the app store of course and use it on our mobile phones.

04:36.600 --> 04:37.970
So this is it actually,

04:38.430 --> 04:42.620
this is the core interface of Power BI service.

04:42.690 --> 04:50.990
Now we have that get data menu that we can access if we click right here or right there and get data is

04:51.010 --> 04:52.840
a good starting point, right?

04:53.170 --> 04:57.380
Because this is the first purpose that we saw in the illustration at the beginning,

04:57.430 --> 05:01.440
so we are still a single user and we don't want to stop right here,

05:01.600 --> 05:06.180
we want to continue and we want to share our data in Power BI service.

05:06.520 --> 05:13.390
So we need to be able to import the data from our Power BI desktop application to the service application.

05:13.390 --> 05:16.200
Let's see how this works in the next video.
