00:02.740 --> 00:07.730
We build the base for our star schema for the data model in the next module,

00:07.750 --> 00:09.120
this is really great,

00:09.250 --> 00:14.140
there is only one thing about the population column that I quickly want to change,

00:14.140 --> 00:16.240
let me show you what I mean.

00:16.240 --> 00:19.290
So in this population column, everything is all right

00:19.300 --> 00:24.840
actually, the only thing that I don't like is the way the numbers are displayed,

00:25.000 --> 00:31.360
so to say it's simple, I simply want to multiply that column by 1000 because this will make it easier

00:31.360 --> 00:34.160
for us to later create the visualizations

00:34.240 --> 00:40.900
and to display the units correctly. Now to multiply a column or to generally apply some operations like

00:40.900 --> 00:42.020
that to a column,

00:42.070 --> 00:48.850
you can simply go to the transform ribbon right here and now in the number column area right here, you

00:48.850 --> 00:51.740
have various options on what you want to do.

00:51.760 --> 00:54.180
Now we only want to do a standard operation,

00:54.280 --> 00:58.040
so we simply click onto standard right here and press multiply

00:58.130 --> 01:00.300
and before we do that, you see that you have multiple options,

01:00.290 --> 01:06.160
so if you want to add something or subtract something or divide, etc, this can all be done right

01:06.160 --> 01:06.670
here

01:06.670 --> 01:11.500
but as always, this refers to all values in the corresponding column.

01:11.520 --> 01:13.990
However we only want to multiply,

01:14.110 --> 01:16.860
so we can simply press onto multiply right there

01:17.260 --> 01:21.230
and as I said, I want to multiply that column by 1000.

01:21.370 --> 01:25.660
So let's type 1000 like this and press OK,

01:27.130 --> 01:28.480
now we got that

01:28.480 --> 01:30.130
and now this is fine

01:30.130 --> 01:35.380
and as I said, you will see later why this was important and the only thing we have to do right now is

01:35.680 --> 01:38.430
we should think about performance, right?

01:38.470 --> 01:43.530
Because if you look at our queries column, well there are lots of queries at the moment, right,

01:43.750 --> 01:48.760
and maybe we don't have to load all of these queries into our data model.

01:49.060 --> 01:51.350
Let's talk about that in the next video.
