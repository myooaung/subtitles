00:02.800 --> 00:06.510
We talked about cardinality and about the cross filter direction,

00:06.700 --> 00:12.580
now it's time to understand the last item of our relationships, the active properties that we can see

00:12.580 --> 00:13.850
right here.

00:13.900 --> 00:18.400
I think it's the best if we just go back to our project and see what that is.

00:18.400 --> 00:22.860
So here I am back in the relationship view of our course project,

00:22.960 --> 00:26.620
so we are no longer in the example from the last video. Now

00:26.700 --> 00:29.980
we created that relationships and those work totally fine

00:29.980 --> 00:32.990
but we want to understand what that active properties means.

00:33.160 --> 00:39.340
Well if we go to manage relationships right here, then you can see that you can set relationships to

00:39.340 --> 00:40.670
active or inactive.

00:40.900 --> 00:42.340
Well let's try that,

00:42.340 --> 00:46.930
so let's click right here and see what happens to the relationship between the population and the age

00:46.930 --> 00:47.580
group.

00:47.810 --> 00:53.350
Let's close to that and we can see that we now have that dashed line between those two tables

00:53.740 --> 00:57.850
and if we now get to report view and now change

00:58.720 --> 01:09.940
our chart back again to the Age-Group, like this, then we can see that the chart is not working which

01:09.940 --> 01:13.750
makes sense of course because the relationship is no longer active.

01:14.110 --> 01:20.200
If we go back to relationship view and now for instance double-click it like this, we can also make the relationship

01:20.230 --> 01:23.020
active down here if we click that

01:23.160 --> 01:28.090
and if we now click OK, you can see that we have a solid line back again right here

01:28.480 --> 01:34.210
and in the report view, we can see that this works fine again and this is actually what you have to

01:34.210 --> 01:39.440
know about the active properties. So don't only make sure that you create the relationship,

01:39.520 --> 01:42.610
you also have to make sure that it's active.

01:42.610 --> 01:48.680
Now we talked about our relationship view and we also understand how relationships generally work

01:49.210 --> 01:51.680
but there is another important view in the data model,

01:51.680 --> 01:57.820
you remember? The data view. Now let's start talking about the data view in the next video.
