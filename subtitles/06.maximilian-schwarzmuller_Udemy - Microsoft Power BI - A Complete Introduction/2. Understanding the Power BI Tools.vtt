00:02.170 --> 00:08.830
Let's start with the answer to the most important question first: What is Power BI actually? If you

1
00:08.830 --> 00:11.750
look at the home page, you can find the following text:

2
00:12.020 --> 00:15.540
So Power BI is a suite of Business Analytics tools.

3
00:15.580 --> 00:21.790
It allows you to work on data, to create reports, to publish these reports and a lot more.

4
00:21.820 --> 00:26.590
This sounds really great but we have to take a closer look at that

5
00:26.710 --> 00:29.800
to really understand how this works.

6
00:29.860 --> 00:36.250
So we already know that Power BI is not a single tool but consists of multiple tools.

7
00:36.250 --> 00:38.590
Additionally we have that building blocks,

8
00:38.860 --> 00:39.980
let's see what that is.

9
00:41.010 --> 00:48.960
The first tool is Power BI Desktop, the local application only available on Windows. In Power BI Desktop,

10
00:48.960 --> 00:52.430
we have the first building block - the datasets.

11
00:52.500 --> 00:54.760
Now what is a dataset?

12
00:54.930 --> 01:01.350
A dataset simply describes the data or the information that you have in your data model.

13
01:01.860 --> 01:07.830
You can either connect Power BI Desktop to predefined datasets - so you simply import the data into the

14
01:07.830 --> 01:10.180
data model and then you're done

15
01:10.290 --> 01:13.230
or you can create your own datasets.

16
01:13.230 --> 01:18.650
This would mean that you connect Power BI Desktop to different source files in so-called queries,

17
01:18.660 --> 01:25.220
we will talk about that throughout the course, and then work on those queries. As soon as you finished your work,

18
01:25.230 --> 01:32.420
you will then load that newly created structure into the data model and by that, have your own dataset.

19
01:32.610 --> 01:38.390
Now in both cases, you are not done right here because you want to visualize your data, right?

20
01:38.550 --> 01:45.570
To do this you need the second building block, the visualizations. A visualization is simply a chart or

21
01:45.570 --> 01:51.880
a table, so everything that visualizes your data. With the visualizations

22
01:51.900 --> 01:55.260
we have the third building block, the tiles.

23
01:55.500 --> 01:58.680
Tiles are simply the area of your visualizations,

24
01:58.760 --> 02:00.860
so kind of the frame around it.

25
02:01.050 --> 02:06.780
You can change the height or the width and the position of the tiles just as you prefer.

26
02:06.780 --> 02:12.340
The only limitation is the space on your report page. Reports?

27
02:12.600 --> 02:19.000
Yes, we also have reports in Power BI Desktop and reports are the fourth building block.

28
02:19.470 --> 02:25.050
You can simply create multiple pages with different visualizations just as you prefer.

29
02:25.350 --> 02:26.690
Well and the summary

30
02:26.710 --> 02:28.610
or the combination of the pages,

31
02:28.620 --> 02:32.480
this is the report. So this is Power BI Desktop.

32
02:32.730 --> 02:41.520
You can create datasets and visualize the data in visualizations and the combination of multiple visualizations

33
02:41.730 --> 02:43.200
on multiple pages,

34
02:43.200 --> 02:48.050
this is the report then. Now the second tool is Power BI Service.

35
02:48.090 --> 02:55.440
This is a cloud application, and by that not limited to Windows only, which allows you to share your results

36
02:55.710 --> 02:58.860
and to collaborate in your projects with your colleagues.

37
02:59.250 --> 03:04.710
But if you look at the different building blocks, we can see that those are equal to the ones that we

38
03:04.710 --> 03:07.170
just saw in Power BI Desktop.

39
03:07.170 --> 03:08.800
Now what's the difference?

40
03:08.820 --> 03:15.690
Power BI Service can of course be connected to different datasets but the creation of that own

41
03:15.690 --> 03:16.450
datasets

42
03:16.500 --> 03:20.780
we just talked about in Power BI Desktop, so the connection to different source files,

43
03:20.830 --> 03:26.280
then the work on those queries and by that the creation of that new structure that you then load into your

44
03:26.280 --> 03:27.430
data model,

45
03:27.480 --> 03:34.780
this is not possible in Power BI Service. So Power BI Service is the tool to connect to existing datasets,

46
03:34.800 --> 03:38.650
Power BI Desktop is the tool to create new datasets in.

47
03:38.760 --> 03:40.790
That's an important difference.

48
03:41.000 --> 03:47.210
However as we can connect Power BI Service to those existing datasets and also to that created datasets

49
03:47.260 --> 03:54.690
in Power BI Desktop of course, we can also create visualizations and reports. But the functionality of

50
03:54.690 --> 03:57.140
the creation of the visualizations and of the reports,

51
03:57.210 --> 04:00.420
well we know that from Power BI Desktop already, right?

52
04:00.840 --> 04:05.040
So we will not create visualizations and reports in Power BI Service

53
04:05.070 --> 04:11.370
in that course, we will learn how this works in Power BI Desktop. And the functionality and the interface,

54
04:11.370 --> 04:17.020
as I said when it comes to the creation of the visualizations, is the same between those two tools.

55
04:17.040 --> 04:19.760
Now what else can we do in Power BI Service then?

56
04:20.070 --> 04:24.830
Well, we talked about that sharing and collaborating and we will learn how this works

57
04:25.050 --> 04:31.110
but there is one additional building block that is only available in Power BI Service and those are the

58
04:31.110 --> 04:32.550
dashboards.

59
04:32.580 --> 04:33.940
Now what is a dashboard?

60
04:34.080 --> 04:38.210
Well when we talk about a dashboard, simply think about a cover page,

61
04:38.310 --> 04:43.480
so one single page which summarizes the key facts of your report.

62
04:43.500 --> 04:48.840
This is the dashboard, so this first page you see. If you want to dive deeper, then you can jump into the

63
04:48.840 --> 04:52.180
report and get more information about your data.

64
04:52.470 --> 04:53.880
So this is the second tool,

65
04:53.940 --> 04:58.920
this sharing collaborating tool with the creation of the dashboards.

66
04:59.310 --> 05:01.880
Let's quickly summarize what we've learned so far:

67
05:02.370 --> 05:03.980
We have Power BI Desktop,

68
05:03.980 --> 05:05.550
the local application,

69
05:05.700 --> 05:10.430
where we can create our datasets, our visualizations and our reports.

70
05:10.890 --> 05:14.820
We then publish that information to Power BI Service,

71
05:14.820 --> 05:19.080
the cloud solution. In there, we can also collaborate with colleagues

72
05:19.080 --> 05:26.850
for example if we want or add dashboards to our existing data. So we have the data in the cloud.

73
05:26.920 --> 05:34.360
If we now use the third tool, Power BI Mobile, a mobile app as the name says, this will allow us to access

74
05:34.360 --> 05:41.990
the data that we loaded to Power BI Service from our mobile devices and we will also take a look at Power BI

75
05:42.010 --> 05:46.230
Mobile of course and see how this app works and what we can do with it.

76
05:47.220 --> 05:53.850
So those are the three core tools of Power BI that we need and that we'll talk about in detail throughout

77
05:53.850 --> 05:57.280
the course but we will show you more.

78
05:57.370 --> 06:03.780
We will show you Power BI for Developers also. Power BI for Developers is made to customize your Power BI

79
06:03.840 --> 06:05.110
experience.

80
06:05.160 --> 06:11.060
This means you can create your own customized visuals and you will see how this works throughout the course

81
06:11.490 --> 06:18.330
and you can also embed your Power BI results into your own existing apps with Power BI Embedded, something

82
06:18.450 --> 06:24.230
that is rather related to your own app and not directly connected to Power BI.

83
06:24.750 --> 06:29.200
Because of that, we will not cover this topic as part of this course.

84
06:29.200 --> 06:35.820
However with that Power BI for Developers block, we now have an overview of the entire Power BI universe

85
06:36.120 --> 06:38.620
that we will talk about throughout that course.

86
06:38.970 --> 06:43.390
And now I think its time that we start with our first little project,

87
06:43.440 --> 06:44.550
right?

88
06:44.850 --> 06:47.660
Let's do this and let's start with the first tool - 

89
06:47.710 --> 06:49.970
Power BI Desktop, the local application.

90
06:50.190 --> 06:56.150
Well and to work with this local application, we first have to download and install it.

91
06:56.490 --> 06:58.860
Let's do this in the next video.
