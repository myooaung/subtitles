00:02.420 --> 00:09.260
Welcome to this module, in this module, you will learn what we can do with our actual data model. To be more

00:09.260 --> 00:10.130
precise,

00:10.130 --> 00:14.460
this means we will talk about the data view and the relationship view.

00:14.750 --> 00:19.520
Now before we start, let's take a quick look at the workflow that we already know.

00:21.020 --> 00:27.210
So in the workflow, we now finished the left part, the data preparation in the query editor,

00:27.620 --> 00:31.250
what we want to do in this module is the data modeling.

00:31.250 --> 00:36.890
Now before we start with the actual data modeling, I think we should think about an important difference,

00:37.250 --> 00:41.620
the difference between the query editor and the actual data model.

00:41.990 --> 00:45.240
Let's find out what the difference is in the next video.
