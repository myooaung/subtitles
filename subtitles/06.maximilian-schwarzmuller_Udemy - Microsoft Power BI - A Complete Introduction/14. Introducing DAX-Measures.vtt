00:02.630 --> 00:04.630
It's time to apply some measures

00:04.880 --> 00:08.640
and it's also time to apply those measures to our project file,

00:08.900 --> 00:11.030
let's see how this works.

00:11.030 --> 00:18.130
So here I am back in our course project and I am in the data view and in the FACT-Population table.

00:18.530 --> 00:24.100
Now we want to add measures and I think the best way is if we just start, right?

00:24.170 --> 00:30.440
So let's do this by going to the modeling ribbon and now we don't select new column like we did it

00:30.440 --> 00:34.430
before but now we select new measure, like this.

00:34.790 --> 00:43.290
Let's press that and let's name that measure total population because that's what it's going to calculate,

00:43.310 --> 00:49.950
it will just give us out the total amount of all the population that we have in our dataset. To do this,

00:49.970 --> 00:54.920
we simply write sum like this and press tab

00:55.580 --> 01:01.340
and as you can see here, we can now refer to different tables with that measure but we only want to have

01:01.340 --> 01:04.480
the measure of the FACT-Population population table,

01:04.580 --> 01:11.230
so right here. Now if I double-click that and press enter, then you can see nothing, right?

01:11.290 --> 01:13.730
So there wasn't any column added

01:14.020 --> 01:20.680
and this is also a difference to the calculated columns that we had before, as a measure is only a single

01:20.680 --> 01:21.340
value,

01:21.550 --> 01:26.960
you cannot see it in the actual data model, at least not in that area,

01:27.100 --> 01:34.540
you can only see it when we use it in a visualization and it's also only calculated when you use it

01:34.840 --> 01:40.620
which makes it less memory consuming when comparing it to a calculated column

01:40.900 --> 01:45.050
but of course, you can see it right there, in that fields column.

01:45.150 --> 01:47.760
Here we have the total population measure, 

01:47.760 --> 01:53.050
now let's go to report view and see how we can apply such a measure. To do this,

01:53.080 --> 01:59.220
we simply select a report view right here and here we still have our great population chart.

01:59.650 --> 02:01.100
I don't think we need that anymore

02:01.180 --> 02:07.660
but nevertheless let's keep it and rename that report page to relationships and you can simply rename

02:07.660 --> 02:16.060
that by clicking down here on the name and now call it relationships, like this and pressing enter

02:16.070 --> 02:17.510
of course in the end.

02:17.510 --> 02:24.940
Now if you press plus right here, you can add a second page and we will name that page measurers and

02:24.940 --> 02:26.180
press enter.

02:26.250 --> 02:27.480
Now that we got that,

02:27.490 --> 02:29.570
let's create a simple visualization,

02:29.620 --> 02:30.950
again our column chart.

02:31.090 --> 02:34.480
So I'm clicking right here and I'm positioning it right there,

02:34.480 --> 02:36.200
this is fine actually.

02:36.250 --> 02:41.820
Now if you go to the FACT-Population table in the fields column, you can find that total population measure

02:41.820 --> 02:45.350
right here with that calculator symbol in front of it.

02:45.490 --> 02:51.700
Now if you simply use it and drag it into the visualization for instance, then you can see it right here.

02:51.700 --> 02:54.030
Of course you don't have to drag it into a visualization,

02:54.040 --> 02:57.170
you can also put it right here into the value area,

02:57.370 --> 03:04.060
however this is not a really great visualization for the moment but it shows you that this measure works

03:04.120 --> 03:05.170
as soon as we use it

03:05.190 --> 03:06.880
in a visualization.

03:06.880 --> 03:08.510
Now let's go back to the data view,

03:08.590 --> 03:09.480
here we are

03:09.850 --> 03:14.500
and as a second measure, I would like to add the average population.

03:14.570 --> 03:17.650
Let's do that by clicking new measure again,

03:17.690 --> 03:24.980
now name it population average and you will see why I turn the name around this time and we will write that

03:24.980 --> 03:27.890
formula just as we did it with the sum formula.

03:28.040 --> 03:35.600
So we simply write average like this, press tab and now select again the FACT-Population table and the

03:35.600 --> 03:38.890
population column and press enter.

03:38.930 --> 03:42.090
Now we have the population average measure right here

03:42.350 --> 03:44.180
and I would like to rename that measure quickly,

03:44.180 --> 03:50.040
so I will simply select the total population measure, delete the total part right here and write

03:50.030 --> 03:53.270
population total and press enter.

03:53.270 --> 03:59.040
The reason why I'm doing this is that the names are sorted alphabetically right here and I want to keep

03:59.040 --> 04:02.510
the measures, so the population measures in that part.

04:02.540 --> 04:09.830
However if we now go back to our report view and create a new visualization by clicking here and writing

04:09.830 --> 04:10.740
it right there

04:11.280 --> 04:16.470
and now simply use the population average and now drag it to the value area right here,

04:17.470 --> 04:21.910
we can see that we now visualized the population average with that measure.

04:21.910 --> 04:27.550
Now those were some basic measures of course but let's find out some more things that we could do with

04:27.550 --> 04:28.860
that measure function,

04:29.080 --> 04:32.570
so back to the data view, right here.

04:32.970 --> 04:39.030
So what we want to do right now is we want to calculate the total female population,

04:39.030 --> 04:45.250
so we need to set a filter that it only takes the total value if the gender is female.

04:45.510 --> 04:48.110
Let's see how this works in the next video.
