00:03.030 --> 00:09.870
So after creating our first two visualizations, we now want to make our report page a little bit more

00:10.080 --> 00:14.030
interactive and let's see what that is and how this works.

00:15.650 --> 00:17.950
So we have those visualizations

00:18.110 --> 00:24.260
and this looks nice but there should be more that we can do in Power BI desktop, right?

00:24.710 --> 00:26.640
Let's try that out.

00:26.690 --> 00:36.450
So if I select the right visualization like this and now press on to Asia for instance, like that, then

00:36.480 --> 00:39.230
two interesting things are happening,

00:39.270 --> 00:47.400
the first thing is that the Asia column in our visualization where we selected it is kind of highlighted and the maybe

00:47.400 --> 00:52.410
more impressive thing is that the left visualization also changed.

00:52.560 --> 00:59.390
We only can see data for Asia right now in that visualization, let's click on to Asia again,

01:00.220 --> 01:02.940
now it is the same way it was before

01:03.010 --> 01:07.100
and select Europe. It's the same behavior,

01:07.280 --> 01:13.910
we can also see that we now highlighted Europe right here and we can also see the Europe development in

01:13.910 --> 01:16.330
our left visualization now,

01:16.490 --> 01:18.400
why is this happening?

01:18.860 --> 01:26.300
Well if you remember back, the interface video, we had an option named interactions

01:26.840 --> 01:32.660
and we can find that as soon as we select a visualization, go to the format ribbon

01:32.920 --> 01:39.150
and now in that left part right here, what if I click that?

01:39.400 --> 01:41.050
Did you see what changed?

01:41.050 --> 01:41.990
Let me do it again

01:43.140 --> 01:45.910
and now focus on the line chart,

01:45.930 --> 01:48.600
so on the left chart and I select it again

01:51.730 --> 01:56.060
and what you can see right here is that we have two new symbols, right?

01:56.230 --> 02:00.500
This filter and this none symbol.

02:00.730 --> 02:02.490
What does this mean?

02:02.650 --> 02:06.570
Let's maybe select the none first, like this,

02:07.960 --> 02:11.280
then we can see that we have our initial visualization back

02:11.500 --> 02:13.380
but I still selected Europe right,

02:13.390 --> 02:14.220
so let me unselect

02:14.230 --> 02:17.740
Europe and select North America,

02:18.020 --> 02:19.480
this doesn't work anymore.

02:19.820 --> 02:25.790
If I change that back up here to the filter, then it gets filtered.

02:25.800 --> 02:32.760
So this means we can interact between our visualizations and we can define how this interaction should

02:33.090 --> 02:34.950
impact the other visualization,

02:34.950 --> 02:38.080
so in that case either with a filter or not at all.

02:38.520 --> 02:39.980
Let's keep that filter.

02:39.990 --> 02:40.710
Now let me click

02:40.700 --> 02:43.760
North America again, like this

02:43.770 --> 02:51.620
and if I now select the left visualization, then you can see that we now have three options in our column chart

02:51.640 --> 02:54.220
right here. We have that filter,

02:54.640 --> 03:00.630
we have that none and we have that highlight. At the moment, highlight is selected,

03:01.190 --> 03:02.180
what does that mean?

03:02.180 --> 03:09.590
So if I press right here for instance, didn't work, now it works, then we can see that Asia is highlighted because

03:09.590 --> 03:12.450
we selected Asia in that left visualization,

03:12.620 --> 03:17.880
we can also do that with Africa of course, like this.

03:18.110 --> 03:21.280
So what if we change that from highlight to filter?

03:21.660 --> 03:24.000
Let's click right here,

03:24.380 --> 03:29.600
then we only see Africa, so we only see the selected region.

03:29.660 --> 03:31.350
We can try that again like this,

03:31.460 --> 03:35.050
now we can see Europe. If we select none,

03:35.390 --> 03:37.410
then it doesn't change at all,

03:37.460 --> 03:41.830
so we can click whatever we want right here, didn't work, now it worked,

03:44.560 --> 03:47.330
now it worked and now it worked.

03:47.340 --> 03:50.940
So basically, this doesn't impact that visualization at all

03:51.210 --> 03:56.040
but let's switch it back to highlight and click again, here.

03:56.460 --> 03:59.130
So this is all interesting right,

03:59.310 --> 04:01.490
let me just do this so that you can see more.

04:01.530 --> 04:03.120
So this is interesting right,

04:03.150 --> 04:06.410
we have interactions between different visualizations,

04:06.570 --> 04:14.100
we can edit that interactions and the interactions are different depending on the visualization that

04:14.100 --> 04:14.980
you selected,

04:15.150 --> 04:21.640
so we only had the filter to the left and we have the filter and the highlight option to the right.

04:21.660 --> 04:26.890
So this is it, what we can do with the interactions. As we are done right here,

04:26.910 --> 04:32.190
we can now leave that interactions menu by simply clicking again onto the edit interactions button right

04:32.190 --> 04:34.590
there, like this.

04:34.590 --> 04:42.930
So as we now did that, we want to take a look at another feature, the so-called tooltips because if

04:42.930 --> 04:48.650
I select the left visualization and look right here, then we have the axis,

04:48.740 --> 04:55.920
we have the legend, the values but the tooltips, well we don't have any information in here at the moment.

04:55.920 --> 04:57.460
Now what could that be?

04:57.900 --> 05:04.370
Well to understand that, let me first move the mouse over that line right here for instance. As you can

05:04.370 --> 05:10.450
see in this box, you can see all the information that we have in our visualization, 

05:10.460 --> 05:16.400
so the year, the region and the corresponding population, nothing more.

05:16.400 --> 05:25.730
Now what if I go back to our fields column and use our population, so that female population as

05:25.730 --> 05:32.210
percentage here in the total population measure that we created? Let me use that and drag it to the tooltips

05:32.630 --> 05:34.930
like this.

05:35.400 --> 05:36.840
Nothing changed, right?

05:36.870 --> 05:39.320
The chart looks actually the same,

05:39.330 --> 05:42.100
the only thing that changed is the chart title, right here

05:42.570 --> 05:48.200
but the content, no change. Let me move the mouse again over one of the lines.

05:49.940 --> 05:56.090
This looks different now right because now we can see that we have that percentage here of the female

05:56.090 --> 05:56.900
population

05:57.080 --> 05:59.550
also in our window right here,

05:59.840 --> 06:06.620
so we have an additional information and that is not directly visible in the chart but that becomes visible

06:06.800 --> 06:10.580
as soon as you move the mouse over a certain data point

06:10.730 --> 06:12.360
and this is what a tooltip does.

06:12.470 --> 06:17.580
It simply helps you to add some information that you don't want to display directly in the chart,

06:17.640 --> 06:19.020
so right here

06:19.490 --> 06:24.920
but if you move the mouse right here, you can add the information, like that.

06:24.970 --> 06:29.960
So we now understood all of the fields that we have in that line charts, right here

06:31.100 --> 06:37.280
but if I select the right visualization, we have the axis, the legend,

06:37.280 --> 06:41.320
we don't need that right here so we don't need a field but we know what that is,

06:41.390 --> 06:42.760
the tooltips, yes

06:42.770 --> 06:44.070
we just learned that

06:44.660 --> 06:47.290
but what about that color saturation right here?

06:48.370 --> 06:51.190
Let's learn what that is in the next video.
