00:02.560 --> 00:06.380
We started the work on our first real course project,

00:06.640 --> 00:11.170
time to connect Power BI desktop to the first source files, let's do that.

00:12.520 --> 00:20.110
So this is the first data that we want to import into Power BI desktop or into the query editor to be more

00:20.110 --> 00:27.910
precise, as you can see by the names, we have three csv files with population data by country and

00:27.910 --> 00:29.290
for different periods.

00:29.290 --> 00:34.630
Now the only important information at the moment actually is that we have three files and we have csv

00:34.630 --> 00:37.030
files, now that we know that,

00:37.180 --> 00:42.580
let's go back to our project Power BI desktop file and see how we can import the data we see right here.

00:43.750 --> 00:46.690
Back in the query editor of our project file

00:46.930 --> 00:52.690
and if we now go to the home ribbon and then press that new source button, we can connect Power BI

00:52.700 --> 00:56.080
desktop or the query editor actually to the source files.

00:56.080 --> 01:01.290
Now if you press the upper part of the button, the details get data menu opens,

01:01.300 --> 01:02.650
this is one option,

01:02.650 --> 01:08.230
if we close that and we click the lower part of the button, we see that we get a most common source

01:08.230 --> 01:08.910
overview,

01:09.040 --> 01:14.380
so this might help you to navigate faster and to select the selected source files quicker.

01:14.680 --> 01:20.260
Nevertheless if you click onto more, you simply have the same Get Data menu as if you would click

01:20.260 --> 01:22.540
that new source button in the upper part.

01:22.540 --> 01:29.530
Now what we see right here is an overview of all the data connection types that are available in

01:29.530 --> 01:30.640
Power BI desktop

01:30.880 --> 01:33.780
and as you can see, this is quite a lot.

01:33.780 --> 01:40.830
So to make the navigation easier, this overview is also categorized by different file types as we can see

01:40.840 --> 01:41.690
right here,

01:41.710 --> 01:47.450
so we have file like csv which is the one we need in our case, we have database like SQL

01:47.560 --> 01:48.340
server

01:48.760 --> 01:57.560
and by the way, I have to make a note. At the moment or in this module actually, we will only connect Power

01:57.640 --> 01:59.630
BI desktop to csv files,

01:59.650 --> 02:06.100
so a rather basic connection probably. If you want to know more on how to connect Power BI desktops to

02:06.100 --> 02:12.330
more advanced things like a database, just have a look at one of the later sections of that course

02:12.610 --> 02:18.040
but in this module, we will only talk about that basic csv connections as I just said.

02:18.460 --> 02:24.250
So after knowing that, we can just take a quick look at the Azure connections, so that Microsoft service,

02:24.760 --> 02:31.900
at online services like Facebook, Github and lots of other things and other like web which we used in

02:31.900 --> 02:33.050
the first module.

02:33.070 --> 02:40.450
Now as we know that, for the moment we only need file and the csv type, after we selected that, we can

02:40.450 --> 02:41.800
now press connect

02:42.580 --> 02:46.900
and now we have to select the first source file that we just had a look at,

02:46.900 --> 02:49.310
so that csv population files.

02:49.330 --> 02:52.670
Let me quickly navigate to the folder I located that files

02:52.720 --> 02:58.470
and please do the same and then we'll see how we can get those files into a query editor.

02:58.570 --> 03:05.440
Here I am in the source folder and now I will select the first csv file and by first, I mean the oldest

03:05.440 --> 03:05.860
file,

03:05.860 --> 03:08.530
so the 1950 - 1999 file.

03:08.860 --> 03:14.130
So I selected that and press now open, now it takes a few seconds

03:14.140 --> 03:22.120
and here we see the overview on how to create the query editor understands the structure of that file.

03:22.390 --> 03:28.300
So we could talk about more things like set different delimiters but as in this case, the format seems

03:28.300 --> 03:29.040
to be fine,

03:29.050 --> 03:30.220
we can simply press OK.

03:31.460 --> 03:37.550
Now we loaded our first query into the query editor and we can see it in the left column

03:37.610 --> 03:43.270
where we have the name of that query and in the center where we see the data. Short note,

03:43.370 --> 03:45.090
you can also see in the formula bar

03:45.140 --> 03:52.600
what we did, so we connected that query to a file located in the folder where the file is located,

03:52.610 --> 03:54.200
in my case it is the folder right here,

03:54.230 --> 03:58.010
in your case this is another folder and we have that applied step,

03:58.010 --> 04:01.920
so that connection to the source file also displayed right here.

04:02.330 --> 04:09.530
Now after knowing that, let's quickly import the remaining two queries and I do that quicker now as the

04:09.530 --> 04:12.580
process is the same as for this first query.

04:12.650 --> 04:16.020
So I'll go to new source in the lower part of the button,

04:16.200 --> 04:24.800
csv, select the second file, press open and now we see that structure is fine but we can really

04:24.800 --> 04:26.990
see that we have some N/A's in here,

04:26.990 --> 04:29.290
so we might take care about that later.

04:29.570 --> 04:30.930
So let's press OK,

04:31.070 --> 04:34.520
now you imported the second query as we can see right here,

04:34.680 --> 04:41.650
now let's do that one last time for the third query, text csv, fourth query open,

04:41.780 --> 04:44.150
now this seems to be fine also,

04:44.160 --> 04:45.650
let's press OK

04:46.220 --> 04:47.660
and now we did it.

04:47.840 --> 04:52.650
We now have three queries in our query editor and this was simple, right?

04:52.670 --> 04:59.510
So now it's time to start the real shaping and cleaning of the data because if we click through that

04:59.510 --> 05:04.920
queries, we see that there are things that should not be the way they are right here.

05:05.360 --> 05:08.210
Let's take a look at that in the next video.
