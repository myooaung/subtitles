00:02.590 --> 00:10.920
We can now identify the maximum value of each row but we still have to create that categorization,

00:11.140 --> 00:12.320
let's do this right now.

00:13.400 --> 00:20.390
So we created our Age-Group Max column right here and now we want to create another column

00:20.390 --> 00:27.140
and in this column, we want to be able to define the content of this column depending on what we see

00:27.230 --> 00:29.520
in that Age-Group Max column.

00:29.540 --> 00:36.260
So basically we need a conditional column and to create such a conditional column, you can simply go

00:36.260 --> 00:42.710
to the add column ribbon again and you can find exactly that function, conditional column

00:42.710 --> 00:50.600
up here, let's press that and as you can see, you now have different options how you want to define that

00:50.600 --> 00:51.960
conditional column.

00:51.980 --> 00:54.470
Now the first thing you should define is the name,

00:54.710 --> 00:59.540
let's name it category maybe, like this.

00:59.570 --> 01:00.790
So this is it and

01:00.830 --> 01:01.520
let me now

01:01.520 --> 01:04.530
drag that down a little bit right here.

01:04.820 --> 01:09.610
So we now have to define what should be displayed depending on a certain condition

01:09.620 --> 01:10.780
in another column,

01:10.880 --> 01:19.280
so in our case this would simply mean that if the Age-Group Max column, so the column we created not

01:19.310 --> 01:25.800
equals but is equal or less or less than equal value,

01:25.840 --> 01:27.590
well what value do we take?

01:27.760 --> 01:35.640
We could take that Max, that four for instance right here, let's do that and let's call that baby for instance,

01:35.650 --> 01:41.860
so this means if we have an Age-Group that is below or equal four, this will be displayed as a baby in the

01:41.860 --> 01:43.100
new column.

01:43.120 --> 01:50.020
So this is one condition but as we have more age groups, let's add another rule, like this.

01:50.080 --> 01:56.020
So we again select the Age-Group Max and define that it should be less than or equal to

01:56.500 --> 02:02.260
and now I don't want to define each Age-Group of course because we have that information for each age

02:02.260 --> 02:03.170
group already,

02:03.190 --> 02:05.820
so I want to kind of aggregate the information more

02:05.920 --> 02:15.040
and this means I will not use the nine value right now but I would say that we could use the 14 as a second

02:15.040 --> 02:15.760
condition,

02:15.760 --> 02:22.590
so if it is less than or equal to 14, then it should be a child like this.

02:23.050 --> 02:24.730
Let's add another rule,

02:24.880 --> 02:29.650
so I will do it a little bit quicker now because I think you understood the basic concept,

02:29.650 --> 02:40.990
so we say Age-Group Max is less than or equal to, let's maybe say 19 right here, then this is a teenager

02:41.980 --> 02:43.450
like that,

02:43.450 --> 02:49.270
then we add another rule and let's say we go until the age of 29,

02:49.630 --> 03:00.360
so if the Age-Group Max is less than or equal to 29, this is a young adult, like this and one last

03:00.360 --> 03:01.550
rule maybe,

03:01.610 --> 03:04.380
so I'm doing the same thing that we just did

03:04.770 --> 03:09.690
and let's define the Age-Group until 64

03:12.490 --> 03:17.380
as adult. And now we defined all the rules,

03:17.410 --> 03:20.230
the only thing we have to add is if otherwise,

03:20.260 --> 03:26.970
so if none of this is true, then this should be a senior maybe, like this.

03:27.010 --> 03:35.030
So we now defined all of the conditions and can now press OK and now we can see that we categorized

03:35.060 --> 03:35.710
our data,

03:35.780 --> 03:37.180
so we have the baby right here,

03:37.220 --> 03:38.030
we have the child,

03:38.030 --> 03:41.460
we also have the child for this condition and so on.

03:41.540 --> 03:42.530
This looks good,

03:42.560 --> 03:48.410
the only thing we should do immediately is we should format that rows as text because at the moment,

03:48.410 --> 03:50.430
this is kind of a mixture, we don't want that,

03:50.570 --> 03:54.460
so let's press right here and format it as text.

03:54.800 --> 03:59.760
So we now created our second dimension table, the DIM-AgeGroup table,

04:00.230 --> 04:04.370
the only thing that's missing is that FACT-Population table,

04:04.490 --> 04:09.800
so the table in the middle, that kind of helps us to combine the two DIM table or the information of

04:09.800 --> 04:11.540
that two DIM tables.

04:11.960 --> 04:15.230
Let's create that FACT-Population table in the next video.
