00:02.620 --> 00:10.050
We made great progress in our initial project, time to continue. So we finish the work in that query

1
00:10.050 --> 00:10.860
editor.

2
00:11.190 --> 00:17.610
If you want to load the data into the data model now, then you simply go to the home ribbon like this and 

3
00:17.610 --> 00:20.050
press close and apply, right here.

4
00:20.310 --> 00:29.220
If we do this, then we can see that the interface changed because now we are in the actual data model

5
00:29.370 --> 00:34.800
and again, I have to repeat myself, you probably haven't seen that before, this interface and what you

6
00:34.800 --> 00:35.930
can do right here.

7
00:36.090 --> 00:36.900
Don't worry,

8
00:36.960 --> 00:40.570
we'll talk about that in detail throughout the course. For the moment,

9
00:40.590 --> 00:44.190
I just want to show you the basics that we need for our initial project.

10
00:44.610 --> 00:47.380
So we are now in the so-called report view,

11
00:47.670 --> 00:51.670
so we can create our visualizations in this area.

12
00:52.110 --> 00:53.300
We will do that soon

13
00:53.400 --> 00:58.350
but first we have to take a look at our actual data model. To do this,

14
00:58.410 --> 01:06.700
we simply change from the report view, right here to the data view, right there. And now you can see that

15
01:06.700 --> 01:11.590
we have our different columns and our table actually in that data model.

16
01:12.220 --> 01:16.600
What we have to change right here is the first column, this country column.

17
01:16.600 --> 01:18.070
Why do I want to change that?

18
01:18.370 --> 01:26.220
Well in this column, we have countries and Power BI has great functionalities to visualize country

19
01:26.220 --> 01:32.210
specific data but we have to tell Power BI that those are countries and not simple text.

20
01:32.680 --> 01:40.510
So to change this, we simply go to the modeling ribbon up here like this and now go to data category

21
01:40.690 --> 01:41.920
in this area

22
01:42.250 --> 01:48.280
and if you press that, then you can see that at the moment, we have uncategorized data which is wrong

23
01:48.550 --> 01:52.970
because we should select country right here because that's the type of data we have

24
01:53.530 --> 01:59.430
and we can find country right here. If we click that, nothing changed.

25
01:59.550 --> 02:00.830
No that's not true,

26
02:00.960 --> 02:02.730
we now have that symbol right here,

27
02:02.730 --> 02:04.530
so this seems to work.

28
02:04.860 --> 02:08.860
Let's finally create some visualizations right now. To do this,

29
02:08.910 --> 02:10.690
we have to go back to the report view,

30
02:10.920 --> 02:18.090
so we need to change from this data view back to here to the report view. And now to create a visualization,

31
02:18.130 --> 02:24.430
well you simply can go to this visualization column right here and select a visualization type by simply

32
02:24.430 --> 02:25.540
clicking it.

33
02:25.540 --> 02:29.270
So let's maybe create a stacked column chart, this one right here

34
02:29.890 --> 02:33.450
and after clicking it, you can see this tile.

35
02:33.730 --> 02:35.390
You remember that building block?

36
02:35.590 --> 02:41.680
And we can move it around of course but I will simply increase it now or increase the size so that you

37
02:41.680 --> 02:43.760
can see everything.

38
02:43.780 --> 02:48.250
So this is our tile now and we don't see a lot because we need data

39
02:48.710 --> 02:55.780
and to add data, you simply go to that fields column right here and now drag the GDP for instance because

40
02:55.840 --> 03:02.190
this is the data type that we want to visualize into the corresponding field of the visualization

41
03:02.200 --> 03:06.640
and this simply means that we drag and drop it from here.

42
03:06.640 --> 03:12.610
So I'm clicking and holding the left mouse button and now drag it to the value field right here, like

43
03:12.610 --> 03:15.700
this. Because I selected the vizualization,

44
03:15.850 --> 03:19.350
so this area now refers to that visualization.

45
03:19.360 --> 03:21.980
However this chart doesn't look good at the moment,

46
03:22.030 --> 03:24.250
so we have to add some more information,

47
03:24.280 --> 03:30.940
for instance the different years. To add the years, we simply select it right here and drag it to the axis

48
03:30.940 --> 03:39.140
area right there, like this. Now it looks better but I want to add more because you remember we also have

49
03:39.140 --> 03:45.470
that country data, so why don't we also add this data to our visualization? To do this,

50
03:45.470 --> 03:51.090
we simply select a country right here and drag it to the legend field right there.

51
03:51.680 --> 03:57.700
Now our chart looks better but I think we have too much information in that chart,

52
03:58.070 --> 04:05.150
so we might set a filter to only see the top 10 countries by the total GDP. To do this,

53
04:05.180 --> 04:08.800
we simply keep the visualization selected right here,

54
04:08.810 --> 04:15.260
now scroll down in this visualizations column and select the country right here.

55
04:15.260 --> 04:21.080
Now we can scroll down a little bit and change it from the basic filtering to the Top N filter, like

56
04:21.080 --> 04:21.980
this

57
04:22.130 --> 04:26.570
and now we can simply decide that we only want to see the top right here

58
04:26.570 --> 04:30.170
and if we click into that box right here and define the top 10,

59
04:30.590 --> 04:34.200
well the top 10 by what? By the GDP.

60
04:34.550 --> 04:40.970
So we simply again take the GDP right here and drag it into that by value field.

61
04:40.970 --> 04:48.770
Now we press apply filter down here like this and you can see that we now only have the top 10 countries

62
04:48.890 --> 04:58.310
in our visualization. But you remember, we worked on the data model and explain Power BI that we have

63
04:58.310 --> 05:00.360
data for different countries.

64
05:00.740 --> 05:03.870
So maybe there is a better way to visualize that

65
05:03.980 --> 05:09.890
and of course there is. If you want to change the visualization type, you can simply do this by selecting

66
05:09.920 --> 05:16.670
a different visualization in this area and a good visualization right here would be a world map, right?

67
05:17.210 --> 05:17.480
Now,

68
05:17.480 --> 05:20.290
the good thing is we have such a map right here

69
05:20.660 --> 05:26.420
and if we now click that and we of course still selected our visualization, so we click that now.

70
05:27.670 --> 05:32.820
Now the visualization changed and now we still have the annual data in here.

71
05:32.860 --> 05:38.260
If you want to exclude the years as you can see it right here and only display the total values, so the

72
05:38.260 --> 05:44.710
sum of all the years included in that data model, then you simply go to the fields column again and unselect

73
05:44.720 --> 05:46.310
the year right here

74
05:47.610 --> 05:55.440
and if we then click right here into this formatting area right here and add the category labels, then

75
05:55.440 --> 06:01.480
we can also see the names of this top 10 countries which makes the visualization even better.

76
06:01.950 --> 06:03.220
And this is it,

77
06:03.360 --> 06:05.430
we now finished our visualization

78
06:05.610 --> 06:13.160
and with that, our initial course project. And now that you saw some of the basic functions of Power BI Desktop

79
06:13.460 --> 06:20.690
and how easy to use it is, you probably want to know more. And you will of course! And Maximilian will

80
06:20.690 --> 06:24.320
show you now what exactly you will learn in this course.
