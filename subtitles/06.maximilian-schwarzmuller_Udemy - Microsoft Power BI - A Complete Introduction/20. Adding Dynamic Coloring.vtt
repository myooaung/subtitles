00:02.470 --> 00:04.530
How can we add color?

00:04.960 --> 00:08.400
It starts in our interfaces, there

00:08.410 --> 00:15.340
I want to go to my data point and each data point, each bar, what it will be in the end should have a color property

00:15.340 --> 00:16.400
of course.

00:16.420 --> 00:23.020
So here I will set color to string because it is red, green, something like that or a hexadecimal code.

00:23.080 --> 00:25.350
So that's the first place to do something

00:25.630 --> 00:31.930
but of course not the only place, we also need to make sure that we respect the color here in our visual

00:31.930 --> 00:37.000
transform function because that is where we extract the data and therefore also information about the

00:37.000 --> 00:37.880
color.

00:38.230 --> 00:44.170
How do we do that now? I'll do it right below here where I defined the maximum data and the data points,

00:44.700 --> 00:48.180
here I'll also set up a color palette

00:48.550 --> 00:55.480
and that simply is an automatically generated palette of colors which fits because we can have multiple

00:55.480 --> 01:00.370
bars and therefore Power BI can do the work about creating a color palette for us.

01:00.640 --> 01:05.920
It will be of type IColorPalette, an interface provided by Power BI since all the internals

01:05.980 --> 01:07.740
are managed by Power BI

01:08.110 --> 01:12.190
and here, I can now use the host I added as an argument,

01:12.220 --> 01:19.720
so the host we're getting here as a second argument, I can use the host to call the color palette property,

01:19.900 --> 01:26.260
so that's the color palette provided by Power BI so that we don't have to mix our own colors here. As a

01:26.260 --> 01:27.730
next step,

01:27.730 --> 01:33.610
I can now use that color palette down here where I push new items and you already have an error there

01:33.610 --> 01:37.240
because we need to set the color property, right, that is what we defined in the interface.

01:37.240 --> 01:38.580
That's the great thing about interfaces

01:38.580 --> 01:41.610
by the way, we were informed that something is missing here.

01:41.860 --> 01:47.350
So how can we set up the color now? We can use the color palette we got from the host

01:47.620 --> 01:56.110
and here we have a method, getColor, to get color, we simply pass a string.

01:56.110 --> 02:04.180
We can use our category for that and on category, we can use the values array and then we can access

02:04.180 --> 02:05.390
the current index,

02:05.410 --> 02:12.130
so just like we do up here and now however, I also need to transform this into a string, just as I do up

02:12.130 --> 02:14.220
here. With that,

02:14.260 --> 02:17.340
we're passing this string to get color,

02:17.410 --> 02:19.470
however that alone is not enough,

02:20.270 --> 02:26.000
we need to get the value of the color because getColor just gives us to color in some different

02:26.030 --> 02:30.970
format, with value we get it as a hexadecimal code which we can use. With that

02:30.980 --> 02:34.260
we're extracting the color but we're not using it yet.

02:34.640 --> 02:39.320
Where do we want to use it? In the update method of course because again, that is where all the displaying

02:39.320 --> 02:40.480
stuff happens

02:40.550 --> 02:47.030
and to be precise, we do it here where we assign a couple of attributes to our individual bars. Besides

02:47.060 --> 02:48.910
width and height and position,

02:48.920 --> 02:54.010
we now also want to define the fill which is the fill of this svg element,

02:54.050 --> 02:58.870
the color therefore and fill also receives the data

02:59.120 --> 03:06.080
and here of course I can then extract dataColor since we know that this will be present on our data

03:06.110 --> 03:07.190
element, right?

03:07.280 --> 03:13.440
With this in place if we hit save and we go back to our chart and we reload it,

03:13.610 --> 03:16.670
it's colored, that is awesome, right?

03:16.670 --> 03:23.180
That was a super simple change, just a couple of lines of codes and now we get a much more nicely looking

03:23.180 --> 03:23.970
chart.

03:24.220 --> 03:30.790
However what if I add a donut chart and add my values here too

03:31.070 --> 03:37.970
and now I select a value here? That updates it in the above chart

03:38.040 --> 03:40.720
but here, I can't select values.

03:40.950 --> 03:47.070
It would be nice if I could also select values here to update them in other charts, just as we are used

03:47.070 --> 03:49.670
to from the other built-in charts.

03:49.860 --> 03:51.930
Let's add such a functionality next.
