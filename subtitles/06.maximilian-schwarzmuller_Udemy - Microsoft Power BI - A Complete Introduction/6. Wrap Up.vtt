00:02.460 --> 00:08.390
In this module we had a detailed look at how we can use different data sources in Power BI

00:08.520 --> 00:14.400
and if you have a look at the get data field here, you of course see there are way more and I can only encourage

00:14.400 --> 00:16.160
you to play around with this.

00:16.320 --> 00:22.620
A lot of them or probably all of them are very easy to use since the wizard or this

00:22.680 --> 00:26.410
navigator you get here is really confortable to use for most of them.

00:26.760 --> 00:34.320
A lot of them also can be imported in different ways, for example text and web. If your web resource gives

00:34.320 --> 00:37.180
you back a csv file or JSON,

00:37.410 --> 00:43.590
well that will be handled by an appropriate import step here or import loader.

00:44.100 --> 00:48.390
And again just play around with these and use the one which suits your data,

00:48.390 --> 00:51.180
there are a lot of pre-configured options,

00:51.210 --> 00:53.780
so definitely there should be something which helps you.
