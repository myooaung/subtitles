In the last lectures, we finally got our own visual which is connected to our own data,

00:07.450 --> 00:17.290
really awesome but we can improve our code. It is fine for this visual but as it grows in complexity,

00:17.680 --> 00:24.010
it can be tough to handle it all and it is tough for Typescript to keep track of which type we're using

00:24.010 --> 00:29.650
where, it is a good practice to create your own interfaces

00:29.650 --> 00:32.660
and I'll do this in my modules here at the very top,

00:33.040 --> 00:36.730
I want to create a couple of interfaces, two to be precise.

00:36.730 --> 00:42.310
We do this with the interface keyword and the first one is for my bar chart, the view model and that

00:42.310 --> 00:48.170
is generally a good practice. For the data you're working with, create a view model or for the chart

00:48.170 --> 00:54.120
you are creating I should say, define which input values does your chart need.

00:54.190 --> 00:59.890
So here in my interface, what I need and this is simply created like a class,

00:59.980 --> 01:08.110
I want to have data points in my view model and these data points should be of type of another interface

01:08.110 --> 01:09.370
I have yet to create,

01:09.370 --> 01:11.080
so let's leave it out for now.

01:11.290 --> 01:17.690
I also want to have a maximum data field, number and you will recognize this pattern. Bar chart view model,

01:17.690 --> 01:21.230
the interface we created with data points and data.max,

01:21.250 --> 01:27.070
that's the type we use here for data info for example, so we can now assign our own interface as a type

01:27.220 --> 01:29.620
and that is one of the big advantages of interface,

01:29.680 --> 01:37.540
now our application is more safe and it's clearer. Now we clearly define that this is how data info should

01:37.540 --> 01:44.930
look like and no other way. We also can define that we will return exactly that in the end here,

01:44.980 --> 01:48.070
we return an object with data points and data.max.

01:48.100 --> 01:54.430
So right at the function definition after defining the arguments, we can define the return type and that

01:54.430 --> 01:56.740
is just an object of this,

01:56.890 --> 01:58.530
well schema here.

01:58.990 --> 02:00.310
So that's the first part,

02:00.370 --> 02:05.620
the data we're working with, we can also define this down here in the update method where I get the

02:05.620 --> 02:08.590
transform data, it is a type bar chart view model

02:08.590 --> 02:17.590
therefore. I also want to create another interface though, this interface is for the individual data

02:17.590 --> 02:21.320
point. I'll name it bar chart data point,

02:21.370 --> 02:23.460
this also is an interface

02:23.710 --> 02:25.890
and here, we'll have a value,

02:25.900 --> 02:32.320
this will be of type primitive value, that's a type provided by Power BI which means it's like a

02:32.320 --> 02:36.810
number, something like that, a simple value, no complex value.

02:36.820 --> 02:44.980
I also want to have a category, that will be a string and we should have semi-colons here, not commas,

02:44.980 --> 02:52.690
so make sure to have semi-colons here. For data points, the type will now be bar chart data point but

02:52.690 --> 02:54.100
an array of these,

02:54.130 --> 03:01.960
so like that. This is now my individual data point I want to use

03:02.150 --> 03:07.430
and now with that, we get more consistency in our set up and it's clearer and easier to understand and

03:07.430 --> 03:13.340
we make sure that we don't make any silly mistakes here. With our bar chart data point interface set

03:13.340 --> 03:16.370
up, we can go down and we don't hit it,

03:16.370 --> 03:24.160
our data points should be of type bar chart data point array and that is what we assign here, objects

03:24.190 --> 03:27.820
with category and value, that fits our definition up here

03:28.130 --> 03:30.910
and that is exactly the idea behind all of that.

03:31.070 --> 03:32.370
We know where we return,

03:32.390 --> 03:36.030
we know what we work with. With that in place,

03:36.050 --> 03:40.620
why don't we move on and add some color to our bar chart because that black,

03:40.820 --> 03:41.810
it's not that beautiful.
