00:02.690 --> 00:06.760
We want to create our first little project in Power BI Desktop,

1
00:07.110 --> 00:11.680
let's now download it and connect it to the first data.

2
00:11.710 --> 00:18.550
So this is the home page of Power BI that we saw in the last video. If we now go to products up here

3
00:19.210 --> 00:26.580
and select Power BI Desktop, then we have two options: Download and Advanced download options.

4
00:26.800 --> 00:31.510
If you press download, then the download will immediately start and then you can install Power BI

5
00:31.510 --> 00:32.120
Desktop

6
00:32.350 --> 00:38.460
but you couldn't choose your language and you can't change the language after you installed Power BI Desktop.

7
00:38.560 --> 00:41.230
So I would press advanced download options right here.

8
00:42.870 --> 00:47.800
If you then scroll down, then you can select the language you want to install Power BI Desktop in

9
00:47.910 --> 00:48.700
right here.

10
00:49.080 --> 00:52.140
I will now select English and press the download button

11
00:52.500 --> 00:57.550
and I hope you do the same and then you can simply follow the installation guide

12
00:57.690 --> 01:03.450
and after that, we will see each other when we start Power BI Desktop together for the first time.

13
01:05.110 --> 01:06.920
We installed Power BI Desktop,

14
01:07.090 --> 01:08.480
let's open it now

15
01:11.240 --> 01:15.860
and when you open Power BI Desktop, you can see this sign-in option.

16
01:15.860 --> 01:21.850
This is not necessary at the moment as we will work locally in Power BI Desktop.

17
01:21.890 --> 01:26.410
We will talk about that sign-in later when we talk about Power BI Service,

18
01:26.480 --> 01:32.390
the cloud application. if you want to sign in to Power BI Desktop right here, you can of course do

19
01:32.390 --> 01:33.160
that,

20
01:33.260 --> 01:38.540
the only thing you need to know is that you need a work or a school e-mail address,

21
01:38.660 --> 01:42.250
you cannot register with a gmail address for instance.

22
01:42.290 --> 01:47.800
However as we don't have to sign-in right here, we will simply click on to get data now, right there

23
01:49.890 --> 01:55.600
and now you can see that you can connect Power BI Desktop to multiple data sources.

24
01:55.610 --> 02:00.130
Now one quick note before we start: In this first initial project,

25
02:00.150 --> 02:06.210
so in this and the next two videos, I only want to show you how easy to use Power BI Desktop is and

26
02:06.210 --> 02:09.320
how quickly you can create your first visualizations.

27
02:09.720 --> 02:13.180
So in case you don't understand everything I'm doing right here,

28
02:13.320 --> 02:19.250
don't worry, we will talk about everything you see right here and about more throughout the course.

29
02:19.620 --> 02:24.330
So for the moment, just follow my guidance and enjoy Power BI Desktop.

30
02:24.360 --> 02:26.550
So back to our get data function.

31
02:26.820 --> 02:29.330
So we need data and we don't have any,

32
02:29.430 --> 02:33.450
so why don't we just get some data from the Web? To do this,

33
02:33.510 --> 02:39.370
we simply can click onto that search bar right here and type web, like this

34
02:39.900 --> 02:48.940
and if we now select the second option right here and press connect this button, then we can see that

35
02:48.940 --> 02:51.780
we have to enter a URL right here.

36
02:52.030 --> 02:56.310
Well as we don't have a URL right now, we have to look for one,

37
02:56.500 --> 03:03.060
let's do this. So a good dataset for our first initial project would be GDP data

38
03:03.060 --> 03:07.330
for instance, for different countries also. You can find data like that

39
03:07.470 --> 03:12.510
if you search for the IMF World Economic Outlook database,

40
03:12.510 --> 03:20.150
so the second result right here and down here, we have the link that we need. Another note: At the time

41
03:20.160 --> 03:23.940
when I recorded that video, the April 2017 version

42
03:23.940 --> 03:25.280
was the latest one.

43
03:25.470 --> 03:29.760
In case you watch this video later, you might have a more recent version.

44
03:29.790 --> 03:33.150
This doesn't change the applied steps that we will do right now,

45
03:33.150 --> 03:35.960
the only thing that changes of course is the data.

46
03:36.330 --> 03:37.870
Now let's click onto that

47
03:37.890 --> 03:41.830
April 2017 version right now, like this.

48
03:42.240 --> 03:46.540
Now we select by countries up here.

49
03:46.730 --> 03:54.610
Here we can select all the countries, here we click continue in the right part.

50
03:54.710 --> 03:57.080
We said that we want to have GDP data,

51
03:57.170 --> 04:01.570
so let's select the ones at current prices in US dollar right here.

52
04:01.880 --> 04:11.060
Press continue and now, one last time then we got it, press prepare our report right here and now we got

53
04:11.120 --> 04:12.700
a table right there.

54
04:12.740 --> 04:13.440
This is good

55
04:13.550 --> 04:16.210
and we could also download that table right here

56
04:16.610 --> 04:23.000
but we don't have to do this because we can now simply select the URL right there and copy

57
04:23.000 --> 04:25.650
it into our Power BI Desktop file.

58
04:25.940 --> 04:27.280
Let's do this.

59
04:27.350 --> 04:36.710
So I now paste the URL into this field and press OK. Now the navigator opened and the navigator allows

60
04:36.710 --> 04:41.330
us to select the information that we want to retrieve from that web page,

61
04:41.330 --> 04:46.820
so the information we want to connect Power BI Desktop to basically. In the left part, you can select

62
04:46.820 --> 04:48.580
the different parts of that page.

63
04:48.740 --> 04:56.000
So if you click onto document right here for instance, you see that this is not the table that we want.

64
04:56.000 --> 05:00.640
Let's maybe change from the table view up here to the web view, like this

65
05:01.030 --> 05:07.580
and now you can see that the page is categorized in different tables and we can also see that table

66
05:07.610 --> 05:11.500
null is not the right one but Table 1 is the correct table.

67
05:11.900 --> 05:17.720
So if we select that by ticking that box right here which is then also ticked in the left part right

68
05:17.720 --> 05:22.470
there and then take a look at the table view again right here,

69
05:22.760 --> 05:26.090
then we can see that we selected the correct data.

70
05:26.420 --> 05:31.620
Well now that we know that, we simply have to press - well what do we have to press now?

71
05:31.880 --> 05:33.080
We have two options:

72
05:33.200 --> 05:35.110
We have load and edit.

73
05:35.270 --> 05:38.550
Again, I will not talk about the details right now,

74
05:38.600 --> 05:42.730
you will understand the differences between those two options throughout that course.

75
05:42.740 --> 05:47.030
So just a quick information for the moment. If we press load,

76
05:47.030 --> 05:50.880
then we will immediately load the data into the data model.

77
05:51.020 --> 05:58.040
If we press edit, then we will first open the query editor. The query editor is kind of a separate

78
05:58.040 --> 06:01.820
tool in Power BI Desktop that allows us to prepare the data,

79
06:01.820 --> 06:08.210
so for instance to delete rows or delete columns or add columns or a lot more and then load this clean

80
06:08.210 --> 06:14.870
data into the data model. As we first want to prepare the data, we will click edit right here to open

81
06:14.870 --> 06:15.870
that query editor.

82
06:16.820 --> 06:18.530
Now let's press that

83
06:19.010 --> 06:24.530
and now you can see the query editor with our initial project data for the first time.

84
06:24.560 --> 06:27.140
Let's take a look at what we can do right here.
