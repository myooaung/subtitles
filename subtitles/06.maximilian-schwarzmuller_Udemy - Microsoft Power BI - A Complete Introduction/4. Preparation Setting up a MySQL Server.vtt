WEBVTT

00:02.750 --> 00:08.600
In the last lectures, we had a look at JSON data and that importing data from the web from a restful API

00:08.600 --> 00:09.760
for example

00:09.940 --> 00:16.250
and I want to conclude this module by having a look at how we can get data from a database, specifically

00:16.250 --> 00:18.380
from a MySQL database

00:18.620 --> 00:21.700
and for that, we of course need a MySQL database.

00:21.740 --> 00:27.020
Now feel free to skip this video where I set up the database and fill it with some dummy data

00:27.230 --> 00:30.760
if you already do have a MySQL database to connect with.

00:30.770 --> 00:33.880
So what I will do in the case that you don't have one,

00:33.950 --> 00:39.850
I'll go to mysql.com and since MySQL is free, you can run your own MySQL database for free,

00:39.860 --> 00:45.660
we can go to downloads and choose the community edition which you can find at the bottom here.

00:45.920 --> 00:52.730
Now then on the left, you may choose MySQL on Windows and download the MySQL installer to quickly

00:52.730 --> 00:57.120
get going with MySQL and installing it on your Windows machine,

00:57.260 --> 01:03.470
of course MySQL also runs on Linux and this is just an example because you probably are using a Windows

01:03.470 --> 01:05.750
machine if you're working with Power BI.

01:05.990 --> 01:11.990
So let's download this installer, we'll click on the link first and then at the bottom, you can choose between

01:11.990 --> 01:13.080
two options.

01:13.130 --> 01:19.190
The first one simply is the web installer, here also required files will be downloaded during installation

01:19.190 --> 01:20.120
process,

01:20.150 --> 01:21.630
the second one is the

01:21.780 --> 01:25.370
all is in the installer already alternative.

01:25.730 --> 01:29.800
Now since I won't install all features, I'll go with the web downloader,

01:29.810 --> 01:35.340
the first version here and you're prompted to login but you actually don't have to,

01:35.360 --> 01:36.400
you can just click on

01:36.410 --> 01:37.190
no thanks,

01:37.190 --> 01:39.110
just start my download.

01:39.320 --> 01:45.170
Now this will download the installer obviously and once it did finish, I'll walk through it together

01:45.170 --> 01:46.370
with you.

01:46.410 --> 01:51.650
So the download finished, let's now run the installer, hit run and now in the installer,

01:51.650 --> 01:58.340
we of course have to accept the license terms and here, I recommend choosing custom so that you can customize

01:58.340 --> 02:02.910
what will get installed. We can click next and now what do we need?

02:03.050 --> 02:09.680
We of course need a MySQL server, so the server running our database and just to make this really clear,

02:09.920 --> 02:15.540
this server will run on our local machine for testing purposes because we need a database to connect

02:15.540 --> 02:16.000
to,

02:16.130 --> 02:22.820
of course in a real scenario, that is going to run on a server, on a place in the internet somewhere.

02:22.820 --> 02:28.910
So here let's go to MySQL Server and choose the version which is appropriate for your operating system,

02:28.910 --> 02:31.690
add it to the list of to be installed

02:31.690 --> 02:32.660
features.

02:32.660 --> 02:39.110
We should also have a look at applications though because whilst we do not need the majority of these, the workbench

02:39.140 --> 02:45.470
is pretty handy to be installed because that is a tool running on our local machine which allows us

02:45.470 --> 02:47.200
to administer our database,

02:47.300 --> 02:52.810
so if we want to add some dummy data, add some tables, that is a tool we definitely want to use.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.050
So let's also add this to the list

02:55.400 --> 02:57.770
and with that we're done for now.

02:57.890 --> 02:59.720
You can now hit next

03:00.020 --> 03:03.020
and here, you can choose a place where to install it,

03:03.140 --> 03:11.270
once you adjusted this to your needs, you can hit next again and it will now install the two features or applications

03:11.300 --> 03:12.430
we selected.

03:12.440 --> 03:17.090
Now since I chose the web installer, it will start by downloading these packages and then it'll install

03:17.090 --> 03:17.590
them,

03:17.590 --> 03:19.550
I'll be back when it is finished.

03:19.670 --> 03:23.400
The installation did complete for me, so I can hit next

03:23.480 --> 03:25.710
and now we can configure the MySQL server.

03:25.730 --> 03:30.140
So let's hit next and let's choose the standalone server, we certainly don't want to set up a cluster

03:30.140 --> 03:32.600
here on our local machine, here

03:32.630 --> 03:35.450
the setting should be fine too. Remember the port number,

03:35.450 --> 03:41.390
we're going to need it later when we connect to database and tick show advanced options, so that we

03:41.390 --> 03:46.880
can configure a little bit more and walk through the full setup process. Next again and

03:46.890 --> 03:49.170
now we need to define a root password.

03:49.220 --> 03:54.890
Of course our database is password protected, so choose a password which you of course should remember

03:54.890 --> 03:55.870
thereafter and

03:56.100 --> 03:57.580
once you do this, you can click next,

03:57.580 --> 04:02.270
you could add more user but you don't really need to do that, in a typical, in a real scenario

04:02.270 --> 04:04.410
you probably do have multiple database users

04:04.430 --> 04:11.480
but here having the root user is all we need and we can click OK on this screen here where we decide

04:11.480 --> 04:14.100
how it should run on our Windows machine.

04:14.570 --> 04:19.670
We can click next here too, click next here on the advanced option so you could set up some login if

04:19.670 --> 04:25.640
you wanted to do that and then click execute and now it will apply our configuration, start the server

04:25.650 --> 04:27.520
and do all things it needs to do

04:27.560 --> 04:31.650
so that we have a running MySQL server, I'll be back once it is finished.

04:31.730 --> 04:38.120
It did finish so I can click finish and now we can actually click next one more time and then start

04:38.120 --> 04:39.590
the MySQL workbench,

04:39.590 --> 04:42.200
this tool we can use to administer the database.

04:42.260 --> 04:45.660
So let's hit finish here and it starts up the workbench.

04:45.710 --> 04:50.870
We can now connect to our database by clicking on it and here, we should enter that password you gave

04:50.870 --> 04:52.120
that root user.

04:52.340 --> 04:53.740
So I'll do that

04:54.020 --> 05:00.230
and with that, we're connected to our database server and that's important, to our database server.

05:00.530 --> 05:06.860
Now we can add a new schema which technically is like a new database on our database server because that's

05:06.860 --> 05:07.630
really important,

05:07.700 --> 05:11.290
it's a database server not just one database.

05:11.330 --> 05:14.090
So let's click this new schema button here

05:14.360 --> 05:22.580
and I will name it pbi-test and click apply to create this schema. You can now click finish and you have

05:22.580 --> 05:28.520
this new database on your bottom here. It has no tables though, so let's add a new table with this

05:28.530 --> 05:35.720
button here and we have to select a default schema clicking right on it and then set as default schema.

05:35.720 --> 05:40.250
Now click the new table button, here you can see the schema which was selected

05:40.610 --> 05:46.810
and in this new table, you can give it any name, so I'll name it pbi-data and that of course is totally

05:46.820 --> 05:47.620
up to you.

05:47.690 --> 05:54.740
Now you can actually drag this down, so that you could add columns because of course you want to have columns

05:54.740 --> 05:57.910
in your database table which will structure your data.

05:58.190 --> 06:04.070
You typically have an ID column which is an integer which is your primary key and not null,

06:04.070 --> 06:05.810
so make sure these two are checked.

06:05.990 --> 06:13.340
Then I'll add a new column, I'll name it region and this can be a var char with 45 characters which basically

06:13.340 --> 06:17.050
is a string up to 45 characters long, should also not be null

06:17.300 --> 06:21.460
and of course if I increase that, you can configure way more, right?

06:21.460 --> 06:23.950
If you're a SQL expert,

06:24.020 --> 06:26.530
definitely go ahead and go full nuts on that,

06:26.630 --> 06:33.550
I just want to set up a basic testing database. I'll therefore add a last column, the volume for our

06:33.550 --> 06:35.000
sales like this

06:35.300 --> 06:37.560
and that could be a decimal number,

06:37.580 --> 06:42.060
we can change the type here but I'll just make it an integer since I will use full

06:42.070 --> 06:45.510
whole numbers. I'll set this to not null too

06:45.810 --> 06:47.160
and then click apply

06:47.180 --> 06:50.450
and here you see the SQL command which will be executed

06:50.450 --> 06:54.410
and if you know how to write SQL, you can of course write your own commands.

06:54.560 --> 06:57.020
So I'll click apply here and finish

06:57.110 --> 06:59.740
and now you see that this new table was added.

06:59.870 --> 07:01.760
It is empty though of course

07:01.760 --> 07:04.630
and one quick and easy way of adding data is to right-click it,

07:04.640 --> 07:05.990
select the rows,

07:05.990 --> 07:09.430
of course there are other ways too of importing data and so on

07:09.740 --> 07:16.070
and here in the selected rows, we can now actually start adding rows. So I'll do this, I will add a new row with

07:16.070 --> 07:17.040
the ID one,

07:17.180 --> 07:21.040
here the region could be China with a volume 100, two

07:21.050 --> 07:25.930
could be the USA with 120, maybe name it

07:25.940 --> 07:34.910
USA like that though, three could be India with 110 and then maybe one last

07:34.910 --> 07:35.550
one,

07:35.780 --> 07:40.940
since I live there, choose your country, of course Germany, 80, something like that. Doesn't really matter,

07:40.940 --> 07:44.700
it's just for testing purposes so that we have some data to work with.

07:44.960 --> 07:49.820
With that we can click apply, here you see the insert statements which will be executed and hit apply

07:49.820 --> 07:50.550
again

07:50.630 --> 07:55.760
and with that you get a running MySQL Server with your own table, your own database and your own data

07:55.760 --> 07:56.710
in that table.

07:56.810 --> 08:03.260
And with that in the next lecture, we can actually connect to that service, to that database server and

08:03.260 --> 08:06.770
the database in the database server with Power BI.
