00:02.620 --> 00:10.180
Before we start creating our first visualizations, it's time to take a closer look at the interface of

00:10.180 --> 00:11.510
the report view.

00:11.620 --> 00:20.410
So here I am back in our project file and on the measures page, what if we want to create a new page?

00:20.740 --> 00:27.190
Well to do this, we can simply click onto that plus symbol right here, like this and rename that page

00:27.600 --> 00:29.940
by double-clicking it and naming it new

00:29.980 --> 00:35.020
for instance, if we now press enter, we have that new page name new.

00:35.320 --> 00:38.860
Now if you want to delete that page, you have two options,

00:39.070 --> 00:47.410
you can either right-click it, like this and press delete or click it again and now press that little x symbol

00:47.470 --> 00:48.710
right here.

00:48.910 --> 00:54.780
If you do that, the page will be deleted like this and then you press delete again.

00:55.100 --> 00:58.500
So this is how we can create a new page

00:59.060 --> 01:01.800
but what if we want to copy an existing page,

01:01.940 --> 01:08.300
so create a duplicate actually? To do this, we can simply right-click on the page that you want to duplicate

01:09.200 --> 01:12.570
and then press duplicate page, like that.

01:13.100 --> 01:20.240
So this is the main overview of that part down here, of the different pages that we have in our report,

01:20.810 --> 01:23.290
let's now focus on the ribbons up there.

01:24.480 --> 01:26.120
We are in the home ribbon now

01:26.370 --> 01:28.450
and I think you know that get data,

01:28.500 --> 01:31.600
recent sources, enter data and so on

01:31.680 --> 01:37.650
but if you look at this insert area right here, then you can see some new features,

01:37.770 --> 01:40.740
the first feature is the new page feature.

01:40.740 --> 01:46.590
If we click that, then we can see that we can create a blank page or a duplicate page,

01:46.920 --> 01:53.530
so this is basically the same functionality that we just saw when we talked about the pages, down here.

01:53.790 --> 01:56.090
Let's take a look at the next option,

01:56.340 --> 02:03.600
the new visual option right here and what immediately happens is that Power BI automatically creates a

02:03.600 --> 02:05.690
new visualization.

02:05.760 --> 02:09.810
In that case, we created a column chart, as you can see right here,

02:10.050 --> 02:15.720
if you want to change that visualization, then you can simply select another one like this for instance

02:15.940 --> 02:17.680
or like that.

02:17.900 --> 02:24.060
So this is how you can create a new visualization using the ribbon up here. In this module,

02:24.110 --> 02:30.020
we will simply create the visualizations by directly selecting it in that visualizations area

02:30.350 --> 02:35.960
but we'll talk about that in a few seconds. If you want to delete that visualization right here,

02:36.020 --> 02:38.550
then you can simply press delete,

02:38.570 --> 02:41.710
so this is the new visual button right here.

02:42.260 --> 02:45.210
Let's take a quick look at those three options,

02:45.590 --> 02:47.900
the first option is the text box,

02:47.900 --> 02:54.650
if we click that, then we can insert a text box into our report page and we can drag that around of course

02:54.770 --> 02:58.880
just like the visualizations and write something like hello,

02:59.090 --> 03:02.470
then you can of course select the entire, whoops,

03:02.510 --> 03:09.850
then you can of course select the entire word and change the font style, the font size right here

03:11.020 --> 03:16.360
and make it bold, underline it or change the alignment.

03:16.450 --> 03:20.770
We won't need that so we can click right here and press delete again

03:22.040 --> 03:26.040
and now we have another option, shapes, this one.

03:26.040 --> 03:32.350
If we click that, then we can see that we can insert different shapes into our report,

03:32.600 --> 03:34.790
let's try a line for instance.

03:34.790 --> 03:36.630
So we have that line right here,

03:37.070 --> 03:38.870
we can make it bigger,

03:39.320 --> 03:40.270
now I unselected it,

03:40.280 --> 03:40.820
sorry,

03:40.850 --> 03:47.900
so we can, we selected it like this and we can play around with the format, right there. So we can delete that

03:47.900 --> 03:50.800
again by pressing delete.

03:50.800 --> 03:52.880
So this is the home ribbon

03:53.050 --> 03:54.730
but we have another ribbon, right,

03:54.790 --> 03:58.180
we have that view ribbon right here. In that view ribbon,

03:58.180 --> 04:01.140
we have four main options actually.

04:01.150 --> 04:03.500
The first thing is the phone layout

04:03.850 --> 04:10.500
and as you can see, you now can insert your visualizations into a mobile phone style,

04:10.810 --> 04:18.190
for instance, if we select the left visualization right here and drag it into that stylized phone, then

04:18.200 --> 04:18.920
we have it

04:19.030 --> 04:24.290
and if you select it, we can increase it like this or like that

04:24.520 --> 04:30.570
and if we scroll down, we can insert the second visualization, this one for instance,

04:31.180 --> 04:37.210
leke this, click it and like that.

04:37.310 --> 04:40.740
So this is the phone layout, again

04:40.790 --> 04:47.810
we won't need that in that module so we can go back to our desktop layout right here

04:48.000 --> 04:54.260
and as you can see, we didn't change our desktop layout, we only worked in the phone layout.

04:54.270 --> 04:57.810
Another option is the page view right here.

04:57.810 --> 05:05.050
If you click that, then you can decide on how you want the page to be displayed in this overview. Now

05:05.050 --> 05:07.360
we have two more options left up here,

05:07.720 --> 05:08.870
show grid lines,

05:09.180 --> 05:10.230
let's click that

05:10.240 --> 05:16.690
and as you can see, you now have these grid lines in your report page which allow you to position your

05:16.900 --> 05:19.560
visualizations more precisely then

05:19.820 --> 05:25.510
and if you want to increase that precision, then you can also add these snap objects to grid option, right

05:25.510 --> 05:26.030
here.

05:26.910 --> 05:27.910
What's the difference?

05:28.110 --> 05:35.670
Well, I now selected that and if I now select a visualization and drag it to the right or let me drag it

05:35.670 --> 05:36.840
to the top first,

05:37.200 --> 05:48.980
then you can see that it only moves point by point, so down or up right or left. If I unselect that snap

05:49.050 --> 05:54.450
objects to grid option like this, then I can move it as I prefer,

05:54.810 --> 05:59.440
so let's keep it this way and let's unselect the grid lines also.

05:59.730 --> 06:03.600
So now we got that view ribbon, the modeling ribbon,

06:03.680 --> 06:10.230
well you know that ribbon already, so we will skip that but we have that format and data drill ribbons

06:10.230 --> 06:11.000
now

06:11.310 --> 06:15.040
and these only appear if you select a visualization.

06:15.060 --> 06:17.420
Let's go to format first right here

06:18.060 --> 06:21.080
and here we have well, two fields.

06:21.270 --> 06:26.480
We have the interactions and we will skip that for now and talk about that later

06:26.850 --> 06:29.120
and we have the range options,

06:29.610 --> 06:31.460
well let's talk about that arrangement,

06:31.590 --> 06:35.970
you might know that from other tools but I think it's good that you can see how this works

06:36.000 --> 06:45.810
in Power BI. So bring forward or send backward but if we simply select that visualization right here and drag it

06:45.870 --> 06:53.640
on top of this one, then you can see if I unselect it that this second visualization, so that number is

06:53.670 --> 06:55.660
on top of that column chart,

06:56.310 --> 07:04.840
if I select it and now go to send backward and send it to the back and click right here, then you can see

07:04.840 --> 07:08.220
that the visualization is now behind that column chart.

07:08.410 --> 07:14.910
If I select the column chart and press send back right here, then the initial visualization is in front

07:14.910 --> 07:16.580
of that column chart again,

07:16.740 --> 07:18.240
that's what you can do with that.

07:18.510 --> 07:23.880
Let's drag it right here again because I think it looks better and go back to the format menu which

07:23.880 --> 07:25.570
is still open.

07:25.650 --> 07:28.460
Now we have the align option right here,

07:28.500 --> 07:29.370
what is that?

07:29.640 --> 07:33.150
Well let's assume you want to do the following,

07:33.150 --> 07:39.510
you want to track that right here and now you want to align all of these visualizations to

07:39.510 --> 07:40.110
the top,

07:40.110 --> 07:47.340
so at the same height. To do this, you simply select one visualization, press and hold the control key,

07:47.430 --> 07:50.100
select a second one and a third one,

07:50.130 --> 07:51.770
now go to align,

07:52.230 --> 07:56.570
now we will align the visualizations on top like this.

07:56.580 --> 08:02.500
Now I have to bring some case into that for the next option, the distribute option,

08:02.520 --> 08:09.360
let me first use that and drag it to the left, right here for instance.

08:09.370 --> 08:13.540
Now let's again select all of the visualizations, like this,

08:13.770 --> 08:21.280
click distribute and if I now click distribute horizontally, then you can see that the perfectly distributed

08:21.280 --> 08:28.030
our visualizations. Let me click right here and only select one visualization then,

08:28.080 --> 08:30.640
then we have that data drill ribbon up here,

08:30.810 --> 08:33.670
we will talk about that later throughout that module

08:33.900 --> 08:38.950
and if you now click here, we see that we have our basic three ribbons again.

08:39.090 --> 08:42.000
So we understood the pages, we understood the ribbons,

08:42.210 --> 08:45.260
let's now take a quick look at the write-to columns,

08:45.360 --> 08:49.670
the visualizations and the fields. The visualizations up here,

08:49.770 --> 08:52.310
well you probably know that already,

08:52.440 --> 08:58.950
you can simply click in here, on that pie chart for instance and then you have the visualization

08:59.310 --> 09:05.370
and you can drag it around of course, as you prefer and you can change the visualization by selecting another

09:05.420 --> 09:06.480
visualization,

09:06.540 --> 09:08.580
we talked about that a few minutes ago.

09:09.080 --> 09:15.690
Now in that area right here, you can define what data should be displayed in the different segments of

09:15.910 --> 09:16.710
your visualization,

09:16.770 --> 09:19.210
so axis, legend and so on

09:19.740 --> 09:24.830
and this area changes depending on the visualization that you select.

09:24.840 --> 09:28.800
So we now have that line chart with those four options,

09:28.800 --> 09:34.950
if we use the column chart right here, then we have five options because we additionally have that color

09:34.950 --> 09:38.280
saturation. If you want to bring that with visualization to life,

09:38.280 --> 09:44.310
you have to add some data right here and these data can be found in that fields column.

09:44.300 --> 09:48.830
Here you can see the names of the different tables that you have in your data model

09:49.080 --> 09:54.240
and if you click onto that arrow right here like this, then you can see the different columns of the

09:54.240 --> 09:57.360
table and the measures,

09:57.360 --> 10:02.310
you remember those population measures that we created in the last module,

10:02.400 --> 10:06.930
we can also use them in our visualizations as we tried it right here

10:08.040 --> 10:14.810
but for the moment, we won't add any information to that visualizations, so we can close that and

10:14.900 --> 10:19.210
scroll down right here maybe to the filter area.

10:19.340 --> 10:21.990
We will also learn what that is in that module

10:22.100 --> 10:28.290
but as you can see, apparently you can set different filters in your visualizations.

10:28.850 --> 10:34.270
So the last thing of the interface I want to show you are those three buttons right here.

10:34.280 --> 10:36.210
Here we have the fields area,

10:36.980 --> 10:38.360
let me scroll up again before,

10:38.450 --> 10:43.670
so we know that fields area with the dragged data fields boxes right here.

10:43.670 --> 10:48.380
The second options is the formatting area, depending on your visualization,

10:48.410 --> 10:54.720
this changes of course also and we will talk about some basic formatting topics in that module,

10:54.800 --> 10:58.510
the last option is the analytics option, right here.

10:58.520 --> 11:04.220
This won't work at the moment because we don't have any data in it and we will also focus on the fields

11:04.550 --> 11:07.280
and on the formatting manuals in that module.

11:07.640 --> 11:08.900
So this is it,

11:09.150 --> 11:13.760
we now have a better understanding of the interface in the report view,

11:13.910 --> 11:18.440
so we are now finally prepared to create our first visualizations.
