00:02.700 --> 00:09.750
In the last video, we created our gender column but we have to put a little bit more work into that to

00:09.750 --> 00:13.510
make sure it looks the way we want it to look.

00:13.530 --> 00:20.600
So in that gender column, we see that we have population minus female and population minus male.

00:20.610 --> 00:28.560
Now this is not really good, right, because normally we want to have the female and male as the only information

00:28.770 --> 00:30.810
that is displayed in that column,

00:30.870 --> 00:37.710
let's change that. At the moment, I'm in the home ribbon and in the home ribbon, we can find the split column

00:37.710 --> 00:42.140
function which does exactly that, what you want to do right here,

00:42.140 --> 00:47.620
however this is one of the functions that is available in multiple ribbons

00:47.670 --> 00:52.380
as I said in the beginning, that this happens quite often in the Power BI desktop. So if go to the

00:52.380 --> 00:54.110
transform ribbon right here

00:54.330 --> 00:58.760
and then look to the middle of that ribbon, you'll see the same option.

00:58.830 --> 01:01.820
This has the same functionalities it has in the home ribbon,

01:01.830 --> 01:03.550
it's just here twice,

01:03.960 --> 01:07.850
so let's select this one and you can see that we have two options now.

01:08.100 --> 01:15.140
We can split the column, so the selected column by delimiter or by the number of characters, in our case

01:15.270 --> 01:17.400
I will suggest that we use the delimiter

01:17.550 --> 01:20.560
but as I want to show you as much as possible,

01:20.850 --> 01:24.130
let's also see how this works by the number of characters.

01:24.270 --> 01:33.390
So I'll select that and we have to define after how many characters Power BI has to split the column.

01:33.400 --> 01:37.550
We have population as the word that's in every row,

01:37.660 --> 01:40.150
so this is 10 characters.

01:41.280 --> 01:42.590
Let's now press OK

01:44.710 --> 01:48.110
and wait a few seconds because Power BI has to do that

01:49.910 --> 01:54.410
and now we see that the column was split into two parts.

01:54.440 --> 01:56.970
However I'm not really liking that,

01:57.000 --> 02:04.230
right, of course we could now replace that minus and find a workaround but that's not really good.

02:04.350 --> 02:10.910
So let's undo that by pressing the x and apply steps and go to the split column function once again

02:11.280 --> 02:18.480
and now select the by delimiter function, as we can see, Power BI automatically selected the delimiter

02:18.510 --> 02:19.900
we might want to have

02:20.220 --> 02:27.120
which is true in that case and we want to split it at each occurrence, which doesn't make a lot of difference

02:27.120 --> 02:30.600
in our case as the delimiter is only here once

02:30.780 --> 02:37.890
but in case you have multiple delimiters in one of the values, you can define after which one the column

02:37.950 --> 02:40.230
should be split into two parts.

02:40.230 --> 02:45.300
Now as this is fine, let's press ok and wait a few seconds

02:45.530 --> 02:47.230
and now this looks really good.

02:47.430 --> 02:55.020
Let's scroll to the right and we see that we have one column named population and one column named according

02:55.020 --> 02:59.520
to the gender. This population column is the column that we don't need,

02:59.730 --> 03:07.230
so let's go to the home ribbon and press remove columns and that gender too is what we need,

03:07.310 --> 03:11.830
let's simply double-click it and call it gender only.

03:12.200 --> 03:13.740
Now this is it,

03:13.880 --> 03:23.090
we now are actually done with our first cleaning and shaping of the initial queries. In the next video,

03:23.150 --> 03:28.200
I'm going to show you how to bring some structure into that query section right here.
