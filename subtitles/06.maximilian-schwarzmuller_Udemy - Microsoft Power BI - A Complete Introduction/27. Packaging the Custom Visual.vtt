Packaging our finished visual it's relatively simple.

00:07.240 --> 00:16.540
We have to quit this pbiviz start process and thereafter once you quit this process, in your project

00:16.540 --> 00:21.610
folder still, you can run pbiviz package. Now

00:21.670 --> 00:28.510
this will now build it all, bundle it up and give you a package which you can distribute and which you

00:28.510 --> 00:30.930
can use in Power BI Desktop.

00:30.980 --> 00:32.770
Now let's have a look at this package.

00:32.860 --> 00:38.750
You can find it in the dist folder, here this pbiviz file

00:38.890 --> 00:48.230
and now if I open up my desktop version of Power BI, I can go to file, import Power BI custom visual

00:49.130 --> 00:52.560
and there, I can now import it from this folder,

00:52.790 --> 00:59.750
so from the dist folder bar chart pbiviz. It was imported and now it has this default

00:59.750 --> 01:04.820
icon here, that is where you could change this icon.png file in the assets folder to get

01:04.820 --> 01:05.240
your own

01:05.240 --> 01:12.060
icon. If I click this now and I now add sales as a value and region as a legend,

01:12.200 --> 01:18.220
we see the same we created before now running in the desktop version

01:18.380 --> 01:25.220
our packaged and finished visual. And of course feel free to continue working on this and fine tune it

01:25.220 --> 01:26.260
to your needs.
