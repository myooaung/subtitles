00:02.280 --> 00:05.000
We created our first measures,

00:05.200 --> 00:06.490
let's continue.

00:06.880 --> 00:12.580
So we have our measure for the total population and for the average population,

00:12.640 --> 00:16.780
now what if we want to calculate total female population?

00:16.780 --> 00:19.910
We can do that but we have to use a more,

00:19.930 --> 00:24.470
well I would call it advanced formula but still you will see it's quite easy.

00:24.790 --> 00:32.500
So we will again use a new measure and name that measure population

00:32.660 --> 00:37.940
female, like this.

00:38.330 --> 00:45.650
So to calculate the total based on a condition, we will use the calculate formula and 

00:45.680 --> 00:46.940
this works like this.

00:47.060 --> 00:51.730
We simply write calculate and here you can see that became then apply some filters,

00:51.800 --> 00:55.720
so let's press tab and the expression that we want to have,

00:55.730 --> 00:58.040
well that's simply the sum, right?

00:58.070 --> 01:05.330
So I want have to the sum, press tab and the sum of the total population right here

01:06.700 --> 01:11.860
and we can close that and now we have to set the filter and to set the filter,

01:11.920 --> 01:19.700
we can simply write filter again, press tab and now we have to refer to the table where the filter

01:19.740 --> 01:20.760
should be placed to

01:20.860 --> 01:29.110
and this is the FACT-Population table, write another comma, again write FACT-Population and now select

01:29.320 --> 01:32.450
the FACT-Population population column

01:32.800 --> 01:34.060
and that's wrong.

01:34.090 --> 01:36.400
We don't need the FACT-Population column,

01:36.580 --> 01:38.560
we need the gender column, right?

01:38.560 --> 01:40.040
So let's change that,

01:41.190 --> 01:42.560
I hope you pay attention, right

01:42.570 --> 01:44.680
because otherwise we would do things wrong here.

01:44.880 --> 01:46.780
So the FACT-Population gender

01:47.070 --> 01:54.890
and if gender is equal to female, female like this.

01:55.250 --> 01:56.680
So this is what we did right now,

01:56.780 --> 02:02.620
let's press enter and see if it works or before we check if it works,

02:02.780 --> 02:06.740
let's quickly go through that formula again because it was a little bit longer than the initial ones we

02:06.740 --> 02:07.480
had.

02:07.680 --> 02:16.420
So we said we want to calculate the sum in the FACT-Population table in the column population,

02:16.420 --> 02:23.980
so this right here but only if I'm just translating that, only if the FACT-Population table

02:24.290 --> 02:28.730
and to be more precise, the FACT-Population table and the gender column,

02:28.730 --> 02:31.420
so right here, is equal to female.

02:31.640 --> 02:35.950
So only if we have female right here, it would calculate the total and

02:36.050 --> 02:37.180
that's what we did.

02:37.190 --> 02:39.700
So now that we understood the formula better,

02:39.800 --> 02:47.120
let's go back to our report view and create another visualization and to do that, we simply press

02:47.120 --> 02:54.450
escape first to unselect the currently selected visualizations and now select this card visualization.

02:54.530 --> 02:56.680
We will learn that in the next module of course,

02:56.690 --> 03:07.500
so no worries again and if I drag it right here and now select our population female right here, then you

03:07.500 --> 03:14.370
can see the total number of the female population throughout all of the period of course.

03:14.370 --> 03:16.500
So now we get that

03:16.860 --> 03:21.350
but what if you want to have the same thing for the male population?

03:21.600 --> 03:23.340
Well then it's quite easy, right?

03:23.460 --> 03:28.470
We simply can go back to the data view, select that formula

03:29.120 --> 03:30.360
and copy it,

03:30.880 --> 03:32.050
press new measure,

03:34.810 --> 03:37.230
enter the formula or paste the formula,

03:37.660 --> 03:46.370
rename it to population male and also change the gender from female to male, like this

03:46.660 --> 03:54.940
and press enter and now we've got the male population, and now I want to create one last measure.

03:55.300 --> 04:00.490
We now have the total population and we have the total population for the females for instance,

04:00.730 --> 04:06.880
so how could we now create a measure that calculates the share of the female population in the total

04:06.880 --> 04:08.410
population?

04:08.410 --> 04:17.800
We can do that quite easily because we can again create a new measure, call that percentage female in

04:17.950 --> 04:21.140
total for instance or also call it population,

04:21.140 --> 04:24.470
sorry because of that sorting we talked about

04:24.970 --> 04:33.870
and if you now write square brackets and now write p over population, you can see that you can also

04:33.870 --> 04:35.700
select our measures

04:35.970 --> 04:38.030
and this is also great functionality.

04:38.250 --> 04:43.040
As soon as you define measures, you can select them in your formula bar,

04:43.080 --> 04:48.420
so if you want to calculate the share of the female population in the total population, you can simply

04:48.420 --> 04:55.150
select the population female right here, press tab and now divide it by, again square brackets,

04:55.320 --> 04:56.300
population

04:56.430 --> 05:00.510
total right here and press enter.

05:00.690 --> 05:07.840
And now we have to go back to our report view, select our car chart and now simply select the population

05:07.860 --> 05:14.940
share in percentage of the females and drag it right here and now that you can see that this is not

05:15.120 --> 05:16.980
working as it should work, right?

05:17.130 --> 05:23.880
So we have the 0.5 and we would like to have that as percentage. To do that, you simply select the measure

05:24.240 --> 05:28.590
right here and if we now go to the modeling ribbon and the format area,

05:28.770 --> 05:33.480
you can simply format that as percentage, like this

05:34.090 --> 05:40.870
and now we can see that we calculated a share of 49.66% of the female population

05:41.080 --> 05:44.610
in the total population throughout all periods considered

05:44.980 --> 05:49.530
and we just did that with those easy measures that we created.

05:49.540 --> 05:52.700
Now this was a basic overview of those measures.

05:53.140 --> 05:58.660
As you saw in the official documentation, there are a lot more DAX formulas that you can use and that

05:58.660 --> 06:02.090
you can apply depending on the needs in your data model

06:03.190 --> 06:06.620
but as we now have a basic understanding of the DAX formulas,

06:06.820 --> 06:12.670
I think it's time for us to continue to the next module and think about how to create some great

06:12.670 --> 06:18.670
visualizations because at the moment, this doesn't look really good, right? Now before we do that,

06:18.760 --> 06:21.520
we have to do some minor things first.

06:21.700 --> 06:24.500
Let's have a look at those things in the next video.
