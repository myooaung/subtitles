We now finished the report view module. We learned how to use the interface of the report view, how

00:09.240 --> 00:17.040
to create line charts and column charts, how these charts may interact, how we can use slicers and how

00:17.040 --> 00:18.490
we can set filters

00:18.990 --> 00:20.330
and we learned a lot more

00:20.670 --> 00:27.000
but additionally, this was the last module that talks about Power BI desktop.

00:27.060 --> 00:34.310
So in the next module, we will leave that local area and take a look on how we can go on right now

00:34.770 --> 00:38.570
but before we do that, it's time for our next assignment.

00:38.820 --> 00:39.770
See you there.
