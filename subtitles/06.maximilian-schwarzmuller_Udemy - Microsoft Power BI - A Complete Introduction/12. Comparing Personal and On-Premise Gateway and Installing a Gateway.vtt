00:03.350 --> 00:10.010
Time to install our personal gateway now. So we know that we have to use the personal gateway in our

00:10.010 --> 00:11.300
situation,

00:11.300 --> 00:14.790
so let's select that and press next

00:14.870 --> 00:16.920
and now we're in the installation wizard,

00:17.090 --> 00:22.850
so this will guide you through the installation and as soon as we finished the installation, we will start

00:22.850 --> 00:23.930
our gateway together

00:23.930 --> 00:30.310
the first time. Now we completed the installation and can click onto launch, right here

00:31.830 --> 00:34.420
and now the gateway seems to work.

00:34.860 --> 00:40.130
Let's go back to Power BI service and see if we can now press that refresh button.

00:40.590 --> 00:43.290
So let me close the installation first,

00:43.350 --> 00:49.710
here we are back and now we can see that the gateway is still offline,

00:49.890 --> 00:50.910
not good.

00:50.910 --> 00:53.100
Let's right click here and refresh the page

00:53.100 --> 00:55.720
maybe, this doesn't work

00:56.040 --> 01:01.740
and the reason is simple, it doesn't work because the gateway didn't start yet

01:01.740 --> 01:03.230
although we click launch.

01:03.240 --> 01:11.640
So if we press windows and look for personal gateway, then we can find it right here.

01:11.700 --> 01:18.480
So if we click that, it will check some more things and we are signed in,

01:18.480 --> 01:20.570
this is correct, so we can press next right here,

01:21.930 --> 01:23.100
success.

01:23.160 --> 01:24.610
Now we made it,

01:24.630 --> 01:28.640
now we installed the gateway and now it also started.

01:28.800 --> 01:35.030
So if we finished right here now, like this and reload the page of course one last time,

01:37.830 --> 01:42.500
then we can see that we finally have a gateway connection established.

01:42.500 --> 01:43.830
This is really great

01:44.120 --> 01:50.090
but before we really work with that gateway and see how we can schedule a refresh, let's scroll down

01:50.090 --> 01:51.770
a little bit right here

01:52.880 --> 01:56.530
because we have to talk about the data source credentials.

01:56.810 --> 02:00.620
Well we can quickly update them if we click onto edit credentials right here,

02:00.830 --> 02:03.790
so you see that this is the connection to our source files, if we

02:04.010 --> 02:04.840
click right there,

02:06.040 --> 02:11.500
we set the authentication method simply to Windows and press sign-in.

02:11.510 --> 02:12.600
So this is fine,

02:12.770 --> 02:20.590
do the same thing for the second credential and for the third and for the fourth, like this.

02:20.660 --> 02:22.220
Now let's scroll down more

02:22.430 --> 02:26.220
and before that, open that schedule refresh menu right here.

02:26.600 --> 02:32.600
So now we can keep our data up-to-date and how does this work? Well

02:32.720 --> 02:39.230
you simply press onto on right here and now we can decide when we want to refresh our data, so daily

02:39.230 --> 02:40.100
or weekly.

02:40.130 --> 02:47.140
So you could decide daily now and then your timezone and then add a time, like this,

02:47.300 --> 02:53.270
so you could say 10:00am like that

02:53.270 --> 03:01.140
and then we could apply that refresh right here. So we now scheduled a refresh for our project file,

03:01.170 --> 03:07.170
this means if we would now change something, this change would automatically implement it into our existing

03:07.170 --> 03:07.930
dataset

03:08.070 --> 03:13.280
as we set that refresh right here, this is really good.

03:13.450 --> 03:20.510
Now if we go back to our workspace right here and go back to our dataset right there, then we can see

03:20.510 --> 03:22.130
that we now schedule the refresh,

03:22.130 --> 03:28.390
so if you click right here, we are back in the menu and this works and we can see our refresh options

03:28.420 --> 03:36.130
right there like we did it and if we go back to my workspace now, to the dataset and press refresh now,

03:36.940 --> 03:39.670
then the data will be instantly refreshed.

03:39.850 --> 03:41.020
Now let's try that,

03:41.020 --> 03:41.790
click it right here

03:42.990 --> 03:48.700
and if you look at the last refresh date, then you will see that this should update now to the current

03:48.700 --> 03:51.640
time. And it is done

03:51.670 --> 03:58.510
and as you can see, we now have the latest data in our Power BI service application.

03:58.510 --> 04:03.500
Additionally, you can also see our next refresh of course that we installed before.

04:03.820 --> 04:05.950
So what have we done so far?

04:06.580 --> 04:14.680
We were able to import the data from Power BI Desktop into Power BI service. We then created that

04:14.740 --> 04:17.610
new report and created dashboards.

04:18.160 --> 04:20.760
Additionally we now installed a gateway,

04:20.950 --> 04:28.510
so we are able to dynamically update the data that we have in Power BI desktop to our Power BI service application.

04:28.870 --> 04:34.390
But so far, we only worked alone right because at the moment, we are only talking about the connection

04:34.510 --> 04:38.710
between Power BI desktop and Power BI service.

04:38.710 --> 04:41.490
What about that sharing and collaborating?

04:41.740 --> 04:46.620
So what if we want to work together on data and then share this data?

04:47.440 --> 04:50.540
This is something we have to think about now, right?

04:50.770 --> 04:54.060
Let's think about that in more detail in the next video.
