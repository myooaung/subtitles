WEBVTT

00:02.480 --> 00:05.820
So we talked about the workflow of Power BI Desktop,

00:05.990 --> 00:08.810
now it's time to understand the interface.

00:08.810 --> 00:15.800
So here we have the final output of our GDP project and this means we are in the report view with

00:15.800 --> 00:17.700
our final visualization.

00:17.720 --> 00:24.880
So one important note before we start, everything we will see in that video is the actual data model.

00:25.070 --> 00:29.270
So the first step, the query editor, with the data preparation,

00:29.270 --> 00:31.640
this is not presented right here,

00:31.670 --> 00:38.000
this is a separate menu that has to be opened and we will cover the interface of that menu in the next

00:38.000 --> 00:43.530
video and the details on how we can work with that query editor in the next module.

00:43.550 --> 00:49.060
Nevertheless keep in mind that there is a big difference between the query editor where you prepare

00:49.060 --> 00:55.820
the data and the actual data you import into the data model which can be seen in the interface we were

00:55.820 --> 00:56.410
talking

00:56.440 --> 00:56.900
right

00:57.190 --> 00:59.230
now about. After knowing this,

00:59.270 --> 01:01.040
let's start with the interface.

01:01.310 --> 01:10.040
So basically you have four core areas, you have the ribbons on top, you have that left column right here,

01:10.310 --> 01:16.130
you have that center part where you can see the actual content of each view and you have the columns

01:16.130 --> 01:17.720
to the right.

01:17.730 --> 01:25.100
Now I talked about view, the views can be selected in the left column. At the moment, we are in the report

01:25.100 --> 01:27.070
view and it is displayed right here.

01:27.620 --> 01:31.960
The report view is the view where we generate our visualizations.

01:32.090 --> 01:37.560
Now if we switch to the data view which is the second button, then we see the actual data model.

01:37.580 --> 01:39.630
So the data we created

01:39.710 --> 01:46.030
and we worked on throughout that data modeling step. The third button opens the relationship view,

01:46.310 --> 01:51.570
this is the view that allows us to connect the tables in the data model with each other.

01:51.950 --> 01:53.400
So that's the first thing you have to know.

01:53.510 --> 01:58.670
You have three views and you can select those views by clicking onto the different buttons in the left

01:58.670 --> 02:00.200
column.

02:00.200 --> 02:07.130
Now let's focus on the right part of the screen, that visualisations and that field column. The visualizations

02:07.160 --> 02:07.640
column,

02:07.670 --> 02:13.300
well that column allows us to select different visualizations that we have in Power BI Desktop.

02:13.430 --> 02:21.320
For instance, if I select our world map like this and then press onto that column chart, then the visualisation

02:21.410 --> 02:22.830
type changes.

02:22.880 --> 02:27.530
We did not change anything about the content that should be displayed,

02:27.530 --> 02:34.280
if I want to change the content, then I have to change the fields column or the selected columns in the

02:34.550 --> 02:35.280
fields column.

02:35.330 --> 02:37.830
So at the moment, we selected country and GDP

02:38.270 --> 02:43.140
and we dont have a lot of data to play around with at the moment, so I don't change a thing right here.

02:43.220 --> 02:49.310
Now let's change that visualization back to our map that we had by simply clicking it and let's focus

02:49.310 --> 02:56.080
on that columns because now I will switch to the data view and in the data view, we see that that visualization

02:56.120 --> 02:57.310
column is gone.

02:57.360 --> 03:00.950
This has a simple reason, you cannot visualize anything right here,

03:01.010 --> 03:03.060
so you don't need that column.

03:03.080 --> 03:09.380
However the fields column is still here and this makes sense because you need that column for instance

03:09.380 --> 03:11.060
to create measures.

03:11.300 --> 03:14.880
You may not know what measures are at the moment but you will learn that,

03:14.900 --> 03:22.130
so don't worry but you can create those measures for instance in both views, in the report view and in

03:22.130 --> 03:23.000
the data view

03:23.600 --> 03:28.490
and this might be a nice help if you are looking at some visualization and you see that you're missing

03:28.490 --> 03:31.610
some important information that you need a calculation for.

03:31.910 --> 03:38.950
However in this course, we will focus on the actual data modeling and the creation of such measures in

03:38.950 --> 03:45.140
the data view and in the report view, we will really only create the visualizations and the outputs

03:45.320 --> 03:48.380
but you are free to work with Power BI Desktop as you prefer,

03:48.410 --> 03:55.220
so I just wanted to tell you that. Now if we select the last view, the relationship view, we see that the

03:55.220 --> 04:02.600
views column disappears and this makes sense because in this view, every content will be displayed as

04:02.600 --> 04:09.290
a box and by every content, I mean every table of the data model with the corresponding columns

04:09.530 --> 04:13.840
because this allows you to connect that tables and that columns with each other.

04:13.880 --> 04:19.610
However you might note that we have table 1 and then the column names which are equal to the table

04:19.700 --> 04:21.760
and the column names in the fields view.

04:21.800 --> 04:27.110
So basically it's just displayed differently with some different functionalities but the content is

04:27.110 --> 04:29.000
basically the same.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.950
Now we understand the left column, the center part and the right columns.

04:33.950 --> 04:41.240
So the last thing we need to understand is that ribbons part up here. At the moment we see five ribbons,

04:41.300 --> 04:44.350
this is because I selected our visualization,

04:44.360 --> 04:45.570
so our world map.

04:45.890 --> 04:48.910
Let me just unselect that by clicking into the report

04:49.250 --> 04:55.100
and now we see that we have three general ribbons, so the home, the view and the modeling ribbon. We'll

04:55.130 --> 04:57.160
talk about the file ribbon later.

04:57.530 --> 05:00.050
So the home ribbon doesn't change,

05:00.080 --> 05:06.170
the only thing that changes is the functionalities that are available depending on the view you selected.

05:06.590 --> 05:13.390
For instance, the new page functionality will only work in the report view, in the data view,

05:13.430 --> 05:15.350
we cannot create the visualizations

05:15.380 --> 05:18.400
so the available functionalities change.

05:18.440 --> 05:24.030
Nevertheless the home ribbon is available in all of the views as you can see.

05:24.440 --> 05:30.650
This is different for the remaining two ribbons, the view and the modeling ribbon. The view ribbon is only

05:30.650 --> 05:34.220
available in the report view because here you can play around,

05:34.220 --> 05:39.710
you can define how you want to display your report and you could also try out what your report looks

05:39.710 --> 05:41.460
like in a phone layout.

05:41.540 --> 05:45.920
You don't need that functionality in the data and the relationship view though,

05:45.920 --> 05:52.540
so if we changed the data view, we see that we don't have the view ribbon, the same thing is true in the relationship view.

05:52.940 --> 05:54.750
So that's another outcome.

05:54.860 --> 06:00.830
We know that the columns change and that the ribbons change depending on the selected view in the left

06:00.830 --> 06:02.050
column.

06:02.060 --> 06:05.580
Now let's see what happens to the last ribbon, the modeling ribbon.

06:05.600 --> 06:08.240
So here we can model our data,

06:08.240 --> 06:12.130
we know that and we can do the same thing in the data view.

06:12.350 --> 06:16.220
That's what we talked about, that you are free on where you want to model your data

06:16.340 --> 06:23.760
but we will focus on the data view for that modeling purposes. If we go to the relationship view, we see that the

06:23.760 --> 06:26.070
modeling options are well, reduced

06:26.070 --> 06:26.940
right

06:26.970 --> 06:31.290
and this again makes sense because you don't model your data in that view.

06:31.440 --> 06:37.290
You only create those relationships and you can do that if you go to the home ribbon and then select

06:37.290 --> 06:43.260
manage relationships. At the moment, there is not a lot to manage because we only have one table in our

06:43.260 --> 06:45.240
data model but this is how it would work

06:45.240 --> 06:47.390
and we will see how this works of course.

06:47.820 --> 06:48.730
So this is it.

06:49.020 --> 06:50.900
Let me now go back to the report view

06:51.300 --> 06:57.420
and by that, we now have a basic understanding of the interface of the data model.

06:58.180 --> 07:01.460
However, we still have that query editor, right,

07:01.540 --> 07:03.970
so that data preparation part.

07:03.970 --> 07:08.350
Let's take a look at the interface of that query editor in the next video.
