Welcome to this module. In this module, we'll have a look at how we can build our own visuals,

00:08.270 --> 00:16.010
so our own charts for Power BI. To be honest, Power BI ships with a rich library of charts

00:16.280 --> 00:18.110
and that might be all you need

00:18.290 --> 00:23.480
but it is great to know that you can build your own charts, it is great to know how that works and

00:23.480 --> 00:29.960
you can build these charts not just for you. You could also publish them and there is an official catalog

00:30.020 --> 00:35.540
of custom visuals, of visuals created by other people than Microsoft which you can browse, which

00:35.720 --> 00:37.730
might already hold the chart,

00:37.760 --> 00:40.010
the visual you were looking for.

00:40.310 --> 00:46.820
So in this module, we'll have a look at how we can set up our development environment to get started developing

00:46.850 --> 00:47.910
our own visuals,

00:47.960 --> 00:49.540
it's pretty easy, no worries

00:49.700 --> 00:51.590
and then how this works.

00:51.590 --> 00:52.800
Of course this module

00:52.800 --> 00:57.860
will just get you started with that, if you then want to dive deeper into this, you can do this, you

00:57.860 --> 01:01.050
should have the basic knowledge to then dive deeper into it

01:01.370 --> 01:02.910
but enough of the talking.

01:02.960 --> 01:07.020
Let's start diving into it and let's learn how we can build our own visuals.
