00:02.570 --> 00:07.050
We want to add a second dimension table, the DIM-AgeGroup table.

00:07.240 --> 00:13.120
Now to do this, we will follow the same approach that we learned for the DIM-Region table first,

00:13.120 --> 00:18.280
so the first thing we have to do is we have to create a reference to the population combined query.

00:18.820 --> 00:19.670
To do this,

00:19.690 --> 00:27.240
we right-click on population combined, like this and press reference. Now while this is loading,

00:27.250 --> 00:34.170
we can simply drag that to the data-model group already and now it is loaded

00:34.350 --> 00:38.040
and the first thing we should do is we should rename that query again.

00:38.040 --> 00:47.780
So let's go to properties, select the whole name and call it DIM-AgeGroup and press enter, like this.

00:49.030 --> 00:50.410
Now that this loaded,

00:50.410 --> 00:53.210
let's think about what columns we actually need

00:53.470 --> 00:58.420
and as we want to talk about age groups, well we only need one column here, right?

00:58.420 --> 01:00.500
We only need that Age-Group column.

01:00.790 --> 01:08.800
So let's select it and now go to the home ribbon, to the remove columns button right here, press the

01:08.800 --> 01:12.050
lower part of it and now press remove other columns.

01:12.250 --> 01:17.980
You remember with that command, you remove all the columns that are not selected at the moment,

01:17.980 --> 01:20.830
this is what we want, so we can simply press that

01:21.430 --> 01:28.060
and here we have it and now again we have to follow the same logic that we learn from the DIM-Region table.

01:28.270 --> 01:33.910
So the next thing we have to do is we have to remove the duplicates again because at the moment, we can see

01:33.910 --> 01:36.710
that each Age-Group is existing multiple times

01:36.790 --> 01:42.670
and this is not good because the DIM-AgeGroup table should only contain unique values when it comes

01:42.670 --> 01:43.980
to the different age groups.

01:44.140 --> 01:46.170
So let's remove the duplicates

01:46.300 --> 01:52.150
and as we are still in the home ribbon right here, we can go to the remove rows button right now, click

01:52.150 --> 01:56.760
it and press remove duplicates, like this.

01:57.010 --> 02:03.550
So now we have a unique column with all the different age groups that we have in our initial population

02:03.550 --> 02:05.280
combined query.

02:05.290 --> 02:07.360
Now what do we want to add?

02:07.660 --> 02:12.880
If you think back about our illustration which showed us what we want to have in that DIM-AgeGroup

02:12.880 --> 02:13.720
table,

02:13.720 --> 02:16.060
so we want to have the Age-Group, 

02:16.120 --> 02:17.560
this is something we have already,

02:17.780 --> 02:21.880
we want to have the AgeGroup-ID and the categories,

02:21.910 --> 02:24.260
now let's think about the AgeGroup-ID first.

02:24.340 --> 02:26.470
We need something like this,

02:26.590 --> 02:28.410
let's go to the DIM-Region table,

02:28.540 --> 02:34.430
something like the country ID, So one column with a unique number for each of the age groups.

02:34.450 --> 02:38.210
Now we don't have that at the moment in our DIM-AgeGroup table,

02:38.590 --> 02:45.280
the good thing is if we go to a new ribbon which we didn't have a look at so far, the add color ribbon, we

02:45.280 --> 02:50.700
can see that we have multiple options on what you want to do with the columns.

02:50.760 --> 02:56.380
Now if you look at this index column function right here, this might be the thing that we need, right?

02:56.560 --> 03:02.530
So if you click onto that arrow right here, you can see that you can create an index column and you can

03:02.530 --> 03:04.220
even define the starting point,

03:04.420 --> 03:10.360
so you can start counting from zero, from one or we can define a custom index column.

03:10.570 --> 03:13.220
I don't think we need a custom index column right now,

03:13.270 --> 03:16.930
so I think we should just select the from one function right there.

03:17.200 --> 03:19.780
Let's click that,

03:19.980 --> 03:24.960
now it takes a few seconds and now we created a new column.

03:24.960 --> 03:31.170
Let's quickly select the column and drag it to the left right here and double-click it to rename it

03:31.230 --> 03:35.650
to AgeGroup-ID and press enter.

03:35.940 --> 03:42.450
So we have that new query, the DIM-AgeGroup, we have the AgeGroup-ID column, we have the Age-Group

03:42.490 --> 03:45.300
column but there is something missing, right?

03:45.330 --> 03:50.910
We do not have that categorization at the moment, so that may be adult and so on for the different age

03:50.910 --> 03:51.630
groups.

03:52.050 --> 03:54.580
Let's learn how to do that in the next video.
