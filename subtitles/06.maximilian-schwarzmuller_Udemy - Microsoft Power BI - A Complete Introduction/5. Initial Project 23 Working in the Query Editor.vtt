00:02.890 --> 00:06.320
We now connect Power BI Desktop to data,

1
00:06.490 --> 00:09.880
time to take a look at that data in the query editor.

2
00:10.390 --> 00:14.290
So again, this is probably something totally new for you.

3
00:14.440 --> 00:16.140
You haven't seen that interface before,

4
00:16.150 --> 00:17.790
you don't know what you can do right here

5
00:17.980 --> 00:22.680
and don't worry, we will talk about all that throughout the course. For the moment,

6
00:22.690 --> 00:26.290
let me just show you how quickly you can now clean that data,

7
00:26.410 --> 00:31.000
then load the data into the data model and then create beautiful visualizations.

8
00:31.090 --> 00:33.980
So we are in this data preparation step right here

9
00:34.300 --> 00:39.650
and what you can see up here in the center where we have our data, that the column names up there,

10
00:39.730 --> 00:41.740
well those are not really good.

11
00:42.190 --> 00:47.330
A better column name would be the second row because this should be the country, the subject descriptor

12
00:47.330 --> 00:48.480
should be the second column

13
00:48.640 --> 00:52.970
and so on. To do this, we have to apply two steps:

14
00:53.140 --> 00:55.770
The first step is we have to delete the first row,

15
00:55.840 --> 00:59.730
this one right here because we don't need that information in here.

16
00:59.740 --> 01:05.290
The second step then is that we have to turn this second row - which will then be the first row after

17
01:05.290 --> 01:07.120
deleting that current first row -

18
01:07.300 --> 01:10.570
so we want to turn that new first row into the header,

19
01:10.570 --> 01:11.960
the column names.

20
01:12.370 --> 01:14.410
So let's first delete the first row.

21
01:14.830 --> 01:22.390
To do this, we simply go to the home ribbon right here and then click onto remove rows, right here and select

22
01:22.450 --> 01:24.740
remove top rows, like this.

23
01:25.730 --> 01:31.580
Now we want to remove the top rows starting from the top which of course excludes the column names.

24
01:31.640 --> 01:35.490
So we simply type 1 to delete that first row and press OK.

25
01:36.550 --> 01:40.060
Now we see that this first row is gone.

26
01:40.060 --> 01:45.430
Now we want to turn this new first row into that column name. To do this,

27
01:45.430 --> 01:52.380
we can stay in the home ribbon and now press onto use first row as headers, right here. If we do that,

28
01:53.050 --> 01:55.450
well then we also got this.

29
01:55.450 --> 01:58.020
So those are the first two steps we had to apply

30
01:58.240 --> 02:01.750
and with that, we are finished with the work on our rows.

31
02:02.230 --> 02:04.060
Let's take a look at the columns now.

32
02:04.630 --> 02:09.940
So you can simply select a column of course and then navigate with the left and right arrow keys on

33
02:09.940 --> 02:10.950
the keyboard.

34
02:11.410 --> 02:17.380
So I think we should keep the country column, the subject descriptor, the units and the scale, those

35
02:17.380 --> 02:23.260
columns are fine but the country and serious specific notes, I don't think we need that.

36
02:23.410 --> 02:26.910
Now if you want to delete that column, you simply have to select the column,

37
02:26.920 --> 02:28.480
what we did right now,

38
02:28.480 --> 02:34.250
then again stay in the home ribbon and then press remove columns right here, like this.

39
02:34.750 --> 02:36.110
So this column is gone,

40
02:36.400 --> 02:41.470
let's now take a look at the remaining columns and see if we have to delete anything else.

41
02:41.470 --> 02:44.040
So those year columns are fine,

42
02:44.050 --> 02:46.390
we will talk about those in a few seconds though

43
02:46.870 --> 02:48.760
and in the last column,

44
02:48.790 --> 02:51.340
yes I think we should also delete this column.

45
02:51.370 --> 02:55.260
So again, we simply click remove columns and it's gone.

46
02:56.280 --> 03:02.220
So I mentioned this year columns a few seconds ago because I think the way we display it at the moment

47
03:02.400 --> 03:04.040
is not the best way.

48
03:04.260 --> 03:11.790
Wouldn't it be better if we change that into two columns simply? One column being named years with all

49
03:11.790 --> 03:18.120
the corresponding years in the corresponding rows of that column and the second column with the corresponding

50
03:18.240 --> 03:19.920
GDP data.

51
03:19.920 --> 03:20.720
I think so

52
03:21.060 --> 03:28.140
and what we have to do right now is we have to turn these columns, so these year columns into rows basically.

53
03:28.290 --> 03:34.400
So the column is named year and all the rows in that column are the different years. To do this,

54
03:34.470 --> 03:41.820
we simply select the first column, the 2015 column and now press and hold shift on the keyboard and select

55
03:42.030 --> 03:44.880
the last column, like this.

56
03:44.880 --> 03:51.690
Now we change from the home ribbon to the transform ribbon up here and now we press that unpivot columns

57
03:51.780 --> 03:53.160
columns function.

58
03:53.160 --> 03:59.100
Again something we will talk about in detail throughout the course but for the moment, we simply press that

59
03:59.430 --> 04:07.930
like this and as you can see, we simply turned those multiple columns into one single column with the

60
04:07.930 --> 04:11.480
years being single rows in that column.

61
04:11.530 --> 04:12.810
This was easy, right?

62
04:13.090 --> 04:19.930
Let's continue because we have to rename that columns now because attribute and value are not the best

63
04:19.930 --> 04:21.040
names probably.

64
04:21.310 --> 04:27.940
Let's change that quickly by double-clicking onto the attribute column up here and now name it year, like

65
04:27.940 --> 04:32.720
this and press enter and do the same thing for the GDP column.

66
04:32.780 --> 04:33.850
Well and name it

67
04:33.850 --> 04:36.640
GDP, like this.

68
04:36.670 --> 04:42.120
Now we got that and now we should make sure that we only have rows in that GDP column

69
04:42.190 --> 04:48.610
where we have data for because we only want to import the really important information into our data model,

70
04:48.790 --> 04:54.320
so we should take a look at that. Now to see if we have any N/As in this GDP column,

71
04:54.390 --> 04:59.180
we simply click onto that arrow right here and scroll down

72
04:59.380 --> 05:02.070
and as you can see, we have some N/As.

73
05:02.140 --> 05:09.520
So if we unselect that and press OK, those N/As are no longer in that column and by that, won't be loaded

74
05:09.730 --> 05:14.900
into the data model when we finished the work in the query editor, you will see that of course.

75
05:15.140 --> 05:18.190
Now we got that clean column here,

76
05:18.310 --> 05:23.670
so the only thing we have to do is we have to change the format of the data in here.

77
05:23.830 --> 05:25.600
Why should we change that?

78
05:25.840 --> 05:33.540
Well if you look at that symbol right here, this ABC and click it, you can see that at the moment, this GDP column

79
05:33.630 --> 05:37.760
or the values in the GDP column are formatted as text

80
05:38.080 --> 05:39.350
and this is not true.

81
05:39.790 --> 05:41.030
So we should change this

82
05:41.290 --> 05:48.010
and one way to change this is if we simply change it right here from text to decimal number for instance

83
05:48.010 --> 05:54.040
and as you can see, the symbol also changed now from ABC to 1,2 to indicate that this is a decimal number

84
05:54.040 --> 05:54.800
now.  

85
05:55.240 --> 06:00.520
So this was fine but what if you have to select multiple columns or to change the formats of multiple

86
06:00.520 --> 06:06.220
columns actually? Well then you have another option in Power BI, you can simply select the first column

87
06:06.370 --> 06:12.080
like this and again, select all the remaining columns, like that.

88
06:12.080 --> 06:20.020
Now if you go to the transform ribbon again and press detect data type right here like this, then you can see

89
06:20.020 --> 06:25.280
that the format of the first four columns of course didn't change because well, those are text

90
06:25.280 --> 06:30.730
so this is fine, but the format of the year column changed to a whole number now which is fine for the

91
06:30.730 --> 06:33.470
moment. And this is it,

92
06:33.630 --> 06:36.350
we now finished the work in our query editor,

93
06:36.480 --> 06:43.380
so in this data preparation step for our initial project. The next step now is to load that data,

94
06:43.440 --> 06:48.390
that clean data into the actual data model and create visualizations.
