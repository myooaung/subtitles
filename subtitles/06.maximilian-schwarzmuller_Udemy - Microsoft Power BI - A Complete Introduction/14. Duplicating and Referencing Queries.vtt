We want to start shaping our data, to import them into the data model in a really clear and good structure.

00:09.340 --> 00:11.310
Let's do this.

00:11.340 --> 00:17.670
So this is the overview we had in the last video when we finished our population combined query,

00:17.700 --> 00:23.070
let me just switch to that query by the way. Now this takes a few seconds to load that query but that

00:23.070 --> 00:24.010
should be done soon,

00:25.700 --> 00:26.720
here it is.

00:26.720 --> 00:30.810
So this is where we now want to start our work

00:30.950 --> 00:38.600
and you remember, we want to create three tables, two DIM tables and one population table and all the

00:38.600 --> 00:42.190
information we need is summarized in that table at the moment,

00:42.410 --> 00:44.800
so we basically want to split that table

00:45.140 --> 00:48.640
and as I want to split the table or that query

00:48.800 --> 00:54.630
but I don't want to change that initial query, so that population combined query we created,

00:54.710 --> 00:57.700
we should copy that query three times, for the two DIM tables

00:57.710 --> 00:58.940
and the FACT table.

00:59.450 --> 01:08.660
Now when I say copy, this is not totally true because we have two options on how to copy that query and

01:08.660 --> 01:11.360
you have two options on how to access that options.

01:11.390 --> 01:17.870
The first option is if you right-click on to that query, if you now go down, you see that you can create

01:17.960 --> 01:21.850
a duplicate or a reference for that query.

01:21.900 --> 01:28.250
Now the same thing can be found if you go to the home ribbon, go to manage and here you can delete that query

01:28.250 --> 01:33.320
of course which is something that you want to know and you can create a duplicate and the reference

01:33.320 --> 01:34.520
again.

01:34.520 --> 01:37.510
Now we want to do something like that

01:37.760 --> 01:42.690
but first you have to understand what the difference between a duplicate and a reference is.

01:42.950 --> 01:44.700
Let's take a look at that.

01:44.720 --> 01:49.730
So the starting point is basically a source file right, in this source file,

01:49.730 --> 01:53.230
we have three columns of information, column ABC.

01:53.360 --> 01:58.350
Now what we did so far, we use that source file and we are in a query editor

01:58.610 --> 02:02.730
and then we only used two columns, so Column C was deleted for instance,

02:02.840 --> 02:04.960
so we don't have that connection at the moment.

02:05.300 --> 02:08.890
So we have that query, in our case this is the combined query,

02:09.290 --> 02:11.160
now we could do two things.

02:11.450 --> 02:15.530
We could first duplicate that query, like this,

02:15.560 --> 02:19.760
what happens then is that the initial connection will remain,

02:19.790 --> 02:23.220
so we have a second connection to that source file actually

02:23.550 --> 02:27.400
and what will also remain are all of the steps that we did so far.

02:27.680 --> 02:32.870
So if you should think about the applied steps column, you would see all the cleaning steps we did also

02:32.870 --> 02:37.320
in that query too, so that duplicated query of query one.

02:37.370 --> 02:38.350
This is one option,

02:38.360 --> 02:41.950
this is the duplicate but we can do something else,

02:41.990 --> 02:45.180
we can also create a reference like this.

02:45.350 --> 02:51.920
The difference between the duplicate and the reference is that the reference now refers to the first

02:51.920 --> 02:54.950
query and not to the source file,

02:54.950 --> 03:02.510
this means if we create a reference, we can simply use the existing steps we did and build on on that.

03:02.510 --> 03:08.720
So this means we don't need another external connection to the source files and in the applied steps

03:08.720 --> 03:15.260
column, we only see one step and this is the connection of query two, the reference query to query one,

03:15.410 --> 03:17.810
the initially created query.

03:17.840 --> 03:19.310
So this is what we want to do,

03:19.400 --> 03:25.100
we want to create a query reference because we already did all the work and the cleaning of the data

03:25.430 --> 03:27.860
and we already have a connection to the source file,

03:28.040 --> 03:30.150
so we don't need a second connection.

03:30.170 --> 03:34.590
This is why we will now create that reference in our project,

03:34.640 --> 03:36.860
let's do this in the next video.
