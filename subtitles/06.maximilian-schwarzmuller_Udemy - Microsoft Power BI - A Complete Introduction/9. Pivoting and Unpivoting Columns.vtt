00:02.560 --> 00:11.450
We now have a formatted database in our query editor but still, we have to do something more.

00:11.560 --> 00:14.250
Now this is where we ended in the last video,

00:14.380 --> 00:19.900
let's now scroll to the right a little bit and take a closer look at the last three columns.

00:19.900 --> 00:25.640
These columns are called population male, population female and population total,

00:25.750 --> 00:27.910
there are two things that I don't like.

00:27.910 --> 00:34.750
The first thing is that population total column because this is a redundant information because if we

00:34.750 --> 00:36.170
add male and female,

00:36.280 --> 00:38.180
well this should be the total,

00:38.410 --> 00:45.040
so let's get rid of that last column first by selecting it, going to the home ribbon and simply pressing

00:45.040 --> 00:46.540
remove columns.

00:46.540 --> 00:50.260
Now this was easy and we already learned how to do this,

00:50.740 --> 00:57.240
nevertheless the last two columns are not fine because we need two columns right here

00:57.490 --> 01:05.650
but the information displayed is not the way it should be in a good data model because there, it should be one

01:05.650 --> 01:07.620
column named gender,

01:07.750 --> 01:09.460
so male and female

01:09.790 --> 01:12.760
and the second column named population,

01:13.120 --> 01:20.490
so I want to turn that information around somehow or I want to unpivot that information.

01:20.530 --> 01:23.760
Let's see what it is and how we can do that.

01:23.830 --> 01:26.970
So I'm selecting the population male column right now

01:27.370 --> 01:34.690
and if we go to transform, we find the unpivot column option right here and by clicking that arrow, we

01:34.690 --> 01:36.740
see that we again have two options,

01:36.820 --> 01:38.480
so the unpivot columns,

01:38.490 --> 01:44.770
so unpivot the selected columns option and unpivot other columns, so unpivot the unselected

01:44.770 --> 01:45.860
columns option.

01:46.180 --> 01:51.550
We want the unpivot the selected column, so we simply press that and see what happens

01:51.760 --> 01:58.840
and what happened is that Power BI now created one column with the attribute, so population male and

01:58.840 --> 01:59.550
the value,

01:59.620 --> 02:01.070
so the population.

02:01.300 --> 02:07.500
Now this is actually what we want but I want to have the male and female,

02:07.540 --> 02:14.110
so this gender definition in that column and at the moment, this table is structured in a way that nobody

02:14.110 --> 02:15.100
understands,

02:15.100 --> 02:17.740
so we have to undo that,

02:17.830 --> 02:24.280
we have two options on how to do it of course. We can either go to applied steps and press that x to

02:24.400 --> 02:25.480
undo that step and

02:25.480 --> 02:33.120
this works perfectly or we can simply select the attribute column and now go to pivot column

02:33.280 --> 02:37.710
because this does exactly the opposite of what we just did.

02:37.720 --> 02:40.570
So first we turned that column into rows,

02:40.750 --> 02:43.980
now we turned that rows back into columns again.

02:43.990 --> 02:46.440
So let's use that and see what happens.

02:46.450 --> 02:53.650
So I'm pressing pivot column and now we have to define the value because if it unpivots that and makes that

02:53.650 --> 03:02.590
population male from a row into a column name, then this column needs information in it and that information

03:02.590 --> 03:07.960
is, well the value. Let's press that and press OK,

03:08.290 --> 03:09.750
now we have to wait a few seconds

03:10.890 --> 03:17.460
and we see that everything is the way it was before but this didn't help a lot, right because now we

03:17.460 --> 03:19.180
didn't make any progress

03:19.410 --> 03:24.760
but we know more and as we know more, we can now simply select both columns.

03:24.840 --> 03:30.750
So I'm selecting the female column, pressing and holding shift and now select the second column,

03:30.750 --> 03:37.320
now I'm in the transform ribbon still, go to unpivot columns and press that. Now we have to wait again

03:37.320 --> 03:38.110
a few seconds

03:39.430 --> 03:42.530
and now we are where we want to be,

03:42.850 --> 03:50.180
we now have that new column with the gender which you should name according to that by the way

03:50.710 --> 03:58.400
and we have that second column with the population which we should, sorry a little typo, which we should

03:58.430 --> 04:00.670
also replace, like this.

04:01.250 --> 04:02.650
So this looks fine

04:02.750 --> 04:07.100
and please note that Power BI added that second row,

04:07.250 --> 04:13.960
so we now have two rows with one Age-Group for one country and one period, the female and the male.

04:13.970 --> 04:16.490
So we increased the amount of rows

04:16.730 --> 04:21.020
but at the same time, we have a better structured model in the end

04:21.290 --> 04:22.890
and that's why it's worth it.

04:22.900 --> 04:27.730
Now one thing I don't like right here now is that name of that gender,

04:27.860 --> 04:30.250
this doesn't look the way it should look now,

04:30.740 --> 04:33.880
let's see how we can change that in the next video.
