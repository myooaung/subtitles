00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.640
So why would we want to learn about DevOps?

2
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.620
Well, there's a lot of different reasons,

3
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.340
and it can apply to us still, even if we're not trying to be a DevOps engineer.

4
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.800
The first is that there's high salary growth and pay, up 5.2% in 2020.

5
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.970
And there's a growing demand not only for DevOps engineers,

6
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.940
but the skills that DevOps engineers have.

7
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.490
So, even if you're in a more traditional software engineering role,

8
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.040
or another role somewhere in the technology field,

9
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.340
having these skills can still be very valuable.

10
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.160
And, of course,

11
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.000
you'll need to learn about DevOps to prepare for AWS certifications like the AWS

12
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.240
Certified DevOps Engineer Professional level certification.

13
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.220
But what can you build with DevOps skills?

14
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.420
Well,

15
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.060
I'll be showing you in this course how you can set up development

16
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.830
workflows to streamline everything that you're putting together using

17
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.100
Git and a bunch of other DevOps tooling.

18
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.080
We'll also look at how we can include things like testing,

19
00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.250
builds, and the deployment of applications inside of development workflows,

20
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.460
as well as how we can manage our entire infrastructure in the cloud using

21
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.820
code rather than going into the AWS console and clicking a million

22
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.340
different buttons to try and get what we want.

23
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.190
So being able to build all these things sounds pretty awesome,

24
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.740
but why AWS DevOps tooling specifically?

25
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.240
Because AWS remains the public cloud leader among competitors like

26
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.500
Microsoft Azure and Oracle, integrating AWS developer tools with

27
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.970
your applications will also allow you to manage your

28
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.540
infrastructure and code in one place.

29
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.310
Also,

30
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.270
AWS has a variety of different integrations between all of its many services

31
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.960
that make developing applications on the AWS a good experience.

32
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.470
So, hopefully I've convinced you that we're about to learn some

33
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.000
useful and essential skills that will benefit our career and any

34
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
other technical goals that we have. So let's dive in by looking at some fundamentals.
