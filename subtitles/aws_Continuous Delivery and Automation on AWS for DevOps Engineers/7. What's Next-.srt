1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,710
We covered a decent amount about CodePipeline during this module,

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:06,250
we went through all the essentials we need to know around

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,280
the concepts of working with CodePipeline,

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,140
as well as how we can integrate it with a bunch of

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,650
other different kinds of tools,

6
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,190
and we even went through a demo and created our own pipeline to help

7
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,820
us deploy code directly to an Elastic Beanstalk environment every

8
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,740
time we make a commit in AWS CodeCommit,

9
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,340
and we even included a build and a test step inside of

10
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,740
there and then did the deployment.

11
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,150
So, overall, nice work throughout this course.

12
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:32,820
You've learned a ton about different AWS services that'll help

13
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,620
you to streamline your development processes.

14
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,850
Now, right now, you might be thinking what's next,

15
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,290
and what should you keep learning?

16
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:39,510
Well,

17
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,490
I have a few suggestions about other tools that you

18
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:44,240
might find useful when working in AWS.

19
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,240
The first is some tools that might help you

20
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,140
integrate different services together.

21
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,530
You might have noticed that AWS Lambda comes up in

22
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,540
several of these development services,

23
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,620
and I have an introduction to AWS Lambda here on Pluralsight

24
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,130
that you might be interested in taking.

25
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:59,950
I also have another framework course related to

26
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,770
something called the Serverless Framework,

27
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,210
which will help you develop AWS Lambda applications and

28
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,900
deploy them a little bit more easily.

29
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,840
From there,

30
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,680
you might want to look at how you can do cost optimization on AWS, something

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,630
that DevOps engineers are frequently tasked with doing.

32
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,970
I have a course on Architecting for Cost on AWS, here as well.

33
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,160
And if you're interested in learning more about other fundamental AWS services,

34
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,570
I have some courses on Collecting Data on AWS and Storing Data

35
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,640
on AWS, as well as a course on DynamoDB,

36
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,810
which is a pretty common one when you're working inside of AWS.

37
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:35,380
So hopefully this will give you some suggestions of what to take next,

38
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,720
but I want to take a moment and just say thank you.

39
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,670
I really appreciate you taking the time to go through this course.

40
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,170
And if you have any questions,

41
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,900
please don't hesitate to reach out in the discussion section on

42
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,850
Pluralsight, and also, feel free to get in touch with me and make

43
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:54,000
recommendations for other things that I should be working on. Thanks again, and I hope to see you in another course soon.
