00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.640
So what is AWS CodePipeline?

2
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.700
CodePipeline is an AWS service that helps you automate

3
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.540
all the steps of your CI/CD pipelines.

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.440
You can use this service in order to automate software releases

5
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.860
and have processes that have more than one step,

6
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.640
using more than one tool to do it.

7
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.200
This will help you to combine different build tools and

8
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.340
other tools throughout the entire process,

9
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.230
so you can use things like AWS CodeCommit, in combination with AWS

10
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.740
CodeBuild, in combination with something like AWS CodeDeploy, or even

11
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.300
thirdâ€‘party tools in many of these areas.

12
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.230
And it'll help you to visualize the progress of pipelines

13
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.640
across all of these different stages.

14
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.600
So if you want to see what the current stage is of the

15
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.890
build process or the deployment process,

16
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.400
it'll help you bring all these visualizations into one tool.

17
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.470
So what are some of the concepts we need to understand

18
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.390
when we're working with CodePipeline?

19
00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.560
One of the first ones is just pipelines themselves.

20
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.140
Pipelines will have several different stages inside of them,

21
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.140
and those stages will have different transitions between the stages.

22
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.870
Additionally, inside of the stages, you're going to have different actions,

23
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.010
and those actions might produce something called artifacts.

24
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.000
Now this is a pretty high level example of what the different concepts are.

25
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.640
So let's try and visualize it to get a little bit more specific.

26
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.810
When we have a CodePipeline pipeline,

27
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.720
we might have a stage inside of it that has an action,

28
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.840
and we could have more than one inside of each stage.

29
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.340
Then, when the stage completes, it would have a transition to the next stage,

30
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.360
which also would have at least one other action, but potentially more than one.

31
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.860
Now we can have many different types of stages and

32
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:44.000
kinds of actions inside those stages. So in the next section, let's look at what these options are.
