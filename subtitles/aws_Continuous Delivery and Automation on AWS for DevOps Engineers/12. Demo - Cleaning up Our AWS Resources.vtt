00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:01.940
So by now,

2
00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:05.060
we've deployed everything we set out to deploy and created

3
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.010
every part of our application we wanted to,

4
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.250
but these resources aren't free,

5
00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.580
so let's make sure we clean them up if we're not

6
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.640
planning on using them later on.

7
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.600
First, I'm going to delete all the resources related to CodeDeploy specifically.

8
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.750
So I'll go to the Application section here and then click

9
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.310
into my tutorial‑bluegreen‑app application,

10
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.150
and I'll click Delete application.

11
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.340
I'll need to type in delete here and then press that one more time.

12
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.730
This should take care of my CodeDeploy application and the

13
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.350
related deployments to that application.

14
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.040
Next up, let's go to ECS to make sure we get rid of those resources too.

15
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.060
Inside of ECS,

16
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.840
we should see something like this with our tutorial‑bluegreen‑cluster.

17
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.700
Let's go ahead and click into that and start

18
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.940
removing the resources inside of it.

19
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.150
The most important part is probably to delete the cluster itself,

20
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.630
which we can do by pressing that Delete Cluster button,

21
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.920
but we can also go in here and delete the service too,

22
00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.340
so I'll start with that.

23
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.700
Let's delete the service, type in delete me,

24
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.270
and then we'll go back up one level, and we'll also delete the cluster itself.

25
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.210
This should happen automatically after we delete the

26
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.540
service going back up one level.

27
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.360
Now we'll delete the cluster too and this should take a little bit longer.

28
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.930
Ah,

29
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.410
but it looks like because we currently still have a task

30
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.180
active from our earlier deployment, we have to delete that,

31
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.550
too.

32
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.350
So let's go to the Tasks section,

33
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.400
we'll click on the drop‑down here and select the task that's currently

34
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.440
running, then we can stop this task and click Stop again,

35
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.570
and this should make sure that that's not going to be

36
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.440
running any longer and serving traffic.

37
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.780
If we go to the Stop section,

38
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.940
we should see several stop tasks, some of these are

39
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.040
from our earlier deployments.

40
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.740
Once these all appear as stopped,

41
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.640
we should be able to delete our cluster. We can also refresh this page here and

42
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.380
eventually see this task transition from running to stopped.

43
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.900
Currently,

44
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.580
it's slowly shutting this task down and making sure

45
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.440
that it won't continue running.

46
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.520
In the meantime, though,

47
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.540
we can go over to another section of the AWS console with the EC2 section.

48
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.450
We'll go there and then hop over to the load balancer section at the

49
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.680
very bottom and we should see our bluegreen‑alb load balancer here. We

50
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.230
could first remove the listeners on this alb and then we can delete the

51
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.940
load balancer itself as well.

52
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.000
Now, once we've done this,

53
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.410
we can also go over to the VPC section of the AWS console and remove some

54
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.910
of our network resources. So let's type in VPC here,

55
00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.220
go to the VPC section, and we can remove the VPC we initially

56
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.500
created and that should cascade down to other things.

57
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.470
I happen to have it memorized that this is the VPC that I created, but

58
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.700
you could also check if you only have two, you probably just have one

59
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.610
default and one non‑default VPC. In our case,

60
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.050
we want to delete the non‑default VPC.

61
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.540
Now make sure that you're only deleting the one that you created in

62
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.200
this demo as those are pretty critical resources for applications

63
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.240
that rely on AWS's networking services.

64
00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.320
So now that I know I have the right one selected,

65
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.940
let's go to the Actions drop‑down and let's click Delete VPC.

66
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.840
This will delete a bunch of other resources underneath it,

67
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.440
including the internet gateway, the route tables,

68
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.840
the subnets, and the security group that were all linked up to that VPC.

69
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.880
So let's type in delete here and click Delete one more time.

70
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.640
This should detach everything and delete everything as well.

71
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.050
Now that we're done with this process,

72
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.420
I just want to point out that AWS has been experimenting

73
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.960
with a new UI here, so if you see the option to select a new

74
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.370
VPC experience in the top left,

75
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.240
you can toggle this new view on or off with that button.

76
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.570
And if you're in this view,

77
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.470
you're probably going to want to toggle it on so that you can see

78
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.640
the steps as I was doing them in this newer view.

79
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.240
Now that we've deleted a lot of our networking resources,

80
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.540
let's go back to ECS and make sure that our tasks are done running.

81
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.440
So this is currently still just our single task and it looks like it

82
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.040
hasn't finished, so let's try stopping it again.

83
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.980
It looks like we're stopping the task successfully this time.

84
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.480
So now we should be able to go to the Services section,

85
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.770
and if we have any services here,

86
00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.340
they'd show up here, but we successfully deleted our old one,

87
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.160
so we should be able to just delete the cluster itself here,

88
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.660
Let's type in delete me one more time and this should work now

89
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.740
that we don't have any more tasks running.

90
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:15.480
Alright,

91
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.620
now we've deleted our clusters, we've deleted our tasks, we've

92
00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.540
deleted our networking resources that we spent so long trying to get

93
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.920
together, and we've deleted our code deploy resources. With

94
00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.690
everything cleaned up here, hopefully,

95
00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.020
we're not going to get billed for anything that we left behind.

96
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.680
But I will point out that if we go to Task Definitions,

97
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.640
our Task Definition is still in here.

98
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.360
Our task definitions shouldn't be charging us as long as

99
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.280
we're not running them inside of a cluster,

100
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.240
though.

101
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.920
So now that we're done deleting everything,

102
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.140
congratulations again on making it through this pretty technical demo.

103
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.000
Hopefully, this will be helpful if you're working with ECS and CodeDeploy in the future.
