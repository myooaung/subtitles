1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,950
how everyone in this lecture will understand about the best shell born against him.

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,210
That's the full form off bash.

3
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:19,060
It's a free UNIX el that can be used in place off the bone shell bash is the shell or come

4
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,950
on language interpreter for Atlantic's operating system.

5
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:31,100
And it is also the before Lennox's best was written for the Genome Project by Brand Fox.

6
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,610
So in simple words,

7
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:37,490
if a user wants to talk to the Atlantic's colonel,

8
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:42,200
did it cross a medium so that medium is your show?

9
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,880
And we have a different type of shells,

10
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,670
the most common and important on before one is your best shot.

11
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:56,590
So whatever the shallow scripting we're going to learn in this entire course model that is

12
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:01,260
based on the best shell we do have other you know,

13
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,070
shall as well,

14
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,090
like you gone shell,

15
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:08,220
she shell and E Cell has its own,

16
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:08,680
you know,

17
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,610
importance on properties.

18
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:19,770
The best is largely compatible with asset and incorporates useful features from the

19
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,120
conscious and see sell.

20
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:27,650
It offers functional improvements over asset for both programming and interactive use,

21
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:30,620
so there's a basic idea about the best shell.

22
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,940
So friend,

23
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,980
that's all for this lecture in the next lecture,

24
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,480
we'll understand about the logging.

25
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,700
Like if I have a user on the user wants to,

26
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,120
you know,

27
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,950
connect to the box.

28
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,830
So what does it require?

29
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,370
It requires credentials on.

30
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,600
Once the user will supply the credentials,

31
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,680
he or she will get the logging shower or its home directory.

32
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,870
So what's the user will belonging to the box?

33
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:56,670
What are the different?

34
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,120
You know,

35
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,030
profile.

36
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,100
The startup scripts is going to execute.

37
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,460
So this is what we're going to learn in the next election.

38
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,670
So thanks for watching.

39
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,040
We'll soon the next lecture.
