00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
okay,

2
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:03.410
It's about time.

3
00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:05.920
Now we start four loops Ghoshal file system.

4
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:06.350
Well,

5
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.540
we already learned for Loops earlier,

6
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.750
but now we are actually going to learn MAWR smaller and bigger at advanced four loops as

7
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:16.050
well.

8
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.500
I am going to actually include multiple scripts here.

9
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:20.980
It's not.

10
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.150
This lesson is not about just one script,

11
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.020
and we'll move on this lesson.

12
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.340
We are going to create simple accounting for loops.

13
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:28.550
Grip.

14
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.390
Ah,

15
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.140
you could use it,

16
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.650
their account counting by 1 200 or whichever the specified number of times.

17
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.510
We're going to create multiple files with different names.

18
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.980
If you want to create,

19
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:41.640
let's say,

20
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.560
10 files.

21
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.220
Are you going?

22
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.950
Going to do touch one touch to text three.

23
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:46.420
No,

24
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.790
right.

25
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.750
You wanted to create a script that will create multiple files and,

26
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:50.060
of course,

27
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.650
with multiple different names.

28
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.120
So that's what we're gonna cover next.

29
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.600
We're gonna cover multiple create multiple files with user input,

30
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.850
so use it will have to specify,

31
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.560
Ah,

32
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.210
it would be like,

33
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.400
Hey,

34
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.850
do you want to create a falls?

35
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:03.210
Yes.

36
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.110
And what's the name of the while?

37
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.390
There's how maney fuzz you want to create wanna create 10 files wouldn't be there.

38
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.750
Nice.

39
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.850
Then we have to create another script.

40
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.090
Like assigned write permissions to files will create another script assigned right.

41
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.950
Permission to files with total time it will take.

42
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:28.810
So this is I am actually going to cover five different script in this lesson.

43
00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.620
And the reason I'm keep on focusing on four Loop is four.

44
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:40.190
Loop is one of the important statement for loop scripts that you will be using more often

45
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.150
than any other statement scripts.

46
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.150
Okay,

47
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.250
Without further ado,

48
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.370
let's log in to our links machine.

49
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.650
We have our length machine right here.

50
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.050
I'm gonna clear the screen real quick.

51
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.150
Um,

52
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.950
I'm gonna exit out,

53
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.250
and I'm gonna go again to my other one,

54
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.150
which is right here.

55
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.810
Clear the screen.

56
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:02.650
Who am I?

57
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:03.730
I have.

58
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.770
So this is my other session that was running.

59
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.050
I don't want to have two different sections open.

60
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.750
This will do nothing but to confuse you more.

61
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:12.210
Anyway,

62
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:21.310
I am in my home directory and I want to go into my profession script directory that I

63
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.390
created earlier.

64
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.280
I have a few scripts that I work on it earlier.

65
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.230
You probably have it too.

66
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.070
If you're following me exactly every lesson one by one.

67
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.710
Anyway,

68
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:31.750
let's clear the screen out.

69
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.920
The first thing I wanted to do is I want to create simple accounting script with for the

70
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:37.430
for loop.

71
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.350
So what it does,

72
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.160
let's first create the script and you will know exactly what I'm talking about.

73
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.150
Simple count again.

74
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.100
What do you have to do,

75
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.750
guys?

76
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.620
So now I am trying to save you time.

77
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.250
So I'm just kind of this author date.

78
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.150
See you fill that up yourself.

79
00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.280
Ah,

80
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.070
description.

81
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.480
But please don't forget to do that.

82
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.260
I am skipping it because I don't want to waste any more time on this.

83
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.450
I won't get in straight into script.

84
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.310
All right,

85
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.710
so everything is defined.

86
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:25.150
Turnout for the I is just invariable in curly braces.

87
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:33.980
One dot dot That's a 20 and her.

88
00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:40.390
Now what I'm saying is I want you to put all the counting from 1 to 20 into a variable

89
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.320
called I this stuff.

90
00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.110
Is that what I'm doing?

91
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.150
So think off it.

92
00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.750
You have ah,

93
00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:45.970
a can.

94
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.950
And you're putting 20 numbers from 1 to 20 in that can.

95
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.550
So that's and that can name is I.

96
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.400
You could name it anything that can name is a or just even you could even name it can as

97
00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.350
see and can.

98
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.330
So you could do that.

99
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.580
Now what do you want to do now?

100
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.620
So you already put those 20 numbers in a can,

101
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.250
Where you want to do,

102
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.260
I can.

103
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.900
It's a perfect example.

104
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:16.510
So do first is echo dollar.

105
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:22.750
So it is actually going to echo whatever is an inside of the container.

106
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.250
So I am actually boxing 20 numbers in a box.

107
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.710
And then once I did that,

108
00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.920
then I want to open the box and read those numbers.

109
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.950
That's pretty much it.

110
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.450
And then I don't want to read all of them in one shot.

111
00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.090
I want to read one number at a time.

112
00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.030
It will read one number at a time,

113
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.150
but it will read it so fast that it will look like as if it's reading all in one shot.

114
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.140
So in order for me to verify that it is reading one of the time,

115
00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.220
I'm gonna put a command inside called sleep.

116
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.910
One sleep on.

117
00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.050
What is going to do is is actually gonna read one letter,

118
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.460
sleep for one second,

119
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.550
then read the second the third the fourth,

120
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.120
so I don't want to waste your time.

121
00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.220
I'll just put here 10.

122
00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.480
So we will just run the script for 10 seconds.

123
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.650
Will sleep for 12th.

124
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.850
Oops.

125
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.850
And right here is done.

126
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:25.920
So I hope you you understand this for I n put there's a container.

127
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.210
I put number fund through 10.

128
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.360
Then what do you want to do?

129
00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.650
What's you have all the numbers in a box than do Read those numbers from for me,

130
00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:34.100
please.

131
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.500
123456789 10.

132
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.960
Perfect.

133
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.320
But I want you to sleep like put a break in every number while you're reading it.

134
00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.050
And that break is for only for one sec.

135
00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.850
Okay.

136
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:45.670
Okay,

137
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.890
sir,

138
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:46.570
we will do that.

139
00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.950
Perfect.

140
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.860
And what do you want to do?

141
00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:49.600
Once I'm done,

142
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.550
then you're done.

143
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:51.260
Don't worry about it.

144
00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.750
Okay.

145
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:52.880
All right.

146
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.260
Let's go into our script.

147
00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.150
Modify the permissions.

148
00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.050
Simple count.

149
00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.650
Sorry.

150
00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:06.180
And I guess ah mentioned earlier that you could use,

151
00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.680
um,

152
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.330
numbering way to do the change mod or this way,

153
00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:11.080
I prefer this.

154
00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.950
First I used anyway,

155
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:14.610
uh,

156
00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:15.710
permissions are done.

157
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.940
Now.

158
00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:16.550
Let's run.

159
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:24.150
Take us at one to 34567 eight,

160
00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.250
nine,

161
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.150
10

162
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.450
You're done.

163
00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:29.740
See?

164
00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.250
It's just that simple.

165
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.540
Now you're probably thinking,

166
00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:34.900
Hey,

167
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:35.380
Imron,

168
00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:40.650
what is the real life application for this type of script?

169
00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:41.840
Okay,

170
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:42.450
Perfect sound.

171
00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.660
You're probably perfect.

172
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:45.060
Questions.

173
00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:45.420
Hurry.

174
00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:46.540
You probably,

175
00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:47.060
um,

176
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.530
installed a lot off,

177
00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:49.060
um,

178
00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.210
Softwares and your A machine,

179
00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:52.570
right?

180
00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.100
If you are using windows,

181
00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.590
you install software.

182
00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:56.580
It goes through a visit.

183
00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.750
If you're running Lennox crap,

184
00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.120
then you installing something,

185
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.950
it goes through some kind of little busier.

186
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:07.160
But then you also noticed it gives you some kind of progress bar,

187
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:07.650
right?

188
00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:11.330
That is where those people those developers,

189
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.600
put those progress bar by putting thes counting in there.

190
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.750
It does accounting,

191
00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:16.610
it tells you.

192
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:16.800
Okay,

193
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.960
approximately is gonna take this much time.

194
00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.320
And that's how it does.

195
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:26.210
Counting 12345 So that's what actually is,

196
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:31.190
um Why I have not put it in a real example,

197
00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:36.650
because I want you to go and find out how you could put that in a regular everyday example

198
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:36.650
.

199
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:38.590
Now going to other scripts,

200
00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:40.170
the four scripts that I have.

201
00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:45.120
I'll show you exactly where I could put in other examples as well,

202
00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.680
but not just in Ah,

203
00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.600
installation wizard.

204
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.550
But in something else.

205
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:54.750
Second script now we're doing is we're going to create multiple pause right here.

206
00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:59.050
He says create multiple files with different names.

207
00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:00.330
By the way,

208
00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.940
these scripts that I'm typing,

209
00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:03.440
of course,

210
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.750
I do not remember all of them on top of my head.

211
00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:12.940
I actually have them written in a note pad on another computer that is right sitting next

212
00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:13.250
to me.

213
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:16.050
So I am not like you can say,

214
00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:16.180
Oh,

215
00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.120
him run is a genius.

216
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.450
He room where every script on on his head.

217
00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:23.300
I don't I'm just like a regular person like you.

218
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.090
So I have this note pad open on another computer,

219
00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:31.400
and I have that no pad Attash toe every lesson that you're gonna do.

220
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.670
So once you're gonna play that lesson or this lesson,

221
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:37.450
you will see an attachment dot text file,

222
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:40.980
elect you to open the text fall and then look at the text well,

223
00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:43.650
and then created your script anyway,

224
00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:48.070
So let's create a 2nd 1 and I'm gonna create their for multiple files.

225
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:49.110
So we I,

226
00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:51.010
um,

227
00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:54.450
create multiple files,

228
00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:58.150
but different names,

229
00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:00.950
stuccoed confusing,

230
00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:02.290
create balls.

231
00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:02.740
Simple.

232
00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:05.850
Is that enter?

233
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:14.240
I didn't put in certain aren't you know what goes here?

234
00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:20.030
So before I do that the best way to do is I just remember I Julie do that.

235
00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:22.920
So I'll copy simple count,

236
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.220
which I need to be created just before that.

237
00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:27.380
And I'm gonna name it a different one.

238
00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:30.370
Create falls are to know the I said this.

239
00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:32.450
We will have everything up there that we need.

240
00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:33.850
Just remove this part.

241
00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:35.350
Okay,

242
00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:43.280
now four I I like I So I keep picking on you.

243
00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:44.250
Could pick anything again.

244
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:50.150
En curly braces one through 10.

245
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:51.590
Okay,

246
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:52.360
so now you know,

247
00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:52.670
again,

248
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:54.340
I'm putting 10 numbers in my box,

249
00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:54.890
right?

250
00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:56.050
So you know you know that.

251
00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:56.760
Okay,

252
00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.130
Now what do you want to do?

253
00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:00.160
Do this time?

254
00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:04.740
I wanted to create files and the file name should start with Imran.

255
00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:05.260
Perfect.

256
00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.650
And it should end with dollar high.

257
00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:10.550
Nice.

258
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:12.070
So you see what I'm doing?

259
00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:14.790
It is going to create 10 files,

260
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:20.560
and every file would have the name imran 100.1 imron dot to imron 0.0.3 and all the way to

261
00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.850
in runda 10.

262
00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:27.290
See how easy it has become to create multiple files.

263
00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:29.550
Probably you would have to create 1000 files,

264
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:32.770
then creating it manually.

265
00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:34.480
It's not productive at all.

266
00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.840
So that's how we used before we commence and even moving forward.

267
00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:41.850
So I'm gonna create 10 filed with the name Imron and then I want you to be done.

268
00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:46.150
Um,

269
00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:47.850
since I copied from simple account,

270
00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:48.950
it should have.

271
00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:51.360
They're executing permission as well.

272
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:51.630
Also,

273
00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:56.260
create false enter boom.

274
00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.150
It actually through an error message right away.

275
00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:00.070
Perfect.

276
00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:03.190
I want you to have that experience as well,

277
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:03.650
because,

278
00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:06.050
um you will be troubleshooting,

279
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:07.110
um,

280
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:10.050
ever messages while you are creating scripts as well.

281
00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:11.060
So anyway,

282
00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.570
it's his unexpected end off filed is,

283
00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:14.050
um,

284
00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:17.630
while looking for matching ah,

285
00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:19.850
back tick and coat.

286
00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:24.150
And it's a line seven to what I would do is I'll go straight into the file,

287
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:25.650
create falls,

288
00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:31.650
and I'll go into Line seven by putting calling seven Is coming right here.

289
00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:32.800
Ah,

290
00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:33.350
you see,

291
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:38.650
It is it has this thing I don't want to take.

292
00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:43.070
That's why I was giving no,

293
00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:43.250
sir.

294
00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:44.930
Now let's run it.

295
00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:45.750
Create falls,

296
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:47.760
Bingle.

297
00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:53.870
It came back when you have command that comes back and give you a prom back without

298
00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:57.650
throwing any error message What it means the script ran successfully.

299
00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:59.830
Now let's verify if it ran.

300
00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:00.650
Let's do ls minus.

301
00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:03.030
Lt are and you will see right here.

302
00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:06.150
It created 10 files.

303
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:08.650
Awesome.

304
00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:10.050
Perfect.

305
00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:10.950
Okay,

306
00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:15.750
now let's move on to the next and next grip.

307
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:17.050
I'll just do copy,

308
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:18.590
create falls.

309
00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:28.550
And this time I'll do create falls with input and and put Sorry,

310
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:29.640
Um,

311
00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:30.840
stands for I p.

312
00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:31.410
I want to do it.

313
00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:33.750
So I will do and oh,

314
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:40.690
the I create Um you know what?

315
00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:41.250
Um,

316
00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:42.580
I will change it.

317
00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:46.250
I don't want use myself and out.

318
00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:47.090
Instead of that,

319
00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:47.750
I will do,

320
00:12:47.750 --> 00:13:04.960
user and put and now create falls Dash using what I'm going to do here is who's bash and

321
00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:12.250
let's skidded off all of that And now I want a user to tell me how many files they want.

322
00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:14.720
This is the third script it says right here,

323
00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.750
create multiple followers user input.

324
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:18.680
So,

325
00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:19.250
user,

326
00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:27.620
we the script will ask users how many files you want to create and a nail say's how many?

327
00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:30.450
What's the name of the files that you want to create?

328
00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:33.850
So let's do that echo.

329
00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:45.150
How many files do you want and I want to come on the script to read that,

330
00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:46.800
um,

331
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:47.550
response.

332
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:51.250
And that is T for Total.

333
00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:54.310
It's just that echo.

334
00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:56.220
Just put a empty line.

335
00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:59.650
Then I want to throw another question at the user,

336
00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:11.920
and I'm going to say police and her that star name files.

337
00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:16.070
So the file names if you want the file names destroyed with Imran and please enter em.

338
00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:16.250
Right,

339
00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:21.550
read and just number one,

340
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:22.060
not number.

341
00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.350
Just a variable now.

342
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:29.350
Four I in again eyes variable.

343
00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:32.650
Now I want to put sequence here.

344
00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:41.450
Put dollar sequence one through.

345
00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:44.770
Okay,

346
00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:50.460
so this is going to What is going to do is this is going to put this variable,

347
00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:56.550
which is the sequence inside the variable I and the sequence is going to be the number off

348
00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:57.550
files.

349
00:14:57.550 --> 00:15:00.240
So the reason I'm putting sequence here,

350
00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.530
not one through That's a dollar to you.

351
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:04.170
Probably thinking,

352
00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:04.370
Hey,

353
00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:04.700
Imron,

354
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:05.560
why didn't you pick?

355
00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:09.850
Let's say not dot like this.

356
00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:14.060
This is something.

357
00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:17.880
If you have think off that then I would say you are right on the right track,

358
00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.360
but and then you have specimen.

359
00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.250
You have to specify the variable which is dollar t.

360
00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:31.630
Then you cannot use one dot dot dot and the variable because one dot dot only works with

361
00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:34.150
number or interview.

362
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:36.100
So in order for it to work,

363
00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:43.180
you have to put a new thing called sequence one through that variable,

364
00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:44.650
which is specified by the user.

365
00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:47.820
It's just That's how it is.

366
00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:48.510
You know,

367
00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:49.880
that's what some people says.

368
00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.090
It is what it is.

369
00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:51.550
Okay,

370
00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:53.940
now that is done.

371
00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:54.650
Do what?

372
00:15:54.650 --> 00:16:03.760
Come on.

373
00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:05.170
My cursor is stuck.

374
00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:21.220
Looks like hopes my network went down.

375
00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:22.240
I don't know why,

376
00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.110
but anyway,

377
00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:27.450
I am going to copy this so I don't lose my work.

378
00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:34.550
I'll go into my machine,

379
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:41.870
verify the i p.

380
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:42.700
And you see,

381
00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:43.660
the i p is gone.

382
00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:44.650
I don't know what happened,

383
00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:45.280
but anyway,

384
00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:49.150
all just free store my network.

385
00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:57.650
This is just a command to restore.

386
00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:58.760
Um,

387
00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.650
you could just fast forward it.

388
00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:02.030
If you don't want to know,

389
00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:06.160
I'll just log back into my party session once the session comes back up,

390
00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.320
uh,

391
00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:10.260
has restarted.

392
00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.660
Now let's see if I got an I p.

393
00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:15.780
Yes,

394
00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:16.190
I got it.

395
00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:17.660
I p no,

396
00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:20.160
I'm just gonna do right here.

397
00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.660
Restart session.

398
00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:25.950
It has restarted.

399
00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:32.250
Okay,

400
00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:44.780
so now I'm gonna go back into my PS Drake tree and my script that I was working on Isis

401
00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:47.850
found a swap while named this because,

402
00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:48.210
you know,

403
00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:50.550
my I lost my ah session,

404
00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:53.160
and it still has that dot swap file open.

405
00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.130
So it's his read.

406
00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:56.880
Only added anyway,

407
00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:02.050
recover quit and aboard all state record and enter.

408
00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:02.940
Yes,

409
00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:03.760
it has recovered.

410
00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:07.050
So let me just quickly save it and make sure it does save it.

411
00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:09.660
Um,

412
00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:11.320
at it.

413
00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:11.760
Anyway,

414
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.580
you know,

415
00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:15.660
that's where we left off.

416
00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:21.950
Now we're going to do is do touch.

417
00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:26.990
And so touch n,

418
00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:31.090
which is the name of the file dot dollar I,

419
00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:33.340
which is the number that specified by the user.

420
00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:33.760
Done.

421
00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:36.950
That's pretty much it to save it.

422
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:38.450
This cat,

423
00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:43.760
it is there now let's run it.

424
00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:47.760
Create files,

425
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:48.480
user.

426
00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.780
I p no,

427
00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:51.670
it's asking me the question.

428
00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:52.660
How many files you want?

429
00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:55.260
I want this five files.

430
00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:58.670
Please enter the start name off the falls this time.

431
00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:04.800
I'll just put I am are just 1st 3 initial off my name because I already have reports in

432
00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:05.090
there.

433
00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:08.010
So And when you do ls minus.

434
00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:08.570
Lt are.

435
00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:12.020
You'll see it created file files with my name.

436
00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:13.390
I am our initials.

437
00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:16.790
And that's how you give that option to the users.

438
00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:21.260
If the users are not very friendly with the command line,

439
00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.010
then you could create a script for them and they will run it.

440
00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:25.660
And there it'll create the script for you.

441
00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.000
Next.

442
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.600
Moving on the another script that I wanted to do is to a sign,

443
00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:30.910
right,

444
00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:32.100
permission to the files.

445
00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:36.820
So now you notice that I have created these files and I wanted to give,

446
00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:38.150
Let's say right,

447
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:39.760
permission toe every one of them.

448
00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.790
So of course you could do that.

449
00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:45.370
C h m o D a right,

450
00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:49.450
and just do imron and then hit this aspirational Assign it.

451
00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:52.890
But what if you have different names,

452
00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:55.260
then you have to do one by one.

453
00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:59.410
Or you could actually make a mistake while you're working on.

454
00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:00.850
So it's better you create a script,

455
00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:01.960
create a script.

456
00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:05.260
I'll name it a sign.

457
00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:07.160
Permission?

458
00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:10.800
I don't want to do that again.

459
00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:11.290
Object,

460
00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:11.630
Right?

461
00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:18.550
It's all just create piles and a sign Save time.

462
00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:20.260
Sign permissions.

463
00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:24.550
Okay,

464
00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:35.850
so now for I in Imron to echo a signing,

465
00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:50.760
right permissions to dollar I that's to do is execute this $2 I and sleep one.

466
00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.160
So it will do one at a time and done.

467
00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.650
Okay,

468
00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:55.390
So basically,

469
00:20:55.390 --> 00:21:00.410
what is going to do is gonna look for all the files that has imron dot asterisk.

470
00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:05.320
And then it's going to do echo assigning by permission to all those files.

471
00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.780
And then it's gonna actually sign those permission one by one.

472
00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:08.660
That's run it.

473
00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:19.740
Assigning right permission to Imron one Imron 10 Imron 234 How many we have You have 10

474
00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:20.060
right?

475
00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:23.720
That's the one we created in my previous script.

476
00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:24.850
So let's verify.

477
00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:28.280
Yes,

478
00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:28.710
There you go.

479
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:31.450
So it has signed all the write permissions.

480
00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:33.760
Did it give right or execute Herbal?

481
00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:37.900
We give executed.

482
00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:38.550
But anyway,

483
00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:40.700
you understand what I'm trying to do,

484
00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:41.010
right?

485
00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:46.760
So you could do instead of decks you could just put and even moving on to our last script

486
00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:47.590
for four loop.

487
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:51.050
I want you to keep doing four loops or you'll get used to it.

488
00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:56.450
The next one I want toe assign write permissions who filed with total time.

489
00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:58.730
It will take if it's gonna take,

490
00:21:58.730 --> 00:21:59.190
um,

491
00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:01.050
10 seconds And I want to know,

492
00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:02.710
um,

493
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:06.050
the visit to tell me hey is gonna take that much time.

494
00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:12.890
So I'm gonna use the same script this time I'm gonna just of the Eid assigned permission

495
00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:13.160
script.

496
00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:15.160
I'll come back right here.

497
00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:18.050
And this time I'll put right here.

498
00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:22.220
Ellis minus l Oh,

499
00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:22.420
no.

500
00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:22.760
You know what,

501
00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:23.260
total?

502
00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:24.850
Let's assign a variable.

503
00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:26.380
When you sign a variable,

504
00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:28.530
you equal and then tick,

505
00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:30.450
which is right above the tab.

506
00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:36.050
And the variable starts with Ellis my cell Imron,

507
00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:37.050
Asterix!

508
00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:40.260
And then how many files we have?

509
00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:46.160
This is going to give us the total number of followers that starts with Imron.

510
00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.590
Okay,

511
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:48.760
so now go.

512
00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:59.760
It will take total seconds to a sign.

513
00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:08.260
Permissions and the rest I'm gonna leave out as is I'm not changing anything,

514
00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:11.530
so But this time I'm just gonna change update this one.

515
00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:11.850
Look,

516
00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:18.660
all I did is I am telling the user that you when you run this script,

517
00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:25.350
the script will take this much time to complete is just like as if you are installing a

518
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:28.810
software and the software tells you that it will take that much time.

519
00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:34.830
Took finished insulation and I am putting creating variable and inside the variable.

520
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:40.870
I'm putting this command and that command is going to do is it's gonna drawn at s minus L

521
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:43.890
Imran Asteroid W c minus l.

522
00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:45.850
So what exactly that does.

523
00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:52.050
So this commandment you do ls minus l and then you run it.

524
00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:56.380
It will give you the total number of files that matches in Rhonda Asterix.

525
00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:57.170
So basically,

526
00:23:57.170 --> 00:23:58.950
I'm saying since we have sleep here,

527
00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:03.070
So if there are 10 files and is going to sleep 10 times,

528
00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:06.450
then it's gonna take 10 seconds.

529
00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:11.050
So let's do a sign commission.

530
00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:12.470
See?

531
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:17.550
It says right here it will take 10 seconds to assign permissions because the heart 10 files

532
00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:17.550
.

533
00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:22.050
Okay,

534
00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:24.690
so now let's check right.

535
00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:25.850
Permission and you see,

536
00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:29.660
every fall that has Imran has the right permission.

537
00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:38.050
So these are a few examples off creating these four loops scripts.

538
00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:39.350
Try them,

539
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:40.720
try them again and again,

540
00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:43.570
and you will become a very,

541
00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:45.960
very skilled and four loop.

542
00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:47.760
If you try all of the's scripts
