1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,150
how everyone?

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:07,440
So the last lecture we got an idea about how to create on in teaser variable.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,930
So here we have commands.

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,460
Declare on declare Come on.

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,280
We have to use an option that is hyphen.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,050
I hyphen.

7
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,990
I is to make a in teaser variable.

8
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:23,050
So this selective we understand how to create that constant very bell.

9
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,110
So,

10
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:29,390
Costin variables are basically those variables whose values has been defined.

11
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,150
So that would be same.

12
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,050
Throw the salad script.

13
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,700
Suppose I have a script on at the beginning,

14
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,520
I have created,

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:37,920
you know,

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,670
a few Costin variables like ABC on I'll have another available like BF So two variables

17
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,400
have defined on These are my costume variables.

18
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,150
So once it has been defined,

19
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:54,550
the value of these variables would be seemed throughout the shallow scrape.

20
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,640
Even in this clip,

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,240
in below lines are mentioned some different values,

22
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,360
but it is not going to take those values.

23
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,040
And the starting we have defined these well,

24
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,420
loser as a costume variables.

25
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,510
So these values will be saying on it cannot be changed as well.

26
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:14,000
If anybody is trying to change these values,

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,780
it won't be because these are called,

28
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:17,150
you know,

29
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,250
constant variables or,

30
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,010
we can say read only variables as well.

31
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,940
So there to commands which can be used to,

32
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:24,170
you know,

33
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,750
create the constant variables.

34
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,270
The 1st 1 is your read.

35
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,320
Only on 2nd 1 is your declare.

36
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:29,650
Come on.

37
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:35,810
So read only the name off your variable on the value Second is declared.

38
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:36,610
So declare.

39
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:37,150
Come on.

40
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,670
You have to use one option.

41
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:39,230
That is hyphen.

42
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:42,540
That is to clear Costin Variables.

43
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,730
So But the commands are doing the same thing,

44
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,510
like on these other you know,

45
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,810
building commands as well.

46
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,340
So this is my in a box.

47
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,890
I'm going to show you how to get the,

48
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:52,320
you know,

49
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,860
constant variables.

50
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,990
So I'm going to use this declare.

51
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,480
Come on,

52
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,190
Haifa.

53
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:01,660
On here you have to give the variable name I'm giving.

54
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:12,690
Like any name like this is my available in on the value of my values.

55
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,820
You can give any names like you can give in,

56
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,230
Teacher,

57
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,110
you can give you know,

58
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,040
like any string as well.

59
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,590
If you want to give,

60
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:18,780
like,

61
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,900
this week and also give way,

62
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,050
it is up to you.

63
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,610
Anything you're gonna give here Even you can give number as well.

64
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,010
So I'm giving this one on here.

65
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:28,440
We have,

66
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:28,660
you know,

67
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,250
some data files,

68
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:35,330
some important finds that so any name I have given?

69
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,550
No,

70
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,730
I have defined available the name off.

71
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:43,040
My variable is warmer and it's a constant.

72
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,590
So I'm doing this.

73
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,450
I call this one.

74
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:48,110
No.

75
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:51,590
If anybody is trying to you know t this valuable it is not possible.

76
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:55,160
So this variable has been defined as a constant variable.

77
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,420
This variable is only applicable for this shell,

78
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,350
right?

79
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:03,780
It is not any no environmental variable African See the system variable.

80
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,430
That is same for all the shells.

81
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,980
If you want,

82
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,490
you can make it.

83
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,120
No,

84
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,890
if I'm going to try to change this world like I want to change something like this one it

85
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,900
wanted like you got this has been defined.

86
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,130
So at the beginning,

87
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,600
off a shallow script if you have defined,

88
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,470
like this is my,

89
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:19,900
you know,

90
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,200
costume variables on the script.

91
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,140
If if it is the biggest script and somebody has tried to,

92
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:25,530
you know,

93
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,350
use the same,

94
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:26,850
you know,

95
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,320
variable name,

96
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:28,790
like,

97
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:29,520
warm available.

98
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:29,820
Um,

99
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:34,100
if it is being used in the same script and giving some different values.

100
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,440
So it is not going to be taken.

101
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,840
It cannot be changed once it has been defined.

102
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,840
Even you can.

103
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,090
You cannot believe that.

104
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,210
Well,

105
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:43,430
yes,

106
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:43,640
Well,

107
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:49,900
using this command as well if you want to use this one like this one and it is not going to

108
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,070
be viewed as well well,

109
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,450
over the same this one.

110
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,890
So,

111
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:55,080
friend,

112
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,800
that's all for this lecture will do in the next letter.
