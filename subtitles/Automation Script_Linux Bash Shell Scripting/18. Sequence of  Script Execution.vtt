00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.080
sequence off the script when you are defining command inside off a script.

2
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.000
If you want to run,

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.420
command a command,

4
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.720
be and you want the command be to run first.

5
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.550
Then you should put command be first.

6
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.310
That's how the script works.

7
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.690
It goes through the sequence and start from the beginning,

8
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.160
and it goes to the end.

9
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.750
So if you have command one,

10
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.080
23 and so on,

11
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.960
it will run the command one followed by two,

12
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.950
followed by three.

13
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.090
For example,

14
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.350
if you wanted to run ls command first,

15
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.100
put Ellis Command first in your script,

16
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.440
followed by date and Kell,

17
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.480
which is calendar.

18
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.850
These are a few example commands I just picked.

19
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.860
So if you want to run date command,

20
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.050
the first thing,

21
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.750
then you should move that up before l s command.

22
00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.070
That's how the scripting works.

23
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.550
Any script that you run,

24
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.790
whether it's a corn shell,

25
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:02.380
poor old,

26
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.050
any kind off programming language that you know,

27
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.990
it runs this way in a sequence,

28
00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.050
something you should know.

29
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.550
And ah,

30
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.240
if you are confused that hey,

31
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.160
I run if else statement.

32
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:27.950
But if works this way and it runs else that way because that those are the statement

33
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:28.390
scripts.

34
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.570
We will cover that statement.

35
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.480
Scripts Don't confuse yourself right now,

36
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:38.040
but focus on this one script sequence it always 1123 as they are sequential in a sequential

37
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.350
order.
