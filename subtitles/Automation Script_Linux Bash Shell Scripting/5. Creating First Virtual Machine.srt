1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,550
creating virtual machine.

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:03,590
In this lesson,

3
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:05,670
we will create our first social machine.

4
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,650
And on victory will be installing are sent OS clinics operating system.

5
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:13,460
But worker machine is basically nothing but a shell.

6
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:14,330
Ah,

7
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,260
container,

8
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:21,960
which holds the information off a machine CPU memory disc and all the resource is this

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,750
fortune machine is gonna be sharing.

10
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,310
The resource is wherever it is installed.

11
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,620
So let's say if it is installed on my laptop,

12
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,530
it will be sharing.

13
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,650
The resource is from a laptop,

14
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:36,910
the Oracle work show box.

15
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:37,950
I'm gonna open it up.

16
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:46,360
Okay,

17
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,450
so this is the window for the Oracle Horschel box.

18
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,550
I'm gonna click on new.

19
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:59,850
The name I will pick is my first Lennox,

20
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,750
the M.

21
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,030
And if you notice,

22
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:04,920
um,

23
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,380
the virtual box is smart enough to OPEC,

24
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,000
the operatives,

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,950
his assistant type and version for you.

26
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:16,350
You probably noticed that you are going to see the 64 bit.

27
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,240
You are probably seeing 32 big.

28
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,610
Now,

29
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,920
if you are seeing a 32 bit,

30
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:32,780
then either your computer is 32 bit architecture or the virtualization technology is not

31
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:33,450
enabled.

32
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,200
First,

33
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,910
let's find out if my computer is 64 or not.

34
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:40,150
So let's go to start menu computer.

35
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:46,950
I'm gonna click right click and go to properties.

36
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:53,610
Once the property comes up,

37
00:01:53,610 --> 00:02:00,750
you will see here it will tell you if it's Win seven PC and right here you're gonna see or

38
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,910
is this system type?

39
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:04,550
It's a 64 bit operating system.

40
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,680
So that's one way.

41
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,620
That's one of the reason that when I'm building my worship machine,

42
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,150
it is coming up 64 bed operating system.

43
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:22,070
The second reason you might not gonna see it 64 is if you don't have virtual technology

44
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,150
enabled in your bias sitting.

45
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,190
If that's the case,

46
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:36,350
I have actually pasted an article and in my in this lesson and there is a link to it,

47
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:43,660
I would recommend that you could go that link and try the settings that are recommended and

48
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,530
see if it changes the 64 setting.

49
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:46,550
I'm sure it will work.

50
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,470
If not,

51
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,950
you will always email me back.

52
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:57,920
So I'm gonna leave thes setting sugar click next Now here is gonna ask me the size off the

53
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,250
memory I want to assign to this virtual machine.

54
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,120
Now,

55
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,410
by default is picking up one gig off memory now,

56
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:12,760
you should also keep in mind How much memory do you have actually in your laptop?

57
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,360
So in my laptop,

58
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,650
I have Let's look at my computer again,

59
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,250
Right?

60
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,950
Click properties,

61
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,150
and you will see here.

62
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:26,490
My computer has installed memory is four gig.

63
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,400
So it is.

64
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,920
It is wise that I keep the memory below that digit.

65
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,630
That number.

66
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,750
So I have four gig,

67
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,050
so I'm gonna give one gig up that memory to dis virtual machine.

68
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,850
I'm click next,

69
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,890
create a new Horschel desk.

70
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:43,310
Yes.

71
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:46,640
It will create a brand new Horschel disk.

72
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,350
Next,

73
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:52,520
leave the default dynamically allocated.

74
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:57,150
Lee the default post.

75
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,820
Um then this is the size of the disc.

76
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,780
By default,

77
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,880
it picks a gig.

78
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,950
I wanted to pick 10 gig just to be safe.

79
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,450
So I'm gonna just click inside this box,

80
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:16,050
remove and type 10 and click create.

81
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:19,790
And there you go.

82
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:24,700
This is my first worship machine that is created again.

83
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:29,340
Think off it as a piece of hardware that's been created for me.

84
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,940
I'm on the assembly line.

85
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,960
I'm putting the CPU and putting the memory and putting the hardest.

86
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,050
I'm putting everything in that machine and I built a machine.

87
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,900
So once the machine is built,

88
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,450
what is the next step?

89
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:44,590
Next step is to install the operating system,

90
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,130
and in our course,

91
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:50,120
we will be working with Santo s up a ring system.

92
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,020
So I'm gonna power this on,

93
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,850
and I'm gonna install the operating system.

94
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,110
But of course,

95
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:58,010
before I go ahead and install the offering system,

96
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:01,350
I do need the software ISO image.

97
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,730
So in the next lecture,

98
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:06,840
we will cover how we're going to download the IRS.

99
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,010
So,

100
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:07,650
software,

101
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:13,750
and then how you could attach that software to this Lennox of'em,

102
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:18,250
and then we will boot off off that software.
