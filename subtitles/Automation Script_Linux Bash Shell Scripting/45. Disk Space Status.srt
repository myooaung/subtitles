1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,790
disk space.

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:04,910
Check status,

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:05,850
no matter what.

4
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:06,810
Um,

5
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,140
you are doing an i t.

6
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,140
This is one of the issue that everybody experiences.

7
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,070
Whether you are a database administrator,

8
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:19,140
networking guy Lennox guy Windows guy are working in any kind of application capacity.

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,750
You always going to get to this point where you will have a dis space issue and this space

10
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,530
issue either on your own computer owned a laptop or a server that you're working on,

11
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,740
where you would have to actually tell the administrator Hey,

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,510
can you free up to this space and administrator would eventually go in and free up the

13
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:37,850
space by deleting discs.

14
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:38,550
But anyway,

15
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:39,450
ah,

16
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,950
system administrators or engineers who are actually managing the servers,

17
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,660
weather's windows,

18
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,300
Lennox or any other offering system,

19
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:56,010
they have to be vigilant off all the system health and biggest.

20
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,750
One of the main system health that you have to check is the dis space.

21
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,350
If the Dace base is out,

22
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,370
it's 100%.

23
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:07,480
Then your system will become unresponsive,

24
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,530
and sometimes what happens is you know you want to delete a file,

25
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,930
but it's too late because you cannot even log in.

26
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:15,760
The system is not letting you insult.

27
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:22,350
You have to be proactive and make sure you're dis space does not get to 100%.

28
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,360
So that's one of the real life examples that everybody would faces,

29
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,160
and I'm gonna put a script for it.

30
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,650
And then we will automate that,

31
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:34,080
and we'll make sure this it's not gonna happen in anybody's,

32
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:40,220
um of professional career where they will have to face the issue off this base.

33
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,760
So what we'll do is in this lesson is,

34
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,160
well,

35
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,650
first,

36
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,050
find displace using the DF commit.

37
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,680
Of course,

38
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,190
there are different commands as well,

39
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,750
but the most ah,

40
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:55,150
important command and mostly used command is DF.

41
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,470
You could also use um,

42
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:02,530
D you to find a disk usage based on a file system as well.

43
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:08,310
But DF is we'll give you the file system usage on petition level,

44
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,560
and this is what we're looking for.

45
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,840
So we'll run that command,

46
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:18,720
and what we'll do is we'll run different scripts that will filter output and compare so it

47
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,790
will run the same script D of command.

48
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:27,650
And then we'll put the filters around like grab this off that column and then do the

49
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:28,540
comparison.

50
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:33,190
If this column is greater than 90 then let me know.

51
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:36,850
Or if it's less than that than what do you want to do if then statement.

52
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,620
So there are different ways we're gonna do that.

53
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,850
Compare comparison.

54
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,120
This is a longer way to do it.

55
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,720
It's always been done like that.

56
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,380
But now on at the end,

57
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,950
I'll also show a simple script which will actually go in.

58
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,330
And it's like a one liner script,

59
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:56,850
and it will actually tell you the dead space and that I'll show you at the end.

60
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:02,050
So let's go into the clinic server that we have.

61
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:06,490
Okay,

62
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,160
I have this terminal open.

63
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,610
And for this space,

64
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:10,950
you would have to be,

65
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,000
um,

66
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,600
route.

67
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:13,910
No,

68
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:14,590
I don't think so.

69
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,990
For DF minus h,

70
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,340
yes.

71
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,810
You could run that command without being so that's what you don't have to be rude.

72
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,360
Just make sure you are in Ah,

73
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,500
ps directory,

74
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,770
which is my home.

75
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,100
I have solved PS directory.

76
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,750
That's where I'm keeping all my script.

77
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,320
Okay,

78
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,170
so the first thing first what do you want to do?

79
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:40,190
You want to run the command d of mines H and the status that you will get is not from the

80
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:40,790
size,

81
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:45,550
not from used not from available from the usage column.

82
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:53,780
If the usage column is reaching above 90 or 95 in some companies than it's a problem,

83
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,550
and you should be aware of that.

84
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,540
And if you do not have,

85
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,150
um,

86
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:05,550
some kind off monitoring application deployed in your systems,

87
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,250
then you would have to do it manually.

88
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:11,440
And sometimes the systems do not behave normal.

89
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,150
When you install a monitoring agent on it,

90
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:18,920
then you have no luck but to create an automation tool yourself like we are going to do

91
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,750
here in this lesson.

92
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,820
So we will focus on this column,

93
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:27,890
which is 123 4/5 column and we will compare with our threshold.

94
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:31,040
If threshold goes above 90 let me know,

95
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,650
complain.

96
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,930
If it's been stays below 90 and perfect,

97
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,980
just keep running it and keep doing your job.

98
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:38,350
Okay,

99
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,480
so for that,

100
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,430
we know that now,

101
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,170
as you could see,

102
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,360
the first thing we have to do is DF minds H.

103
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:50,050
And now we have to get rid off these temp FS petition.

104
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:55,860
These are swap space and you don't want to get any information on that,

105
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:09,370
so you will do igra minus V T m p f s or Dev TMP fs So I don't want filter out everything

106
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:12,350
that has TEM profess or deaf Tampa office.

107
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,980
Now it enter.

108
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:21,270
And now you'll see that you have flow's system right here on Lee,

109
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,090
the one you're looking for now.

110
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,760
You could also get it off the first line if you want to.

111
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:34,040
So let's see if I could get rid off first line and the first line is file system size used

112
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:47,450
or less until minus and plus to can it has gotten got rid off the first line.

113
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:48,440
Perfect.

114
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,740
Now we have four petitions route as D B one as D.

115
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,690
B s D.

116
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:55,710
A one and V g.

117
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:56,150
Oracle.

118
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:01,350
Now you'll probably have a different file system in your environment,

119
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,350
and I'm sure you do not,

120
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,550
just probably because your system is probably built.

121
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,050
Um,

122
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:08,680
of course,

123
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,610
your system is actually built on a different way or different petition,

124
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:19,170
so you will see something else on the file system being mounted and actual file system.

125
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,000
But I'm sure you are following me.

126
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,410
What?

127
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,150
What?

128
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:26,850
I'm talking about how we could get rid off the stuff that we do not want.

129
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,170
Okay,

130
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,200
so that part is done.

131
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,580
Now,

132
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,310
what do you want to do?

133
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,650
We want to get on ley the fifth column,

134
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:33,380
Right?

135
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,060
Because Fifth column is the one right here.

136
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,850
This is the column that we wanted to do a comparison on.

137
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:43,350
So we'll do talk 50.

138
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,990
Oh,

139
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:47,290
yeah.

140
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:51,650
I accidentally percent signs should be dollar signs.

141
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,550
Um,

142
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:58,650
I think this is not the right column looking for Oh,

143
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,250
I made a mistake.

144
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:05,850
I for fourth column on Want to replace it?

145
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:09,320
Have you know,

146
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,250
72 16 and two?

147
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,410
Okay,

148
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,080
we are hair up to here.

149
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,680
Perfect.

150
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,050
Now,

151
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:23,200
if we are comparing these inter Jewish with our pre defined number,

152
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,550
let's say we wanted to get an alert.

153
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,150
If the value is above,

154
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:32,330
that's a 60 and then we know the value of 70.

155
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,450
But it has this percentage sign.

156
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:37,250
So when we do the comparison,

157
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:42,500
but if else statements this is gonna complain and script won't run,

158
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,950
so we have to get rid of this percent sign as well.

159
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,680
So to get rid off,

160
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,720
that is,

161
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:57,170
I would use the cut command cut minus D and unwanted character,

162
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:09,360
which is percentage coat single coat space minus F one and you will see.

163
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:09,640
Okay,

164
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,570
let me make this bigger.

165
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:17,450
So you will see the entire command hit a parakeet.

166
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:21,260
So command filter,

167
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,630
filter or the first column,

168
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:29,750
The first raw filter out fifth column and cut and get rid off percent sign.

169
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,050
And once you get rid of a percent sign,

170
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,960
give me the first field and first feel his number one field,

171
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,950
which was right here.

172
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:39,780
And then if I put f two,

173
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,040
it would give me just percent if you want.

174
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,810
So we got to this point.

175
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:45,370
Perfect.

176
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,960
Said this is what exactly?

177
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:51,250
We wanted to get out from D of command so he could do our comparison.

178
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:51,870
Now,

179
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:57,640
what you would have to do is now you create a script and do a four loop.

180
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:17,550
So let's say you did this and you copy it and you create a script called check disk and you

181
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:24,750
give defined the shell out there.

182
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:30,750
Um,

183
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:40,450
date description.

184
00:09:40,450 --> 00:10:04,050
This script will check for disk space modified I put down right here.

185
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:07,220
Okay,

186
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:13,150
So this is going to give us all the values in the fifth column off the D of command,

187
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:17,450
and it will filter out the percent sign.

188
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,950
So if I just run this script like that,

189
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:28,550
check this B I check disk.

190
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:31,210
Um oh,

191
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,080
I put it a variable.

192
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,840
That's why didn't run.

193
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:39,350
So just take other variable and just stick in the command by itself.

194
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,750
And then do check this.

195
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:48,350
You'll see it is giving me or the entire column and with four roars.

196
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,190
Okay,

197
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:49,470
good.

198
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,850
So now we know we are getting the result if you want.

199
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:59,010
Now we have to give this entire command and a sign of variable and I'll give the variable

200
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:03,750
name A and if it's a command you take,

201
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,120
which is right above Sorry,

202
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,750
which is right below the escape.

203
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:14,050
And you close it the entire command with tick as well.

204
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:16,780
This will show that this is a command,

205
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,850
not just a value.

206
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:24,910
So now what we wanted Now we have to use the four loop he could use.

207
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,240
We could do this first,

208
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:37,550
like if dollar A is greater than let's say 50.

209
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:57,250
Then at go check disk space else we don't want to do anything else just fee and done.

210
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,630
But it will not run.

211
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,610
Let's try.

212
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:01,050
Run it,

213
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,130
C.

214
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:03,810
It didn't run.

215
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:04,270
Okay?

216
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,080
The reason it didn't run.

217
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,790
It says too many arguments.

218
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,110
You see,

219
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,720
it's is right here to money argument,

220
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,260
White home.

221
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:10,850
Any argument,

222
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:15,850
because when we run that line,

223
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,850
this command,

224
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:21,660
it gives us more than one value.

225
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,250
Remember,

226
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:26,650
gives gave us four rose with four different values.

227
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:30,610
So if it has given us only one value,

228
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,730
let's see if it has given us,

229
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:33,250
Um,

230
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:37,090
just draw first role and number is 40.

231
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,020
Then it would work.

232
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,720
But since it has four O's,

233
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:45,240
then we have to use four loop for that so that so four Luke can go from first roll,

234
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,160
second role,

235
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:46,980
third row,

236
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:51,490
fourth row and then done once it's finished looking at every row.

237
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:54,980
So that's why just for single if is not gonna work.

238
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,950
We have to put a four loop around it.

239
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:04,250
So how we do it we do for and I'll put I as invariable in dollar eight.

240
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,020
What does Soleri dollar a is this variable?

241
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,030
So what I'm saying is,

242
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:11,250
whatever the result is coming from this line,

243
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:15,700
put it into another variable and DeBary with his I Okay,

244
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,450
I put it in.

245
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:24,670
It's it's in the variables in the container nobody want do now I want to do is if that

246
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,690
container is dollar,

247
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,450
I now not dollar eight.

248
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:31,550
That container has a value.

249
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:39,850
Anything above 90% which is 90 then echo check disk space,

250
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:41,250
see?

251
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:46,750
And then done cause we're doing for Luke.

252
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,300
Sorry,

253
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,950
I missed one thing.

254
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:55,490
Four also has do for I in dollar a then do what?

255
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:55,870
Right.

256
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:56,440
So I missed that.

257
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:02,950
Do if which is finishing off a fee and do is finishing up with done.

258
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:06,450
Or now when I run this quick,

259
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:09,870
it is not going to give me anything.

260
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:10,210
Why?

261
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:21,840
Because I have defined the value as if the output off this command any of the output is

262
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,650
above the number 90.

263
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,650
Then tell me that check this space.

264
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,950
Put none of the output.

265
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,590
This detective,

266
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,230
none of them has 90.

267
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:38,330
My file system is the highest 1 70 So I have to pick a value that is below 70.

268
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:40,450
So this baby could verify our script.

269
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:41,440
So instead,

270
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,350
off 90 I will pick 50.

271
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:53,500
So now audition work Now it should give me this Check this space so I'll do clear this

272
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,450
green check disk.

273
00:14:55,450 --> 00:15:03,760
They go see it says check this space because it did find one off the values that is above

274
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,050
50 and it complaint.

275
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:07,250
Now we have to be a little more.

276
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:07,750
Um,

277
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,350
we need a little more information from it.

278
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:10,910
That's it.

279
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,220
Not Just check this papers.

280
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,310
Tell me what rich partition.

281
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:14,660
Right.

282
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:18,950
So if I have this four petitions that I was looking for,

283
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:25,550
let me cat my script and the me run this command again,

284
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:29,640
and you will see I have this for partition.

285
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:35,450
Let me take out this one has have these four partition,

286
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:38,700
and it gives me if I run my command,

287
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,350
just check disk.

288
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:47,630
It gives me check this space because it actually met the value I have defined.

289
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:51,190
But it only gives me information that check this space,

290
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,600
but not which this space.

291
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,250
So in order for me to be more,

292
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,420
um,

293
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,710
informational about this error,

294
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:01,540
I have to give it there map drive as well.

295
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,150
So how can I also give the map drive information?

296
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:09,850
But I could do is I could come in here and I'll say echo this base.

297
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:14,050
Check this base and output dollar.

298
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:19,530
I like which the space if this is dollar eyes only gonna give me the number Okay,

299
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:20,230
Nice.

300
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,250
I have the number.

301
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:24,550
There's to check the number Bush numbers.

302
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,560
You're the screen.

303
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,350
Check this.

304
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,020
Check.

305
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,260
Disk space 70.

306
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:30,850
Okay.

307
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,040
Your hair.

308
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:39,130
So now we know that there is a dead space are disputation with up to 70%.

309
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:44,690
Now we also need more information that which this partition all right,

310
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,960
no problem will keep working on that.

311
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,940
So for that,

312
00:16:47,940 --> 00:17:02,350
what we have to do is we have to grab that dollar I from the d of command of So if I put in

313
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,560
right here,

314
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,340
I could do tick,

315
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,480
because again,

316
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:15,450
this is a command DF minus h grip for dollar and take clothes.

317
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:21,760
So now echo will echo out this.

318
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,450
And if I don't put in right here,

319
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:31,660
then it will read out the entire eco with DF minus crab.

320
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,650
Let me show.

321
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,100
You know what said this way?

322
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,150
You know what I'm talking about.

323
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,110
So let's say if I take out,

324
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:39,350
take and run the check.

325
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,110
You see,

326
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,950
it is giving me DF minus age,

327
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:46,850
as if it's it's actually it wanted to up with the screen.

328
00:17:46,850 --> 00:18:06,710
So that is why I have to put a tick around and close of now.

329
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:16,950
I should have the exact information They checked this base 70 which is on file system Santo

330
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:23,270
s dash route and space in an entire thing and it is mounted on slash.

331
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,760
So is basically gripping it.

332
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,740
That number.

333
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,370
And of course,

334
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,420
the number exists.

335
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,540
That's why I'm gonna get So anyway,

336
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:33,260
this is the four loop that you would have to use to check the displaced.

337
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,090
Another way.

338
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:38,130
We have the same script written a different way.

339
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,990
I actually got the script.

340
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,930
The second script from online.

341
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:48,350
I was looking online and this was the script that I found out initially.

342
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:51,160
So I I have already created the script,

343
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:57,860
and I What I did is I copied the create disk file.

344
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,040
Sorry.

345
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:03,950
Check disk and I copied it to one.

346
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,310
And I have to now.

347
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:10,450
So I'm gonna go to the 2nd 1 but IHS checked this one.

348
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,720
Okay.

349
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,470
And this one,

350
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:16,000
you will see it is slightly written differently.

351
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,050
Um,

352
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,060
what it is doing is it's running command.

353
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:26,280
DF minus h upper case h ah which is pretty much the same as the lower case.

354
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:26,670
H.

355
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:34,620
If you wanted to see what man DF has with minus h upper case h.

356
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,160
Actually,

357
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:40,350
this is likewise but use powers off 1000 not one down,

358
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,950
1024

359
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:44,990
So it's pretty much give the same thing somewhere.

360
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:47,350
Leave it as is with grab E.

361
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:51,230
It is trying to filter out anything that starts with file system.

362
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,320
Tim Papacy,

363
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,390
Jerome um,

364
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,860
or death of her temper.

365
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:59,660
First is doing the same thing than oc print dollar one.

366
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,140
Sorry,

367
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,490
Dollar five and dollar one,

368
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:03,550
which is the Fifth Column and first called.

369
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:17,060
So when I run this command just that and mice other terminal I have to put a d of mine

370
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:25,050
safety before that DF my upper case h And now I run the command and I'll get that up.

371
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:30,310
So pretty much the same way I did now differences that they instead off doing using the

372
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:30,900
four look,

373
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,050
they're using the why look so in while Lou,

374
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:40,950
what they're doing is the while read the output and the output is this entire command.

375
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:47,610
So put the output of this entire command into the variable call up on,

376
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:48,350
then do,

377
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:52,740
and they're defining another variable and enter.

378
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:59,330
The variable they're doing is echo the output and talking it and print dollar one,

379
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:05,760
which is the file system cutting it and getting a percent sign if there's any to it.

380
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,050
And um,

381
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:09,920
no,

382
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,280
sorry,

383
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:15,950
but the output they're trying to get rid off the fifth column percent sign and putting it f

384
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:18,370
one second variable.

385
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,590
The defining is echoed the same output,

386
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,020
which is Thea operate hair,

387
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:29,690
disa variable and auk and dollars print dollar to have a little space here,

388
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,050
I'll just get rid of the space.

389
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:32,580
Okay,

390
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,010
then.

391
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,760
If the use percentage,

392
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,260
which is this variable,

393
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:42,340
is greater than 90 then echo running out of the space petition,

394
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:45,800
which is this petition variable on host name,

395
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,520
which is the host name of this machine as on date,

396
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,910
which is today's date and fee and don't.

397
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:56,350
So this is written a little differently and let's try to run the script.

398
00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:00,050
This one,

399
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:08,730
it didn't give me anything because the the set value is 90.

400
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:19,910
So I'm going to change it to 50 and now I run it and you will see it is giving me this

401
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:20,580
entire line.

402
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:28,320
Running out of this base on this file system 70% on my first linens is the host name.

403
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:34,590
As on September Saturday and the date and time and everything because it has that date in

404
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:34,730
it,

405
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:35,260
too.

406
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:38,050
You could use that one if you want to.

407
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,580
Um,

408
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,420
it's a little bit complicated,

409
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:44,260
but if you do understand this group perfect.

410
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,610
Be my guest used that one.

411
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:47,160
It works perfectly as well.

412
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,280
Um,

413
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:53,250
and it is not using for loop as I was using it in my previous script.

414
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,550
So now you have to scrape.

415
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:58,020
So the third script that I wanted to show you guys,

416
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,820
which is very easy and simple and straightforward.

417
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,410
I'm gonna copy.

418
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:09,460
Check disk to check disk three V.

419
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:14,660
I check this three and let's get rid off.

420
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,160
Um,

421
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,350
everything.

422
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:28,550
And what this was going to do is DF minus h look.

423
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:31,760
So oh,

424
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:42,550
single coat zero plus dollar five.

425
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:48,950
Greater than or equal to 10.

426
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:50,160
This is,

427
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,660
ah,

428
00:23:51,660 --> 00:24:03,660
stressful that I wanted to go with and print the threshold.

429
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,800
Okay,

430
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:18,350
so if I just run this command just like that single,

431
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:26,920
it is giving me everything that is above 10% on the fifth column.

432
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:33,350
So what I'm saying is the fifth column has to be cool or greater than 10.

433
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:35,660
So these are the equal and greater than 10.

434
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,610
So if I modify that to,

435
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:40,850
let's say 50 then it will give me only the one of them.

436
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:42,760
One of the rose,

437
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:50,830
which is slash mounted so put to put it in script.

438
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:54,450
So what we'll do is we'll who echo this is simple line.

439
00:24:54,450 --> 00:25:07,640
Another echo following is the disc space steps go on more line and then it will do is run

440
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,050
that same command right here.

441
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:20,950
I'll get rid of this and I will filter or what I don't want.

442
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:29,550
And I will just print dollar five and dollar six,

443
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:33,450
and that's pretty much it.

444
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:37,050
This is just that simple script.

445
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:39,730
What it's doing is it's running a DF minus,

446
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:40,450
each command,

447
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:46,700
walking it the fifth column and saying this is just the way it is.

448
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,850
Zero plus dollar five.

449
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:57,660
And if the dollar five fifth column is greater than or equal to 10 then print that and talk

450
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,050
fifth and sixth column.

451
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:08,220
So let's run check Disk three and following is a diss based out of 70 and 16.

452
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:08,660
Perfect.

453
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,280
No,

454
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:18,560
Since I have the threshold set to 10 I will modify that to 90 or whatever.

455
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,680
So since I the lowest when I have 70.

456
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,970
So I'll go with Ah,

457
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:23,700
sixties.

458
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,030
Anything above 60.

459
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:27,850
I should get a message.

460
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:37,450
And it sees the following is the dis space status 70% and this is how I'm gonna get the

461
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:38,090
result.

462
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,770
When I run this command,

463
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:42,380
I could change the value to whichever the value I want.

464
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:47,550
So this the last group that I have written this is the one I've been using lately because

465
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:49,450
very much simpler.

466
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:52,850
And we clear the screen very much simpler.

467
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:55,520
And it's one liner.

468
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,550
You don't have to use a four loop.

469
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,090
You don't have to use the while loop.

470
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:02,760
You could just simply use this command to check the disc space status.

471
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:07,000
So now you learn how to do how to check the Dace base with four loop.

472
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,350
How to check the displays.

473
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:08,630
Why,

474
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:08,960
Luke,

475
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,160
and how to check the display simply by one line,

476
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,880
Three different options.

477
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,230
Try every every,

478
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:16,600
all three scripts and,

479
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,000
um,

480
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,850
see if you are actually,

481
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:19,800
um,

482
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,100
having any issues,

483
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,660
and I'm sure all three of them should work for you.
