00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.620
aliases.

2
00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.660
What are those aliases?

3
00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:06.280
Well,

4
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.190
in real life,

5
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:13.900
Ellis is like a short name or easier name or something easy to remember.

6
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.770
So I'm sure everybody has,

7
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:16.410
Ah,

8
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.200
nickname when you were growing up.

9
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.770
Um,

10
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.450
and just like other people who are very famous,

11
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.190
Just look at 50 cents he has his real name is Curtis James.

12
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.020
And,

13
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:29.460
um,

14
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.490
there's another one like another example would be pitbull.

15
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.730
His real name is Armando Paredes.

16
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.590
Eso Those aren't the real names,

17
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.240
but they're Ellis is is shorter.

18
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.770
So the shore aversion and shorter name they have is because easier for people to remember

19
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.550
them since the same way it is his work in Lenox to So there are very long commands that

20
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.200
you'll run almost every day.

21
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.440
But you need a sure aversion off it.

22
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.440
And how do you create a short version or a short reward for it is by creating aliases.

23
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.580
So again,

24
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:09.750
this is very popular command that is used to cut down on Lenti and repetitive commands.

25
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.560
And some off those examples that I have listed here we will cover those example one by one

26
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.290
in our legs machines that they say you exactly know what how leases work.

27
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:29.770
So let's go to our machine and we'll go into our or courtroom machine Consul Terminal.

28
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.880
And we will try these aliases command one by one.

29
00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:41.260
So the first Commander having Ellis is is ls so often time If you want to know all the

30
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:49.200
files of in minus l and a option to listing or a for to also show the head and files,

31
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.650
we will run the command ls minus l eighth or a L.

32
00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:59.450
And you will see all the listing of the files and directories we have in our home directory

33
00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.450
.

34
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.570
And this is our home directory.

35
00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:02.200
Simon,

36
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.960
run that command.

37
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.550
Often time,

38
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:04.790
you'll forget the option.

39
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.430
So what do you do?

40
00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.650
Will create an alias,

41
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.250
So we'll create a low Yes.

42
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.050
And instead of just lsl cree tell,

43
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.030
um,

44
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:23.300
equal coat ls minus a l coat clothes and just hit Enter.

45
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.250
Once you hit,

46
00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.290
enter and you don't get an error message back.

47
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.790
It means that aliases created Now,

48
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.370
how do you verify for screen but simply running an alias?

49
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.270
But l l was our alias and let's run it.

50
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.470
And there we go.

51
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.200
We got the up as if you were running whole command.

52
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.030
Let's create another alias,

53
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.660
the other areas what it will do.

54
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.200
It will,

55
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.150
um,

56
00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.240
do the PW d for you And also do ls for you.

57
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.350
So to command in one shot that you would you don't have to run twice.

58
00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:06.860
So do pl pl I picked the word just for print working directory and Ellis equal coat pwd and

59
00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:14.980
you separate each command with semi Colin and Elvis and coat closed.

60
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.240
You hit enter.

61
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.380
And now and I'm gonna tie pl I should get pwd and L s command running.

62
00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.430
So first let's clear the screen and I'm gonna write pl And there you go.

63
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.570
So the first command it run was pwd Next command ran ls So every time I log into the system

64
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.570
,

65
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.870
I'll just do pl And it will run those two commands for me.

66
00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:42.620
Let's keep going on and let's try our 3rd 1 which has three commands.

67
00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.870
Who am I host name and PWD.

68
00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.110
So I want you to create the alias on your own.

69
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.140
I'm gonna go onto the next one.

70
00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.920
Um,

71
00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:58.950
next one is it will list all the directories inside off my home directory.

72
00:03:58.950 --> 00:03:59.560
Um,

73
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.860
I groaned a command ls minus l and a group,

74
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.520
but And the cap right here that you see,

75
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.680
which is on top of number six?

76
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.800
That's it's telling the group group everything.

77
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.540
Um,

78
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.250
that starts with D.

79
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.550
So run that and you will see it crept Everything.

80
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:22.580
I'm in the output that starts with D.

81
00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.220
So off course,

82
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.370
anything that starts with D is what is a directory.

83
00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.530
So that's what it's getting.

84
00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.250
So I'm gonna create an alias for it,

85
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:42.830
and I'm gonna call the deal I o r equal coat Vellis minus l and I'm gonna grow up it the d

86
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:49.160
enter clear the screen and let's see if it's working by typing de ir.

87
00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.360
And yes,

88
00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.470
it is working.

89
00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.990
Then I'm gonna try the last command in my list.

90
00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:04.100
So what last Command is doing?

91
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.860
Sorry,

92
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.780
I just have to move this little mawr and resize this.

93
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.660
It'll see the last command.

94
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.730
So what last Command is doing is,

95
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:15.290
of course,

96
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:16.980
it's doing DF minus h.

97
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.550
Let's run DF minus h.

98
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:25.100
We could output your petitions information the size where's amounted and how much is used.

99
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.400
And the next command is doing the F at Mons.

100
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.040
Age is printing it's walking.

101
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.010
The last column.

102
00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:46.960
I believe he has dollar six close and you will see it is showing you let me make this

103
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.150
smaller too.

104
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:55.100
So it's listing all everything that is in the last column,

105
00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.390
which is a column six.

106
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:59.070
Now I want to get in that output.

107
00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:03.570
I want to get on Lee the 1st 4 characters off this output.

108
00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:10.050
So I'm gonna run the command again and I'm gonna do cut my A C one through four.

109
00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.470
It enter.

110
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:13.930
And there you go.

111
00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.310
This is what it's telling me that the last column,

112
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.800
these air,

113
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.090
the petitions that I have in my Lennox distribution.

114
00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:25.640
Sometimes you do want to run that command just to find out what petitions you have.

115
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.750
You don't want to look at other other information that DF minus it gives you.

116
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.160
So I'm gonna create an alias for that.

117
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.950
So I'll just hit a barrel key off course to bring the command back.

118
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:42.570
I'll go back all the way to the two beginning of the line by hitting the left arrow key.

119
00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:43.920
I'll type ale.

120
00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:44.450
Yes,

121
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:49.990
and I'm gonna name this alias as just d equal.

122
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.590
Of course I have to put quotation here.

123
00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:54.250
Double coat.

124
00:06:54.250 --> 00:07:01.730
And there is one little thing you have to change here is you see here dollar sign in Lenox

125
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:05.550
Dollar sign has what meaning If you guys remember,

126
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:11.710
dollar sign is actually outputs of variable Whatever that you have variable inside that you

127
00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:16.660
Attash scripting it actually puts it in there so it will think that it's a variable too,

128
00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.520
so we don't want to tell its variable.

129
00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.760
So how we could,

130
00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:20.990
uh,

131
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:26.390
change that or how we could tell Lennox not to think it is as a alias.

132
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:33.940
Eso he has a variable toe put back slash after putting the backslash move or liver to the

133
00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:40.560
end and hit quotation close that enter and it created my alias.

134
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.000
Now if I do d again,

135
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.200
that's clear the screen.

136
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.800
I'm gonna do a D again and very good.

137
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:53.160
It's doing exactly the same thing we wanted to do except with with all that long,

138
00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.690
tedious command you to have to run it all the time.

139
00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:57.270
So it's much easier.

140
00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:58.520
Every time you log into the system,

141
00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.480
you type D and you'll get your information.

142
00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.390
Isn't that cool?

143
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:08.270
It is very cool because that's why most of the time people use aliases,

144
00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:13.480
so it will be easier to remember and do the tedious work in a very short amount of time.

145
00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.370
Now,

146
00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:16.400
where are those aliases created?

147
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:21.680
Once you type aliases without any running creating a new command,

148
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.060
just type releases Hit.

149
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:23.940
Enter.

150
00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:25.540
You will see right here.

151
00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:28.860
It will give you all the aliases that I have created.

152
00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:30.390
He knows right here.

153
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:34.200
This is Want dessert to another one right here.

154
00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:40.040
And then there are another one right here and the last one.

155
00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:40.270
No,

156
00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:43.360
this was other ones that are already created.

157
00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.390
It's already there by the system by default.

158
00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:47.650
It's already there for us,

159
00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:49.790
so I don't have to touch it now.

160
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:54.210
What if I wanted to remove that alias from the list off?

161
00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:55.560
Elicit a creel simply,

162
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:56.670
There's a command to do.

163
00:08:56.670 --> 00:09:02.250
It is a new alias and you type the alias name.

164
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.080
So if you notice the first a list we have,

165
00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.890
you have his name just deep somewhere.

166
00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:09.530
Just type deep it anay listed.

167
00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:11.300
Let's see if it still exists.

168
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.950
You just type bilious and see if the alias exist there or not.

169
00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:16.350
It does not.

170
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:17.330
It's gone.

171
00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:20.850
There's another alias de IR until Alias as well.

172
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:22.550
The I R.

173
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:25.330
And then I'm gonna try to check if it's there.

174
00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:25.680
Nope.

175
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:26.370
It's gone.

176
00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:28.150
So it's just that simple.
