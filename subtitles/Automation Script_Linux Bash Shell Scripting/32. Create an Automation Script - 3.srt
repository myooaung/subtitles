1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,900
everyone.

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,490
So let's continue and do the last part of the script.

3
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,270
So I'm going to you know,

4
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,640
added my men escape on cyber side.

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,560
Let me execute this.

6
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,280
Kept as well.

7
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,750
They so still here.

8
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:18,850
We have already discussed right on day and check the architecture.

9
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:19,550
We have this.

10
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:20,160
Come on.

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,240
That is your name Hyphen.

12
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:22,750
Um,

13
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:22,940
here.

14
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,650
You can see that on same.

15
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:24,990
You know,

16
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,900
I've used the bash color number that it started before the green.

17
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,100
And that is 31 for the red color.

18
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,060
Same concept for commonalities.

19
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:34,650
You can see that.

20
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:35,900
I've used your name hyphen.

21
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,700
Our host name in telling like we have used host name hyphen,

22
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,470
Capital light,

23
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,150
simple fire host name hyphen capital.

24
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,630
It is going to print war,

25
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:45,050
Lynton.

26
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:48,230
Life is you have on your system here to check the Deena's.

27
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:48,980
We have used this.

28
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:49,420
Come on.

29
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,040
All right,

30
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,390
I'm going to cut this and also for the name.

31
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,410
So let's see what our But I'm getting here.

32
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,100
I can see that in the names that I'm getting all the non.

33
00:00:59,100 --> 00:00:59,630
I'd be off.

34
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:00,730
My name's over.

35
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:05,210
So if I'm going to cut this file So this is the file which keeps the information about your

36
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,540
names over here.

37
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,590
You can see that I have you.

38
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,370
I'm getting a lot of other output as well.

39
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,400
So first of all,

40
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:11,970
it is going to,

41
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:12,130
you know,

42
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,480
use said so we'll have a separate section.

43
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,110
Nobody's SOS here Saturday,

44
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,870
Basically deleting first line one d means the leading first line,

45
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,980
so this line has been deleted.

46
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,170
You can see that in the previous are put.

47
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:27,560
We have all the airport and I've used third hyphen Wandy.

48
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,600
It's simply deleted the first line,

49
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,160
that's all.

50
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,400
Now I want to bring this one,

51
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,490
this one and this one on this one.

52
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:35,790
So for that,

53
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm going to use the,

54
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,430
you know,

55
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,740
come on on Going to,

56
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,170
you know,

57
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,430
bring my second column,

58
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,050
this one local domain on this one on this one.

59
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:47,800
So I've used this one or are basically for,

60
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,270
you know,

61
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,360
printing the columns.

62
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,890
So here you can see this is my column.

63
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:52,400
First column,

64
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,800
search name server names ever.

65
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,380
2nd 1 is local domain.

66
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,640
This one on this one.

67
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,330
Let me show you.

68
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:02,980
So what?

69
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,230
I want to bring the first column.

70
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,300
I can use this one Dollar one.

71
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:14,630
The first column is printing this one this one because you can see that every column has

72
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,890
been separated by a space.

73
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,110
If I want to bring the second color,

74
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:23,180
I can put two here if I want to print or I can use tree If I want to print,

75
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:23,480
you know,

76
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,030
here you can see that only two columns are there.

77
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:28,200
This is my first column on second column.

78
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,970
That's why I got only one out.

79
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:34,650
Because in the first line only we have three columns if I want.

80
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:34,950
Oh,

81
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:35,610
you know,

82
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,770
bring one on too,

83
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,680
so I can put like this way so it will Brit board.

84
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,700
But I want to have a space I can put,

85
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,690
Kama said will separate 10 hair.

86
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,170
It was separate by a space.

87
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:51,190
So same concept I've used here as well.

88
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,130
Okay,

89
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,400
Andi,

90
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,260
you can see for logging users.

91
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,740
We have usedto come on and have redirected output into a file.

92
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,000
And then,

93
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
in a simple off mentioned this one logged in users.

94
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,040
So it's becoming like they will see the output.

95
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,160
We have something different.

96
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:24,660
Okay.

97
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,800
Here you can see that Control sampling logged in.

98
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,950
Users are coming here.

99
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,700
We are in the same language getting this outward and this.

100
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,470
But you can see that we have a big output for this.

101
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:35,820
Come on.

102
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,250
That's why I put it in the next line.

103
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,190
So here are for you know,

104
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:45,340
this loving user and I have given green color for their and the last have simple Can this

105
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:53,720
file like this one get this way themselves and using this color and for Ram?

106
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,310
I have used,

107
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:54,610
you know,

108
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,580
free Haifa net,

109
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,560
and I would think the same.

110
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,320
Okay for Lord,

111
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:02,920
read everything.

112
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,490
I've used this.

113
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:03,910
Come on.

114
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,750
OK,

115
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,020
Andi,

116
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,620
for this great deal.

117
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,190
I've used this.

118
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:08,530
Come on.

119
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,090
Okay,

120
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:13,610
and nobody's I'm going to it as business script with your you know,

121
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,990
the section so that he Condoned,

122
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,780
described as well.

123
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:21,940
So from their cell for the selector hope you have understood how we can clear the simple,

124
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,760
simple scripts.

125
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,180
The next part is,

126
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:24,690
you know,

127
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:29,490
is to you know how to fetch the information Now have simply,

128
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:29,810
you know,

129
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:30,690
kid in the script,

130
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:31,590
right?

131
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,070
So next is you know,

132
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,100
I'm going to in a port,

133
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,830
that description all my source and from central location,

134
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:41,340
I'm going to fetch whatever the output of these commands.

135
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,410
So there's no for the selective,

136
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,750
painful watching if you have time,

137
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,300
please join victim in the next lecture.
