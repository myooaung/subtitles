1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,010
how everyone So this factor will understand how to create on in teaser variable.

2
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:13,120
So what isn't is available are variable on which we have only indeed their numbers like one

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:20,610
number 10 number 15 number 200 number But it always be an intention number So how we can

4
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:25,900
achieve this supposed ah half catered available A V is equal to town So here you can see

5
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,190
that Ah have available the name off.

6
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:33,950
My variable is a V on whose values 10 10 isn't in diesel number.

7
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,930
If I want to read this,

8
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:36,950
I can use this one.

9
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,800
So as of now,

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,580
it is not an declared indigent number.

11
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,240
It is an indecent number because we have given.

12
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:49,430
But I want to make it permanently as interior number that I have to use some different

13
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,250
commands for that.

14
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,640
So some was.

15
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,020
I'm given a visa called Toe.

16
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,570
Next time doing this number,

17
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:57,500
I'm getting out.

18
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,840
I suppose I'm giving babies some,

19
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,120
you know,

20
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,200
strengths or some,

21
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:03,680
you know,

22
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,270
alphabetic number or some constant variables.

23
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,260
So,

24
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:07,980
like this one,

25
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:08,740
I'm even this one.

26
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:14,060
So here you can see that baby is available.

27
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,890
So I let it was in teacher variable.

28
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,580
Now it has become cost invariable.

29
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:25,800
But my requirement is that I want This should be on Lee on Intissar variable So this letter

30
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,500
will can have only the numbers.

31
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,280
So in that case,

32
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:36,920
you have to use declare hyphen I A b is called any number you can get like 100 night has

33
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,450
become.

34
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:44,790
India is available now So as a mom the value of babies 100 You can change it to some other

35
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,840
you know number as well.

36
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,050
Like this one can give it okay,

37
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,040
But if you try to,

38
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,390
you know,

39
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:59,250
give babies some constant variable like she Careful tried So you will see that this is

40
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,660
again You're shall is going again toe convert it with some interesting number That zero

41
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,550
number So he warned.

42
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:07,750
Ally,

43
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:14,150
you give this variable Abie to some A string of some question variable on Lee you can give

44
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:17,990
on in teaser toe This valuable right?

45
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,340
So let me care.

46
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,410
A simple variable,

47
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:27,100
simple scheme for you on did let me show you how we can use this in my script.

48
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,810
Okay,

49
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:38,250
so I'm just declaring declared haIf and I a b is you call toe 2010 declare.

50
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:43,710
I my base is called to 200.

51
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,580
Okay,

52
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,310
so these two,

53
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:45,750
you know,

54
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,680
wearables have declared as an interior whatever.

55
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,050
Right now,

56
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:56,510
I want this CD's equality,

57
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,050
this one,

58
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:01,470
this dollar I want toe do the addition of these two numbers,

59
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,550
like B C plus our a b plus B c.

60
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:10,750
But so I could dollar city.

61
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,130
Let me make it executable.

62
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:23,840
I can see that I have got an outboard.

63
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,550
But here you can see that I have defined only it is a number,

64
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,630
right?

65
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,480
No,

66
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:31,690
again,

67
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:32,950
I'm editing this file.

68
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,450
No,

69
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,510
no.

70
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,890
Is that you can see that is a beautiful town.

71
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:40,850
BC's my another available which is having some you know,

72
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,140
it is a number.

73
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,510
Know what I'm going to do here?

74
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:45,990
I'm defining my you know,

75
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,030
babies equal.

76
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,450
Do I'm getting this number.

77
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,260
What amount?

78
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:56,640
So let's see that whether it is going to accept this valuable not because at the start of

79
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,320
this country can see that I have already defined a b is and in teaser,

80
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,560
okay,

81
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,940
especially half a nice for the interior.

82
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,210
I already find that this variable is going to be only in Giza.

83
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,770
If anybody is trying to give you know,

84
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:15,570
maybe some a string of some constant Your shall is going to convert into some in these a

85
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:16,750
number That is zero number.

86
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,030
Okay,

87
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,130
again,

88
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,300
I'm going to do this one.

89
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:28,320
Okay on Did it let me echo this one dollar bill,

90
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:28,790
etc.

91
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,900
What babies?

92
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:35,340
Dollar busy.

93
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,730
Okay,

94
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,620
let me come up again.

95
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,530
Exit Getting it.

96
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,750
I can see that now.

97
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:49,500
This baby has been tends to zero because we were trying to give you know,

98
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:56,890
a B as in some a string for shell has converted your baby variable into some indecent

99
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,960
number into theoretical at people.

100
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,740
That is a zero number it will always give.

101
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:05,670
If anybody is trying to give some string of some constant your shell will convert it to in

102
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:06,890
desert number That is you.

103
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:13,360
So friend their soul for this lecture in the next lecture will understandable your the next

104
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:13,750
variables.

105
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,150
That is constant variables.

106
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,340
So thanks.

107
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,650
We'll soon the next lecture
