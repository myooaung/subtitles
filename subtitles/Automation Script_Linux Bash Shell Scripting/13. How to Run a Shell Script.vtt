00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
one of the basic things that we should know is how to run a shell script.

2
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.680
So when you created there are different ways you could run it,

3
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.800
you can run it through absolute path,

4
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.590
or there's another one that's called relative Path.

5
00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.450
So absolute path is if,

6
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.250
let's suppose,

7
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:26.840
if you are standing right at the first step off a steer's and you have to pick up something

8
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.750
on the very last year in the top,

9
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.760
you have to actually either shoot from the first year all the way to the last year on top

10
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.580
and grab that thing that you're trying to grab or there's another one.

11
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.450
Another way is relative path.

12
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:51.520
The relative pat is that you actually walk up to the steer and then grab that thing that

13
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.050
you wanted to grab the same way.

14
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.020
Um,

15
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.650
absolute path and relative pat works.

16
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:03.450
If you do not know what exactly absolute path and relative pats ar,

17
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.620
I would recommend you that you should,

18
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.090
um,

19
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.400
you know,

20
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.450
try to look it up online and see what they are and how they work.

21
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.860
And,

22
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:14.240
um,

23
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.940
you'll find tons of article there and make sure your type,

24
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.850
absolute path and Lennox or absolute path and relative path in Lenox as well.

25
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.250
So the way it works is I have my limits machine up.

26
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.150
Let me log into my Lennox machine,

27
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:37.520
so I have my script right here.

28
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.650
It's called X Y Z Dash Script.

29
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:50.550
If you notice I am in my slash home slash I of Salt and Slash script directory.

30
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.960
I created a directory called Scripts in My Home Directory on Guy.

31
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.550
Create all my scripts in that directory.

32
00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.350
So if I am already in that directory,

33
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.650
I could run the script.

34
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.450
Or if I am not in my directory,

35
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.400
let's say if I just do CD and which directory I'm in,

36
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.690
I'm in slash route.

37
00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.250
So the script that I want to run it's just a test group that I created earlier.

38
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.670
That's a few tight,

39
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.550
that script name X y Z Dash script,

40
00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.250
and when you hit enter,

41
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.710
you'll see it says,

42
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.120
Bash the script.

43
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.750
Name Command not found.

44
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:28.540
Why?

45
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:37.950
Because the Lenox operating system is trying to find that script and slash root directory,

46
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.950
and I do not have that script in slash root directory,

47
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:48.850
so I would have to specify the absolute path to run the script and the absolute path would

48
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.980
be just the same way as if you are standing at the bottom of the stairs and then you have

49
00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.080
to fetch something from the top of the stairs.

50
00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.850
Then you actually through some kind of means or like a stick or something,

51
00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.170
and you could grab it.

52
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.550
So the same way you could specify the entire path,

53
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:13.550
which is slash home my user directory scripts and now the name of the script.

54
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.110
Now when I run the script,

55
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.790
I'll hit.

56
00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.950
Enter and you will see is just the script that is actually echo out or print.

57
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:23.780
Hello,

58
00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.050
World on screen.

59
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.570
How does this created?

60
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.550
I will cover that in the later lectures,

61
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.010
but just to focus.

62
00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.350
This is how you need to run a script using absolute path.

63
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.980
Now what if you are in a relative path,

64
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.150
which is that you are already in home?

65
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.380
I of Salt and Scripts directory See you CD into that directory,

66
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.050
you do pwd and you'll see Pat is the complete paths Now,

67
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.240
Now the script name is again when you do Alice,

68
00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.580
my cell tr I have the script X y Z script.

69
00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.780
Now,

70
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:07.490
when you run this group now script and hit Enter it still cannot find it.

71
00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:08.400
Why?

72
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.370
Because when you are inside off a directory,

73
00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.330
you will always have to specify that you want to run the script but than this same

74
00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.850
directory.

75
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.760
And that is the relative path.

76
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.820
And to do that,

77
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.450
you have to specify dot,

78
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:32.450
slash and then the name off the scrip you could hit tab the auto complete.

79
00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.550
So now you hit enter and you'll see it ran.

80
00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.460
So keep that in mind.

81
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.410
There are two ways you can run the script one through absolute path and want to the

82
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:44.210
relative path.

83
00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.470
If you are,

84
00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.650
let's say in slash home directory and now you want to run the script.

85
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:55.850
You could still specify the entire past lying home starting my user directory.

86
00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.860
Or you could just simply start from the director you are in.

87
00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.890
So you are in Iove solve.

88
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.160
From from this home onward,

89
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:13.030
I have saw scripts and the script name hit enter and you see it works here,

90
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.340
too,

91
00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:20.950
because you you have to let the opening system know where your script exactly is located.

92
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.350
So that's the basic about scripting how you run it.

93
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.050
So please remember these two main points about running the script
