1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,850
how everyone.

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:09,710
So let's continue and do the rest part off the coating the next is your backs less This one

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:09,710
.

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:19,340
This is called backslash They this is back slash.

5
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,240
Okay,

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,000
So basically,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,120
you know you can use the backslash before you know any special characters like dollar Onda

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:30,120
.

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,980
And if you're using the backslash before any of the special character,

10
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:40,160
it is going to disable the meaning off that character I've taken example Suppose ABC is

11
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:40,420
called.

12
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,570
So here we have available.

13
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:44,510
That is ABC.

14
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,040
No,

15
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,240
If I'm using echo on Putting Dollar ABC,

16
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,250
I'm getting an output,

17
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:58,080
but I want to disable that variable meaning so one way I can put it in a single court,

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,470
but that this had wanted off single court.

19
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:02,270
Suppose you know,

20
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:06,980
if you have a lot of things in that you know,

21
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,700
single court lot off,

22
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,060
you know,

23
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:09,430
different,

24
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:09,710
different.

25
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:10,080
You know,

26
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,650
special characters are there,

27
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:15,690
but you only noticeable spastic.

28
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:16,250
You know,

29
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,290
few off your you know,

30
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:20,050
special characters than better to use single court.

31
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:20,980
You can do one thing.

32
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,870
Put it in double court on the here.

33
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,550
You can put like this way.

34
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:28,150
Okay,

35
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,270
Let's take an example.

36
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:34,850
Suppose I'm putting like this week.

37
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:40,460
The pot is dollar pot.

38
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:49,230
Define one valuable and define one.

39
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:53,260
What about that is taller EVC.

40
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,930
So if I'm fine,

41
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:56,370
this come on,

42
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:59,860
you can see that the output which I'm getting It is really bored.

43
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,290
The special characters.

44
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:06,680
But my Dick Clement is that it should read only this character.

45
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,800
But it should be,

46
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:07,980
you know,

47
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:08,970
printed as it is.

48
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,340
So one way,

49
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,720
Fam putting single quarter.

50
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,420
So what it is going to do?

51
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,230
It is disabling all the single crack,

52
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,180
all the special character that is coming inside that one.

53
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,390
So the best way is there.

54
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,400
Put it in double quarter on which,

55
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:25,670
you know,

56
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:26,450
special character.

57
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,160
He wanted a civil.

58
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,150
Put it slash No.

59
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:36,320
I believe you have understood what I want to convey you like So let's do some more practice

60
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:36,770
on that.

61
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,870
Okay,

62
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:43,260
so I'm just using few examples here.

63
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,450
Okay,

64
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,350
So what?

65
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:56,450
I want to type this one echo my but cost dollar 10.5.

66
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:00,270
I can see that I'm getting into some different output.

67
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,680
But it is just trying to read this,

68
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,570
you know,

69
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,030
very body.

70
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,560
So that kids,

71
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,210
what you can do,

72
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:08,950
you can use Becks list.

73
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,830
Thank one.

74
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,240
And also you can use,

75
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:13,750
you know,

76
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:20,100
have an option with that is physically unable the interpretation off the backs less

77
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:20,920
suspicious.

78
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,800
So let's do some more practice with Echo.

79
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,700
Echo hyphen.

80
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,160
E on Did it?

81
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,530
I'm just doing this one,

82
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,050
I suppose.

83
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,790
I want to put this one serial number.

84
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:37,390
Name students name and marks two things.

85
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:37,800
I'm boring.

86
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,990
I'm getting this output.

87
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,450
Okay.

88
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:42,590
I want that.

89
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,920
There should be something special.

90
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,990
Some,

91
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:45,540
you know,

92
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,050
Tab.

93
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,350
So how we can do that?

94
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:52,520
So you have to enable them.

95
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,670
First of all,

96
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,600
you have to enable the interpretation off the backs.

97
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,690
Let spaces.

98
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,080
So you have to use Khalfani on them.

99
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,910
Use this one.

100
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:04,750
I get this one hyphen de.

101
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,950
I can see that you have God one of space.

102
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,000
If I am not going to use this one.

103
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,830
So this is not going to work.

104
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,740
So here you can see that I have used hyphen t.

105
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:21,080
So high 20 is basically you know that is for hard,

106
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,000
gentle tab.

107
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,050
It will give a tab.

108
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,750
This is a tub.

109
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,880
Are you mentally?

110
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,450
If you want toe article tap that you have to use hyphen B.

111
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:34,700
I want to have one tab here as well.

112
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,790
You can use here as well.

113
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,230
Right on,

114
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:38,840
If you want to,

115
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,290
you know,

116
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,680
give some number as well.

117
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,500
You can give number.

118
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,210
I believe this one.

119
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:45,270
You can see that one number is coming here.

120
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:50,720
They So this way you can do it.

121
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,810
Oh,

122
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,760
I think you can do it like this way as well.

123
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,020
One less teeth.

124
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,740
I can see that one has been started with this one.

125
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:04,570
So it distracted.

126
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,660
We have learned about backs less on.

127
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:07,950
Also,

128
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:08,940
we have seen how to,

129
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,390
you know,

130
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,190
enable the you know,

131
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:14,480
indep additional backs less space is evil fighting like Oh,

132
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,020
come on.

133
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,660
So you have a simple use echo I fancy on Haifa 1,000,000.

134
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,080
After that,

135
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,340
you can use different options,

136
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,820
like 20 for the gentle hyphen V's for what?

137
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,990
Ical on.

138
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:25,610
If you want to,

139
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:25,820
you know,

140
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,750
enable one new line.

141
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:31,050
You can put them so you can see that the next thing is coming into the new line.

142
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:38,870
So if if you're going to put anything like hit and putting this one number one,

143
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:42,020
you'll see that we're number one is coming here.

144
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,640
If I want to put like good.

145
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,880
This is also I am one of 41 Here it is Coming one.

146
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,430
I want to be one time here.

147
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:54,360
Can see that one time is coming.

148
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,950
You have to put it here.

149
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:01,520
Right on.

150
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,390
I want to put Name is sugar here.

151
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,980
We'll see that she could is coming back.

152
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,130
I don't want time here.

153
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,190
I can remove this one.

154
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,380
She was coming here.

155
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,850
I wanted tub here.

156
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:21,080
I can put a tab here on marks I put my marks is 98%.

157
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,450
I'm not intelligent.

158
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,690
So this way you can use,

159
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:26,980
you know,

160
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,850
Echo come on with different options.

161
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:35,310
So when there's all for this lecture I hope you are understanding what I want to convey you

162
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:41,270
on Did it If you want to get you know a good hands on on shallow scripting So do it Do it

163
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,400
Start going from yourself as well The more you will practice,

164
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,760
the more confidence he will have.

165
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:52,790
So practices on leaky toe get understanding on shallow scripting So from that so far this

166
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,160
lecture will see in the next election
