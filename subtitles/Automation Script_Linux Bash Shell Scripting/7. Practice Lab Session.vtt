00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.750
how everyone.

2
00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:04.050
So this is a practice lab session.

3
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:05.300
So first of all,

4
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.930
I'm going to create a normal user.

5
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.180
So have you used use a red?

6
00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.750
Come on.

7
00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.200
I'm not give a password as well.

8
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.080
So I've just created that normally,

9
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.420
user,

10
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:30.250
I'm going to log into the same server using use a John.

11
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.810
So it is asking for the user name and the password.

12
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.550
I can see that I have locked into the box.

13
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.580
I have got some shell.

14
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.280
So what is my show?

15
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.410
I can check with this.

16
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.820
Come on,

17
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.100
you can see that I have got best.

18
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.310
So whenever you know,

19
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.830
I'm going to,

20
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:49.330
you know,

21
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.850
going to look into any of the box.

22
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.610
I will get some obsession,

23
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.350
if I would.

24
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.660
Simple.

25
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.370
Five years,

26
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.850
You will see that I'm getting one best.

27
00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.110
That is best shell.

28
00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.810
I've got it on here.

29
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:01.270
This is,

30
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.740
you know,

31
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.100
process ideas.

32
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.450
Well,

33
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.490
if anybody is going to kill that,

34
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.870
you know,

35
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.740
process immediately,

36
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.350
that section will be closed.

37
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.600
Right?

38
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.110
So if I am fighting this PWD command,

39
00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.560
you can see that I have got this,

40
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.600
you know,

41
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.090
location where I have loved them.

42
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:26.210
So this is my home directly on in the home directory or subdirectory skater?

43
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.530
Not the same as you.

44
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:28.510
User name.

45
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:29.300
Now,

46
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:36.320
let me show you what all the files we have and I can see that by default when a user has

47
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.440
been catered a few you know,

48
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.520
start a file of confrontation file is skated on the user's home directory.

49
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.100
That is a dark best RC dot profile and dot best underscored logo.

50
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.490
Apart from that,

51
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.870
they are a system wide there.

52
00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.290
These two fires,

53
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.610
that is a profile.

54
00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.870
There is one more file that is Boesch RC.

55
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.960
Full files out there.

56
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.150
45 finds out there.

57
00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.520
So when a user logged in,

58
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.450
you will see that I didn't get any message.

59
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.450
So let me first,

60
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:11.430
you know,

61
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.450
coming out from let me look into the root.

62
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.860
I wondered lobbying is it would here.

63
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.850
So I'm going to put something on this fire at the last.

64
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.220
I'm just putting echo.

65
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.260
I'm just putting this,

66
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.430
okay?

67
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.860
I just want to show you that when a user logging So what?

68
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.530
All the files has been executed,

69
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.940
so I've just poured this entry echo this coming back to here and again.

70
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.680
I'm going to take a session off the user,

71
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.110
John,

72
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.210
that is such user.

73
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.850
And John,

74
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.110
I can see that I have got this message.

75
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.000
This is what I have mentioned here in this final.

76
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.610
All right,

77
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:06.990
so But this We come to know that when a user logged in Oh,

78
00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.250
it is a profile has been executed.

79
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.640
So if you have put something here like this one,

80
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.420
so that is a publicly available for all the users.

81
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.770
If you have any other either,

82
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:17.180
Like,

83
00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.040
let me check it out.

84
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.780
If you have any other user on the box,

85
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.160
there is article either.

86
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.630
Also,

87
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.420
if I'm going to log into the box as article user,

88
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.100
I'm just using such article.

89
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.500
You will see that here also have got the same message.

90
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.840
So if you're going to put anything in your a t.

91
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.700
C profiling means that this is going to be executed for all the users.

92
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.480
No,

93
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.610
coming to the next fight.

94
00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:39.970
That is,

95
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.360
I'm discussing about the system Dwight fighting.

96
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.520
So there is another file that is best R.

97
00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.850
C.

98
00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.980
So let me put something here as well.

99
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:58.080
I need to.

100
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:17.310
It will And I have put something in a tizzy.

101
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.250
Best R C as Well,

102
00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.650
let me log in.

103
00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.560
Let's see that.

104
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.570
Not with this.

105
00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:28.060
You know,

106
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:35.220
output will come to know that when a user logs in your idiocy profile as well as your best

107
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.550
RC file is executed.

108
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.130
So this is a long thing we have understood.

109
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.340
Now,

110
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.150
I'll come into the next point.

111
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.950
I'm in this location,

112
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.520
and you will see here.

113
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.430
We do have,

114
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.730
you know,

115
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.800
a few confrontations files.

116
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.500
That is a dot bash profile.

117
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.760
So let me can't this file on?

118
00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.180
Let's see what all the country we have now in this fine,

119
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.040
that is your profile bash profile that is,

120
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.710
father In diesel users,

121
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.610
all users like same user and John user has its own,

122
00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:10.130
you know,

123
00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.650
these confrontations files.

124
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:17.380
So if I'm going to put anything on this file so that would be applicable for my John,

125
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.830
you sit on it.

126
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.370
So here again.

127
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.500
See,

128
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.400
there it is started on initial.

129
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.590
It is checking for this file.

130
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:30.150
So this tells that it is checking for best R c in the same location,

131
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.930
like on.

132
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.100
If this file is there,

133
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.120
then it will execute.

134
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.000
So when a system stops very first filed,

135
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.810
it executed.

136
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.390
That is a dot bash underscore Profile on in that profile,

137
00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:48.260
you will see that it is calling your dot best RC,

138
00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.950
although your best profile is executed first,

139
00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.380
but I need to start.

140
00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:55.590
It's called for this.

141
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.920
So if you have mentioned something in this file,

142
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.350
so in all in what will happen it will is a good at first.

143
00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.750
So let me put put something here.

144
00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:17.670
I'm just putting the echo with the same filing,

145
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:25.000
so that will usually understand what file is executed right again.

146
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.340
I'm going to long into the box.

147
00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:33.840
I can see that first this file has been executed than this file.

148
00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.130
And then the users,

149
00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:36.930
you know,

150
00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.190
started files.

151
00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:42.890
Not here.

152
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:47.800
We understood one thing that this file executed.

153
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.760
It looks for this file and executed.

154
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:56.260
So if I'm going to put something in this file that is my Boesch underscore R c.

155
00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:10.120
This one like echo.

156
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:22.850
Okay.

157
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:23.770
No,

158
00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:24.800
again,

159
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.540
if I'm going to log into the box fast,

160
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.880
it will execute this on this.

161
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.420
And then it will be going to execute this file on in this file.

162
00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:38.500
If you'll see that initially executed this fire so fast,

163
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:39.590
it will execute this file.

164
00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:41.990
This file and then it will less good in this file.

165
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:43.280
So let's see.

166
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:53.540
I can see that I have got this output before that this outboard,

167
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:57.350
Because this file has been executed in that file,

168
00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:00.160
it cause you dot best r C five.

169
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.660
So,

170
00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:02.290
with this output,

171
00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:03.430
you got an idea.

172
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:03.980
Like what?

173
00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:09.650
All the different files we have on when users log into the box which file executed first.

174
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:12.450
So,

175
00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:12.650
friend,

176
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:15.840
that's all for this lecture in the next lecture will understand more about it.

177
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.550
Thanks for watching.
