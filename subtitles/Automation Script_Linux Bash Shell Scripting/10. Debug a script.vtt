00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700
how everyone.

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.670
So let's continue.

3
00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.290
So in this lecture,

4
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:06.110
I'm going to,

5
00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.440
you know,

6
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:13.640
create a second script on which I'm going to show you how to use the building commands like

7
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.600
I want to use dead.

8
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.950
Come on.

9
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:15.680
In my script,

10
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.270
I want to use time.

11
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:17.790
Come on.

12
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:18.610
This up time.

13
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:19.630
Come on in my script.

14
00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:20.750
So let me show you.

15
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.900
So I'm again going to use the V editor on the name off My second script.

16
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.050
I can give anything.

17
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.120
Took it My bank,

18
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:43.910
this one she law Echo on today I did is I want to use the come on.

19
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:51.560
So you use the commanding after use dollar here on the type did this way you can use and

20
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.300
come on here.

21
00:00:52.300 --> 00:01:05.050
Second is system is oh so system is up and here you can put that up time.

22
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.280
Okay,

23
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.960
I'm putting on it to come ons coming out from you.

24
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.230
Let me make my script executable.

25
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.490
I'm going to execute this one.

26
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.990
I can see that I have got an output today.

27
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.390
There is this one system is up from you have got an output?

28
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.360
No,

29
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.440
the next is you know debug.

30
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.350
That's correct.

31
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.450
So what is the Vogosca.

32
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.360
It was that supposed,

33
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.640
ah,

34
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.680
have a script on my script.

35
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.180
You know,

36
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.550
they are 50 lines.

37
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.650
And when I'm executing my script,

38
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.810
I'm not getting the desired output.

39
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.730
Some others are coming,

40
00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:02.350
but I am not able to understand like we're Is the syntax error Which line?

41
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.160
Like on which line?

42
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.370
My,

43
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.910
you know,

44
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.050
some issue suppose are 50 lines.

45
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.190
My four day lines are written correctly,

46
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.450
but there's some issue with line number 41.

47
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.490
And how would I know that in that case,

48
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.320
you have to run the script in debug mode,

49
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.800
so it will,

50
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.080
you know,

51
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.930
run the script,

52
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:22.670
you know,

53
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.160
one by one line and it reassured.

54
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.910
With output like this line has around,

55
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:27.820
you got an output.

56
00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:28.710
This line has run.

57
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:29.610
You got an output.

58
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.200
So,

59
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.550
like this,

60
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.480
we're supposed 40 lines.

61
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.140
It has it on successfully.

62
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.520
What?

63
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.810
It is trying to run the line number 41.

64
00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:38.840
You're getting some hair.

65
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.650
So with that is curved running in debug more.

66
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.960
You will easily understand Where is the syntax?

67
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.370
Error were the issue in my script.

68
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.680
So how to run the script in D But more so There is an option that is hyphen X.

69
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.750
So let me show you.

70
00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:56.500
So,

71
00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.480
like we can you can also in the script tight Becerra's as well.

72
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.660
This one hyphen x on the name of my school.

73
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.510
I can see that it is running line by line.

74
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.150
Let me get my script as well.

75
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.670
So this is the first line.

76
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:12.390
You can see that.

77
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.080
Okay,

78
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.640
Today This one.

79
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.050
So it has it on this line.

80
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.190
Okay,

81
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.060
so in this land,

82
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.320
they have used some variable like some building common that is dead on.

83
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.140
This is output.

84
00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.980
This is second line.

85
00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:25.730
This is out.

86
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.620
This is 2nd 1 of this is outboard.

87
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.820
So this way you can run.

88
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.260
You come on in the morning.

89
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.290
But I you can also,

90
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.510
you know,

91
00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.000
use hyphen ves well,

92
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.550
so it will give you an enema more discomforting.

93
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.750
So this is one thing.

94
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:44.970
Another thing is,

95
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:51.030
they're supposed you want to use some commands in the script as well.

96
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:57.320
So you can but the hyphen X option in the script as well.

97
00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.510
So my script is this one.

98
00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.150
So in the first line,

99
00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.370
I need to book put this one hyphen X.

100
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.330
So whenever you're going to run this script.

101
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.550
It will always run in debug More only,

102
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.750
right,

103
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.410
Toby,

104
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.500
The small things one should know.

105
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.250
Okay,

106
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.600
No,

107
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.120
next is over.

108
00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.700
Important.

109
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.040
That is said,

110
00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.470
Come on.

111
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.010
So sad command is a building.

112
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.550
Come on.

113
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.860
Sekem are also,

114
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:36.340
you know,

115
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.050
house you to debunk the script.

116
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.570
But the benefit would set.

117
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.990
Come on.

118
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:48.580
It drives you the booking options which was usually not possible with,

119
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.890
you know,

120
00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.090
single hyper next option.

121
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.420
Suppose you know Ah,

122
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:53.180
harvest script.

123
00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:58.990
That is very biggest script in which I have used so many logic I've used in a while loop I

124
00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.800
have used test.

125
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.410
Come on,

126
00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:01.490
I have used you know,

127
00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.090
if else have used functions my script is somewhere around,

128
00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.460
you know,

129
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.450
400 lines.

130
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:17.770
But I want that when my script run each time on this certain part of my script should run

131
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.690
in debug mode Not all that their parts.

132
00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.570
So in that case,

133
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:24.810
you can use set.

134
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:25.250
Come on.

135
00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.530
So let me show you.

136
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.150
So this is my skirt.

137
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.740
So I want to use my I want Oh,

138
00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:41.160
but on my script and debug more than you have to use set hyphen X Haifa Next means I don't

139
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:48.990
know the debug more Your this group has been demo and the but more all right.

140
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.650
So let me come out and let me down it.

141
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.630
I can see that I'm getting out.

142
00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.660
Put in more detail That isn't the but more.

143
00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.250
I'm going to add a few more lines in my script.

144
00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.980
I go,

145
00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:07.560
Hello,

146
00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.250
welcome toe.

147
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:33.530
My online loving classes A big hello to oh my the students right now get I'm going Do it on

148
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:33.650
it.

149
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:42.750
I can see that all my four lines which I have written My escape has run up in the but more

150
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.030
right but my requirement is different.

151
00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:52.150
I want my script on Lee 1st 2 lines should be running the but more not all the lines.

152
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.030
So you can,

153
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:53.500
you know,

154
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.100
turn off the debug as well.

155
00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:04.110
How we can do that you have to use plus X plus X means you're going toe done off that they

156
00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:09.550
but more right so debugging will be running only for these two lines.

157
00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:16.300
And then the body will be stopped for other two lines because it is turned off again.

158
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:24.290
I'm going to run it and I can see that debug has run up on Lee Father.

159
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:26.850
Two lives like did.

160
00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:27.200
Come on.

161
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.070
We have up time.

162
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:29.570
Lost two lines.

163
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:36.550
You can see that you have simply got an output without any deeper late.

164
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:38.480
No,

165
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.450
this is one thing.

166
00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:41.900
One more options we have.

167
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.730
Although we have many options.

168
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:46.280
But I'm discussing the main options which we have in the said.

169
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:46.650
Come on.

170
00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:50.980
There is one more good option that is to check the you know,

171
00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:51.740
Syntex off.

172
00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.640
You escape if you want.

173
00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:59.550
If you have this current biggest grip on you want to check this index like I have a 50 line

174
00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:02.250
A script and I want to know that.

175
00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:08.880
What is there any other in my scrip of more so you can use the set?

176
00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.330
Come on on.

177
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:12.980
Did one of them with this song?

178
00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:17.440
So what?

179
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.700
This option will lose her happen,

180
00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.140
and it is not actually going to execute.

181
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:25.690
Describe it is going to read all your commands on Lee.

182
00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:27.060
All right,

183
00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.950
so we have this good,

184
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:35.030
I can exit good and I can execute the script and d but more and I can find out where we

185
00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:35.790
have the issue.

186
00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:37.790
And what is the benefit of this?

187
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:42.920
So the benefit off this side hyphen and is that it is not going to exclude escape.

188
00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:46.820
It will just read all your commands on.

189
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.590
If there is any syntax error,

190
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:51.350
it will let you know.

191
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:57.180
So I'm going to run it now so you can see there as off.

192
00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:57.360
No,

193
00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.520
There is no syntax error,

194
00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:04.920
so you can see that my script has not run up it Just read all the commands on.

195
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.550
If we have any syntax error in this group,

196
00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:08.790
it will be giving.

197
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.520
So what I'm going to do,

198
00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:14.130
I'm just putting some Come on on in the commons.

199
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:17.290
I'm going to put some Arabs like I'm will be used for,

200
00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:20.410
like,

201
00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:21.940
kept my fight.

202
00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.680
Okay,

203
00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.690
So after that,

204
00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:27.660
you have to use do I'm missing.

205
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.870
Do I'm definitely putting echo.

206
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:33.450
I'm putting Hello,

207
00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:35.670
Dollar I under.

208
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:42.250
So this board it understanding I have sport Luke here,

209
00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:44.870
in which we have some Sendek said Okay,

210
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:46.030
now I'm going to run it again.

211
00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:54.550
I can see that it has just read all the lines one by one.

212
00:09:54.550 --> 00:10:02.180
It didn't executed and they have home some syntax errors on Given an output like this line

213
00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.350
is having better.

214
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:04.280
Also,

215
00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:04.900
it has provided,

216
00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.860
like line number eight is having some syntax error.

217
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:14.970
Now you can see that line number.

218
00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:16.060
It should be started.

219
00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:20.120
Do only but I so,

220
00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:20.360
friend,

221
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.040
that's all for this lecture.

222
00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:25.790
Hope you got an idea like how we can run the escape in debug mode.

223
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:27.250
And that's very important toe.

224
00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:28.080
No understand,

225
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.870
but thanks for watching.

226
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:32.430
So we'll see in the next lecture by ticket.
