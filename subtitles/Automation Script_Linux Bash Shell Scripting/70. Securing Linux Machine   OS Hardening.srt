1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,090
Lennox operating system Hardening.

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:09,780
This is a lesson about how can you can secure your Linux operating system Well,

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,760
there are many different ways that you could secure your operating system,

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:21,550
so it it is not vulnerable to the wires is attacks or anything that could harm your system

5
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:21,550
.

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:26,110
So this is also one of the most important topic and Lennox,

7
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:33,660
and many times the recruiters or hiring manager will ask you this question about how do you

8
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,190
secure your lending system,

9
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,950
or how do you harden your operating system?

10
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,070
There are few,

11
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:40,520
many different ways you could.

12
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,100
Even if you go online,

13
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,640
you'll find a lot of different ways.

14
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:51,670
But I think the most basic ones that anyone should really know Rs Fall The 1st 1 is about

15
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:52,870
the account management.

16
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:55,610
How do you secure the user accounts,

17
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,970
one of the policy of standard that you have in place.

18
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:03,920
Then we will cover about remove unwanted packages all the package that you have installed

19
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,560
in your system.

20
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,200
If you don't know need them,

21
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,000
then why do you keep them to remove them?

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,800
Then we have to stop unused services.

23
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,530
If a service is running that is not required in your system.

24
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:15,260
Stop it,

25
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,050
toss it.

26
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,090
Check on listening.

27
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,100
Port some off the time we have pores that are listening for traffic for incoming traffic.

28
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,300
But we really don't need any off those incoming traffic.

29
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,400
So what do you do to stop secure?

30
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,990
Ssh configuration will cover their later enable firewall I p tables,

31
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:38,060
which is all the words in and firewalled in the newer version,

32
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:38,710
Of course,

33
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,180
again,

34
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:47,420
the Wilco in detail on how we could enable I firewall in our system to make our system more

35
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:52,720
secure as the Lennox A ceilings is in your feature,

36
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,750
um,

37
00:01:53,750 --> 00:02:01,140
that you'll cover also as poor off this lesson changing listing service support numbers.

38
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:01,320
So,

39
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,070
for example,

40
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,780
if your report is running on,

41
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,790
let's say ssh 22 you could change it to a different port.

42
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:15,740
So the hacker who knows that you know the port 22 runs for ssh when they tried,

43
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,310
they are getting refused then,

44
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:18,830
alas,

45
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:19,580
but not the least.

46
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,850
Keep your system up to date,

47
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,830
so you should have all the security patches itself.

48
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,050
So let's cover them all of them one by one,

49
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:30,550
log into the next system.

50
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:38,320
So I have here Lennox Machine.

51
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,800
I logged in through the council.

52
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,710
So the first thing that we talked about is about user account management.

53
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,260
How can we secure that?

54
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,370
Well,

55
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:52,440
the first thing that I should include in this is about the naming convention.

56
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,850
When you create a user name,

57
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:54,520
for example,

58
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,870
oracle or admin,

59
00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:03,010
I recommend everyone to know I use the standard Jews UNAIDS because it's very easy to

60
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,800
predict those,

61
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,060
um,

62
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:06,780
there's used name.

63
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,010
So instead of oracle,

64
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,100
you pick like oracle.

65
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,000
123 or 123 oracle instead of admin,

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,630
you pick t admin or s admin.

67
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,830
So how do we get the all these names you go at sea?

68
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:19,650
Um,

69
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:24,890
the password file and you will see the listing off all the users that we have in our system

70
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:24,890
.

71
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:29,480
You see here on 1st 1 call them before the colon.

72
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,060
We have the user name like Spider Man spider.

73
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,050
That's my name.

74
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,790
And many other,

75
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,430
like NFs scrawny eso.

76
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:41,400
You could change the user name to a different name,

77
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,250
so it's not easily guessed.

78
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,390
Another way,

79
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:45,900
I would say,

80
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,810
is by default.

81
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,710
When when a user is created,

82
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,370
when you run the command user,

83
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,460
add when you create a user.

84
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,700
It automatically assigns Jews variety,

85
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:59,070
which usually starts with three digits or are four digits,

86
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,550
with 1002 on.

87
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:09,200
So I would also recommend or industry standard that to use anything from 10,000 bucks.

88
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,660
This way,

89
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,400
it's not hard to guess.

90
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:17,950
Another way is about the password policies now had.

91
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,400
Often,

92
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,740
your password changes how long your password should be.

93
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:27,450
All the information can be looked at by running the command CH age,

94
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,800
which has changed age.

95
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,120
If you do,

96
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,880
minus L on the user name,

97
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,000
which is myself,

98
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,680
you'll see right here last password change.

99
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,430
This is the time,

100
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,830
and I change my password.

101
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,130
Password expired.

102
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,950
Never password inactive,

103
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,350
so passport expired.

104
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,660
Never.

105
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,780
It's not a good sign,

106
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,190
since this is a lab environment is for training purposes.

107
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,140
I don't really care.

108
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,050
But in a corporate environment and production environment,

109
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:56,580
there should be a date to change the password.

110
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,360
Same thing goes for an active password.

111
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,750
Account expires.

112
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,170
When does it pass work?

113
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:08,250
What expires a number of days off warning before password expires,

114
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,160
and so on.

115
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,480
All that information can be changed.

116
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,050
You could set your own standard.

117
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,340
Depending on your company's requirement.

118
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:19,220
You could run ch age commanded.

119
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,490
Dash does help to find more information.

120
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:26,140
How you could make those changes for each user.

121
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,280
Also,

122
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,400
if you go to that see shadow file,

123
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,350
you will see um,

124
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,350
permission tonight after we root.

125
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:39,950
If you can't out that see shadow file,

126
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:45,690
you will see each user has issues.

127
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:51,470
The name it's past for at the end of the past were in this colon It has these numbers thes

128
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:56,760
are the same numbers that we have defined and change age.

129
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:04,750
You could change by David this command see a change or you could coast directly to the etc

130
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,350
Shadow bottom Make the change we'll see here.

131
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:16,180
This seven refers to this seven this 999 1st this 9990 refers to this zero so you could get

132
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:21,650
more information about how you could change whether you could do through the etc shadow R c

133
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:21,650
.

134
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,550
It changed age.

135
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,840
I would before the Hughes change age.

136
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,120
Anyway,

137
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,810
um,

138
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:33,040
moving forward also another come another file that you should look at is etc.

139
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,520
Log in on deaths.

140
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,840
This is to file that she could also define some of the parameters.

141
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,100
Andi,

142
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:47,400
those parameters are That's look open the file again and you will see here.

143
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,210
Maximum pass from baxam days.

144
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,960
Thes are the default settings.

145
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,610
You could do it by per user basis.

146
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,140
Or if you want,

147
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,370
apply to a default setting.

148
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:58,660
You could use it here.

149
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,040
See,

150
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,520
Pastor,

151
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,050
minimum length five.

152
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,990
If you if a user is putting a password and,

153
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,990
um,

154
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,910
for that it's not gonna accept it.

155
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:07,850
So it has to be five.

156
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:08,610
But of course,

157
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,260
over a command.

158
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,850
Go at least 12 or 13 and change it right here.

159
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:15,150
You could also disabled old password.

160
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:22,840
Another file that actually manages user accounts and security is at sea.

161
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:28,250
Pandey the directory and file system off.

162
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,250
Um,

163
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,370
and you look at this file.

164
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:35,270
It has a lot of other parameters that you could define.

165
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:43,530
I want you to spend some time here or even look it up online and study every field off this

166
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:47,050
file to understand exactly how this works.

167
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,780
Um,

168
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:52,290
next one we have is above remove unwanted,

169
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,250
um,

170
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,350
packages.

171
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,560
Right.

172
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,990
So how do we get the listing off all the packages to get to the single packages?

173
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,180
I think you should know that if you have forgot,

174
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:03,870
that's fine.

175
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,600
R P M minus Qiwei and then you hit,

176
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,060
Enter and you had enter.

177
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,660
You get a bunch of list of all the packages.

178
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,650
Now,

179
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:16,960
how many packages do I have in my system so that it's just like a quiz for you?

180
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,410
So tell me how many packages were?

181
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,260
Well,

182
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,850
the commander's rpm that's Q A.

183
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,860
WC minus l.

184
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,480
And this will count every line output of our pm que it?

185
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,000
I have a total number of packaged 1350.

186
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,830
So there are so many package that I really don't need it.

187
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:36,630
So what do we need it for?

188
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,800
Won't get rid of them.

189
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:44,160
So to get rid of a package the commander's R P m minus E and the package name.

190
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:44,940
So also,

191
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,350
remember,

192
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,260
when you are deleting a package,

193
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:53,650
it will ask you that this package has a dependency on another package to be very careful on

194
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,450
on that,

195
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,110
if you remove the package,

196
00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:01,720
it and it and that package has dependencies on another package or other packages.

197
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,530
Dependencies.

198
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:03,280
On this one,

199
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:08,640
you will have some corruption and some programs that won't work properly,

200
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,690
So just be careful.

201
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:10,380
Then we have.

202
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,120
The next one is stop unused services.

203
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,730
Okay,

204
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:14,550
How do we kid?

205
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,310
What the listing off all the services of your running.

206
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,370
If you run system CTL,

207
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,440
dash A,

208
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,450
this will give you everything active or inactive.

209
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:27,650
So if there is a service that is active and you really don't need it,

210
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,210
you could just simply stop it.

211
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:32,040
If a system is serving the pages,

212
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,110
why do you need NFS service on it?

213
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:34,450
Right.

214
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,880
So that's why we stopped the source's.

215
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:43,170
Then the next one we have here is about check on listening ports.

216
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:43,660
Now,

217
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,320
how do we check on the listening ports?

218
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,650
Every service that you run has a port associated with it.

219
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:53,050
So if you run,

220
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:59,820
that's that base dash t you in l.

221
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,730
P.

222
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:01,070
What?

223
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:06,060
Why am I picking these Pacific options is just that that I've been used to it.

224
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,010
You could pick different options to check the ports.

225
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,150
When I enter,

226
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:14,300
you will see all the ports that are open and listening right now.

227
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,340
See hairs.

228
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,250
I p address right here.

229
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,900
And this is my local.

230
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,920
I'd be and again,

231
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,060
this is my local I p.

232
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:30,210
And you'll see everything that after that has of these port 111 53 22 6 31 25 Tell me what

233
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,280
53 is for.

234
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,890
That's a quest.

235
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:35,350
Well,

236
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,550
if you don't remember,

237
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,890
53 is for DNS.

238
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:40,450
And as I said,

239
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,290
DNS,

240
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,070
what port it runs on.

241
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,440
Also one of the important question.

242
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,250
So if you if you if your machine is not serving us a DNS,

243
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:52,550
why do we have a 53 port running to stop it?

244
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:58,890
The next one we have is about securing as a sage configuration.

245
00:10:58,890 --> 00:10:59,570
Now,

246
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:04,270
if you know that when you log into system remotely what protocol you use,

247
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:07,070
you use a sous age and on the poor 22.

248
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:10,120
So this could be secured as well.

249
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:20,150
So if you go to CD slash ssh And then there was a file called S H D config.

250
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,970
And then you had entered more on it.

251
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:26,150
You will see this fall can be modified,

252
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:31,550
and a lot of its parameters can be modified to make a cessation more secure.

253
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,950
And what are those things that can be modified?

254
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:40,150
The two basic ones that I usually make changes to is number one is I change the port.

255
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:40,960
So right now,

256
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:47,030
if you see the port is running on 22 I would change it to 10 22 of which over the port that

257
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,560
I would like to have sold.

258
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,190
My system is more secure.

259
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:57,510
Another thing that I like to do whenever a building system is I go in and I enable this

260
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:57,850
right now.

261
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:58,570
You see here,

262
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:02,280
this one has hash sign anything that starts with hash.

263
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,190
It's a common.

264
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,080
So I will take out this hash sign and I'll say,

265
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,900
Permit root log in and I have the same No.

266
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,830
Why?

267
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:14,850
Because if I'm logging in or if anybody's logging into the system as route,

268
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:15,800
it will deny it.

269
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,910
They should log in as themselves,

270
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:22,430
and this way they could become your route.

271
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:26,850
The reason behind this is because every time a user logs in,

272
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:32,420
let's say if I log and my activity will be long dead at the time and I logging in and what

273
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,520
time I became crude,

274
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:39,150
so all that tracking information will be recorded and it will be a lot easier to understand

275
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,550
who did what to the system.

276
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:46,300
So these are a couple of things I will do with the message configuration.

277
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:51,340
Then we have enable firewall when the firewall,

278
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,150
As I said,

279
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:59,400
There are older version of firewall that Courant's In Grete Had six and older is called I P

280
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,050
Tables.

281
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:08,520
The newer version Off Firewall with seven and above its firewall D both serves the same

282
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,170
function.

283
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:12,360
The viral D has a few and has functions.

284
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,200
You could look it up again.

285
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,540
If you want to learn more about firewall now,

286
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:21,050
I could tell you what firewall does.

287
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,310
Fly woman.

288
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,840
You have it enabled in your system.

289
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:32,200
What it does is that you could filter out meaning if you want to only accept the traffic

290
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,570
that coming in one or 22 you couldn't tell firewalls.

291
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:36,370
A firewall.

292
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,440
Onley.

293
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:44,440
Accept traffic coming in for port 22 or only accept traffic coming in for port 1 23 or 423

294
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,500
Anything that you want to make the changes to firewall anything you want,

295
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,030
the service of it running so far,

296
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:53,190
what is like a ah watchdog,

297
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,350
said defender,

298
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,970
our gatekeeper for your system,

299
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:03,370
which allows someone or traffic to come in or and it allows the traffic to leave the

300
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,310
commands that you need to know for firewall,

301
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:09,880
as in Gui in the newer version off Lenox.

302
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,090
If you are using Google,

303
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:13,480
you go run firewall dash,

304
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:18,470
convict it enter and you will see it will bring up a gooey.

305
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:24,010
This gooey will let you enable services.

306
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:27,670
That's your navel ports add ports.

307
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:31,880
Remove protocols are at poor cause.

308
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,970
If you see if you want to add important,

309
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:38,310
let's say if you enable firewall on your system by default,

310
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,450
it will block everything.

311
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,580
So once you enable firewall,

312
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,220
it's not gonna talk anybody outside.

313
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:44,950
It's not gonna talk.

314
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,630
Have anybody talking to you.

315
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:49,650
So how do you enable the communication?

316
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:50,880
You add the ports?

317
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,950
Click on add.

318
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,260
You put the port number.

319
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:57,710
Let's say I want everyone to talk to me on I'm a DNS server.

320
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,980
So talk to me with 52 three.

321
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,570
I'm allowing it.

322
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:02,200
That's good.

323
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,270
Click OK and good.

324
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,760
Perfect.

325
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:10,740
So that's how the firewall or I P table works in your system.

326
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,820
And that has cool.

327
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,900
What if I do not have agreed?

328
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,970
Okay for that,

329
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:21,500
there's another command for Text Bake based on Command Line Command,

330
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,410
which is firewall that CMD voyages for command.

331
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:26,970
And then you do help.

332
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:28,510
You'll get a lot of information.

333
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:35,080
How do you find Or how do you square your How do you remove a port in all the words in B

334
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,050
Have the command I p tables.

335
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:39,520
So then you had tea tables.

336
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,820
You could just to help.

337
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:48,540
And you will see all the information that you have right now if you enable the i p services

338
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:52,700
and then you run i p tables Daschle list of a list,

339
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,760
All the services anyway,

340
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,790
the configuration file for I p tables,

341
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:59,520
Theo.

342
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:14,750
Older version is at sea This config i p and six convicted complaint file his i p tables

343
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,980
convict.

344
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,950
And this is a father you could go in and modified.

345
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:21,600
If you don't want to modify through the command line,

346
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,310
you can modify through the file and then restart the services.

347
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,440
In the newer version,

348
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,490
the file name is etc.

349
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:31,690
Firewall the I'm sorry.

350
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:32,360
Uh,

351
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:37,700
that see Firewall D is the director and the fire.

352
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,490
What is firewall d dot com?

353
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:41,460
This is the one that you could modified.

354
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:47,190
Then we'll move on to the next one about securing our system,

355
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,860
which is change.

356
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,420
Sorry.

357
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,920
Enabled S e Lennox.

358
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,730
Now what is a c?

359
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:54,240
Lennox?

360
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:00,400
Let me read you something really off the Internet are standard definition off SC,

361
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:00,810
Lennox,

362
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:01,270
etc.

363
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:08,270
Lennox stands for security and has Lennox is a security architecture integrated into the

364
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:12,400
$2.6 ex colonel using the living security module,

365
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,160
also known as L S M.

366
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,160
It is a project off the United States National Security Agency,

367
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,130
which is stands for S A or bridges are everywhere.

368
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:28,640
There's and I say and the SL in his community excellence integration in to read had links.

369
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:35,140
Enterprise Voice was a joint effort between the NSA and the Readiness s Olympics.

370
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:38,000
Defines the access and transition.

371
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,850
Writes off every user,

372
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:45,260
every application process and a file the system on.

373
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,440
So if you have ah,

374
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,620
if you know every offering system has an application,

375
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,520
it has a process.

376
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,250
It has a file,

377
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,110
its as user.

378
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:53,760
Right.

379
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,060
So we have talked about these user permissions on how we change it.

380
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,560
We change it to the change mod right now.

381
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,830
How do we change the permission of a process?

382
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:05,240
How do we change the permission of an application,

383
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:05,660
right?

384
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,100
No,

385
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,550
that's not possible with the operating system.

386
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,450
So what we did?

387
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:15,820
We have this SC Lennox which controls the access that the permission,

388
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,920
access off process and application.

389
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,090
And it goes deep,

390
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:24,510
deep down in the detail and control every access off the pot.

391
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:28,660
The configuration part If you wanted to make sorry,

392
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:34,670
if you want to make a c Lennox enable the first thing you have to do is run as C status to

393
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,220
make sure if it's running or not.

394
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,660
And if you do s east at us,

395
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,530
you see,

396
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:44,920
in my system as e Lennix status is enable Now,

397
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:49,480
a lot of companies that have worked in the past and a lot of people that I've talked to,

398
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,210
um,

399
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:54,760
they usually keep S c Lennox disabled,

400
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,660
um,

401
00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:00,460
which I understand because many times that computers are there in why am I running in a

402
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,760
private network so that they really don't need it?

403
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,000
Plus,

404
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,660
s ceilings is a very newer technology,

405
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:12,360
and it's it is a bit complicated when implemented in your system.

406
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,070
So you have to have ah,

407
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,180
very detail on better understanding for SLX.

408
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:20,170
So if you want to disable it,

409
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:24,590
you all you have to do is go to see it says config,

410
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:27,060
and you do the I.

411
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:32,240
I'm just doing more for now and you will see right here.

412
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,140
Let me clear the screen so there won't be,

413
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,510
um,

414
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,350
confusion when you look at it.

415
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:41,910
So you see right here anything that has hash sciences,

416
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:42,350
of course,

417
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,080
is common.

418
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:43,880
So you see,

419
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,290
right here said at Sea Lennox equal enforcing.

420
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:48,550
It means it is enforced and it's enabled.

421
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:55,430
And there are three modes off a salon X one is enforcing,

422
00:19:55,430 --> 00:20:01,390
which means the A seal next security policies enforced right then the second is permissive

423
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:01,390
,

424
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:07,240
which is telling that a seal inexistent prints warning but does not enforce policies.

425
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,890
So if someone in making any changes,

426
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:09,720
it'll print hate.

427
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,690
Something was going on,

428
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:11,850
but it's not going to stop it.

429
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,920
Then there's another one.

430
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,270
The last one is,

431
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:15,720
of course,

432
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,660
is the disabled,

433
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,460
of course,

434
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,640
which disables at sea Lennox so you could change it here.

435
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,040
And once you have it,

436
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,050
it is recommended that you reboot your system.

437
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:29,480
Eso to check the parameters of a file,

438
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,040
for example.

439
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:35,270
Let's say if I go to my home directory and these are the files and directories I have,

440
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:39,710
So if I just do status or just started just at and I do,

441
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:43,260
let's say I have this file called La La Land.

442
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,350
You will see right here.

443
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:53,800
It tells me everything about the ball falls named the size the block the I'll block and

444
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,310
right here says access,

445
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:55,970
which is read,

446
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:56,520
write,

447
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,500
execute,

448
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:57,990
Right?

449
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,400
We already covered that.

450
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,680
And if not,

451
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:04,390
then you already know that it is like it could be defined.

452
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,550
Changed mod command.

453
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,180
Now,

454
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,760
if you noticed right here,

455
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,770
this is a new thing.

456
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:14,460
Context to this Pacific file is defined,

457
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,910
but the object is use your home.

458
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:24,380
So that's how the Assyrians keep track off which directly belongs to which user or rich

459
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:24,920
file.

460
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,720
And it also gives you access,

461
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:32,820
modify birth changed on all the different information we could change on Lee the read,

462
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,000
write and execute,

463
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,360
right?

464
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,530
But all that additional stuff,

465
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:37,600
if you want to have it,

466
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,290
that could be done with SLX.

467
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,840
Anyway,

468
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,130
there are other commands that I want you to look into it,

469
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,680
which I will not cover here,

470
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:54,450
which is because SC Lennox is a huge topic just for your knowledge or to have you haven't

471
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:56,230
somewhat exposure.

472
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:58,450
You should know what s C Lennox is.

473
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,340
So anyway,

474
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:07,810
some of the Commander Vasily nixes C h con which change file Assulin security context.

475
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:16,050
Then we have checked policy Nature is a selects policy compiler and the other ones are new

476
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:25,540
Role set SC bull set SC pool fix files as he manage and so many of the commands that I will

477
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,450
not cover here.

478
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:27,780
Also,

479
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:32,480
I have attached some documentation which you could read.

480
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,440
So this is about as c Lennox.

481
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:35,770
Now,

482
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:41,810
this second to the last part that I want to color is about change Listing service parole

483
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:43,190
officer with port numbers.

484
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,560
Now also,

485
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,840
I covered that a little bit on the SC.

486
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,170
Sorry,

487
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:51,760
a sausage configuration where you could change from port 22 2 different ports.

488
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,350
You could also make the same change to other services.

489
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,190
For example,

490
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:00,090
DNS by default run on 53 right?

491
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:03,660
You could make that changes as well to make your system more secure.

492
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:10,190
And the last one is about keep your operating system up to date Now it doesn't mean you

493
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:14,290
just go online and do junk update all and just update everything.

494
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,520
All the packages that you have,

495
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,030
you don't have to do or you don't have to update every package,

496
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,980
but you do have to make sure.

497
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:25,020
Especially anything that is related to security.

498
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,620
You have to update.

499
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:31,160
And how do we keep on up to date with the security?

500
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:31,630
Well,

501
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:34,980
one thing is you keep on running on Young Abdel updated.

502
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,370
Right?

503
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:38,080
But that's isn't the right way to do it.

504
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:38,430
Well,

505
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:39,320
what I do,

506
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,160
I could tell use.

507
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,790
I keep myself up to date with,

508
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:43,230
uh,

509
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:48,410
with all the alerts that I get from red hat or sento us or even windows.

510
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:52,050
Every time there is an issue of there's a new pash that comes out,

511
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:53,430
I can't notified.

512
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,360
I have an email,

513
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,190
so I would recommend you to do the same.

514
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:59,830
Go ahead and sign up one redhead dot com on santo esta.

515
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:03,660
Soon as you get any off those updates going apply.

516
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:06,340
That's how you keep your system secure.

517
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,330
Anyway,

518
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:07,820
um,

519
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:15,000
this is about how you could do your system secure or always hardening if you cover

520
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,770
everything here in detail.

521
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:20,970
And if someone is asking your question,

522
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:21,630
trust me.

523
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:23,760
You're gonna ace it if you go over this.

524
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,650
All right.

525
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:25,200
Good luck
