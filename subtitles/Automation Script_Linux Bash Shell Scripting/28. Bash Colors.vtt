00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.160
how everyone it looks like They will understand about the bash colors so you can make your

2
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.570
bash is more,

3
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:09.100
you know,

4
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.250
prettier by colorizing its output.

5
00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:20.900
So if you remember in the previous like tell when I executed my scrip output waas full of

6
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:21.350
color,

7
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:22.850
I had to use you know,

8
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.350
different different class in my output.

9
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.570
So to achieve this we have to,

10
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.830
you know,

11
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.750
understand It's Syntex on what are they you know called for each colors?

12
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.280
It's a lesson this time Syntex is very simple.

13
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:47.120
You have to use this index echo hyphen e why we're using hyphen e just to enable the backs

14
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.910
less escapes Here you can see that I am using this backslash So why we're using this blacks

15
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.370
less so that I can apply the colors Soto unable this black backs less You have to,

16
00:00:59.370 --> 00:00:59.650
you know,

17
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.580
enable the in the tradition off backs less escapes.

18
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.920
If you remember in the previous lecture we had,

19
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.440
I have shown you like if you want to have in a more gentle tap in the output then we have

20
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.870
use less d so like this if you want to enable the you know,

21
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.360
some horizontal escapes.

22
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.060
Then you have to use hyphen E.

23
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.970
Now,

24
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.110
this is one option you have toe.

25
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.260
It's less e on this one.

26
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.470
Here.

27
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:25.750
You can see that this one,

28
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.280
it does the begin off the killer modification.

29
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.550
And after that,

30
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.150
you have toe put the color court like 32 or 35 33.

31
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.050
Each color is having its own meaning.

32
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.370
Like if you're porting 32.

33
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.200
So I think that we do is for you know,

34
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.200
that is for green on 31 is for you know.

35
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.340
So here you have to put the court number like 31 Andi.

36
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.520
After that you have to put em at the end like 31 a.

37
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.350
M on to close it.

38
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.060
Then you have to put the sample test.

39
00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.760
Like how?

40
00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.610
How How are you?

41
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.230
Whatever you want,

42
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.120
you can put it there on you can close with this one.

43
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:09.140
Celeski this scarf record zero am That is for closing the collapse.

44
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.340
If you didn't put this,

45
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.250
what will happen?

46
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.560
It will keep on,

47
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.800
you know,

48
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.490
typing.

49
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.070
If you have a started coloring and you have noticed opted.

50
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:24.380
So whatever you're tapping in Nero Shell that we don't same color not.

51
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.140
These are the color course that you can see.

52
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.750
This is my black plan if you want.

53
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:28.130
Oh,

54
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.420
so there two things first is the foreground cold on another Is your background corn So

55
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.390
these course which can be used to,

56
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.620
you know,

57
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.500
make your output in colors.

58
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.580
So it is up to you.

59
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:46.790
What color and what our 41 this is the courts we have That is normal characters.

60
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.030
Bold character if you want underlying If you want blanking collectors So these courts you

61
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.570
have to use,

62
00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:53.050
you know,

63
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.050
to make your output in color text.

64
00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.750
So from there.

65
00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.580
So for the selector in the next lecture,

66
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.670
I will start for you showing you how to use the color decks.

67
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:05.350
Thanks for watching.
