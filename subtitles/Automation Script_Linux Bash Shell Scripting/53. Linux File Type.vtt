linens file types.

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:11.270
Did you know there are seven different types of linens files in Lenox that includes

3
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:12.060
directories,

4
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.290
lengths and whole bunch of other stuff?

5
00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.870
Let's look at them one by one.

6
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.950
The 1st 1 is a regular file,

7
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.180
anything that does not have a letter associated to it in the beginning.

8
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:23.690
Off it,

9
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.760
it's a regular file.

10
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.080
Anything that starts with D.

11
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.150
It's a directory.

12
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.360
Any attributes off a file that has a L in front?

13
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:41.010
If it is a link and anything starts with C is a special file or device file,

14
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.720
meaning if you attach a key boat or a C,

15
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:44.740
P or memory,

16
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.920
anything that is attached to your system that has also created as a file and that false

17
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:57.810
starts with C and there is a socket file starts with s name pipe that starts with P and a

18
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:04.050
block device that starts with B often times thes are the type of questions that are asked

19
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.170
during the interview.

20
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.270
They'll ask you tell me the file that stars with,

21
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.260
um,

22
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.660
see,

23
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.750
what does that file is for or what is the file that starts with P?

24
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:16.240
Remember,

25
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.740
I'm not talking about the file name I'm talking about the first column that you see when

26
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.540
you run ls minus l that defines a type off file that you're dealing with.
