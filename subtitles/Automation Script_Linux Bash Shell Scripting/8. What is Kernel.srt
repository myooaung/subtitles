1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,150
the next Colonel.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:09,550
Do you know there is a kernel in every Lennox distribution or UNIX distribution?

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,040
What,

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,000
exactly a colonel is?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,250
It actually interfaces between your hardware and your software.

6
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:23,850
So let's look at this diagram.

7
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:24,130
Here,

8
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:27,640
you will see you have at the bottom is the hardware and what others?

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,200
Hardware hardware is like CPU memory,

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,000
hard disk and any,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,010
um,

12
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,650
outside hardware peripheral devices.

13
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,280
Then you have Colonel.

14
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,950
A kernel is a program that is stored inside off your operating system.

15
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,670
It's like a program,

16
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,720
a command that keeps on running.

17
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:58,150
And what it does is it takes the commands from shell and shell.

18
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,340
What is a shell shell?

19
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,760
Is anything like a gooey Davey having windows or a gui in Lennox?

20
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,370
Or if you don't have going Lennox,

21
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:10,760
we have terminal that runs bash shell or sea shell,

22
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,660
which will cover later on.

23
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,770
So when we are in that bash of seashell terminal environment,

24
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,450
the execute commands.

25
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,020
The commands are being forwarded to a colonel,

26
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:28,070
and it's kernels responsibility to talk to the hardware that's inside off your computer,

27
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:30,370
and then you on top of that,

28
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:31,540
you have a browser,

29
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,750
send mail,

30
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,340
all the application that we're only calculator,

31
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,290
calendar office or any limits related applications.

32
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:40,540
And,

33
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:40,840
of course,

34
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,490
on top of that is are the users and that is you.

35
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:46,610
So Shell and Colonel together,

36
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:50,190
that's offer built together in one package,

37
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,400
and that is called operating system.

38
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,340
And that operating system is any operating system like Lennox,

39
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:56,910
UNIX,

40
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,550
Mac or Windows.

41
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:05,000
Every operating system has that little program that actually talks to your hardware and

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,210
anything that is a shell,

43
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,720
which is written in C programming languages.

44
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,240
Well,

45
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:15,150
that shell or that those applications are actually the software.

46
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,900
So this is what the real colonel means,

47
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:24,050
and we really need a colonel in any operating system to talkto our hardware.
