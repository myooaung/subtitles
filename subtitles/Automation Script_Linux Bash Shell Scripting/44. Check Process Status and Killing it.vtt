00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.970
Now we will talk about checking processes status and killing it meaning or stopping it or

2
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:11.220
exiting the process.

3
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.050
So there are many processes,

4
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.000
um,

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.250
in Olynyk system that when you run it,

6
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.650
it doesn't stop gracefully or doesn't shut down gracefully.

7
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.660
And those processes,

8
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.650
most of times are called like zombie process or a process that does not have a parent.

9
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.150
A parent process will started and it initiated a child process.

10
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.850
Ah,

11
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.090
but then the parent process will stop,

12
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.120
but the child process was still lingering,

13
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.170
lingering around.

14
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:48.390
So those are the type of process that you do experience in your in your career in your I t

15
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:48.900
career.

16
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.550
So you would have to actually go into the system,

17
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.450
find those processes and kill those process.

18
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.830
So this is,

19
00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:57.200
um,

20
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.970
this topic of this lesson is about the that process that we have to find out.

21
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.020
How can we be automate that process?

22
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.350
How can we put a script around that process to make it,

23
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.610
um,

24
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.140
Ron it at at certain times that will wake up and see a I see this process.

25
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.450
I'm gonna go ahead and kill it.

26
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.050
So what we're gonna do in this lesson is that we will create a dummy process.

27
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:28.110
Anything that is just taking up some off the CPI or memory resource is we'll just create

28
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.250
that process.

29
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.120
Then what we'll do is we were run the command to find that process I d commands are

30
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.690
different commands that you could check like top You could do PS minus cf.

31
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.580
There are so many commands that you could run to check which processes running.

32
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:45.900
And then you could,

33
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.650
um,

34
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.390
pipe it to grow up to grab for Pacific processes.

35
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.600
You're looking so in this lesson,

36
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.840
this is a lab environment.

37
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.090
We will have a process that will double in,

38
00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.250
we will initiate.

39
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.840
And then we will run the PS minus e of command and group for that Pacific process and its I

40
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.150
d.

41
00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.270
And then,

42
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.820
of course,

43
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.360
ah will create a script around it,

44
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.700
and then we will kill that process.

45
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.500
But in this Okay,

46
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.850
so this is the This is the exercise Will do.

47
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:15.780
Ah.

48
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.630
So for that,

49
00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.550
let's go ahead and log into our Lennox server.

50
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.060
I'm logged in as myself and I am in my home.

51
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.780
I have solved PS directory,

52
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.540
which is professional script directory,

53
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.420
that I have are created earlier anyways.

54
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.710
So first,

55
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:35.260
um,

56
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.420
before I create a script,

57
00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.320
I wanted to test my commands.

58
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.570
So I will run a process.

59
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.550
A dummy process which is to sleep.

60
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.550
Sleep is just,

61
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:51.100
ah,

62
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.000
command that will actually start taking your terminal.

63
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.650
And it will not give you your prom back for Let's see if I have 600 here,

64
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.260
it means 600 seconds,

65
00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.250
which is like 10 minute.

66
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.890
So this will take away my prom or create a process for that problem and a little wait for

67
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.150
10 minutes and then it will return my problem back.

68
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.970
I hit.

69
00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:14.350
Enter.

70
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.800
You see,

71
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.250
I do not have my prom back.

72
00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.350
Now.

73
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.000
How can I check if this process what process ideas is assigned to it?

74
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.340
Who is running that well?

75
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.050
You cannot do it from the same terminal because you do not have the Prabhat unless you

76
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.390
control see out of it.

77
00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.210
That's one way.

78
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.570
Second way is if you run the sleep process in the background,

79
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.500
then you could get your prom back and then you will see the process.

80
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.950
I d.

81
00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.050
Anyway,

82
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:49.030
we'll start a duplicate turn meditation and now I will do PS minus sea of command to check

83
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.860
the process.

84
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.750
And I will grow up for sleep 600.

85
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.300
And as you see the first process,

86
00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:06.000
right hairs initiated by me The process i d the process user i d the process Name time The

87
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.610
term of started from the 2nd 1 is just the group itself Commandment.

88
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:12.850
We run the group for it.

89
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:18.180
See describe since since this group is also a process than it runs,

90
00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.710
it grips,

91
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:20.550
it grips itself.

92
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.410
How come it groups itself so fast?

93
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.480
But that's that's how it does in mili seconds.

94
00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.020
Anyway,

95
00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.550
soil,

96
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.550
run another command to grip out off grid.

97
00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.350
So filter out craft now I will only see my sleep command.

98
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.960
Okay,

99
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.380
so this is the entire line.

100
00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.350
I do not want to see the entire line.

101
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.240
I just wanted to get the process i d.

102
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.740
So I could kill that process.

103
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:54.020
I d So for that we have to keep filtering it and we'll do talk print dollar two because

104
00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.350
it's the second column And now I have a process.

105
00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.390
So the process i d is this and I want to kill that process.

106
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.850
I d to kill this process.

107
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.970
I t I'm just gonna make this bigger said this way.

108
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.540
Everything can show up in one line before I kill it.

109
00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.840
It's always good idea that you tested that.

110
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.410
It comes back with the right I d.

111
00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:26.350
So I'm gonna use the X argument Command X a RGs mind's eye parentheses.

112
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:35.580
This is where it holds the result off this committee and now one when it holds that result

113
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:36.850
in this parentheses.

114
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.650
What I wanted to do right now is what I wanted to echo that,

115
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.250
um,

116
00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.020
whatever.

117
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.110
Inside of that parents see cell hit,

118
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.580
enter and you will see it brings back the same process.

119
00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:50.550
It didn't kill it.

120
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:51.540
Now,

121
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.850
I could run a command hill right here,

122
00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:02.780
and I could simply kill that commit that process process is gone.

123
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.210
And if you go back to your terminal in the background,

124
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.220
you'll see I got my prompt back,

125
00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.050
and it says right here terminated.

126
00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:17.180
So this is one of the ways that you could actually create a script like that which will

127
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.500
terminate your process that are no longer needed.

128
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.320
So let's go ahead and create the process.

129
00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.450
V I,

130
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:24.750
um,

131
00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.350
kill,

132
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:37.090
um process been bashed shoes.

133
00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:38.310
The author,

134
00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:38.900
of course,

135
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.150
We all know that by now.

136
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.290
Okay.

137
00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:50.550
Date description.

138
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.250
This script will find,

139
00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:55.650
um,

140
00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:04.640
dead or Zumbi Process seas and kill.

141
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:09.450
It modified.

142
00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:11.350
You ate.

143
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:13.450
You ate too.

144
00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:15.310
Okay,

145
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.250
so I'm just gonna go ahead and save this,

146
00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:23.650
and I will copy my entire command from here.

147
00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:31.150
Go back into my script and paste it by right clicking in the party terminal.

148
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:32.740
So for that,

149
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:41.750
what I could do is just either I could just leave it like that and and do echo.

150
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:43.650
Ah,

151
00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:47.950
sleeping processes are killed.

152
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:52.090
So this is how you go.

153
00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:53.450
Run that simple command.

154
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:57.140
And once you run it Ah,

155
00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.090
before you run it,

156
00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:02.050
you have to give it execute permissions.

157
00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:05.480
Kill process has executed permission.

158
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:05.950
Perfect.

159
00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:12.650
And I'm gonna run that sleep cement and terminal behind me and it.

160
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:15.220
And now I will run the script,

161
00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:19.050
kill process and all sleeping process are killed.

162
00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:21.150
See if you got it prom back.

163
00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:21.440
Yes.

164
00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.100
So that's one way to do it the second way.

165
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:25.520
I'm sure.

166
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:25.980
You know,

167
00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:27.050
I want you to try that.

168
00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:27.460
Secondly,

169
00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:30.550
I'm not gonna tell you is to use a for loop.

170
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:37.380
So you could actually put this entire command until here into a variable.

171
00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:45.920
Let's call that variable a And then you will run the four loop port for I in dollar a do

172
00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.830
kill dollar A done.

173
00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:50.690
So try that,

174
00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:51.770
and I'm sure it will work.

175
00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:56.260
And if you have any issue with this four Luke commandment,

176
00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:57.050
you're trying this,

177
00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:58.150
Let me know.

178
00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:58.760
But,

179
00:08:58.760 --> 00:08:59.200
um,

180
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.950
I'm sure you will be able to right both scripts.

181
00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.850
Would our ex arguments and four.
