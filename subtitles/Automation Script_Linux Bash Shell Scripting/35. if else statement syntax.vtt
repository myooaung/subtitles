00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.050
how everyone.

2
00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.280
So let's continue and do some more practice.

3
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.730
In the last lecture,

4
00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.880
we got a basic idea of old condition,

5
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.430
so let's continue.

6
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.900
So what is conditioned condition is nothing but an expression that ever lose to a Boolean

7
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.390
value that is true or false.

8
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.660
Your condition walks on Boolean value.

9
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.220
Other.

10
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.460
You're getting an output that is to off falls.

11
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.840
In other words,

12
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:27.660
condition.

13
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.590
You know,

14
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.840
it's a comparison off two numbers or two values.

15
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.070
Suppose you know I need to do addition off two numbers.

16
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.410
How we can do It's very simple.

17
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.050
I have to use this like 10 plus 30.

18
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.570
I got an output.

19
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.270
But here you can see that there is no comparison between Tool um was two values.

20
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.350
So let's do some comparison here.

21
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.710
So stood off this.

22
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.720
I'm putting number like 10 less than seven.

23
00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.500
Now you can see that the answer is zero.

24
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.060
No,

25
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.250
this Come on.

26
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.680
Basically,

27
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.700
it is doing some you know,

28
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.830
comparison between two numbers.

29
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.050
It is just checking the condition whether it is satisfying or not.

30
00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.230
In such tribunal conditions,

31
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.460
you will be getting an output either zero or one or any non zero value.

32
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.170
So do you no means that the result is false.

33
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.580
Is number 10 less than seven?

34
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.820
Obviously.

35
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:32.390
No.

36
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.590
So you got zero.

37
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.060
So in simple words,

38
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.350
if you're getting zero,

39
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.590
it means our it indicates falls.

40
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.910
Your condition is false on.

41
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.710
If you're getting a number one or any non zero values in Indyk,

42
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.720
it indicates to right.

43
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.350
So let's do some more practice.

44
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:59.920
I'm giving some other number like 14 is Get of them.

45
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.600
It didn't.

46
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.250
Let's see,

47
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.850
I'm getting zero Is 14 getter than eating?

48
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.760
No.

49
00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.120
So it's false.

50
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.850
False means it values to number zero.

51
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.960
If I'm typing this one,

52
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.060
that is to our equal to,

53
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.050
you know 40.

54
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.720
It's totally cool to 14 to 1/4.

55
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.890
It's false.

56
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:32.930
All right,

57
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.950
So false means you will be getting a number zero if I have tapping this one.

58
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.550
12 is not a call to 14.

59
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.840
12 nautical.

60
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.510
14?

61
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.500
Yes,

62
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.750
yes means true.

63
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.990
It will use to number one.

64
00:02:52.990 --> 00:03:04.400
The condition is satisfying here they I'm putting this Fortin equal to 14.

65
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.090
Yes,

66
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.540
14 is going to 14.

67
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.650
The condition is true,

68
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:10.640
right?

69
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:11.690
The condition is yes.

70
00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.950
That's why I'm got an output one.

71
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.300
So this way you have to use you know,

72
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.730
conditions while creating,

73
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:18.010
you know,

74
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.730
for moves.

75
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.480
If rules they So let me create asking for you so that you can understand how I'm using.

76
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.920
You know the conditions,

77
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.110
right?

78
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.910
So I'm going to create a simple script.

79
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:37.190
This one I get.

80
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:46.280
So if I'm using here on the dollar one So dollar one while executing this script,

81
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.060
I need to supply this one after less dot Celeste,

82
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.990
The name of the scoop.

83
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.720
After that,

84
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.430
I need to supply.

85
00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:00.870
The number is greater than 2 50 There is a condition here.

86
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.900
If it is 30 fire done,

87
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.330
it is going to the next line like echo.

88
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:15.420
You have time.

89
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.350
A number?

90
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:25.350
Get to them 2 50 That's all.

91
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:26.690
Simply skip behalf.

92
00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.640
So let me.

93
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.090
Come on,

94
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.780
let me make it executable.

95
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.460
Okay,

96
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:36.360
let me get again.

97
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.530
Okay.

98
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.990
So to execute this,

99
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.440
I have to,

100
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.610
you know,

101
00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.010
supply dollar dollar,

102
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.850
dollar one.

103
00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.430
So dollar one.

104
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.920
I have to give it here Support.

105
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.550
I'm giving number to 65.

106
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:50.610
No.

107
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:59.940
So 2 65 is going toe this $1 right now The condition if to 65 is greater than 2 50 Yes,

108
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:00.850
it's true.

109
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.220
It means that number one.

110
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:09.290
If they're getting condition is satisfying than it is going to move to the next line.

111
00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.890
Then so here my condition is satisfying.

112
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:12.970
Right?

113
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.080
I'm getting you know this.

114
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.880
Yes,

115
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:17.670
that is true.

116
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.350
It devalues the number one.

117
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.860
So it will be type.

118
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:21.560
Yes,

119
00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.630
you have type of number if I am giving a number,

120
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.210
which is less than 2 50 light to 44.

121
00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.150
So but my condition is not satisfying.

122
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.800
So it is not going to move to the next line.

123
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.650
Right?

124
00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:38.630
So it is not going to type anything here If you're going to give any number like this one

125
00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:45.710
this maybe so.

126
00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:46.680
This is a basic idea,

127
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.880
like,

128
00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:47.240
Okay,

129
00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.920
so let me get one more scared for you on this one.

130
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:58.450
Okay.

131
00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:01.930
So what I'm gonna do in this kip,

132
00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.890
I'm again going to use if on I'm looking for some fire.

133
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.990
Like embassy,

134
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.510
we find I'm looking for So here.

135
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:18.350
You can see that if on there is one condition if this it means that it is looking for this

136
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.710
file.

137
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.430
If condition is satisfied,

138
00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:21.650
if the file is there,

139
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.980
then echo.

140
00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.250
You can type,

141
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.250
you know,

142
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:32.090
filers existing else.

143
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.390
Suppose if condition is not satisfying.

144
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:36.790
Then it will move to the next statement.

145
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:37.720
That is else.

146
00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.240
And it couldn't time.

147
00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.210
Late file is missing.

148
00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:48.280
So if condition is satisfying,

149
00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.850
it means that you're getting a number one,

150
00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:51.360
right?

151
00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.940
If you're getting a number one,

152
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.230
your condition is satisfying.

153
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.430
Then you are going to move to the next line.

154
00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:57.290
That is then.

155
00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.850
Okay.

156
00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:00.900
And I'm going to read this good.

157
00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:11.010
This one file is missing because this file is not existing.

158
00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.460
I'm going to care this file touch that is,

159
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.050
in time,

160
00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:16.140
ABC again.

161
00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:16.770
I am running it.

162
00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:21.080
You can see the finals existing because condition is satisfying uglier.

163
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:21.680
You know,

164
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:30.800
let me open this file and really No,

165
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.180
The file was not there.

166
00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.950
The condition was not met.

167
00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.220
The final was missing,

168
00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.790
so it didn't move toe this line.

169
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:42.480
It moved to this else.

170
00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.270
If condition is satisfying here,

171
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:47.160
then only it will be in a moving to the next line.

172
00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.820
That is then echo violence,

173
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:50.680
existing house.

174
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.460
It will move here.

175
00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:56.850
So from their cell for this lecture hope you're enjoying a loving.

176
00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:58.760
But I will do in the next lecture
