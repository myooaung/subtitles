1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,770
Hello and welcome to log monitoring.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:10,980
Lesson Another and most important way off system administration is logged.

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:11,910
Monitors.

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,370
Think of a lot of monitor in a way as if you have.

5
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:16,920
If you have your person,

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,600
physician or a doctor,

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,350
every time you go to him,

8
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,290
he or she has a chart on you,

9
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,750
which the record of your medical history,

10
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:31,460
which tells the doctor What are the problems you had in the past,

11
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,100
whether you had any surgery,

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,690
whether you're allergic to any medicine,

13
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:41,850
said That is the way doctors keep logs on your physical health.

14
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,910
Just like that,

15
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:50,980
systems also have to keep logs and generate logs and record everything that goes on with

16
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:51,760
the system.

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,680
So in our log directory right here in our learning system,

18
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01,450
the primary log directory is war and slash long.

19
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:08,360
All the logs that are generated on UNIX machines are mainly in warlock directory,

20
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:15,790
unless specified or changed in the configuration file owner often application to change the

21
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:16,860
law location.

22
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,100
Um,

23
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:25,010
a few off the logs of evil Kovar in this lesson are one number one is boot boot is the log

24
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:25,010
.

25
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:28,170
When your system boots up reboots,

26
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,370
it generates this long and records everything that goes on to your system.

27
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,560
How it cleans up the memory.

28
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,380
What the process is starting up.

29
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,200
If it hasn't,

30
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,590
if it is having any issues,

31
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,150
it will log everything in there.

32
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,050
Then you have crony D,

33
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,710
which is a newer version off.

34
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,810
NTP has its own log.

35
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,670
Cron may law secure logs.

36
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,430
The next one we have the messages.

37
00:01:53,430 --> 00:02:00,820
Long messages is one of the important logs that every system in Mr uses to monitor system

38
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,470
activities,

39
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:05,640
everything that is a hardware wise application,

40
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,630
wise or process wise,

41
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:10,990
anything that has to do with the systems or even application wise,

42
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,990
it goes into war long messages.

43
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:17,380
Then at the last one we have http D,

44
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,150
which is also an Apache application law.

45
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:25,150
So without further do I log into my Lennox machine,

46
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,850
I log it as myself.

47
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:31,970
I already have an I p that I specified.

48
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,710
Um,

49
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,080
so once I log in,

50
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,750
I will go into war slash log directory.

51
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,680
When I am in slash lock directory,

52
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,450
I could go on Ellis minus l command or simply wrong.

53
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:48,820
Hell,

54
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,720
l and you all the locks.

55
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,800
And once again,

56
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,020
when I run that it has so many logs,

57
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,770
so many files,

58
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:59,100
so many directories that I cannot view them all on one page.

59
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:06,920
So I'll do this El Pipe it to more and you will see l l will list all the files by

60
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,310
alphabetical orders.

61
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,740
So the 1st 1 is our did audit Aziz.

62
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:17,690
One of the files are directory that has all the other information.

63
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,930
Then we have boot dot log.

64
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:23,600
Let's look at book dot log When you do more on food,

65
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,910
don't log.

66
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:29,050
I get in message days permission denied.

67
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,890
Why do I get that message?

68
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:40,370
Because the Buddha log is owned by route and the group who owns that while is also route.

69
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,360
So am I root.

70
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,550
Who am I?

71
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,950
I'm not route.

72
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:45,630
OK,

73
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:51,010
so if I'm not ruled to do I have the permission to read the file and as others I should

74
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,750
have read permission right here,

75
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,650
right last three bits.

76
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,430
Or if I'm part of the group,

77
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,410
I should be as you have access here.

78
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:02,860
So neither group nor regular ordinary users has access.

79
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,590
Read a file,

80
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,900
so only root hasn't.

81
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,250
So we will become route.

82
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:18,010
Go back to our log and we'll do poop dot lock when I hit.

83
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:18,500
Enter,

84
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,870
you'll see on the left side.

85
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:24,100
It is coming up with OK messages.

86
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:29,980
While system is booting up every time there is an issue with the system booting up,

87
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:34,860
it will come up with a message saying falls or error or alert.

88
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,020
So you'll see.

89
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,850
It is starting all the services one by one.

90
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,250
It is starting all the processes.

91
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,610
Welcome to Cento Islamic seven.

92
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:52,200
It's going through each step off the spooks startup and when it starts up completely,

93
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,840
it stops the log.

94
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,870
When you reboot your system this file,

95
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:04,090
which is let's find L Buddha log.

96
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:06,480
This file gets over written,

97
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,140
So if I reboot my machine right now,

98
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:14,120
it will generate a newer file and it will rewrite the speak boot dot log.

99
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,390
Okay,

100
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:25,250
so the next one we have a Z Ronnie crony is a placement of NTP service,

101
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:31,210
any type off changes that we make on the crony service.

102
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:37,100
It actually generates that long and actually locks that information into the logs.

103
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,780
Next one we have in the list is craun.

104
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,810
If you look at it on the left hand side,

105
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,840
I'm just going by what I have listed,

106
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,820
there are many other files.

107
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:56,620
And if you have time And if you are interested in learning all these different logs,

108
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,180
then please be my guest.

109
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,600
Try out every command.

110
00:05:59,600 --> 00:05:59,980
I'm sorry.

111
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,660
Try of everybody and see what they are used for.

112
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,670
Um,

113
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,720
the next one I want to cover is the KRON,

114
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,050
which is right here.

115
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,030
You,

116
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,240
whenever you're scheduled,

117
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,880
a job or a process through a Cron tab entry,

118
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,070
it generates some kind of activity.

119
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,360
And that activity,

120
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,850
that record is logged into this file so you could do Kron.

121
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:25,350
And you will see all the information about the Koran.

122
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,540
And by the way,

123
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:30,820
whenever you open up a log while the first is the month,

124
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,490
second is the date.

125
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,520
Time the name off your host.

126
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,190
Name the demon,

127
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,890
which is crawling D and process.

128
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:40,850
I d associated with that demon.

129
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:47,460
Their user Who's running that and the command or the entry that has been associated with

130
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,370
the Kronk moving on.

131
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,150
Um,

132
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:53,830
we have the next one we have quickly.

133
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,740
There is a command called the message.

134
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,300
Even you run this command.

135
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,290
This one also gives you information about the hardware.

136
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,730
If you do not want to run this command,

137
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:06,750
you could simply to cat on the messages as well,

138
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,580
which will give you the exact same information.

139
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:14,270
The next one we have is may log.

140
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:20,250
Male log has all the information about your send mill demon,

141
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:26,100
which means every time you send an email out or every time in the email comes and all that

142
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,010
activity is being recorded in this law,

143
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:35,630
whenever you are troubleshooting issues with send mail service,

144
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:40,680
this is one of the laws you would have to look into to see why you are where your service

145
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,410
not able to send e mails moving on.

146
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:48,300
Then we have secure log right here.

147
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:48,630
Now,

148
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:55,770
secure logs is the log that actually records all your logging in logging out activity.

149
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:58,500
So when you doom or on secure,

150
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:04,910
you'll see all the users that have been long then if they have failed logging in or if they

151
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:09,300
from which machine there logging in all the information about the users.

152
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,640
So I am.

153
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:18,540
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do tail minus Steph now minus F is the option that will keep

154
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,380
on sniffing the log.

155
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,890
And every time a new record is updated to the log,

156
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:27,680
that tail minus f will get that newest long at the bottom.

157
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,170
So if I do tail minus f,

158
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,040
um,

159
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,730
secure and I'll keep running this command,

160
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,780
this command is running.

161
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,350
Now I'm gonna open up another session,

162
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:41,900
another party session I have already saved.

163
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:49,280
And if I log in as myself and I type in wrong password,

164
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,380
let's say as soon as I type wrong password you see in the background,

165
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,650
it stays right here.

166
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:57,520
Failed a password for I assault.

167
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,160
And I'm trying to log in from this machine one night,

168
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:06,050
1 61.8 If I log back in with the correct password,

169
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:15,410
then I will get that additional record for my sessions in session open for user.

170
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:16,750
I have solved.

171
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,630
So this is about the secure disc,

172
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:31,170
your log file and the next one is one of the most important log file that you should spend

173
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,050
your time and is messages.

174
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:36,660
Every time there's an issue with your machine,

175
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:44,370
the first thing an administrator does they long into your machine and they will trace logs

176
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:51,010
in messages while so you go into see you are logged and then you doom or messages.

177
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:55,830
Now this file has again once again this while has all the hardware,

178
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:56,540
information,

179
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,000
all the software information,

180
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,090
all the application information,

181
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,150
all the processes,

182
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:04,790
information everything is being logged into this log.

183
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:11,270
So if I wanted to see how many lines this log file has,

184
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:15,290
I could do cat messages and wc minus help will see,

185
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:21,600
I have 7001 or three lines if I wanted to see if they are any error messages in this file.

186
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,840
So the group minus I I is to ignore upper case,

187
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:33,290
lower case from messages fall and you will see it actually grabbed every line inside of

188
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:36,910
this log file that has a message called Error.

189
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,910
So this way you could go in and see what's going on.

190
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:40,950
Reduced system.

191
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,070
What happened?

192
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,040
Why it failed,

193
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,440
what time it failed.

194
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,820
So anyway,

195
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:50,070
let's wrap up the lesson and again,

196
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,630
spend some time in this war.

197
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:56,230
Log messages go over all these log files,

198
00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:01,630
specifically the ones I have in this lesson and see what type of different laws there are.

199
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:05,850
View them group for certain errors and get yourself familiar with them.
