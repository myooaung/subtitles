00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.450
Hello,

2
00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:02.250
everyone.

3
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.730
In this lesson,

4
00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:10.060
we will cover the Lennox File Editor and editor is a program which enables you to create

5
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.120
and manipulate data or text Analytics fall.

6
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.350
There are several standard Texan editors available on most Lennix systems.

7
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.590
You could use V i e d e x e Max PICO and women,

8
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.510
which is a van.

9
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.850
Them is the advanced version of the I.

10
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.870
In our lesson,

11
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.560
we will focus on V I.

12
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.680
Why?

13
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.700
Because V I is available in almost every Linux distribution,

14
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.260
regardless of which Olynyk system you log in it.

15
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.650
Whether it's a bun to Soucy Red Santo s,

16
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.750
you're gonna find me I everywhere.

17
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:48.820
Plus,

18
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.150
it's very easy to learn.

19
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:59.000
The V I editor actually supplies commands for inserting or deleting text,

20
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.140
replacing text,

21
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.020
moving around the file,

22
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.390
finding substitutes,

23
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.080
strings and cutting and pasting text inside.

24
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.560
So that's what we I does when you have to write to a file,

25
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.580
the most common keys are I,

26
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.990
which is to concert escape,

27
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.220
replace before our Defense league and quit without saving and quit.

28
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:20.630
Right,

29
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.280
but safe.

30
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.350
So let's look at our Lennox machine,

31
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:29.460
and at this time you will log into our Lennox machine the Linux virtual machine through our

32
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.350
police station.

33
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.330
Okay,

34
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.970
um,

35
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:45.210
that cd my and wished Eritrea in in this derek tree,

36
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.730
I want you to create your first file.

37
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.120
So call it the I,

38
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.650
which is a command space.

39
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.250
Uh,

40
00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.740
my first added to her or just save my first.

41
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:01.050
Well,

42
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.090
how's that?

43
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.880
Much easier hit.

44
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.320
Enter now.

45
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.980
When you hit enter,

46
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.610
you are still in command mode.

47
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.180
You're not an insert mode,

48
00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.770
so there are two different modes.

49
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.300
Once you are in the V,

50
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.380
I his first more is to when you run the command.

51
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.040
Second mode is when you inside of the V I,

52
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.510
and you start typing it.

53
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.340
If you want to get out of that typing mode,

54
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.930
you have this escape.

55
00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.150
So now let's start.

56
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.770
Let's see if I want to type into this file.

57
00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:41.670
You hit I or insert lower case I As soon as you hit I you see at the bottom it say's insert

58
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.670
.

59
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.740
It means we are an insert mode now.

60
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.890
Already limits commands won't work are because we are an insert,

61
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.050
more so that he could type something like Hello world.

62
00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:02.440
This is my first lesson to learn,

63
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.440
be I and you could hit.

64
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.570
Enter again,

65
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.350
um,

66
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.470
so excited about.

67
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:19.360
So it's just simple as if you're trying award document now if you wanted to exit out off it

68
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.360
.

69
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.250
If you want to save this wall,

70
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.770
all you have to do is hit escape right here.

71
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.730
And once you hit escape,

72
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.060
you'll see the insert mode is calm.

73
00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.580
Now how do you save this file?

74
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.040
You could do through two different ways.

75
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.350
One.

76
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.650
You hit shift is easy,

77
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.990
the twice,

78
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.750
and it will save the file.

79
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.240
Let's see if you do cat again and do my first file,

80
00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.580
you'll see it's there another way to save a far.

81
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.020
Let's go back in the file,

82
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:59.550
my first ball and let's say you want type something,

83
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.450
um,

84
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:07.150
hit insert again and then high space.

85
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.950
And now you want to exit out and save his escape.

86
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.510
And this time,

87
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:14.410
instead of shipped,

88
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:15.080
is easy.

89
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.520
You type shift calling,

90
00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.450
right.

91
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.240
Quit and exclamation point,

92
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.060
which is also referred to as bag you had.

93
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.630
How do you wear file?

94
00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.990
You read the father my first file,

95
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.540
and there you go.

96
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.520
The file is there.

97
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.790
So this is these are two modes is once you get out And once you get in now,

98
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:42.750
I want you to go back into your fault and it be I and my first file,

99
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.700
and I want you to replace,

100
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.880
um hi.

101
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:49.300
No,

102
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.380
I want you to delete high and leave their as is now.

103
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:54.650
How do you go?

104
00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.760
Move around inside off the file.

105
00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.540
And you're already India editor.

106
00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.850
You could use up bottom left,

107
00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.110
right keys on your keyboard to move around.

108
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.460
But remember,

109
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.830
you cannot use thes keys if you are an insert mode.

110
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:21.580
So let's say if you are hit I and you know in insert more and now you do a left right key.

111
00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.590
It can work,

112
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.610
but it most likely it will break your command.

113
00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:40.320
So it's better you had escaped and go back and then you do d on your keyboard d This will

114
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:48.090
delete the entire line I wanted to delete on Lee the Ford High.

115
00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.680
So how do I get back?

116
00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.670
My last line that I deleted.

117
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:58.050
So you hit you just simple you and it brings back your last line.

118
00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.220
Now,

119
00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:07.220
if you wanted to remove the high just type X once which will remove one character Type X

120
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.650
again was to remove another character.

121
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.930
Now you have a space hit X again.

122
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.500
Now you don't have a space Now what?

123
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.500
If you want to save now again,

124
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:22.120
do shift ZZ twice and it saves it.

125
00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.290
How do you wear a fight?

126
00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.560
You do,

127
00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.050
cat my 1st 5 And it is there.

128
00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.260
Now let's go back in again.

129
00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:36.940
And let's practice the replace command the I my first Well,

130
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.180
I wanted to replace.

131
00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.540
I am so excited about it.

132
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.380
I wanted to replace the word excited with the word happy.

133
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.950
So how do we do it?

134
00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:53.180
We cannot hit I right now because we don't want to get into the insert mode.

135
00:06:53.180 --> 00:07:04.350
So we will use our arrow keys to go down to the word excited so I could do our once I hit

136
00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:12.100
our I could do h It only replaced one letter if I wanted to do again.

137
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:21.050
The second letter You move your cursor to the right it are and then do a and so forth.

138
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:30.940
But I would prefer that you do escape out of it and then do x x x expects and then you hit

139
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:36.550
I and then PP why you escape again.

140
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:39.770
So you can move around,

141
00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:42.790
You could go up.

142
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:48.390
It could go it down If you want to move around now,

143
00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:55.820
if What If you want to go to the end of this file and now you want to create a new line

144
00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:59.250
right below it before I am so happy about it.

145
00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:00.750
You had Oh,

146
00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:04.530
this will create a new line for you.

147
00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:05.950
And also,

148
00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:14.750
it would automatically put you into insert mode so you could type anything like LA Law.

149
00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:15.650
The law?

150
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:16.990
Well,

151
00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:21.600
you just noticed that you just type j by mistake.

152
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.000
Now,

153
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.550
how do you remove Jay?

154
00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:25.280
You type X,

155
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.200
Remember,

156
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.500
If you're gonna type X,

157
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.780
it will write X instead of deleting it.

158
00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:30.250
Look,

159
00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:34.930
See it typing the X So I want to delete that character.

160
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:35.920
How do I delete that,

161
00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:39.180
captain is because you cannot delete why?

162
00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:41.920
Because you are in insert mold.

163
00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.850
How do I get out of insert more You hit?

164
00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:51.510
You're saving life saving key which is escape as soon as you hit escape.

165
00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:51.930
You see,

166
00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:53.500
the insert mode is gone.

167
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.890
Now when you hit x x,

168
00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:03.360
it deletes those two characters that you added by mistake.

169
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:06.780
It was a typo that you added Same way.

170
00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.150
If you want to go up,

171
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:12.850
you could if you wanted to write something right here.

172
00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:15.140
And if you type,

173
00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:16.560
I you notice it.

174
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.460
Start writing right in the middle.

175
00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.130
Hello.

176
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:22.250
Hi C without giving a space.

177
00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:24.890
So let's do escape again.

178
00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:31.530
His ex Move the cursor to the left and x Okay.

179
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:34.480
And now you have that space in the middle.

180
00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.180
Now,

181
00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.600
how do I write?

182
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.480
By putting a space in the middle?

and it is saving your first file now.

195
00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.600
What if I wanted to delete the line blah,

196
00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.090
blah,

197
00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:19.050

198
00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:21.190
So I'll go back into my file,

199
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:23.470

200
00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:27.380
Move your cursor down to blah,

201
00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:27.880

12 They It removes the line that you added that wherever you want to go,

204
00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:40.220
if you want to.

205
00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:40.610
Oh,

206
00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:42.240
usual Moved it by mistake.

207
00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:47.250
No problem that you will bring it back again.

208
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:49.240
You could save it through ships.

209
00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.680
Easy for you could save it through common right,

210
00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:57.550
Quit and bank.

211
00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:02.660
You could hit and and that's how you saved the ball.

212
00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.550
Now let's go back into the fall one more time.

213
00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:10.240
The I might first file and I want to.

214
00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:13.300
Let's say I have a file which is huge,

215
00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:19.040
and I wanted to search for a Pacific word in a file.

216
00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:23.060
Let's say I wanted to search for a lesson.

217
00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:29.140
I wanted to search for l so you could do search for it two ways.

218
00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:32.250
I hope you remember the command corrupt.

219
00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:39.520
And then you search for lesson from where my first file and it will Onley bring that one

220
00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.310
line that has the word lesson.

221
00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:44.540
But if you are in the eye mode,

222
00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:46.490
you could also do that same search.

223
00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:52.670
And now you could just simply make sure you're not an insert mode.

224
00:11:52.670 --> 00:12:05.770
Simply hit slash and type L E s s on lesson it into and there it will bring you to exactly

225
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:08.520
the word that you want to change.

226
00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:09.150
Perhaps.

227
00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:18.780
Are you looking for so These are the few commands that we have about creating a file using

228
00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:19.390
the I.

229
00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:28.080
We do have many different commands or keys that we could use in V I I have included in this

230
00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:28.670
lecture.

231
00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:35.120
I have included all those keys in and Azan Handout.

232
00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:39.670
So please look into those and try every single key.

233

one common mistake that everybody is gonna make is when you are an insert mode,

238
00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:04.780
you're probably gonna have to get out of it.

239
00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:05.570
