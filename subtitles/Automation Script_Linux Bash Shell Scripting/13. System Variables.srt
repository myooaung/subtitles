1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
how everyone.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:02,800
So this,

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,200
like trivia going to understand about system variables.

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:12,400
System wearables are created and maintained by Atlantic bash shell itself.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:20,350
It means that those variables which are basically created bio system itself or consistent

6
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,050
variables.

7
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:24,570
So when you do the stylish in off any operating system,

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,150
the system created Lord off variables for their uses.

9
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:30,200
They're called system variables.

10
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,900
The admin,

11
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:33,730
the user admin.

12
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:38,090
The system admin is not basically catered such variables.

13
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,940
You can modify the system variables.

14
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:40,750
As for you,

15
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:47,040
uses so this type of variables that maintain your system that always started with capital

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,790
letters.

17
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:52,700
You can configure the aspects off shell by modifying the system variables.

18
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,980
So these are your system.

19
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,010
Variables like Bs,

20
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,170
one that billions off the best prompt.

21
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,250
When you log into the system,

22
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,190
you always get some prompt.

23
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:04,620
So at the back,

24
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,450
any food see,

25
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:08,450
which is basically defined by a Bs one.

26
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,340
So it is already defined when you do that stylish.

27
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,170
But if you want to modify the best prompt,

28
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:15,230
you can do it.

29
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:22,250
A system admin can do it like your HIST file size the number of commands in bash history.

30
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,040
So by default,

31
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,040
it is 1000.

32
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,920
But if you want to modify,

33
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,650
you can do it.

34
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,430
And part as well.

35
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:31,490
That is a directors to look for executive ALS.

36
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:32,440
So these are your,

37
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:32,840
you know,

38
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,060
system variables.

39
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,510
So let me log in toe my line X box on.

40
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:37,250
We'll show you.

41
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,620
So they're to command this basically,

42
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,520
which can be used to,

43
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:41,930
you know,

44
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,740
see your valuables.

45
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,370
The very 1st 1 is your set.

46
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:45,850
Come on,

47
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:46,570
I said,

48
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:46,870
Come on,

49
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,290
is basically used to,

50
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:48,760
you know,

51
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,210
look,

52
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:54,050
for you're both environmental variables and your cell variables.

53
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,010
In simple words,

54
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:59,760
we can say that the system variables are also a part off your environmental variables,

55
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,690
right?

56
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:02,420
So that's why,

57
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,960
from simple fire the set Come on,

58
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,850
It will give you all the system variables that includes the environmental wearable as well

59
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:08,850
,

60
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,830
plus your local variable as well.

61
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,550
So look a little Suppose I am.

62
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:18,350
Clayton is equal toe 11 b is equal to 12 season called Tory,

63
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:21,500
so three variables are have credit as a local variable.

64
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,230
If I'll simple fire set.

65
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:23,750
Come on,

66
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,340
you can see that it will start showing in the set.

67
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:26,840
Come on.

68
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,770
So that's why the definition offset.

69
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,310
Come on or we can say Simple.

70
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:31,900
Father said,

71
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,230
Come on,

72
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:36,060
it will give you an output in which we have the environmental variables,

73
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:36,970
your shell variables,

74
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,000
your local variables,

75
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,670
all the variables that is defining your system that will be coming with this.

76
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,150
Come on,

77
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,060
the next command is your e,

78
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:45,810
and we Come on,

79
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,320
it'll simple fire and we come on and fight.

80
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,060
It will only give you the environmental variables.

81
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,930
Or you can see that your sister very well also.

82
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,340
Right?

83
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,310
So your system is creating a lot of variables by itself.

84
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,400
So they're called system variables are called environmental variable.

85
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:11,630
If I use a like there's a root user on the road user has created available on that terrible

86
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:11,630
,

87
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,400
you know,

88
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,360
has been killed as the environmental variable.

89
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,640
So that is called environment available.

90
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,910
So such type of wearable available is called is not a system.

91
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:20,310
Very well,

92
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,300
right.

93
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,280
So don't be confused with that system.

94
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,680
Variable on environment available.

95
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,050
Okay,

96
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:28,290
so here,

97
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:28,880
from simple,

98
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,150
funny and become on you can see that I go to someone on board.

99
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:35,550
So let me 1st 5 this come on and show you a few more things here.

100
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:39,280
You can see that I got an output like this one.

101
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,270
The HIST file is showing this one.

102
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:46,270
It means that this is the location where all your history commands are going in this file.

103
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:52,500
So this who has defined this hissed file his file is available on a very well.

104
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,460
We have defined this When your system is mandating this fire like this way,

105
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,720
the HIST file size is your 1000.

106
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,100
So who is mandating this?

107
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:05,290
Your system on If you logged in Currently I have logged in as a route If you have changed

108
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:12,900
your user from root to some local user So here the variable it will be 10 days.

109
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,990
So let me show you.

110
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:18,700
Let me log in with us about the user uncle on again.

111
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,650
I'm fighting the same.

112
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:20,120
Come on,

113
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:34,630
I can see that the variable name is still same but its value has been changed The party

114
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:40,100
against is that when I logged in as a food user it waas less rude on dot Bash underscore

115
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,660
History now have logged in as a user Uncle,

116
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,070
you can see the pop.

117
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,960
You can see the value of the variable.

118
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,400
The hist file is available Name it is to train thousands.

119
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,760
So these are your system.

120
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,300
When the system is mandating,

121
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,510
I do come out from here on.

122
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:04,810
I'm going to create environmental variable like D is called 200.

123
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,470
So if I all 500 is a local variable,

124
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,500
it will not show in this.

125
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:08,900
Come on.

126
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:14,820
If I'll simple and we will check the DEA's is not showing right.

127
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,510
These 10 is not showing in this common.

128
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,560
So let me make it as an environmental variable.

129
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,980
No,

130
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,090
my d has become an environmental available.

131
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,250
If all fathers come on,

132
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,400
you can see that these time starts from that,

133
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,520
right?

134
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,950
So in simple words,

135
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:34,180
the set commands will give you an output off both your environmental,

136
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,880
your system and your local variables.

137
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,380
Whatever the variables that has been defining your system that would be showing in this set

138
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:40,380
.

139
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,790
Come on on with envy command,

140
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:46,260
it will only show your environmental Where's all your system variables?

141
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,490
The local variables will not be showing into this car.

142
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:49,520
So,

143
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:49,700
friend,

144
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,390
that's all for this.

145
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:54,770
Like to hope you have got an idea about the variability of system variables,

146
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:55,940
the local variables.

147
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,700
Thanks for watching.

148
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,650
And if you have time,

149
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,680
please join him in the next lecture.
