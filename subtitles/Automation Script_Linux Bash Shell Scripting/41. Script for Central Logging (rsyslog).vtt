00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
Okay,

2
00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.300
This is the time about central logging.

3
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.190
This is one off the script that,

4
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.650
um a lot of places have it in place and a lot off.

5
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:12.660
Um,

6
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.750
companies would like to have some kind off automation tool around the logging.

7
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.600
How is how it works is you have every Lennix machine has war log messages,

8
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:25.950
right?

9
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.030
And you would actually have to go into the machine,

10
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:34.990
log into the machine to view those those logs and to see if they are any,

11
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.290
er,

12
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.450
messages or failures or anything.

13
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:43.040
So you you probably would have to do that multiple times if you have multiple servers or

14
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.230
did you have to do probably for 1000 times?

15
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.730
If you're thousands servers and you have to go and be I the file tested grew up so many

16
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:51.050
things.

17
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.850
What if I tell you you could write a script,

18
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.620
a central logger script?

19
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.450
What is going to do is gonna trace the war log messages.

20
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.790
Well,

21
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.810
not just trace like entire fall.

22
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:10.620
It actually is going to sit and wait for the new line generation to log in to the war log

23
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:11.170
messages.

24
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.050
And as soon as it comes in,

25
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.750
it is actually going to,

26
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:17.950
ah,

27
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:18.810
filter route,

28
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.880
whether it has ever messages or not,

29
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.700
and it's gonna put it out if it matches your criteria.

30
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.120
If you are looking for Onley,

31
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.610
let's say error messages of failures.

32
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.150
Then it's only gonna grab for that key words.

33
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.110
And one,

34
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.900
once it finds those keywords,

35
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.750
is gonna push that out to a file.

36
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:42.130
And you could read that file later on by yourself or then.

37
00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.570
Or you could actually leave that script to run it in the background while it's running its

38
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.450
keep out putting your,

39
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.260
UM,

40
00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:56.390
error messages or your failures related lines from your log messages to,

41
00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.150
ah file.

42
00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.380
And then you could go in and read it,

43
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.290
and you just have to do is run in the background.

44
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.690
Or you could third step you could do is you could as soon as those file is created,

45
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.080
you could create another script and tell if it's gonna wake up like every 15 minutes or 20

46
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.050
minutes and tell the users or administrators or managers that hate There is.

47
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.530
This file has been generated,

48
00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.600
and it has thes many errors,

49
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.760
and failures are,

50
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.240
of course,

51
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.300
you could go another step,

52
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.950
which is to schedule descript through the Cron job,

53
00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.950
so if you look at it backwards,

54
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.250
you have a script that is scheduled to wake up every 15 minutes.

55
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:46.960
That's group will have to notify a user if a file exists and that file that exists that has

56
00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.120
your information that you're looking for,

57
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.950
like errors,

58
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.450
failures shut down,

59
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.150
off line or anything that you have specified.

60
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.950
And those messages are coming from where from War log must.

61
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.950
So we will create this grip.

62
00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.330
It's a little long scribe.

63
00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.950
You'll create this script step by step,

64
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.520
and you could actually implement that script in your job.

65
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:16.740
If you are at Lenox capacity right now and you will see definitely that this has this will

66
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.050
make your life so much easier than you actually have.

67
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.950
Um,

68
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.150
these Aramis is coming in through the email without you having to log into every machine.

69
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.050
No,

70
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.590
let's go straight again to our machine.

71
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.150
Let's clear our screen,

72
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:40.950
and I want you to this time become route because in order to read war log messages,

73
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.340
you have to be Route Vidal route.

74
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.960
You cannot read y log messages that does not have re permissions for anyone else,

75
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.470
but Okay.

76
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.970
Here.

77
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.250
You have to,

78
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.710
um,

79
00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:56.500
start writing a script.

80
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.100
But before you write a script,

81
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.550
I just have to tell you that the way you could look at the logs is by doing tail.

82
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:04.750
Um,

83
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.530
let's in minus 10 or log messages,

84
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.870
right?

85
00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:09.460
Most of time.

86
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.450
People would do that to see if there are any messages,

87
00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.550
or what they do is they do cat such war log messages,

88
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:23.150
and they will just grow up for minus i to skip case lower case.

89
00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.200
You see,

90
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.110
I have so many air messages on my machine,

91
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.810
it came up.

92
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.440
I would have known if this air messages exist unless I come in and log into the machine and

93
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.650
actually run this command.

94
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.510
But is that something that you want to do it every day and spending so much of your time

95
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.860
just looking for log our messages.

96
00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.630
And if you have 100 system,

97
00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:45.900
then forget about it.

98
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.770
You going to spend all your date and it's gonna affect your performance significa and you

99
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.420
don't want Okay,

100
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.600
so,

101
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.940
for you,

102
00:04:52.940 --> 00:05:00.260
for that you have to write a script and to write a script I'm gonna pick ofhis directory of

103
00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.640
men in slash route and here I have few other ones.

104
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.840
I already have one script that I created earlier.

105
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.000
It's called Log Tail and I will actually use that script.

106
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.450
But I will tell you exactly how it works.

107
00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:15.950
Let me clear the screen.

108
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:20.370
So lock tale is a script that I have written her.

109
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.190
And then you will see here a skip it real quick.

110
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.650
But I want you to put it in the information that we always need.

111
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.750
Date description.

112
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:46.950
This will log on the fine key model.

113
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.090
Okay,

114
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:50.250
so let's get into this.

115
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.640
This is what the script first,

116
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:59.150
the script is going to tail with minus f n zero option.

117
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:04.490
Till is a command that will tail the last error messages from a file.

118
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:05.700
So not error message.

119
00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.660
Any messages from and then use place?

120
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:09.650
If I minus f,

121
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:10.810
um,

122
00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:18.220
this is going to tail the live incoming trump with minus with minus end.

123
00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.400
Zero option.

124
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.700
What is telling it on Lee?

125
00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.550
Look for the latest new incoming message.

126
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.250
Don't look forward messages that previously in this in this law,

127
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:28.700
which is fine,

128
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:29.950
because when you gonna run it,

129
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:33.080
You don't want to start from the beginning you don't want it to keep getting the same error

130
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.550
messages.

131
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:34.530
Okay,

132
00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:36.670
so I'm sure you're familiar with this command.

133
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.050
You do our log messages.

134
00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.030
Next thing right here,

135
00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.450
you put a pipe and you do wild read line.

136
00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:46.850
What this is doing is while it is doing tail,

137
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:48.850
if you leave it right here,

138
00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:52.950
then it is going nowhere because you're running a shell.

139
00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:55.080
But you want to put it somewhere,

140
00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:55.380
right?

141
00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.160
So you do a wild script.

142
00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:02.050
The reason you do while is because you wanted to run disco in a loop.

143
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:05.050
Meaning it doesn't stop,

144
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.850
just keeps running and running and running until you actually go in and stop this.

145
00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:15.520
So what is doing is you are telling the script to run the script while in a while,

146
00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.750
loop and read the line.

147
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:19.260
And what is the line?

148
00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.570
Line is our variable.

149
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:23.470
And what is coming inside the line?

150
00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:33.120
Whatever the output from this is going to go into this very now you clear here Now,

151
00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.690
once we have all those messages coming in in this line,

152
00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:37.550
what should we do?

153
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:38.810
Right?

154
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:39.450
What should we do?

155
00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:42.440
Do echo that line first.

156
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:42.850
Awful.

157
00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:49.150
Whatever is inside of this variable accord again once you echo it,

158
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:51.450
which is gonna It's gonna read it right.

159
00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:54.250
Then it will grow.

160
00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:55.480
Igra.

161
00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.240
Pekar up is another command.

162
00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:57.960
Ah,

163
00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.950
it's ah efficient command that will grab multiple key.

164
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:06.710
So eager minus I and I have key words here.

165
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:07.750
It's refused.

166
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:13.180
Invalid error fail lost shut down off line.

167
00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:17.920
These are the key words that I have gathered in the past from my experience.

168
00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.950
And I know these keywords actually,

169
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:21.950
um,

170
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:22.590
work.

171
00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:29.780
And these are the type of keywords and mostly coming to the system and valuable to the

172
00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.050
system in Mr Didn't find out.

173
00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:32.860
So anyway,

174
00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:37.550
whatever comes in and it will grow for all these messages,

175
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:40.800
Harry putting in if commit What he's saying is,

176
00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:48.540
if statement is if dollar question mark meaning if the exit status is equal to zero,

177
00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:53.250
meaning if it does find something any of these key word.

178
00:08:53.250 --> 00:09:00.800
Only then only then echoed that output from this to,

179
00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:00.890
ah,

180
00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:02.920
file called temp filter.

181
00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:06.230
That's my own created file.

182
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:18.850
I wanted to put into this filter once it's been put in fi and done so that's save that file

183
00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:18.850
.

184
00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:21.360
But I run that file,

185
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:29.850
you'll see it will run an infinite loop unless I actually put in some kind of logar message

186
00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:30.140
in it,

187
00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:33.250
and then it will put it into the filter fall.

188
00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:34.350
So let's ah,

189
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:35.180
control,

190
00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.270
See out if it And if you notice,

191
00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:42.380
where is it putting its putting into slash temp filter messages,

192
00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:42.550
right?

193
00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:47.880
I ran this command previously,

194
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.300
and it has some off the,

195
00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:50.150
um messages.

196
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:56.730
And when you do cat filtered messages,

197
00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:02.950
you will see some off the air mess you that I sent through the logger that came in here,

198
00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:04.350
Um,

199
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:07.300
the longer command to run it.

200
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.260
I think it's,

201
00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.950
ah me do from my history breath for longer.

202
00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:15.010
And you see right here this is a logger.

203
00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:20.900
If you run any of the command that will go into the war log messages because let's say if

204
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:21.750
you run longer,

205
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:22.840
Dashti,

206
00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:28.610
her test entry are put in like Imron is testing and hit.

207
00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:33.280
Enter This entry is going into the war log messages.

208
00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.380
How do you verify it?

209
00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:36.150
You do tail minus five,

210
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:37.350
Warlock.

211
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:38.450
Us.

212
00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:39.850
You see,

213
00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:40.550
it's right here.

214
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:48.350
It is being recorded because longer tells it to record to know if I do the same thing again

215
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:48.350
.

216
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:59.450
I run the log till script and now I open up another terminal Come route.

217
00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:11.750
And here if I run that logger command and I will put in Imron is testing again and hit.

218
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:12.250
Enter.

219
00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:16.050
Sorry.

220
00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:26.900
Be exactly Log on,

221
00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:29.950
Ryan is testing better?

222
00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:31.260
Okay,

223
00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:31.900
you see,

224
00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:38.390
as soon as I ran this the lock tail also through the message on the screen And I'm sure it

225
00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:48.180
has also logged in to are this file cat I was hardly slash temps.

226
00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:48.970
I felt a message.

227
00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:50.250
So let's verified.

228
00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:52.090
You see,

229
00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:56.450
it has added that right here into our miss.

230
00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:58.630
So that's what happens every time.

231
00:11:58.630 --> 00:11:59.150
Ah,

232
00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:00.950
error message comes in,

233
00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:03.550
it will be log in here.

234
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:13.990
So if I also have its do our cat log tail If I do invalid So let's do longer instead of

235
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:16.750
error put in invalid,

236
00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:22.350
it's He picks up that Imron is testing invalid uh,

237
00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:28.890
key and her As soon as they hit enter,

238
00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:29.750
you see in the back.

239
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:39.930
It also listed that into our log messages and then you read the file file.

240
00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:40.850
Where is pushing it?

241
00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:42.550
Too clear.

242
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:49.720
You see,

243
00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:55.790
it has also added that to your slash temp session.

244
00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:57.760
Okay,

245
00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.510
Now you see one step is done.

246
00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:01.260
You have,

247
00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:01.950
Actually,

248
00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:04.650
if you notice right here,

249
00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:05.850
minimize this.

250
00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:09.240
You have actually created the script to trace log.

251
00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.960
You run the script in the background.

252
00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:11.990
Next step is now,

253
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.400
you see,

254
00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.250
on my prompt is not given me back stuff.

255
00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:16.060
Why?

256
00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.550
Because this script that I've written it is going in a loop,

257
00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:22.190
and it's not going to give me my prom back.

258
00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:25.950
So in order for me to run that script in the background,

259
00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:30.860
I would have to run the script with no help and m percent.

260
00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:31.760
So just do control,

261
00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:34.850
see out of it and hit up arrow key.

262
00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:40.640
And this time I'm gonna specify no meaning.

263
00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.590
Don't bother my terminal.

264
00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:51.350
Give me my terminal back log till and just put em person.

265
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:53.890
Why is that?

266
00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:55.360
No up and m percent?

267
00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.190
That's how it is.

268
00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:58.350
That's how you run the commands in the background.

269
00:13:58.350 --> 00:13:59.900
So you hit.

270
00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.850
Enter and,

271
00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:06.280
uh did it.

272
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:09.200
War Lord second,

273
00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:15.850
no log tail.

274
00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:18.150
10% and percent.

275
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:22.640
Yeah,

276
00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:22.970
Sorry.

277
00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:23.950
11 Empress's.

278
00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:25.340
Okay,

279
00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:27.700
So once you run,

280
00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:33.450
it could actually do PS minus F and graft for log tail.

281
00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:38.960
Your script and you will see it is running right you know,

282
00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:44.350
here's the running two scripts because it's one is it's reading.

283
00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:45.420
And second,

284
00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:49.850
it's putting into a file and gripping poor error messages and involved.

285
00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:53.550
So if you want to bring it to the foreground,

286
00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:59.420
I believe it's for around something that brings anyway.

287
00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.850
So whenever you run this script,

288
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:02.950
you have to run it.

289
00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:04.690
This command,

290
00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:07.670
no hub slash routes that Locke tail and percent,

291
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:08.950
and it will put it in the back.

292
00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:13.050
Next thing is right here we have user admin notification.

293
00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:13.790
Now,

294
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:14.450
what if,

295
00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:15.500
um,

296
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:22.550
it actually generates the file and put it into the user?

297
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:23.650
Ah,

298
00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:27.990
it actually throws that message to as user email.

299
00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:29.900
So for that,

300
00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:32.750
I believe I also have a script.

301
00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:34.250
Um,

302
00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:36.640
no,

303
00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:37.060
actually,

304
00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:37.650
I don't.

305
00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:39.980
I would have to create a new script,

306
00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:41.350
and I will name it.

307
00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:44.240
Uh,

308
00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.450
log alert.

309
00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:50.630
Um,

310
00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:51.670
before I do that,

311
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:54.540
let me copy that law tail to log.

312
00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:57.160
So this right?

313
00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.350
I have to type variable in description.

314
00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:01.300
B,

315
00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:05.040
I log alert description.

316
00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:17.840
This script will send an email to administrator Modified.

317
00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:18.160
OK,

318
00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.000
so now let's get rid off everything this favor.

319
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.650
You are typing back.

320
00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:25.240
First thing is,

321
00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:29.850
if you have multiple users that you wanted to send this log to,

322
00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:30.950
Um,

323
00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:33.440
instead of putting their email one by one,

324
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:37.820
you could put them in a very So the way I do it is I put in,

325
00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:39.660
like if your group name is,

326
00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:40.850
let's say I t.

327
00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:53.460
And now put coat and the email address Imron underscore envoy at hotmail dot com Comma,

328
00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:54.560
let's say,

329
00:16:54.560 --> 00:17:02.650
peter dot um says,

330
00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:09.270
uh gmail dot com coat close.

331
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:11.480
So I'm just picking to users right now.

332
00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.880
If you want to specify more than that,

333
00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:16.170
you just put comma and the email address.

334
00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:22.820
Another advantage of putting the emails in a container or in a variable is because if a

335
00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:26.980
user leaves the company are a new user joins the company,

336
00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:29.060
you don't have to modify your script.

337
00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:30.080
You could make a mistake.

338
00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.880
You could simply modify this.

339
00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:32.260
Very.

340
00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.180
Okay,

341
00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:36.770
so now are variable is defined.

342
00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:41.950
Now you put if statement it is always very strong,

343
00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:46.250
the next the newer option of picking is minus s.

344
00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:55.950
So what we're doing it minus s is slash temp filtered messages.

345
00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.740
What?

346
00:17:58.740 --> 00:17:59.790
What I'm saying is,

347
00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:00.290
first,

348
00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:01.900
make sure if that file exists,

349
00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:03.890
I don't want to send an empty file,

350
00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:04.220
right?

351
00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:05.870
If the file is there,

352
00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:07.160
then I wanted to send it.

353
00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:14.540
But for that let me make sure this is a crackpot Will see this Just script and just two ls

354
00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:14.860
minus.

355
00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:17.560
L Yes,

356
00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:18.050
it is.

357
00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:22.880
So the I lobular Okay,

358
00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.930
so if you find ah,

359
00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:28.160
file there in temp and file name is filtered messages,

360
00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:40.050
then you cat that file sordid,

361
00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:42.950
unique.

362
00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:49.450
Mail it to who?

363
00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:53.960
Smell it to I t.

364
00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:54.320
Right.

365
00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.760
But also put in some subject is,

366
00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:17.850
um cyst log messages and then send it to I removed this else.

367
00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:19.220
Don't do anything.

368
00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:20.660
Okay,

369
00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:21.820
Let me go.

370
00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:22.520
Worried again?

371
00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:23.360
I know.

372
00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:24.770
Probably typed it fast.

373
00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:25.560
Oven or fast.

374
00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:29.050
You probably don't know what I just did again.

375
00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:33.260
I specified the email address is put in a container.

376
00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:40.230
Then I drowned the command If and what if is doing is making sure this file exists Because

377
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:40.620
again,

378
00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:42.050
you don't want to send an empty fall.

379
00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:43.500
If it does exist,

380
00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:45.260
then what do you want to do?

381
00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:49.160
You want script to do is to cat that fall.

382
00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.090
Okay?

383
00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:51.940
Did cat then sorted?

384
00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:53.660
Why am I sorting it?

385
00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:56.160
Because I want to unique.

386
00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.150
All right.

387
00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:58.660
But why are you sneaking it?

388
00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:02.850
Because what happens if you have 10 messages?

389
00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:06.160
10 error messages that are the same one,

390
00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.280
Let's say error Jews,

391
00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.680
Or can a log in address music?

392
00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.540
Analog in hever using analog.

393
00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:19.100
You don't want to view the three repetitive same error messages you just wanted to know one

394
00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:19.500
time.

395
00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.350
So that's why I'm putting in sort.

396
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:23.440
So it will sort and unique it.

397
00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.380
Just give me one message and I wouldn't know.

398
00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:26.660
You'd have to tell me three times.

399
00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:27.580
Okay,

400
00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:28.560
So once you do that,

401
00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:29.850
then you mail it.

402
00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:33.350
Command for male is simple mail minus as for subject.

403
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:36.160
And the subject is going to say since log message,

404
00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:37.180
okay.

405
00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:39.850
And where is gonna go to is gonna go too.

406
00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:41.510
Dollar I t.

407
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:45.260
And whose daughter i t These are the people of dull Okay,

408
00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:46.060
art.

409
00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:48.060
And then once you're done sending it,

410
00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:49.350
then I want you to remove them.

411
00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:51.660
Why I really moving the file now?

412
00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:57.950
The reason of your removing that file because we do not want new messages coming in and

413
00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:59.780
adding it to the same messages.

414
00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:04.050
And then what will happen is we will get new messages as well as old messages.

415
00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:05.940
So that's why I'm removing death.

416
00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:06.160
Well,

417
00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:11.360
else do nothing if there is no file and of course,

418
00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:12.380
don't to anything.

419
00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:13.710
Don't send any other message.

420
00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:14.650
I don't even want to know.

421
00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:14.940
Hey,

422
00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:18.210
the file slash temp filter messages now created.

423
00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:18.930
You could do that,

424
00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:21.370
but you don't want to get that message every 15 minutes.

425
00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:24.170
If this script is running every 15 so basically,

426
00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:25.330
else and fee.

427
00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:27.600
And you had done again,

428
00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.530
If you run this script in your riel environment,

429
00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:32.240
you will start getting messages.

430
00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:33.660
I do not have,

431
00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:34.790
um,

432
00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:37.910
actual mail relay server,

433
00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:43.880
which is going to actually send out males outside to my lab environment.

434
00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:46.050
So I cannot test the script.

435
00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:47.170
But again,

436
00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:51.750
I have tested this script in my job in my previous jobs.

437
00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:55.380
And it works perfect art.

438
00:21:55.380 --> 00:22:01.660
Save it and change mod a plus x lobular.

439
00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:02.710
All right,

440
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:04.020
so now you you know,

441
00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:07.450
we have to script One is long tail.

442
00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:14.660
2nd 1 in Logar lock tail will continue running forever until you actually stop.

443
00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:22.550
Long alert will run on Lee when you want to view those messages and you want to send an e

444
00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:25.440
mo with those messages now,

445
00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:28.270
you could go into your machine every time in London.

446
00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:29.050
Run log alert.

447
00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:30.920
But again,

448
00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.010
it's our pilot attack.

449
00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:37.580
So the last thing we have to do it right here is scheduled the script through Cron job and

450
00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:39.320
to schedule the Scripture con job,

451
00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:40.360
I'm sure you know,

452
00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:46.420
you just have to type Cron tab minus e to edit it and you specify Let's say if you want to

453
00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:48.330
run this every 15 minutes,

454
00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:53.450
you'll do gastric slash 15 every day,

455
00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:58.940
every month and so and so slash root slash log.

456
00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:03.550
Oh,

457
00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:09.140
and this script is run every 15 course.

458
00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:11.780
I don't want to run it because this is my test environment.

459
00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:12.760
All just headed it,

460
00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:16.160
and I'll put it at comment out ofit.

461
00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:22.350
And this is how you create a central logging script?

462
00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:23.510
Um,

463
00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:25.910
it took me a while when I first created it,

464
00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:29.350
but eventually I read Re find it many times.

465
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:34.390
Now you have this script already done created for you.

466
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:36.490
I want you to create this script from scribe.

467
00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:40.760
Don't just copy mine from the text that I have a Tash with this lesson.

468
00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.550
This is just for your reference.

469
00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:47.300
If you skip something in my video than you could always go back to my text file and and

470
00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:47.660
look,

471
00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:48.350
look from there,

472
00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:52.570
otherwise tried everything from scratch and it will work.
