00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.020
However,

2
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.650
I have one.

3
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.640
This is a practice lab session.

4
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:08.540
So I'm going to create a script and what I'm going to use the exodus status.

5
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.220
So I'm in this location,

6
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.550
so I'm going to create a very simple script on it.

7
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.150
Okay,

8
00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.250
So what is my script?

9
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.710
I'm going to,

10
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.250
you know,

11
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.950
create a fine se I did with the script exited status.

12
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.650
I will come to know that whether my file has been kitted or not.

13
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.690
So let me care.

14
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.540
Then you will understand what I'm doing with the school.

15
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.300
So what they described.

16
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.050
I'm trying to,

17
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.380
you know,

18
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.550
here this file that is touch on,

19
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:46.950
uh,

20
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.230
time on every city file.

21
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.270
I'm going to get this one.

22
00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.070
See if this file has been created with this common.

23
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.130
Obviously the exit the status would be zero.

24
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.000
Now,

25
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.700
I'm going to use a condition here.

26
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.120
If this question mark,

27
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.100
this is to check the exit status,

28
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.750
right?

29
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.440
Is it cool to zero?

30
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:28.040
They then echo has been get it did successfully.

31
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:41.400
Else I go could not kid a fight.

32
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.160
So it's a very simple escaped have used.

33
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.610
So I'm making it executable.

34
00:01:49.610 --> 00:02:04.750
And I said getting in executing it final has been killed successfully,

35
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:05.590
right?

36
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.030
This time it is able to clear the file.

37
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.250
No,

38
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.060
I want to check the final evidence.

39
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.100
You don't know You can take with this every city.

40
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.110
I can see that the file has been killed.

41
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.360
Now,

42
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.580
Right now what I'm gonna do here,

43
00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:19.520
I'm just,

44
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.190
you know,

45
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.610
opening this file on Dhere.

46
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.420
I'm doing some mistake like this one are all right.

47
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.900
So this is I'm just,

48
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:31.370
you know,

49
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.250
tease the common touch Now have used C.

50
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.890
You see,

51
00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:36.840
there's a type of mistake.

52
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.020
Now again,

53
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.670
I'm fighting this.

54
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.920
Come on,

55
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:40.480
let's see.

56
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.980
Could not find this common.

57
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.220
So could not create a file,

58
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.950
because this is her here.

59
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.660
And also,

60
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:48.150
you know,

61
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.720
let me do one thing.

62
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.990
Some more changes in that five.

63
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.550
Suppose you know,

64
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.600
touch on here.

65
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.400
I'm trying to do that.

66
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.720
Isn't rude location,

67
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.140
right?

68
00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.200
Other than your location.

69
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:08.520
Now I'm sitting from who use it to a normal user.

70
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.360
Right?

71
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.300
So I'm going into this location 10.

72
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.650
What?

73
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.700
So my skin was this one?

74
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.280
No,

75
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.170
I'm tryingto execute this script by a normal user on.

76
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.740
We know that normally that doesn't have the permission to create a filing root directory.

77
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:26.470
Right?

78
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.840
So let's see whether what are what I'm getting.

79
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.950
So here the permission denied.

80
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.760
Enter and output also here you can see that could not get a fine.

81
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:43.260
So if you want to see if you don't want to see this you know you can do one thing you can

82
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.870
nullify years.

83
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:44.030
Well,

84
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.720
let me show you.

85
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.440
So this is my exit on it.

86
00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:58.800
So this will whatever the other while executing this comer,

87
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.230
it will nullify so to,

88
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.720
you know,

89
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.550
get a sign.

90
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.760
Now again,

91
00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:16.500
I am sitting with normal user temp on this on a visit Could not create a file.

92
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.180
So I believe you're getting something better now What I have don't have you.

93
00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.600
Simple.

94
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.800
You know you know this direction channels That is too great a sign.

95
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.730
So whatever the others we have while learning the you know that Come on,

96
00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.270
that will you nullify you want You won't see that in the ice cream you will see only the

97
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.160
useful output.

98
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:40.280
The useful all sport is that could not create a fine right now the same thing the same is

99
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.580
kept.

100
00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.350
I'm going to explode with rule user.

101
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.770
The file has been getting successfully.

102
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.270
So there's a simple script.

103
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.880
I have credit.

104
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.150
Thank you.

105
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.030
So when did some for the selected?

106
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.680
We'll do one more practice,

107
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.970
one more lap station using the exit status.

108
00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.880
So thanks for watching well to in the next week.
