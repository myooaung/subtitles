00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680
how everyone in this lecture will see about what is Atlantic shell.

2
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.670
So that's also important topic to understand.

3
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.450
Let's continue.

4
00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.780
In the early days off,

5
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.700
computing instructions were provided using boundary language.

6
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.280
What is banned the language computer.

7
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:28.160
Understand the language off zeros and ones that is known as bandy language,

8
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.760
which is difficult for all of us to read and write.

9
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.760
Therefore,

10
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.430
in an operating system,

11
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:45.670
there is a special program called Shell A Shell provides you with an interferes toe,

12
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.550
the UNIX or Linux based operating system.

13
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.950
It gathers input from you on execute programmes based on that input.

14
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.110
And when a program finishes executing,

15
00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:05.050
it displays that programs output in simple words.

16
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.300
If you want to interact with the operating system,

17
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.650
you need some medium.

18
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.600
On that medium is call you shell.

19
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.340
So what?

20
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.410
I want to you know,

21
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.410
London.

22
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.930
Come on,

23
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.490
I want to,

24
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.730
you know,

25
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.150
execute some program.

26
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.050
We cannot directly you know,

27
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:36.160
talkto the Lennox cardamom because Linus couple understand Bandy language only so how the

28
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.810
users can interact with the Lennox got moved with the help of Shell.

29
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.820
That is your medium.

30
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.410
You can talk to your Lennox Gardens,

31
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:57.200
the shell except human readable commons and just leave them into something the colonel can

32
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.550
lead in process.

33
00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:06.250
Let me take you into my blackboard on and draw a simple tagged him so that he can

34
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.140
understand what is shown.

35
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.690
So you want to complicate,

36
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.860
Really?

37
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:12.290
You know,

38
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.750
Lennox operating system or any operating system.

39
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.830
So the main component off on operating system is your colonel.

40
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.460
So I'm just taking the example off,

41
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.700
you know,

42
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.850
Lennox operating system.

43
00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:31.400
So the main component we have this is your Lennox.

44
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.670
Come in.

45
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.650
Right on.

46
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.730
You have a stole Lennox,

47
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.360
What?

48
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.700
To some,

49
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.180
you know,

50
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.200
physical box.

51
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.090
So obviously there will be some,

52
00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.320
you know,

53
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.580
computer hardware as well.

54
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.830
So we have this hardware.

55
00:02:49.830 --> 00:03:17.250
So let Mrs Mannix colonel is responsible to managing the computer hardware as well.

56
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.550
No,

57
00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.500
there is some user.

58
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.770
They have somebody because,

59
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:23.090
like,

60
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.930
user request,

61
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:24.400
we can see.

62
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.720
Do you want to,

63
00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.930
you know,

64
00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:30.810
type some things.

65
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.570
Some program so they cannot tell directly.

66
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.110
Talk to the Atlantis camel.

67
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.350
They need some medium.

68
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.850
So that medium is your shell here.

69
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:45.320
So user will not directly talk to the Linus can.

70
00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.390
They will talk to Linus.

71
00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.150
Colonel wire shell late.

72
00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.070
Suppose we have some application.

73
00:03:54.070 --> 00:04:00.690
Andi and we have seen that once we have install an application,

74
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.200
it is running at the back end.

75
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.320
So application,

76
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.180
they have their in billions shell.

77
00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.490
They can talk directly to the planning on getting design out.

78
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.870
So I believe with this small and simple diagram,

79
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.450
you understand?

80
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.410
What is Atlantic Shell all about?

81
00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.930
So,

82
00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:21.310
basically,

83
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.160
the shell is a user program.

84
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.850
We can see that,

85
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.960
or it is a coolant.

86
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.910
Or we can say it is an environment provided for user injection.

87
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.590
Begin to that right.

88
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:34.210
And,

89
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.570
you know,

90
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.040
once you log into the box,

91
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.930
you will get the shell.

92
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.460
The shell gets it started when you log in or open the console.

93
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:47.730
And I so from the cell for this lecture in the next lecture,

94
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.560
I will tell you the several cells that are of level for Lennox.

95
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.040
So thanks for watching.

96
00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.150
And if you have time,

97
00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.450
please join with me in the next lecture.
