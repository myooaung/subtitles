00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.700
script file permissions.

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:03.880
Now,

3
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:09.330
this is not just theoretical or concept or standard that I'm trying to explain it to you.

4
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.360
This is actually mandatory.

5
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:21.580
You need to have the right permission to execute a script and to and to have a proper

6
00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.150
permissions on the script file itself.

7
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.450
So all scripts to be executed should have a proper execute.

8
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.010
Herbal file permissions.

9
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.050
And those are,

10
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.080
for example,

11
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.400
if you see here it's read,

12
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.370
write and X is for execute herbal meaning the route.

13
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.850
The person who created this group can execute it.

14
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:50.370
Then read Dash X meaning the group who belongs to the user or the user belongs to a group,

15
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:57.000
has a right to read and execute this crew and the last one are the other people who do not

16
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.250
belong to your group or there are not you.

17
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.670
They could also execute that script and read it.

18
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.300
But of course they cannot write it because you don't see that w and W in the middle of

19
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.600
group and others.

20
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.390
So every time you create a script,

21
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.050
you need to assigned the execute herbal permission.

22
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.230
Okay,

23
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.450
so now you're probably thinking,

24
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.450
haven I create a script?

25
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.610
Why can't it.

26
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.710
Get a signed by default.

27
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.750
Executed permission Question.

28
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.330
But the problem is that whenever you create a script in Lennox or whenever you create ah,

29
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.970
file,

30
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.410
I should say in Lenox,

31
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:33.510
by default,

32
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:39.150
it does not assign execute herbal permissions because it doesn't want you to make a mistake

33
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.450
and executed something by mistake and corrupt your file system.

34
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.080
That's why it doesn't give the executable permissions.

35
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.050
You have to sign them yourself.

36
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.350
Okay,

37
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.050
now,

38
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.410
I created a script.

39
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.610
Now,

40
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.760
how do you change the permissions?

41
00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:02.170
Simply the command to change the permission is CH model A plus X and the name of the script

42
00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.170
.

43
00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.140
A stands for all.

44
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.440
Everybody should have executed Bill permission off the script I use.

45
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.310
I prefer,

46
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.970
um,

47
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.520
letters as a our,

48
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.060
um,

49
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.820
g or Oh,

50
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.820
for user group and others.

51
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.280
There are other people,

52
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.690
or you probably are familiar with the digits as well.

53
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.420
Like 65567 Something like that.

54
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.780
Which I I I'm not too much familiar.

55
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.310
I try to follow something that I am very familiar with,

56
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.750
and I would like to teach you something that I know.

57
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.920
Anyway,

58
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.650
if you are comfortable with your own way of saying Permission,

59
00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.180
be my guest.

60
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.390
You feel free to use that Now let's some see.

61
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.950
If I log into my machine and I create a script,

62
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.860
then how can we change permission?

63
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:51.870
So let's see.

64
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.180
Where is my Lennox machine?

65
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.650
My Lennox machine is right here,

66
00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:01.550
and I am in my slash home slash I have solved slash script directory.

67
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:08.470
I wanted to create a script and there are few ways you could create a file first.

68
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.750
You always create a file.

69
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:10.870
You could touch it.

70
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.900
You could be I it and you could echo it and output to a file The different boys,

71
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.750
whichever way you want to start creating a scrip.

72
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:25.770
So first thing I will use a very basic is touch And the name of the script.

73
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:33.550
Let's say script name is a party script had entered.

74
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:34.980
Now when I do,

75
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.120
at S minus lt are you'll notice the script that I had before.

76
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.430
Hello.

77
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.310
World has the execute herbal permission,

78
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.700
right?

79
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.150
This is the third but you see your way here.

80
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.500
The new script that I created which is Apache script,

81
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.810
does not have the execute herbal permission.

82
00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.940
So in order for you to run that script you need to assign execute herbal permission to

83
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.150
assign the permission.

84
00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.640
You have to run the command change marred as I said,

85
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.740
I'll use for all.

86
00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:13.160
Everybody should have executed Herbal plus X for execute Herbal The name off the scrip hit

87
00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.160
.

88
00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:21.460
Enter now duelist minor sell to your You will see the name off the script and it's correct

89
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.460
.

90
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:22.150
Permission.

91
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.650
This is how you assigned permission?

92
00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.530
Very easy to do that.

93
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.000
If you're already in Lenox,

94
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.250
you've been using Lennox.

95
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.390
You probably like ho.

96
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:31.080
I know that.

97
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.450
Perfect.

98
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:32.950
If you know that,

99
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.150
let's move on.
