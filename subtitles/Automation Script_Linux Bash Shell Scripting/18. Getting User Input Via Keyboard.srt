1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,240
how everyone It looks like they will understand about users Input wire,

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:05,810
keyboard.

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:08,110
So basically,

4
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:09,150
we have a command read.

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,500
Come on on.

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,100
With the help of read common,

7
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:18,150
you can take an input from the keyboard on a sign that input into a user defined very

8
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,990
better money times.

9
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:20,310
You know,

10
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,370
when you run the script,

11
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,460
you need some input from the users.

12
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,780
So with the help of read,

13
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:27,190
come on.

14
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,470
You can take those inputs and put it in a variable.

15
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:33,650
So here we have the syntax,

16
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:34,460
like read hyphen.

17
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,420
B prompt these variables.

18
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:36,900
Name like,

19
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,250
credible 123 on and number of variables you can give.

20
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,520
And you have to give the,

21
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:48,090
you know name the inputs on it is going to save into the variables that you have defined.

22
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,740
So,

23
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,450
like we do want,

24
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:50,900
you know,

25
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,650
a script for you so that you can understand how we can use the,

26
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:53,890
you know,

27
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:54,460
read common.

28
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,620
So I'm going to create a very simple escape.

29
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,250
Okay,

30
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,430
so in this case,

31
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:00,790
you know,

32
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,220
it is it will last for you,

33
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:02,700
you know,

34
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,400
to enter your name or anything.

35
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,600
Okay.

36
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,120
Read hyphen.

37
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:20,730
P on until you're full name for that I'm defining any name,

38
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:21,870
not his name.

39
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,190
You can give any name.

40
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:25,540
So that is basically you available Name?

41
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:29,670
So whatever you're going to try like I'm tapping Shaker Boerma So she cover my eyes.

42
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,650
Going to say Vinto viable?

43
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:32,450
That his name?

44
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:42,670
I said that just your good name is dollar name.

45
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,440
You could give any name like I'm giving this one.

46
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,150
You're confusing Continued.

47
00:01:50,150 --> 00:02:05,140
Okay,

48
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,230
let me make it executed.

49
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:13,220
I'm going to and execute this one until your full name.

50
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,920
Good day,

51
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,400
Michigan.

52
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:18,700
Warmer.

53
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:26,060
So here you can understand that it is asking an input from you and you have provided in

54
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,870
footwear keyboard.

55
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,090
Okay,

56
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,950
so that kid one motor script for you.

57
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:38,750
Okay,

58
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:46,770
so So this group basically no addition off two numbers.

59
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:52,610
So the numbers that you have to provide the user has to provide the number on the is kept

60
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:52,880
will,

61
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,420
you know,

62
00:02:53,420 --> 00:03:04,070
do the sum of both the numbers and you will get an output read hyphen B and to first number

63
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:04,070
.

64
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:09,190
Okay.

65
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,760
On the vegetable name.

66
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,420
I'm giving effort.

67
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:20,350
You could give any name and to second number.

68
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:24,160
I'm giving essence second number.

69
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,250
That s for a second.

70
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,070
And then I need to use some,

71
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:28,530
you know,

72
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:31,100
calculation here.

73
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,570
That is some expression I'm going to use.

74
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:39,880
That is dollar fn plus dollar s.

75
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,250
And that is my second number.

76
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:54,280
Echo some off your and that number is dollars.

77
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,350
Okay.

78
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,760
And if you want to delay,

79
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,580
I can put sleep here for two seconds.

80
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,630
You want that?

81
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,050
It should also delay for some more time.

82
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,280
And I put it on,

83
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:09,830
put like,

84
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:13,680
five so that even think that something is going on.

85
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,870
Some calculation is doing.

86
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,450
Otherwise you will get an output immediately.

87
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:21,210
So I'm just making it was a good different.

88
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:28,560
Now let's see under the first number,

89
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:38,630
I'm giving this 13 50 and the second number I'm giving 4 50 It will be for five seconds

90
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,050
because I have used a common sleep.

91
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,350
Some off your enter number is 800.

92
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,330
So there.

93
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,070
So you know,

94
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,850
simple scripts are half culture that the help of,

95
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:50,330
you know,

96
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:50,800
read.

97
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,350
Come on.

98
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:55,190
So you can see that users has given their imports wine keyboard.

99
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:58,540
So friend herself for this lecture.

100
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,570
We'll see the next lecture.

101
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:00,500
But thank you.
