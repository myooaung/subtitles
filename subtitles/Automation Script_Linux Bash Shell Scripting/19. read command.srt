00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,040
Hello,

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:01,770
everyone.

3
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:04,820
Let's continue and do some more practice using did.

4
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:05,250
Come on.

5
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,640
So I'm going to you know,

6
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,030
Kate,

7
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:08,050
one more escape,

8
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,950
that is Adidas is a CIA T dog message.

9
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:15,460
So a few things we forget to discuss in the last lecture.

10
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:16,500
So let me do it.

11
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,720
Okay.

12
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,220
So,

13
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:22,570
you know,

14
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:28,380
if you want to delay off your and in port suppose you want to have some input for the users

15
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:28,380
.

16
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,850
But user is taking a lot of time,

17
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:33,110
so you can specify the time out.

18
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:33,340
Well,

19
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:33,820
you as well,

20
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,670
like read hyphen.

21
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,080
D w have defined,

22
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,650
but,

23
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:40,750
you know,

24
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:45,900
five seconds on the hyphen,

25
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:52,150
p for that again and first number.

26
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,350
Okay.

27
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,440
Read hyphen.

28
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,500
T for a five to be.

29
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:13,750
And this is a first number.

30
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,150
It's again number.

31
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:33,940
This is my first I was asking Do we know until your first number?

32
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,330
If I'm dealing for some time?

33
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:36,800
Let's see.

34
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:41,110
I can see that how this is kept has buried for only five seconds.

35
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,270
If you have no supply,

36
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,660
I think you can see that it has moved to the next variable.

37
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,550
So one thing second thing is also here.

38
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,150
What kid?

39
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,930
One more descriptive CR four or less.

40
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:57,200
Okay.

41
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:57,910
Several.

42
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:58,120
You know,

43
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,730
you have to.

44
00:01:58,730 --> 00:01:59,730
Sometimes you have to,

45
00:01:59,730 --> 00:01:59,970
you know,

46
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:00,870
enter something.

47
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,180
But you want to,

48
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:02,590
you know,

49
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,250
hide that is on the screen,

50
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,900
Like suppose you want to enter the past passport from the users.

51
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,290
But you want that?

52
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:17,650
It should be hide so you can use hyphen ass option like the five on s hyphen P right.

53
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,390
And to the bus.

54
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,520
But okay,

55
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,850
we're gonna put honey,

56
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,790
you know well out of it.

57
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:48,850
Okay?

58
00:02:48,850 --> 00:03:00,320
No,

59
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,420
it is asking for the password.

60
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,360
I'm giving any passport.

61
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,260
I can see that I'm tapping the passport,

62
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:05,930
but actually,

63
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,170
it is not showing there.

64
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,450
Okay,

65
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,430
so this way you can,

66
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:12,950
you know,

67
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:20,150
hide the input from the users I get when that cell for this lecture will see in the next

68
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:20,420
decade.
