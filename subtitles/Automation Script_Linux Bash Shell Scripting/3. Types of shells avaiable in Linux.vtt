ï»¿1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.050
how everyone.

2
00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:03.850
So let's continue.

3
00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.850
In the previous lecture,

4
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.790
we got an idea about what Islamic Shell Shell is.

5
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:20.430
A interpreter that executes commands leaves from the standard input device,

6
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.370
such as key would or from a file.

7
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.630
So basically,

8
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:26.970
it's a interpreter.

9
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.250
Now you have got a shell.

10
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.690
If you want to communicate with you,

11
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:32.180
Colonel,

12
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.060
you need to type some.

13
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.530
Come on,

14
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.750
you can simply type of single Come on.

15
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.530
Or if you have a list of commands,

16
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:49.380
then you can put those commands in a file on Execute that file and I the shell Get this

17
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.580
taught it when you log in or open a console.

18
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.140
Various shelter off level for landings,

19
00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.670
as shown below.

20
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:07.100
The most important is your best shell born again shell.

21
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.320
Most common shell in Lenox.

22
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.900
It's an open source,

23
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.070
or we can say it's a default shell as well.

24
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.640
The next is your she shell.

25
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.680
The sea shells in Texas on uses are very similar to the C programming language,

26
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.530
so basically it is for application users who is walking on C language like they're

27
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.140
developing DCC or the lip on your system Linus operating system.

28
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.430
The change there,

29
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.960
you know,

30
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.250
before shell from bastard seashell.

31
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.670
Every cell has its own properties.

32
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.000
The next one is a geisha that is a con shell.

33
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.570
It was created by David Corn at Arian de BellSouth.

34
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.290
The corn shell was also the base for the Bush action.

35
00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.810
So if you'll see an operating system that is HP UNIX,

36
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.250
they're before Shell is your posh section or seashells.

37
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.350
The next one is a D.

38
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.730
C.

39
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:14.220
Sell.

40
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.240
It is an ass,

41
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.910
but come completely compatible.

42
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.430
Wasn't off the Barkley UNIX.

43
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.240
That is seashell.

44
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.960
So different shells we have available under Atlantis operating system.

45
00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.370
So whatever you want,

46
00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.160
you can use it.

47
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.520
That is up to you.

48
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.450
But before one is your best shell,

49
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.240
there are various ways to get the shell access.

50
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.670
No,

51
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.450
I'm a user.

52
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.310
I want to,

53
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.850
you know,

54
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.370
communicate or interact with.

55
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.880
You know,

56
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.150
my Landis operating system.

57
00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.850
We know that we need a medium.

58
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.020
We need an interpreter.

59
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.760
That interpreter is shell.

60
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.660
But how to get the sham So they have various views to get the shower.

61
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.440
The most important on common is connect wire sick yourself.

62
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.660
That is a message.

63
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:13.840
So he should have put the software with the help of POTUS software you can log in to the

64
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.850
any of the box.

65
00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.230
What did you do?

66
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.580
Supply?

67
00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:24.510
You need to supply the name of the sewer or i B once it will put connect R.

68
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:25.150
Okay,

69
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.690
it will go to the server,

70
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.930
and then you have to supply the user name and password once or something like that.

71
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.140
Cutting credentials,

72
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.760
you'll get the shell.

73
00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.080
And after that,

74
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.330
you can interact with your Lennox,

75
00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.730
Carmen,

76
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.200
other ways your terminal or console s well.

77
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.290
So this is my Lennox operating system on here.

78
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.420
You can see that I have already logged into my Lennox operating system that is actually

79
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.460
using party.

80
00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.170
So let me show you again.

81
00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.840
I've taken a new section here.

82
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.650
I need to put the host name or i p address.

83
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.810
So I'm just typing that.

84
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:04.450
Beatrice,

85
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:05.570
this one,

86
00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.850
this is idea this off my line X operating system already is asking for the user name.

87
00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.490
I have tied the user route.

88
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.410
If you have some different user,

89
00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.020
you can type a different user.

90
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:21.030
I have given the password as well.

91
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.780
Now I have loved into the box.

92
00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.030
They So this is a cell.

93
00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.660
We can say that we have got in here.

94
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:33.450
If you want to find what All of little shells in your system.

95
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:34.520
So simple.

96
00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.330
Five This Come on.

97
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.990
So these are the cells of level on your land,

98
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.980
its operating system.

99
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:50.490
And if you want to check what is your before shell you have and you need to fight like this

100
00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.640
one.

101
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:56.580
Like you want to know that I have learned to this box What's what shall I got now?

102
00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.450
So my shell is you know,

103
00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:59.530
this one best shell.

104
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.250
You can also fired this.

105
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.670
Come on.

106
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.740
This committee also will tell you you have logged in with the box.

107
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:06.660
Obviously,

108
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.250
there would be a process that has been kitted for you shall as well.

109
00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.680
If somebody will kill this process.

110
00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.970
3855 What will happen?

111
00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.950
Your session will be terminated,

112
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:17.780
right?

113
00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.780
If I'm from another,

114
00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:20.130
you know,

115
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.950
participation.

116
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.170
And if I'm going to kill this one,

117
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:29.610
you'll see that my session will be going out.

118
00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.450
So with this come on,

119
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:32.780
that is Bs.

120
00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.390
Dela dela.

121
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:41.900
It will tell you that you have in order into the box and God this shell and the process

122
00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.830
idea off your Shelly's your to it.

123
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:45.110
Five.

124
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.720
Here it could be different for your as well.

125
00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:53.430
So I'm displacing control.

126
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.110
L so basically full press control.

127
00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.450
It will clear the screen.

128
00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.140
All right,

129
00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.710
now,

130
00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:00.830
this is the you know,

131
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.310
and I have got We can say this is a shell I have got.

132
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.330
Now I want to type some Come on.

133
00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:07.630
Like I wonder type did.

134
00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:08.030
Come on.

135
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.020
So basically what happened in the back end?

136
00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.090
As a user,

137
00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.330
road users have logged,

138
00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:14.310
and I have got the shell.

139
00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.810
I want to get the time off the system,

140
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:23.380
so have simply fired Did come on so daily that come on which is already defining your

141
00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:24.610
Landis operating system.

142
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.340
So if you want to see a simple five,

143
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:34.630
this one So this is the program which has been created for the debt.

144
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:35.050
Come on.

145
00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:36.320
All right,

146
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.890
So if you have fighting did come on.

147
00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:39.740
So at the back.

148
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:47.020
And this problem has been initiated on this program is going to your camel like I want to

149
00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:51.280
know the date on colonel isn't spawning back like this is a car indeed.

150
00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.080
Right.

151
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.620
But as a user,

152
00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.040
there where I need to fire this did come on.

153
00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:04.450
Obviously on shall only right.

154
00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:06.200
This is one thing.

155
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:10.820
Another thing is that if you want to get more knowledge about any come on,

156
00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.800
you can use the help as well.

157
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:17.950
So getting helping Lennox like you want to check the manuals for any common you can like,

158
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:18.350
man.

159
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.140
Any common like up time,

160
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.540
you can no stop.

161
00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.030
Time is basically it.

162
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:24.970
Tell how long the system has been running.

163
00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:28.770
Suppose there is a common you do not know about it.

164
00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:31.150
So you can simple use.

165
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:31.560
Man,

166
00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.800
that is Manuel on type this.

167
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:38.230
You can also use the info documentation as well.

168
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:40.580
So in for a commendation is also available.

169
00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:44.370
Okay,

170
00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:51.850
You can also like you like this year's been updated up time.

171
00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:52.990
Hi,

172
00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:59.320
Senneff and hope so it will tell you what all options we have like there is a command it

173
00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.380
Come on on.

174
00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:01.170
We did Come on.

175
00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:03.080
You can also use some more options.

176
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.890
Right?

177
00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:07.770
So this is a basic idea.

178
00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:11.200
Like what we shall all about Andi from the cell,

179
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.450
how you can type come ons.

180
00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:18.520
There is another Come on PWD which tells your present working directory.

181
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.020
If I'm going to change my directory from,

182
00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:21.440
you know,

183
00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.520
less room temp again.

184
00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.200
If I'm going to fire people agree,
