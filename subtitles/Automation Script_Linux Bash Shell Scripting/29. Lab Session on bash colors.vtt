00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640
how everyone?

2
00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.580
So this is a practice lab session for best color.

3
00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.950
So I'm going to use eco.

4
00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:13.950
How funny is to enable the interpretation off backs less escapes and then I can use this

5
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.550
Backslash this one.

6
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.790
I want tohave color.

7
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:18.630
Right.

8
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.830
So to start the killer,

9
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:20.920
we have this option.

10
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.230
This one here you can see in this index,

11
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.820
right?

12
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.880
And after that differently.

13
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.030
No policy Have simple They warn,

14
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.180
you know,

15
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.700
31 in the foreground.

16
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.790
That is red color.

17
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.370
So I'm putting there on after that you have to put em at the end and then you can type

18
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.800
anything like Hello.

19
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.890
How are you?

20
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:56.340
They so that would be in Red club on how close this home you have to puts less E That is my

21
00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.160
scribe record zero Um that's all you can see.

22
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.140
The output is in red color,

23
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.910
I think on if you want to have,

24
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:06.520
you know,

25
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.920
some different colors.

26
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.820
Like I want to have green.

27
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:10.600
Green is Toledo.

28
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.850
So I can put Teddy to here.

29
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.330
So whatever color you want,

30
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.920
you can put it.

31
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.740
Blue is 34.

32
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:27.030
All right now you want to have the ground caressing that is this one back.

33
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.070
I want both.

34
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.540
So that is how we can use.

35
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.120
So I want blue.

36
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.200
That is for the four grown on for background.

37
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:43.200
I warn toe this red 1 41 So you have to use like this way 34.

38
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.440
That is for my you know,

39
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.270
foregone.

40
00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:53.530
First you have to mention that for gone and then this one that growing I'm putting 41 So

41
00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:05.680
you have to use a comma 41 And I think it's semi gonna your semi gonna I can see the

42
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.030
airport.

43
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.650
It's not looking good.

44
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.020
So I put some of the color here.

45
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:22.430
I'm putting this one My this background 41 is not looks Let me put it green for you now It

46
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.150
looks good now.

47
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.570
So it is up to you in a what color you are choosing.

48
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:33.080
So this bacon put the colors apart from that you can post like some underlying characters

49
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.560
as well.

50
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.250
If you want to have the underline that I can put like this way for underline that is for um

51
00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.700
So you put four.

52
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.090
I'm here.

53
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.520
I can see that it is coming as a four hour.

54
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.020
So let me try to put all off.

55
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.860
