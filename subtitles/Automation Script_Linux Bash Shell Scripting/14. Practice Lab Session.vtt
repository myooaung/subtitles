00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Hello,

2
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:01.850
everyone.

3
00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:05.600
So let's continue and do some more practice on variables.

4
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.730
So the last few electors,

5
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:13.150
we got a basic idea about the variables on their types and also did some practice as well.

6
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.230
So let's do some more practice.

7
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.450
So to define available we have the command like I have.

8
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.050
ABC is a name of variable.

9
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.350
I can give any names,

10
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.450
like is on.

11
00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.910
So if I want to see the value of this variable,

12
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.910
I have to use a dollar ABC.

13
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.840
So I'm getting a new output.

14
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.600
Like what?

15
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.640
Variable half what you know.

16
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.340
Well,

17
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.810
you have given to that variable that is ABC I can give any other names for like same as

18
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:44.030
well.

19
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.540
I can change the really off my ABC.

20
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.720
That's why it is called terrible.

21
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.740
I'm getting it under different A.

22
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.330
So here I have defined a B.

23
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.980
C's.

24
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:55.750
Sam.

25
00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.350
Suppose I'm fighting this one Echo dollar Embassy.

26
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.470
I offer that support after I'm stop something like B E f.

27
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.240
So will I get to the value off Donald ABC.

28
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.840
This one.

29
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.040
So the answer is no,

30
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.000
because here it will be looking for available limp,

31
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.940
whose is whose name is a B c D E f.

32
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.140
So there is no such variable defined on your system.

33
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.750
That's why you're not getting an output.

34
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.790
So the solution for that support if you want oh,

35
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:31.640
you know,

36
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.770
defined,

37
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.330
available and I want to add few characters after that that I have to use,

38
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.470
like this way I will see that you have God than output.

39
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.700
So ABC is available.

40
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.660
Whose values Sam on B B F is just like you know,

41
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:53.470
any correct as we can see that which has been added into the variable ABC.

42
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.530
Sam is the belly off my wearable EVC on.

43
00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.890
After that,

44
00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.930
you can see that three characters have been added.

45
00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:59.810
That is D e a.

46
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.040
So that a simple thing that we have to,

47
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.190
you know,

48
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.850
take care.

49
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.830
The next topic is,

50
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:06.270
you know,

51
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.110
default shell variables.

52
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:09.590
Well,

53
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.290
you So you can said that the four shell variable as well.

54
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.670
So in that case,

55
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.940
you know,

56
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.910
you can use the common like suppose you know I want to,

57
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:19.450
you know,

58
00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.240
define some values,

59
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:28.110
toe my valuables so I can use echo on Did this one.

60
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.140
So that's what you're testing topic here.

61
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:38.370
So suppose my variable in is hello.

62
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.770
I have given available in his house.

63
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:46.180
I want to define two values to that variable like zone on Sam.

64
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.860
So this one,

65
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:50.730
Right?

66
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.550
So this is what will happen.

67
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.480
The variable.

68
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.380
Hello?

69
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.800
Which is undefined as off?

70
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.980
No,

71
00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.040
there is nothing in the Hello.

72
00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.870
I'm coming back.

73
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.570
I'm showing with this.

74
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.890
Hello.

75
00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.390
So I'm not getting an output.

76
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.090
It means that my hello variable is undefined variable,

77
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.620
which which has nothing has off.

78
00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.130
Now if I am going to five this Come on,

79
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.190
this one I call.

80
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.170
So what will happen?

81
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.910
This level will be having available right?

82
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.080
Whose values?

83
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.900
John s place.

84
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:21.350
Sam,

85
00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:22.890
You can also,

86
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:23.110
you know,

87
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.320
define with this way as well.

88
00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.600
So both are correct.

89
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.240
So both are correct that he can do this one of this one as well.

90
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.420
I'm going to do Echo Dollar.

91
00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.350
Hello.

92
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.510
So I'm getting on output.

93
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.290
That is that my hello is available Limb?

94
00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.650
Whose value is Jonah Space?

95
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:45.050
Sam.

96
00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.290
Right.

97
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.960
So this is you know,

98
00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.960
the default shall very rules have been defined.

99
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.770
So if you want to change this one civil,

100
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:53.900
I want to change this one.

101
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.150
Sam on here.

102
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.420
I'm giving some other name like Ali.

103
00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.320
So we'll be change.

104
00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.910
No,

105
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.350
it is not going to be changed.

106
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:10.820
So this come on will only change the variable which is undefined only so as off.

107
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:11.090
No,

108
00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.930
my this hello is already defined,

109
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:13.780
which is having some you know,

110
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:14.900
default very wells.

111
00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.030
So if you want to change with this command,

112
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.700
it is not going to change it.

113
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:18.900
Still,

114
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:19.950
it is showing the same.

115
00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.200
Okay,

116
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.590
so in that case,

117
00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:25.570
if you want to change it first,

118
00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:26.430
you need toe unsaid.

119
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.880
This one,

120
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.960
it is that you have to make it nullify.

121
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.000
You have tow undefined this variable.

122
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.500
So how we can do that is come on,

123
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.210
Sunset Dollar on.

124
00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.640
Hello.

125
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.030
Now,

126
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.880
this has been unset getting family so far This so it leaves unsaid this one.

127
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.650
Okay.

128
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:45.810
And again,

129
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:46.620
if you will go far,

130
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.180
this one,

131
00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.370
I could already or you're not supposed to get any output because this very well has now

132
00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.330
undefined valuable,

133
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.460
which is having no Volusia talk.

134
00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.320
Now again,

135
00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.640
if I'm going to fire this Come on.

136
00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.740
No,

137
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.650
This is going to be set now.

138
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.160
I can see that my variable has been set up now.

139
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.880
So this is one thing.

140
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.350
No.

141
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.650
Let's understand one more thing.

142
00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.730
So these are the basic things which we need to winnow.

143
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.050
Learn on this time.

144
00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.290
So that is an importance index.

145
00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.150
This one that is colon.

146
00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.310
Is it going to?

147
00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.760
And manuscripts?

148
00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.270
You will see such Centex.

149
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.550
And it's very useful when you will be doing you know,

150
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:28.980
the biggest Crips.

151
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:34.270
Then you will see the at one day off this ino Centex toward this in textiles.

152
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.320
So this in text tells that if there is a very bill,

153
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.550
right,

154
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.250
I'm that variable is empty,

155
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.210
which doesn't have any value.

156
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.690
Then you're gonna sign it before,

157
00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:45.060
will you?

158
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.600
All right,

159
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.270
so let me do it for you.

160
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.490
Suppose you know I have to find out what it was like.

161
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:59.210
This one school is a cultural.

162
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:05.150
I'm giving a name off any school like DPS Noida.

163
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.050
Okay,

164
00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:12.540
so I have defined by school is available limb on its values.

165
00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:13.450
DPS murder.

166
00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:14.750
Okay,

167
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:15.910
No,

168
00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:16.930
I'm going toe.

169
00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.470
Use the same index.

170
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.700
This is dollar Onder.

171
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:26.670
This is my colleague Beckett on did school.

172
00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:30.290
This colon is acquittal.

173
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.880
Amity.

174
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.590
So what does it mean?

175
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:40.350
It means that it is going toe set the value of this variable school to amity.

176
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:41.910
But there's one condition.

177
00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:49.330
This condition condition is that it is going to set the very well toe amity,

178
00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:54.950
the value off this school to amity Onley if that variable is undefined or empty.

179
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:56.890
But here it is not empty.

180
00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:58.780
You can see that that is cool.

181
00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.270
Variable is already having,

182
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:00.530
you know,

183
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:01.750
some content.

184
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:02.940
So if I'm going to,

185
00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.020
you know,

186
00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:09.410
and this you will see that you have got an output in which it doesn't change it.

187
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.740
It's still a destroying the DPS murder.

188
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:13.870
So this is one condition,

189
00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:14.830
right?

190
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.970
If you want to,

191
00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:18.200
you know,

192
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:18.510
sad.

193
00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:20.390
With this command you have toe inside this one,

194
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:22.850
you have to nullify you have tow anti that variable.

195
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:26.650
Now this variable has been empty.

196
00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:26.980
Now,

197
00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:27.630
if you want to see,

198
00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:29.180
you can check it again.

199
00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.620
If I'm going to fire this common,

200
00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.830
you will see that my valuable school has been teaching now,

201
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:35.450
right?

202
00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:39.810
So this is very important with this factory interview as well.

203
00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:42.810
If you're going toe going for any into many times,

204
00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:47.570
I have seen that they can simply ask you what is the meaning off the sentence that is colon

205
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.800
is equal to so in simple.

206
00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:50.000
What?

207
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.850
You can see that if the variable is an empty,

208
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:55.070
then you can assign it before value.

209
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:55.680
That's all.

210
00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:01.020
So when their soul for this lecture in the next electoral understand a lot of more things.

211
00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:01.940
So thanks for watching.

212
00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.220
We'll see in the next lecture.
