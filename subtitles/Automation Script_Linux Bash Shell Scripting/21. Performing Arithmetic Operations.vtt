00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680
how everyone is this lucky will understand about automatic operations.

2
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.450
You can perform math operation using best shall variables.

3
00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.550
It has building Mathematica option.

4
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.530
You can also use some you know,

5
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:17.050
external.

6
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.470
Come on,

7
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.900
that is expression or you know bc calculator.

8
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.360
So the Syntex off,

9
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:22.930
you know,

10
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.030
after the explosion is very simple.

11
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.250
That is dollar on then.

12
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.560
But I get twice time on your expression.

13
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.180
Expression could be any numbers,

14
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.350
like five plus town.

15
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.570
So you can used operator.

16
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.130
Plus,

17
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.570
you can use obstruction as well.

18
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.880
Miners division.

19
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.730
You can use multiplication you can use you can use plus.

20
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:47.970
Plus,

21
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.600
that is for post In Kleeman.

22
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.020
You can use minus manners.

23
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.910
That is posed,

24
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:52.470
Dickenman.

25
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.750
So let's do in a lab session on that so that you can understand more.

26
00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.890
Right?

27
00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.290
So what I'm going to do,

28
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.220
I'm just taking an example.

29
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.770
Like addition off two numbers.

30
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.720
So I'm going to use this echo.

31
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.150
My two numbers is 35 plus 65.

32
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.250
I can see that I'm getting in output here.

33
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.430
So this is a simple index you can offer using,

34
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.980
you know,

35
00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.080
it's kept as well.

36
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.330
So here you can.

37
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.460
I'm going to do this one that is 20.

38
00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.970
Divide right,

39
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:28.450
five.

40
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.450
So I'm getting this out.

41
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.450
I can add this one that is 20 minus five.

42
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.350
15

43
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.300
Right.

44
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.070
So,

45
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.500
like this way,

46
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.720
you can use different,

47
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.000
different,

48
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.450
You know?

49
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.560
You know,

50
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.550
operators.

51
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.730
So division plus minus modification for multiplication.

52
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:51.660
You ever used this one?

53
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.450
That is a stop Esther 100.

54
00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:03.750
So how do you use this expression in a,

55
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:04.160
you know,

56
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.880
shallow script.

57
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.500
So,

58
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.720
like,

59
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.110
material,

60
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.300
you know,

61
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.460
simple script for you.

62
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:17.540
I'm in this location on that is automatic operation.

63
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.610
So I'm giving out.

64
00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:19.500
I'm very,

65
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.900
you know,

66
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.750
bad in giving the names so you can give your names.

67
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.750
Okay.

68
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.940
Okay.

69
00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.160
So I'm going to,

70
00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.660
you know,

71
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.090
multiply two numbers,

72
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:42.080
so I'm giving you input from users on toe first number.

73
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.070
So that is my no number.

74
00:02:47.070 --> 00:03:06.290
You're going to leave it here on going efforts is the variable name and a second number two

75
00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.010
numbers input.

76
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.630
I have already taken from the users on.

77
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.590
Then I'm ring modification.

78
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.950
I can give any name taller.

79
00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:22.360
The kit on my first reply by this one.

80
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:28.850
Asset echo again.

81
00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:39.050
Put it like modification and turn numbers.

82
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:56.690
This dollar mother first number.

83
00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.830
I'm giving this 15 on second.

84
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.090
What is I'm doing?

85
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.750
15 again?

86
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.070
49 immune.

87
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.270
So the multiplication that could have got to 10.

88
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:08.960
Right.

89
00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:09.410
So,

90
00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:10.620
like this where you can you know,

91
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.110
kid,

92
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:12.530
on this clip on,

93
00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.370
you can use the mathematical operations.

94
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.600
Okay,

95
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.770
One more thing.

96
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:18.430
I want to tell you.

97
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.340
Hear Echo on.

98
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:27.570
Do suppose I have number A visa called 200 number.

99
00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:28.550
Okay.

100
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.820
I want to show you this post,

101
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:31.700
you know,

102
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:32.650
inclement.

103
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:39.180
So I can use echo this $1 on this one.

104
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.950
A B plus plus so you can see the output is still.

105
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.120
I'm getting this 100.

106
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.450
It should be 101.

107
00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.630
Okay,

108
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:50.730
Some type of mistake.

109
00:04:50.730 --> 00:05:00.250
It could be Okay.

110
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.950
You have to use use the bracket here.

111
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.750
Okay.

112
00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.990
So I can see that each time I'm fighting this.

113
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.360
Come on.

114
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.390
The number is increasing,

115
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.050
so I stood off,

116
00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.470
plus place.

117
00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.910
If I'm using minus minus the number one decreasing.

118
00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:16.450
Didn't see that.

119
00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.380
So from there,

120
00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.410
some for the selected.

121
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:20.520
We'll see in the next lecture,

122
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.920
but
