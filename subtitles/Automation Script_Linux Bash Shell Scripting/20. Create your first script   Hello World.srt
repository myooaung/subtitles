1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,930
Hello World.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:04,340
Okay,

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:04,660
Yes.

4
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,740
This is the basic script that most of the time that I have seen people,

5
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:09,400
right.

6
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,020
Whenever there,

7
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,890
star learning,

8
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,020
scripting languages.

9
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:16,620
So we're learning back scripting languages and the first script that we will write as to

10
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,950
echo or toe output on the screen that reads Hello World.

11
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:28,080
I remember when I was in college the first script that was given to be by my teacher and or

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,150
but my professor was too right.

13
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:30,930
Ah,

14
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:31,950
script that will.

15
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,950
I'll put print on the screen that would read Hello World.

16
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:36,840
So anyway,

17
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,850
I am going to do the same thing for you guys that I want you to create the first script.

18
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,540
If you know this,

19
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,460
how to create a script,

20
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,040
awesome.

21
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,320
But start with me.

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,190
Let's go with me.

23
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,750
So we're going to start with creating the first group that will output Hello World.

24
00:00:51,750 --> 00:01:02,050
So I have already my lyrics machine session open and I am logged in as myself.

25
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,200
No,

26
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,440
as a practice,

27
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,880
as I mentioned before,

28
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,100
that always create your script in a Pacific directory,

29
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:16,250
so it will be easier for you to remember were those scripts are so let's do CD script I'll

30
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,510
have already created that.

31
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,070
You should have that too,

32
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,610
if you follow my early lessons.

33
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:21,190
If not,

34
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:21,930
then go ahead.

35
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,150
Run the command make de ir followed by the scrip.

36
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:28,330
And it will create a script in the script.

37
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:29,330
If you do ls minus.

38
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:32,970
L you probably not gonna have anything if you never had a script before here.

39
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,020
If you do.

40
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,220
Ah then go ahead.

41
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,140
And the lead descript the first script.

42
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,150
All the lead is Hello world.

43
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,780
This is permission denied.

44
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:44,750
Why is that?

45
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,700
It is owned by me.

46
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,420
It is owned by my group.

47
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:52,360
And I could remove it by looking at this.

48
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,680
W it has write,

49
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,150
write permissions.

50
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,640
I cannot delete it.

51
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,000
That's a good troubleshooting exercise as well.

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,250
Right?

53
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,010
Uh,

54
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:01,710
I know it.

55
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:08,850
Why I can't delete it occurs when I created the folder or directory called scrip,

56
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,550
I was rude.

57
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,790
So let's go.

58
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,620
One step back.

59
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:16,550
Cd dot dot Do ls minus l and you will see.

60
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,040
Yeah,

61
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,480
I was right.

62
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:18,750
See?

63
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,540
Right here says this directory is created by route.

64
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:28,010
So anything under this directory will be protected by user route.

65
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,650
Nobody could touch it or delete it.

66
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,450
So the best thing I should do is to become route,

67
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:38,650
go into my home directory,

68
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:43,550
and I was simply removed the directory now,

69
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,740
so this will start fresh.

70
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,830
Okay,

71
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:47,690
so now it's gone.

72
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,950
That's exit out off that route.

73
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,810
Make sure you are yourself.

74
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:52,360
Yes,

75
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:52,890
we are.

76
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,140
You logged in ourselves also.

77
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,870
You could check by looking at the prompt.

78
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,150
It tells you the,

79
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,100
um,

80
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,350
name off the user logged in and the server name.

81
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:08,250
So now we are in our home directory,

82
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:13,150
and now we're going to create a directory called Scripts.

83
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:21,300
And we will put all our script from this point on to our folder called Scripts.

84
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:21,750
Now,

85
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,670
make sure it is there.

86
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,020
Yes,

87
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,440
it stares the end,

88
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,250
and now it is owned by me.

89
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:27,800
Now,

90
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,550
you don't have to run all the scripts as root.

91
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:38,150
The only time you would have to run scripts as route if the commands that you are adding

92
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:41,350
inside of your scripts required root privileges.

93
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,470
Yes.

94
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:49,530
So you could run any any command like PWD Ellis or anything that do not require root

95
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,190
permissions.

96
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,330
If you are running other commands,

97
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:58,190
let's say ah d m I decode or d message or D f uh,

98
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,010
dis command.

99
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,450
Those are the type of commands a require route rights.

100
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:05,100
So it's better that you run those commands.

101
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:05,640
Ah,

102
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,550
those scripts.

103
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,320
Ah,

104
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,380
you create the scripts as route anyway.

105
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,950
So let's get into our scripts territory.

106
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:18,990
And now you see a We don't have any file or any directory in our scripts directory.

107
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:30,490
So we will create our first script and we'll call it Hello World and you could put dot bash

108
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:31,140
as well.

109
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:36,490
But since we will be working primarily with Bash Ah,

110
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,910
Shell so we don't have to specify.

111
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:39,520
Ah,

112
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,200
the extension.

113
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,150
So just simply,

114
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:41,950
um,

115
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:42,650
hit Enter.

116
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:46,800
Once you are in the V I mode,

117
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,450
you specify the shell.

118
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:54,140
So we want to run this script as bash.

119
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,050
Good second thing.

120
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:00,400
Who is the author off the script?

121
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,750
I will say it's myself.

122
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:06,550
Then again,

123
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:13,050
comment date Script is created.

124
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,230
Let's pick any date.

125
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:20,490
So let's say if you're picking zero a slash 20 sacks.

126
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,350
2020

127
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,450
Okay,

128
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,420
um,

129
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,430
Daniel put in.

130
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:39,270
It's a little description description and that will read this script Will output Hello,

131
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:44,150
world on the screen.

132
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,750
That's it.

133
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:55,480
Simply that if there are any modification so you could put a date modified and then you

134
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,240
could put the date.

135
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,450
Since we're doing the first time,

136
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:01,980
you could just put it the same date as you put a did created.

137
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:02,410
Okay,

138
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:05,350
so our shell is defined.

139
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,650
Our comment is defined.

140
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,730
Do we have to add anything?

141
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:10,030
No,

142
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,450
it's just a simple script.

143
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:18,310
So I will go ahead and write the script that were print Go.

144
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,310
Hello,

145
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,450
world.

146
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,950
And that's it.

147
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:27,750
Now you could just to escape out of fed and right.

148
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,850
Quit.

149
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:31,620
And your script is created now.

150
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,370
Verified.

151
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:32,700
Yes,

152
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,550
the script is there,

153
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,400
but you cannot run it.

154
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:35,740
Why?

155
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:39,850
Because it does not have execute herbal permission right here.

156
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:42,150
So in order to,

157
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:42,950
uh,

158
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:46,420
a sign proper execute herbal permission,

159
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,950
you will have to run the command change mod.

160
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,210
Oh,

161
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,150
plus execute herbal.

162
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,650
Hello world.

163
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,250
And by the way,

164
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:59,050
I'm using tap that auto completes file.

165
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,650
And if the ball does not exist,

166
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,710
it will not auto complete as an example.

167
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:10,050
Let's say if our instead of h e l l o put h A l l and hit tab.

168
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:10,960
See,

169
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,960
it's not gonna work,

170
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,250
so it has to have a correct spelling.

171
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,970
Okay,

172
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,300
so we have modified the permissions.

173
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,250
Let's verify it?

174
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,340
Yes.

175
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:24,020
Now it has the execute permission.

176
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,450
As if you see as soon as we could give it.

177
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,230
Ah.

178
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,000
Gave it executed information.

179
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,250
It's color change as well.

180
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:30,860
Now,

181
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,530
please remember,

182
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,170
don't focus on the color,

183
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:39,620
as I said earlier as well that sometime maybe you probably creating a script in Solaris or

184
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:46,460
in a I X or in any other UNIX or links play were that does not give you that color changing

185
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,300
scheme or that depends on the environment.

186
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:49,750
A shelf.

187
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:54,140
So that's why Just focus on that it is executed.

188
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:54,270
Well,

189
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,450
by looking at execute permission.

190
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,590
Okay,

191
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:57,850
now,

192
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:58,250
perfect.

193
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,650
Now let's run it.

194
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:00,760
So again,

195
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,400
you could run it through the hole,

196
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,330
Pat,

197
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:09,570
which is Absolute Path script directory and hello,

198
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,060
world and hit Enter.

199
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,350
And there you go.

200
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,650
Your foot script is created.

201
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,540
Isn't that fun?

202
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:20,150
You have just created your first script,

203
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,920
which outputs on the screen.

204
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,300
Hello,

205
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:22,650
world.

206
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:27,750
Now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna run the script as a relative path.

207
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,650
Sadat slash Hello,

208
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:30,050
world.

209
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,340
There you go.

210
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,700
It does the same thing,

211
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:37,830
but it executes it with a relative path if you notice.

212
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:38,270
Um,

213
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:42,020
there are no lines in between on top and bottom,

214
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,900
so I wanted to make it more clear.

215
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,990
More neat.

216
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:45,640
Look.

217
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,850
So what I will do is modify the scrip.

218
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:48,960
Hello,

219
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,330
World hit.

220
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:50,750
Enter.

221
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:57,950
And now I'm gonna put one echo here and one echo here.

222
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:04,740
So when I put these echoes inside that it will actually generate an empty lines before.

223
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,150
Hello,

224
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:05,530
Orland.

225
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:08,780
After hello World and datemodified again.

226
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,890
I could just put it like,

227
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:18,260
Let's if you're modifying it a day after the first time you created then you just 21 save

228
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,250
the script And now let's run it.

229
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,580
Hello,

230
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,300
world.

231
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,930
Nice.

232
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:25,650
You see?

233
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:33,130
Now it is giving the output that you want Now as exercise I would recommend you to go ahead

234
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,150
and create a couple off,

235
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,560
um,

236
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,930
scripts like that that will output on the screen Like my name is Imron.

237
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:39,680
Absolute.

238
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,390
I love to teach and I am whatever that you wanted to add,

239
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,560
just I'll put on it,

240
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,570
chop the lines which over the way you want it.

241
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:50,750
This will give you some practice on how to creates him.

242
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:50,860
Well,

243
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,350
script
