1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,870
how everyone.

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,250
So let's continue.

3
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:06,070
So in the last effectively understood about,

4
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:11,180
you know differently now in installation files that we have in user's home directory.

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,170
So these are the important files we have dot bash,

6
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:14,750
profile.

7
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:21,140
So I have put cement in that file in the last you can see that I have some useful message

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:21,570
like,

9
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,150
this is my box.

10
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,920
And I want that when this user John log in to the boss,

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,550
he will get this massive these time.

12
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,650
But this is only for the John User.

13
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,200
If some other users going to look into this box,

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,590
he or she will not get this message.

15
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:41,880
If you want for all the users that you have to put the same entry in the ABC profile No,

16
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,400
I'm coming to the point.

17
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:50,820
This one the difference between your dog bash profile on this one dot Boesch RC so dot best

18
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:57,140
profile is executed for logging cell andare Boesch arses executed for interactive non

19
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,100
logging shells.

20
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,050
So what does it mean?

21
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:01,230
So here,

22
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,200
if you'll see that I have locked into the box as a user,

23
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,500
John So I have run into the box I got you know,

24
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,710
let me come on from here.

25
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:09,390
This one.

26
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,900
So you will see that when I logged into the box.

27
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,870
So this is Collier blogging.

28
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,190
Shall I got some logging shell?

29
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,920
This is the best shell I've got on.

30
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,460
But this is the process I d.

31
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:28,050
So when you look into the box when he supplied the user name and prosper So in that case,

32
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:34,050
you know you will get along in show on all your profiles will be executed.

33
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,620
But some would you know,

34
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:37,750
I have,

35
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:38,200
you know,

36
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,310
already logged into the box and open a new terminal.

37
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,440
So that would be your non log in shell.

38
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,270
So in that case,

39
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,700
on Lee ah file which will be executed,

40
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,650
that is a dark best RC.

41
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,250
Not other files will be executed.

42
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,150
So here you can see that I'm in this.

43
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,810
I have got this best profile,

44
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:00,670
right?

45
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,550
So if I want to check the process i e.

46
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,320
It is already there.

47
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,760
You can fire this command as well.

48
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,040
They No,

49
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,290
I'm going to fire this.

50
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:09,660
Come on.

51
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,550
So what will happen if I'm going to fire this?

52
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:12,970
Come on,

53
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,200
I will get it Another Siachin another shall.

54
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,860
I will get right that would be,

55
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,290
you know,

56
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,450
my interactive but non log insurance.

57
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,210
They this is inducted,

58
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:32,050
but non Long shell You'll see that I again I've got a new shim.

59
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,270
So if I'm fighting this come on,

60
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,380
you'll see that a new process i d.

61
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:44,500
So I believe it was 5637 Now I have got 5916 So this session is already hit.

62
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,050
If you will see in the system,

63
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,470
you'll see this session is already there.

64
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,410
But I have taken,

65
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:49,950
you know,

66
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,420
another not interactive logging shell Interactive normal again.

67
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:58,010
Shell No,

68
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,460
when you get a,

69
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,300
you know,

70
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,290
non long and shell.

71
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:06,150
So at that time only you know dot best R C profile will be executed.

72
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:13,660
You will see that in this home in this file we have this file also and that finally we have

73
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,370
some empty cell.

74
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:14,800
So there.

75
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,740
But when I fired this common been bashed again,

76
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,830
I'm going to get a new shell.

77
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,230
This file has not executed.

78
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,160
You know I did.

79
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,300
This fall has not exhibited.

80
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,870
That's why I didn't get this message.

81
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,850
So which fight has been as good?

82
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:36,510
Onley this Bashar see So let's see what all the things that you have So here again.

83
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:37,590
See that in Bashar See,

84
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:49,930
we have this message I want to put one more message like Hello again I'm going to take a

85
00:03:49,930 --> 00:04:01,250
new you know best So if it is that you know non logging shell then on li dot Bashar see

86
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,350
escaped will be executed Not any other escape.

87
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,790
All right,

88
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:10,780
so this is what they want toe say And that is the basic different between your dot best

89
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,730
profile and your dot Peshawar.

90
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:12,980
See?

91
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:18,680
So when their soul for this lecture hope you have got some idea thanks with you in the next

92
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:18,980
election.
