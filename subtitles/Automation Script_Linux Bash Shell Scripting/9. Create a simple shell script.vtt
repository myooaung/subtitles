00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.850
how everyone.

2
00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:08.850
So this is a practice lab station in which I'm going to show you how to create a simple

3
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:09.850
Saleh script.

4
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:15.380
So this is my article box and which I'm going to do a lot of testing.

5
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.660
So we'll start with a very basic Saleh scripting.

6
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.890
So locate a simple salad scream.

7
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:29.610
You have to use some editor text editor such as them via because,

8
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:30.130
you know,

9
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.080
shallow script is nothing.

10
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.280
It's a text file individually,

11
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.370
Harvin All Atlantic's Koeman's on some logic.

12
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.150
As for that equipment.

13
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:45.900
So once you have created the file save and close the file exit from the V I on,

14
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.970
then make that a script executable.

15
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.650
After that,

16
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.650
you have to do the testing with the script,

17
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.370
like the script is given.

18
00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.710
The proper output are not as Fatah requirement on one.

19
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.510
Satisfied with the out port,

20
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.560
you can move that a script to your production environment,

21
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.990
where you have to run the script.

22
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.970
This is usually we do it in any environment.

23
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.400
Suppose I have a production environment on.

24
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.050
I want to do some task,

25
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.110
but I want to perform those tasks using some Saleh script.

26
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.010
So first of all,

27
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:28.660
we will vacating the Saleh script on the testing environment on one satisfied with output,

28
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.050
them will move those scripts to the production environment.

29
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.790
So let's stop.

30
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.550
So I'm in this location.

31
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:41.310
So this is a location where I'm going to keep on getting the skips for this entire course.

32
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.630
Morning.

33
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.330
So this is the first Alice kept.

34
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.320
So I'm going to use via and then you have to give the name off the Sallis care.

35
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.250
So I'm giving my first script.

36
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.890
Don't message.

37
00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.520
It is not mandatory.

38
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.970
Toe.

39
00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.950
Give this extension.

40
00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.420
You can give any finally,

41
00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.930
May as well.

42
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.470
So it is just for your,

43
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.040
you know,

44
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.820
reference only.

45
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.250
Like if you'll see that fine people come to know the boat dot Outside admits it's a script

46
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:09.250
.

47
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.350
That's why we usually prefer to,

48
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.760
you know,

49
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.850
put down a set.

50
00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.710
Now I'm enter into the common mode.

51
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.660
All right,

52
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.470
so I have just opened a fine Andi,

53
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.560
just press enter.

54
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.880
The file has been opened now,

55
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.070
so this is a common what we can see that is Kim.

56
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:35.230
I know you can see that I'm an insert more No.

57
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.560
After,

58
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.080
you know,

59
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.260
put something in that like,

60
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.990
I need to put some commands or whatever the logic I want to put for this kid.

61
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.450
As for the requirement,

62
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.550
All right,

63
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.210
so,

64
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.860
first of all,

65
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:49.370
you know,

66
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.860
every script will always start with a she bang,

67
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.010
but I So it is like this one,

68
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.850
this hash exclamatory.

69
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.430
So this talent,

70
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.000
this index,

71
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.820
this one this hash exclamatory Syntex.

72
00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.150
Basically,

73
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.730
it is used to indicate on interpretative for execution under line.

74
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.890
It's a UNIX operating system like you have created this a script.

75
00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.650
But this is Kim is for which shell.

76
00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.640
So here you can specify.

77
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.240
I want this for before bash.

78
00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.740
I warned my skirt for pull.

79
00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:28.850
Then you have to use pull.

80
00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:36.780
Suppose I have created by Tony script and you have to tell at the beginning off the script

81
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:48.920
that this is my script which will be executed using bite on late support.

82
00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:49.440
You know,

83
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.270
I have logged into the box and I have,

84
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.900
you know,

85
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.390
taking a shell that is C cell occasion.

86
00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.200
And I have killed her descript.

87
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.200
So obviously,

88
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.880
if you're sitting on you know K shell on,

89
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.810
you have created a script on the starting.

90
00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.160
You have no mention anything.

91
00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.680
The 1st 90 i was started with the,

92
00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.050
you know,

93
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.090
commands on you're going to execute the script.

94
00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.210
So what will happen as you logged into the system and you have changed your shell from

95
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.620
bashed.

96
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.150
Okay,

97
00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.300
so this group is going to run with the shell only,

98
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.410
But you are sitting on occasion on.

99
00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.110
Do you have a specified This one?

100
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.140
This been dash.

101
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.050
So that is what will happen.

102
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.610
It doesn't matter on which sell yours currently.

103
00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:38.050
You know,

104
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.430
sitting on using the script will be running with cash only.

105
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:48.680
So it is collar she banged or bang line as well.

106
00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.860
So it is nothing,

107
00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.010
but we can say the absolute part.

108
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.040
This is absolute part off the bash.

109
00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.210
They Oh,

110
00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:07.250
you can say that this ensures that the bash will be used to interpreted the script.

111
00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.750
Okay,

112
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:10.970
Now come into the next line.

113
00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.350
That is a comma echo.

114
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:25.260
I can give anything like welcome to online loving glasses.

115
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.940
Cool.

116
00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:34.420
Hello to all my students.

117
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:41.130
I hope you are London.

118
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.810
Well,

119
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.280
from this course.

120
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.300
So you put you can put anything here today after,

121
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.820
you know,

122
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.360
creating this kid.

123
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.150
Whatever.

124
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:54.250
Okay.

125
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.290
Whatever you want,

126
00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:56.320
you have better now.

127
00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.270
Now you have to come out from this.

128
00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.300
It means that you have toe save a filing.

129
00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.700
Good.

130
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.870
So toe save a filing,

131
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:03.220
kid,

132
00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.110
you have to first press escape on,

133
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.300
then type colon W Q.

134
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.150
Come on.

135
00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.150
So my skipped has been created.

136
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.630
So let me kept this file.

137
00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.830
So destroying these contents.

138
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.240
Now I'm going to execute this.

139
00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.370
So to execute this escape,

140
00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.650
you have to press dark less my script.

141
00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:35.330
I'm getting an Eddo.

142
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:40.670
The other tells them the script doesn't have permission.

143
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:42.970
So let's see the permission off this fire.

144
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.140
So the permission off this file,

145
00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:50.690
you can see for the route because I have Lord into the box as a route on drooled user has

146
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:52.950
skated this it's good.

147
00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:56.810
So this route either is having only,

148
00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:57.300
you know,

149
00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.110
read and write access to this file.

150
00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.870
It doesn't have the executable permissions.

151
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:07.170
So I'm going to use a common ch moon which will be used to 10.

152
00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:10.760
The permission off any file or directory plus X is for,

153
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:11.250
you know,

154
00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:14.730
executable permission on my script.

155
00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:18.450
I am going to five this Alice.

156
00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:18.990
I feel India.

157
00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:20.770
You can see the permission has been stated.

158
00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:21.990
It was this one.

159
00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:23.470
Permission mark has been justice.

160
00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:29.630
So It means that knowledge would use that is having the permission to execute this one.

161
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:30.850
I'm going to use this one.

162
00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:33.950
I can see that I have got an output.

163
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:38.280
It means that my script has so this way.

164
00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:38.750
You know,

165
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:40.350
you can clear the simplest grip,

166
00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:41.440
right?

167
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:47.040
So you have to use V I editor to create the script on then save on,

168
00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.450
then make it executable and execute on.

169
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:51.490
Always remember,

170
00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:53.270
you have to start with a C bang.

171
00:07:53.270 --> 00:08:02.740
That is the first line off any script Onda and See Bank is nothing this and shows that the

172
00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:07.480
bash or pile up Eitan will be used to interpreted the script.

173
00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.640
Okay,

174
00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.890
so from there.

175
00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:14.860
So for this lecture So we'll to in the next lecture about ticket
