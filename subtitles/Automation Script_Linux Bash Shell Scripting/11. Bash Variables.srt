00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,930
welcome to Atlantis classes.

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:07,050
So this selective you're going to understand about West variables?

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,190
We'll understand what are variables water,

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,990
environmental variables and water system variables.

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,570
And what are the various commands,

6
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:15,430
which can be used to,

7
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:16,050
you know,

8
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,490
assign the variables,

9
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:22,300
and we'll have a lot of love stations as well on.

10
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:22,800
Believe me,

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,900
this is an important topic to understand.

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,720
If you're walking as a Atlantic segment on,

13
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,230
if you won't do it on a start loving,

14
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,310
shallow scripting.

15
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,960
So I would say these are the base off these topics.

16
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,100
So let's start.

17
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,850
What are variables?

18
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:41,730
So variable is a character string toe,

19
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,020
which we assign a value.

20
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,950
The value assigned could be number,

21
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:53,320
text filing device or any other type of daughter available is nothing more than a pointed

22
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:53,480
toe.

23
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,970
The actual data Suppose you know I've logged into a system.

24
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:00,520
I gotta shell on their cell.

25
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,080
I can type.

26
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,930
Anything I've given is equal to 10.

27
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,330
So what does it mean?

28
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,220
It means that is my variable,

29
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:11,220
and I have given 10 is the number I can give anything.

30
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,290
It could be number.

31
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:12,800
It could be,

32
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,250
you know,

33
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,150
text.

34
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,560
It could be filed him whatever but it would be my parable.

35
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:17,870
Why?

36
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:22,220
I'm saying variable because I can give anything is going to 10 I for some time.

37
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,050
I can give a visible 20 as well.

38
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,880
So these are my valuables.

39
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,750
So best variables are local toe single cell by before.

40
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,010
So what does it mean?

41
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:36,650
It means that someone you know I have got a shell on have assigned available is you got 10

42
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:36,650
.

43
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:40,460
So that variable is only applicable to my this shell.

44
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:46,770
If I have taken another shell off the off the same system so that variable is will not be

45
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:47,450
inherited.

46
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:54,120
So nobody's let me have long toe the line and so on will show you so that you can

47
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,550
understand about the variables.

48
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,350
So this is my Lennox over.

49
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,250
So how we can give assigned,

50
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:00,710
available.

51
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,520
It's very simple.

52
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,480
A physical toe.

53
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,400
20

54
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:08,030
So here is my terrible on 20 is the number I have given.

55
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,660
Okay,

56
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,460
So that's why the definition of variable is a variable is a characteristic will be assigned

57
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,350
off you.

58
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:19,100
We can say they're variable is nothing more than a pointed toe.

59
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:25,080
The actual data how to read the variable a echo dollar A.

60
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,440
Now I'm guarding an output.

61
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,090
What does it mean?

62
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,710
It means that this is my variable.

63
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,350
I want to read what we have in the variable.

64
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:34,120
I have to use the common core dollar A.

65
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,980
Suppose I'm giving this 30 number.

66
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:38,880
I want to read.

67
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,450
I can do this.

68
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:43,020
Suppose I have even is going to ABC.

69
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,240
Maybe only.

70
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,530
Okay,

71
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:46,720
So,

72
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,100
like this,

73
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,870
you can give any very blessed like these will 34 if you want to read it,

74
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:52,630
This one.

75
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:58,050
So these are the commands which can be used to send the variables.

76
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,160
Now,

77
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:05,480
suppose argument is going to 30 on a busy Quito 40 on.

78
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:14,740
I want to do the some off two numbers I can give C Is it going toe this expression dollars

79
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,200
kit.

80
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,190
Bless dollars B.

81
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,100
Now what I have done here,

82
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,480
I've just simple used,

83
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,950
uh,

84
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,250
Come on,

85
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:25,950
mathematic.

86
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,920
This is expression here.

87
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,110
This coming.

88
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:32,330
I can simply do the addition off to wearables.

89
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:40,460
So whatever the value we have on a dollar a cancer in a on the that would be some that will

90
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,620
be going to available.

91
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,080
See?

92
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,100
Okay.

93
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,260
I want to read.

94
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,450
See that I have to use.

95
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:50,920
I can see that I got an output 70.

96
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,030
So whatever you need to be is that you know,

97
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:59,890
I have available and we have to wearables envy on 3/3 variable is nothing that is some off

98
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:00,650
to wearables.

99
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,360
So you can see 30 plus 40.

100
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:14,530
That would be so indeed symbols is my 100 on my bees Equal toe 80.

101
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:17,870
I have given this and it stood off.

102
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,350
Plus I'm using minus.

103
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,980
If I am using this,

104
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,490
I got an output off 20 100 minus 80.

105
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:26,220
That would be you,

106
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,720
20

107
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:33,420
So this is a simple edible if you are rebuilding their definition.

108
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:37,600
I said that respirable czar local to a single shell by default.

109
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,460
What does it mean?

110
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,990
It means that support.

111
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,250
You know,

112
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,820
I have open another shell from this shell,

113
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,490
right click and open or have just,

114
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:45,980
you know,

115
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,540
switch user to some of the shell.

116
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,110
So what will happen?

117
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,500
A new shell will be generated.

118
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,820
So whatever the value have assigned like physical,

119
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:58,780
30 bees will do 40 so those values will not inherited the another shell.

120
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,420
So those variables is only applicable to this cell.

121
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:06,880
If I'm going to clear any child shell from this show so those where was will not go to that

122
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,130
show.

123
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,560
Simple.

124
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,140
What I can say.

125
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:13,080
Suppose I have Kurdish simple chalice scripting on in the shallow script.

126
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,560
You know,

127
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,690
I have just,

128
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,050
you know,

129
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:20,510
use those capes If I want to use those scripts on Ivan's good in the shallow script.

130
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,370
So what will happen?

131
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:27,180
A child process will be initiated from that So that child process will not being the values

132
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,350
that you have a sign here.

133
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:33,240
So from their cell for this lecture in the last lecture will understand more about it.

134
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,370
So thanks for watching.

135
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,820
And if you have time,

136
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,340
please join with me in the next lecture.
