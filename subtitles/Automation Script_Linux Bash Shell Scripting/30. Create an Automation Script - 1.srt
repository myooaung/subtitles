1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,750
how everyone.

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:04,680
So let's continue and start creating this group.

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,830
So Skip is already created.

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,690
I'm going to execute the script on Let's see Ward Stout.

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:11,840
What?

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,440
I'm getting.

7
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,500
So with the help of output,

8
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,550
I'm going to create the script with you from scratch.

9
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:19,680
Okay.

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,830
After going position,

11
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,000
this is my second edition.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,340
Andi,

13
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,640
I'm going to get the script.

14
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:33,170
Okay?

15
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:47,200
Today let me scroll up.

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,630
I can see that when my script started.

17
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,290
Very first information WAAS system information.

18
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:54,180
So it's very easy.

19
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,090
You can put like this one echo on here again.

20
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,660
Put system information.

21
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,550
All right,

22
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:03,520
let me make it executive in.

23
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:11,170
That is okay,

24
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,310
I'm getting this information,

25
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:15,450
But if you'll see there's a difference here,

26
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,380
you can see there is an underlying as well.

27
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:23,240
So two unable underlying you have to,

28
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:23,800
you know,

29
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,250
enable the you know that is interpretation Off backs less escapes.

30
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:28,870
So,

31
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:29,190
Father,

32
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,490
do you have to use Hyphen e?

33
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,000
And also for this underlying,

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,430
you need to,

35
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:34,800
you know,

36
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,910
start the bash colors.

37
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,590
So the command was this one.

38
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,490
That is your It's less okay.

39
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:51,160
That is bracket square bracket on the court number color court number for underlying the

40
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,660
court is four,

41
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,880
and you have to use em.

42
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,860
Andi,

43
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,850
to close this color coding,

44
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,770
you have to use less E.

45
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:00,920
Coli back in.

46
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,820
So it's crab record zero,

47
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,030
That's all.

48
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,900
No,

49
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:12,450
I'm going to the same output that is that I'm getting with that descript.

50
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,480
They next is your internet.

51
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,830
It is showing connected.

52
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,020
Right.

53
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,850
So to check the internet connectivity,

54
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:21,970
I'm going to use this.

55
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:22,340
Come on.

56
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:22,980
That is,

57
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:23,460
you know,

58
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,470
being being.

59
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:30,470
And I remember you with this one here.

60
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,220
You can see that I'm keep on getting the output.

61
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,270
And if I own two interrupted,

62
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,620
I need to press control.

63
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,060
See?

64
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:46,680
So I have to use fi option with thing that is C one on google dot com.

65
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,400
Right,

66
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,250
So here you can see that it checks only father one time.

67
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,730
Apart from that,

68
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,560
I'm also using some time on value as well.

69
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,340
That is five seconds,

70
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,750
So it will wait for only five seconds.

71
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,650
Suppose you know I mentioned like,

72
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,480
any website on that website is,

73
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:07,760
you know,

74
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,750
not responding.

75
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,710
And I have not mentioned this time of value.

76
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,610
That is five seconds.

77
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:13,820
So in that case,

78
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:20,040
the ping command will keep on Jack the connectivity till it reaches to the time of value

79
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,180
tomorrow,

80
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:21,480
will you?

81
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,300
It could be one minute to minute whatever.

82
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,000
So what will happen in the script?

83
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,780
Your script gets hung,

84
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,900
right?

85
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,410
So do a white this I'm going to use this time,

86
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,180
or will you as well,

87
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,680
right?

88
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,600
The next thing is that in this case we will see that it is simply selling Internet

89
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,340
connected or disconnected.

90
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,680
I don't want to see all these outputs.

91
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,080
So after nullify all those outputs for that,

92
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,650
I will be used.

93
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,790
This this symbol that is percentage the same.

94
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,380
That is a redirection channels.

95
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,700
So we'll have a separate section on understanding the redirection channel.

96
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:59,950
So this channel is basically nullify our genetic all your outputs,

97
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,580
whether it's a useful out port or any other.

98
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,660
After that,

99
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,760
I have mentioned this one,

100
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,290
so it will nullify otherwise if you have mentioned like some file,

101
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,640
so all the output is going into that file.

102
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:19,640
But I wanted should nullify like now you can see that it is number five like No,

103
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,450
The next thing.

104
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:24,530
If you remember that in the previous lecture we had discussed,

105
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,100
like one come on,

106
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:30,220
that is test and we're having one condition like on day.

107
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:30,790
After that,

108
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,630
we have used some,

109
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:31,880
you know,

110
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,710
symbol like this.

111
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:36,300
One person on that that is too common,

112
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,040
Andi.

113
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,900
And if my previous come on,

114
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,160
didn't transit is fully down.

115
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,910
It would be going to this like false Come on.

116
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:51,340
Like the same concept I'm going to use.

117
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:51,980
So here,

118
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,560
you know,

119
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,880
this is my come on.

120
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,390
And it is going to check this one.

121
00:04:55,390 --> 00:05:03,100
So if it is satisfied like the condition is satisfied So whatever you have mentioned here

122
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,940
that is going to be executed If this condition is not satisfied,

123
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,240
it will be going here.

124
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,440
So same concept.

125
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,740
I will be used here as well.

126
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,670
So this is my been comma on If my pink connectivity is working Fine.

127
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:22,600
Then I'm mentioning here I NT is my variable name I have given any name on it would be

128
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,040
saving this connected here.

129
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,570
Right?

130
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:28,210
And suppose it has not been given.

131
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:35,180
It means that my command didn't properly so I'm going to put this I m t is equal to this

132
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:35,750
character.

133
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,940
Right?

134
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,000
So now I have available.

135
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,250
That is I nd it is suing connected.

136
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:44,690
Same.

137
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,130
I'm going to use in my script.

138
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,140
Okay.

139
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,110
The name off my script.

140
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,920
Waas this one.

141
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,050
Okay,

142
00:05:54,050 --> 00:06:04,560
Electric copy my script.

143
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,540
I did.

144
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:12,910
And I'm putting this sleep so that it should wait for running.

145
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:16,040
Should wait for one second before initiating the second.

146
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,360
Come on.

147
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:25,090
So okay,

148
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:25,640
Andi,

149
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,720
after that,

150
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,190
I'm putting this echo,

151
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:32,870
Andi and this I cook and I want that output should becoming like this one.

152
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,590
This is you know,

153
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,570
my grain,

154
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:37,510
right?

155
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,280
It isn't green.

156
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,020
So I have to use this one on for green.

157
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:46,310
The court color code is your 32 on a dish going Internet.

158
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:49,830
I'm putting Internet here on its face.

159
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,470
Colon and I have to close this one.

160
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,450
Because if you'll see that the second,

161
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:56,230
this one is your different color.

162
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:58,560
So how to close this one?

163
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,230
It's very simple.

164
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:02,430
The same I have used that is zero.

165
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,250
They.

166
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,450
So that's let me come out and done it again.

167
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:11,770
Okay,

168
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:12,710
now here.

169
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:13,690
I've got this output.

170
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:16,260
But I didn't get anything here.

171
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,780
So I have to mention here,

172
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,420
this one as well.

173
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,750
So whether it is connected or not connected,

174
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,420
very safe.

175
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,120
It's saving to this variable.

176
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,840
That is I NT right.

177
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,850
So what I'm wondering.

178
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,050
Use here.

179
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,560
And I want the output.

180
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,540
Should be coming in Red color,

181
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:33,970
resident.

182
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:39,430
So I'm going to put this one e and forward.

183
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,100
We have the color court 31.

184
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,550
Okay,

185
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:47,800
This one I nt I ain't is my variable Right on.

186
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,110
I have to close as well.

187
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,190
So the clothes we have,

188
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:52,570
This one that's all so simple here.

189
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:56,760
No discipline connected.

190
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,350
I can see that.

191
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:03,880
The second is operating system tied that issuing zero Lennox.

192
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,190
So get this.

193
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:06,980

198
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,290
Right.

199
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:11,980
Same.

200
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,380
I'm putting in my script.

201
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,940
So after each come on,

202
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,570

203
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:23,120

211
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:47,100
I'm going to put echo hyphen e on this less e on the head again.

212
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,150
