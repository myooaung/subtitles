in this lesson,

00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.650
we will cover the Oracle Horschel Box download,

3
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.830
and it's It's insulation.

4
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:07.970
First of all,

5
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:23.870
you would have to go to Google and type Oracle Virtual Box download and then the first link

6
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.090
you will see here go to download.

7
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:32.080
If your operating system is Windows,

8
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.350
you'll click on Windows Host.

9
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.620
Once you click on,

10
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.650
it will ask you to save the file.

11
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.630
I can't save the file,

12
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.600
but since it takes some time,

13
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.950
I have already saved the file previously to save some time.

14
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:54.750
This is the file execute herbal file that's been saved.

15
00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:05.170
Run,

16
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:15.290
click.

17
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.950
Next,

18
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.250
Leave everything default setting.

19
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.080
Create a start menu entry You.

20
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.430
Could you believe that?

21
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.210
Create a shortcut on your desktop?

22
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.890
That's fine.

23
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.410
Create a shortcut in a quick lounge bore.

24
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.590
I don't like that and Register File Association.

25
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:43.050
You believe that networking installing the Oracle Worship box and network feature will

26
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.750
reset your network adapter connection temporarily.

27
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.450
That's fine.

28
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.450
Proceed 10 and stole.

29
00:01:50.450 --> 00:02:01.850
Do you want to allow the following program to run since installed software years?

30
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:12.840
Would you like to install this device software from Oracle?

31
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.450
Yes,

32
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.650
if you notice quickly.

33
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.850
This created a quick desktop shortcut on your desktop.

34
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:33.060
It is trying to install another device software That's fine.

35
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.950
Click Install.

36
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.720
Just going to say,

37
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.980
Always trust anything that's coming from Oracle Corporation and just click on install.

38
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.350
So this week it's not gonna bother me again.

39
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.170
And there you go,

40
00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.180
Oracle be impartial.

41
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.320
Box installation is complete.

42
00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.140
Click start Oracle of Urschel box after the insulation.

43
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.600

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:08.520
you could leave the check box cook finish and is Cancel this man Dairy go!

45
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.830
That's the first welcome page off the wardrobe box.

46
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:18.560
And that's where we have actually completed the installation off the warship box from a

47
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.250
hair on you could build,

48
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.000
create a new wardrobe machine.

49
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.020
