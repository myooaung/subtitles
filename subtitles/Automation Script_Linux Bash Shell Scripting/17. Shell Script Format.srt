1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,580
script format.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:07,850
Having a proper format inside of a script is very important.

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:09,160
Why is that?

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,610
Because I'm going to say I'm gonna bring back the same analogy.

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:13,710
You create a script.

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,220
It's a very long script,

7
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,300
and a few months passed by,

8
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:22,700
and now you need to modify the script or troubleshoot something in the script you have.

9
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,970
Sorry,

10
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,330
you have written down the script,

11
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,170
but it's all over the place.

12
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,470
The variables is up.

13
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,350
Your comments are nowhere to be found.

14
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,620
The description is nowhere.

15
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,560
The commander left and right.

16
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,990
There is no Indention,

17
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:38,740
nothing.

18
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:44,710
So there should be a proper format that should be followed so that someone can come in and

19
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:45,660
take a look at your script,

20
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:45,950
insist.

21
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,320
Wow,

22
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:52,950
that's a great job whoever did that so easy to read and so easy to understand.

23
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,850
And what are those format?

24
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:59,150
One is first and foremost is defined shell.

25
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:02,810
This is something that you have to define.

26
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,350
You could say it is a part of format are mandatory.

27
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:06,170
You have to do that.

28
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,650
You have to define a shell.

29
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,090
Then you create a first script.

30
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:17,050
You have to let your operating system no run that script as Bash script.

31
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:18,580
If you're doing a corn shell,

32
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:22,650
you'll have to specify pound hache slash bin slash corn shell.

33
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:23,740
Anyway,

34
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:24,280
when we write,

35
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,590
our first group will cover that as well,

36
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,980
then comments.

37
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,210
Right after defining the shell,

38
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:32,650
you have to put the comments,

39
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:36,250
and those comments always starts with pound sign.

40
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:43,110
And the reason I am telling you that you should include comments is because common should

41
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:51,850
tell what your script does When your script was written who it was written by,

42
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,320
Was it there any modification,

43
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,050
anything that you wanted to include that a user o R.

44
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:04,290
Someone else reading your script can understand what this script is about?

45
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,850
Please add that to your comments,

46
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,050
then defined variables,

47
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,390
variables what Those variables are real.

48
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,660
Cover that not to worry body,

49
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,640
but just to let you know quickly.

50
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,670
The variables is just like an alias.

51
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,250
If you have a long command or if you have ah,

52
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,500
a bunch of emails.

53
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,350
What people do is they give it,

54
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,160
um,

55
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,550
a letter equals the whole big command that becomes their variable,

56
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:33,340
so define your variable at the top after comments.

57
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,730
Then you run the commands,

58
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,950
whatever the commands that you want your script to execute.

59
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:45,840
You need to specify those commands or if you do not have command or if you have any

60
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,970
statement scripts.

61
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:49,520
That's where you put your statement scripts.

62
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,180
Those statements groups are if then,

63
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,750
while for loop or so on.

64
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,450
Now,

65
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:58,250
when you have statements defined,

66
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,550
you should start.

67
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:03,350
If the line where you gonna put an if hit tab?

68
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:09,150
Because this way it will show that you're f statement is starting.

69
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,550
From this point on,

70
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:16,450
there is nothing that that script will translate your tab into something else.

71
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,020
You could use spaces.

72
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,100
You could use tabs,

73
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,170
anything that you want.

74
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:26,210
But try to make your script formatted in a way that if someone or even you read it after

75
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:26,900
year to year,

76
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,320
you'll say,

77
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:27,980
Ah,

78
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,650
this is what I did it so easy to read.

79
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,400
So let me log into my linens machine again,

80
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,150
and I'll should tell you exactly how you should format your scrip.

81
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,650
Okay,

82
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:39,750
this is my Lennox machine.

83
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,460
I'm already in my directory.

84
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,050
Perfect.

85
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,230
I created a script earlier,

86
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,340
or a file earlier.

87
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,710
Call Apache.

88
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,750
I'm gonna take that same script,

89
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:55,130
and I will formatted the way I have just disgusted so to do that.

90
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:58,550
I have to now do a V I on that screen.

91
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:03,340
And I am sure you guys know how to use a V.

92
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,360
I some some of you are familiar with them,

93
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,240
which is probably in a Hass worsen O V I.

94
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,800
I like to use a V I It's kind of old school,

95
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,090
but,

96
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:14,500
um,

97
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:20,910
the good things that it's available and pretty much all the units or her linens flavour So

98
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:26,100
I could never learn something new and not utilize it on older version.

99
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,370
Because I use V I in many system like Solara,

100
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,480
say I X systems.

101
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,450
And sometimes vim is not available.

102
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,880
So v I is something that you will find anywhere,

103
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,050
whichever the system you logging.

104
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,090
Anyway,

105
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:45,100
I'm gonna use V I to at it this file which will eventually become a script.

106
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:45,900
So you hit,

107
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,390
Enter now the first thing.

108
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:48,940
As I said,

109
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,350
you have to define a variable.

110
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,120
It had been bash.

111
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,050
If you look at the back,

112
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:59,050
you'll see the first thing is defining your shell.

113
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:03,590
I want to run this script as bash script.

114
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:04,050
Perfect.

115
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:08,670
Now the next thing I said to add a comment,

116
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:09,250
Okay,

117
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,270
I always add a comment.

118
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:24,750
As usually add a comment is like purpose testing script format date.

119
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,000
Put any date,

120
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,550
Let's say August 22,020.

121
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,050
Um,

122
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,870
modification.

123
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,650
If you have done any modification to the script,

124
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,780
put down the date off the modification.

125
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:49,170
So zero to 08 So last modification.

126
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:49,570
Of course.

127
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:50,820
Since you're creating the first time,

128
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,850
I'll put 20 again.

129
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,780
Okay,

130
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,150
then anything that you wanted to add,

131
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,660
Please Go ahead.

132
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,210
Do so.

133
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:03,820
So if I just put in block love whatever,

134
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,800
it's just a common.

135
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,250
It has no effect on your script.

136
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,400
OK,

137
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:10,960
Perfect.

138
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,050
I understand Imron.

139
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:18,720
But how come the first line that you have is slash bin slash bash has a common in front off

140
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:18,720
.

141
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,800
It isn't,

142
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,450
that isn't it will be considered as a comment as well.

143
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,020
Awesome question.

144
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:25,490
Trust me,

145
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,350
I had the same question.

146
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,060
But let me tell you,

147
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,230
this is just how it is.

148
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,250
Sometimes you know,

149
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,310
it is how it is.

150
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:40,750
So the Lenox will understand this as actually a shell script,

151
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,410
and it always starts with pound and hash.

152
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:45,550
Why?

153
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,220
I honestly don't know.

154
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:53,800
If you really want to know why you could ask someone else who really know inside out when

155
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,840
they came up with,

156
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,630
ah,

157
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,960
writing scripts.

158
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,490
Or you could I'm sure,

159
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,050
um,

160
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:03,670
go online and find out why you have to define with hash.

161
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:04,450
But anyway,

162
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,770
put that in the back of the head.

163
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,650
You have to remember there's no matter what.

164
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:09,310
Okay,

165
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,310
so moving on,

166
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,660
then you define next thing is variable.

167
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:18,380
Variable is something like I want Every time I want to echo something,

168
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,670
I just want to say a and then echo.

169
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:21,820
So let's say in my case,

170
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,650
I wanted to have,

171
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:26,250
um single coat Imron epistle.

172
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,300
And you know what?

173
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:28,950
All the same,

174
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:32,310
my name is Imron.

175
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:42,600
This is how you define your variable And then you could just do echoed dollar a Then it is

176
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,070
going when you say echoed dollar A By the way,

177
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,500
this is this a scripting language?

178
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,080
I already started teaching you,

179
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,010
but that's okay.

180
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:50,520
Ah,

181
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:56,160
you need to understand the format so variable I have defined here that every time this

182
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,230
command will run,

183
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:00,850
it is going to call upon this variable.

184
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:04,760
Why didn't I put that whole thing here?

185
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,400
I can't,

186
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,020
of course.

187
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:13,250
But what if you are working an environment that requires a huge line and does huge things.

188
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,450
Then you it's better that you put those variables in there.

189
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,680
Then,

190
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,250
of course,

191
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,370
then you put command.

192
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,070
Let's say you want to run a date.

193
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,850
You want to run a command G of minus age or so on,

194
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:27,110
then The last one I included as statements.

195
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:30,450
If you are including statements in your script,

196
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:33,450
please do not start from if,

197
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,850
let's say,

198
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,550
um,

199
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,550
dollar a equal.

200
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,650
Um,

201
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:46,650
that's a file or whatever.

202
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,640
Do not start like that.

203
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,960
Always put tab like this.

204
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,650
So if something is equal to that file,

205
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:13,030
enter and then tab again then echo this else echo dad and then fee to close the statement.

206
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:19,630
You see how it is that if Kantar if statement came to be on the right hand side So you know

207
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:26,750
that this is the statements that I want to run and they are and then did to the right side

208
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:26,750
.

209
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,750
What are those statements?

210
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,040
Kits?

211
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,890
I never seen that.

212
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:30,720
Don't worry about it.

213
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,150
I'm gonna cover that in my next lessons.

214
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:37,370
The purpose of this lesson is just that you know that.

215
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:42,750
Why would I follow this format on the following lessons?

216
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,340
That's why I want undercovered that right now,

217
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,150
so you wouldn't know.

218
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:49,100
This is the best way to put your scripts together,

219
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,450
and it will be so easier to remember when you come back to
