1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,610
how everyone.

2
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:04,580
So today we're going to discuss a very important topic.

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:08,540
White guards and system at mean if you want to,

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:08,840
you know,

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,280
lunch,

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:09,490
Alice.

7
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:10,110
Scripting.

8
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,730
So you must be aware off these wild cars.

9
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:13,620
So we have,

10
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,110
you know,

11
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:18,110
three while cars that your best support The 1st 1 is a restaurant.

12
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,140
The symbol is this one.

13
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,610
So the meaning off this as triggers,

14
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:23,920
it matches any sticks,

15
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,620
including the another string.

16
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,990
This can be represented.

17
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:30,300
Any number of characters,

18
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,350
including zero.

19
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,400
In other words,

20
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,000
do and more characters.

21
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,260
So here they have taken one example like suppose I have used this one Syrian.

22
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,510
After that I've used this.

23
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:42,360
Estes.

24
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,180
So what does it mean?

25
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,470
Suppose I'm in some location,

26
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:47,140
Andi,

27
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:47,860
that is in,

28
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:48,310
you know,

29
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,230
supposed im and e d.

30
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:49,550
C.

31
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,490
On.

32
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:51,460
I want to search,

33
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,280
you know,

34
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,820
the files that has been started with city.

35
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,340
So what I can do here again?

36
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:57,790
Five.

37
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:03,220
This Syrian iStar for whatever the fires that is available on that location like city,

38
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,750
and then see after that also like CD ABC,

39
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:05,980
like,

40
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,560
see the room like silly because it will list all of you.

41
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,750
You have any files which is having the name on the city itself.

42
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:13,400
Silly itself.

43
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,730
The next one is your question,

44
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:17,010
Mark.

45
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:17,390
That is,

46
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:19,540
matches any single one character,

47
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,710
right.

48
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:23,850
So here you can see that it is searching for all,

49
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:24,630
like city,

50
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,640
a city room.

51
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,450
So three correct to say has been added.

52
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:32,290
But it will look for on a single character like half fire as the cushion lot.

53
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:35,260
So it will look for as he as D.

54
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:35,650
C.

55
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,560
S B if you have.

56
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,300
If I like as the baby,

57
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:48,030
that is not going to list you because cushion mark matches any single one character matches

58
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,060
any one of the characters.

59
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:49,790
So done.

60
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:50,220
One is one.

61
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,600
So let me move to us.

62
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,350
My lab obsession on Let's do some practice here support I won't do such You know,

63
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:02,270
the fires in my this location that has ended with dot com.

64
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,510
So here we have,

65
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:08,840
although puts So what I have used here ls slash CDC on.

66
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,240
After that,

67
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:16,920
I have used strips on dot com so you can see that all the fires it's ended with dot com and

68
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,200
I This is one thing.

69
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,330
Now I want to such in the same location that a D.

70
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:22,750
C.

71
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,540
Who was enough extension would be dot com,

72
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:32,330
But I want that file should be started with our and how we can do that I can simply pull

73
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,050
are here.

74
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,660
So we'll set for the files.

75
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,100
Who's started with,

76
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,210
you know are after that.

77
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,460
Whatever the name it could be.

78
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,550
Extension would be dot Confidently.

79
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,340
No.

80
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,320
Here you can see the output.

81
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,750
So this is the benefits off the wild cards,

82
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,650
right?

83
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,630
Suppose I'm here?

84
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,770
I'm going to get few fights,

85
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:56,990
like,

86
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:02,280
obviously not at it.

87
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,350
Be seated on it.

88
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:07,950
Hollowed image defies output or no,

89
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,440
I'm going to care Some other fights,

90
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,780
like my daughter.

91
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,560
See,

92
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:20,760
X y did not see on day like the f topsy.

93
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,340
So few files are crowded into this location.

94
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:32,020
So I want to search all the fights that has been started with daughter has taken such with

95
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:32,350
this.

96
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:35,720
I want to see all the fights that has been started.

97
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,180
That has been,

98
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:36,360
you know,

99
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,420
ended with dot C five this cover.

100
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:42,310
So they're simple examples which can be used to find out.

101
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,030
I want to search.

102
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:48,000
You know all the files whose extension is Darcy and knowledge.

103
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:57,070
I can use this one my head.

104
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:57,990
We have got an output.

105
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:02,300
That is one thing.

106
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,530
The next is you know,

107
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,240
the question Mark,

108
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:04,560
that is,

109
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:04,790
you know,

110
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,500
matches any single characters.

111
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,650
So how we can use that?

112
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,040
So that's a very simple,

113
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,730
you know.

114
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,330
So in this location,

115
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:17,850
Andi and I want to search for the fights.

116
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,300
They So let me do one thing.

117
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,530
Let me get few files here,

118
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:31,140
so I'm going to use touch file on day one dot 10 Dusty.

119
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:35,550
I can see that a lot of fights have been killed in here.

120
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,450
Okay,

121
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:41,460
so what I'm going to do and when we use ls file a star?

122
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,260
It is giving me all the fines,

123
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:44,750
right?

124
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,000
Who?

125
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,550
The starting is fine enough for that.

126
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,420
Whatever it could be,

127
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,250
it could be anything.

128
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,190
Suppose you know have changes.

129
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,190
Have taken every 5 to 10 more files.

130
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,330
Whose extension is dark.

131
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:56,740
I get.

132
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,140
I'm fighting.

133
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,090
This company will see that it is giving me all.

134
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,360
Put off all the fights.

135
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,580
Whether it's you know,

136
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:04,560
extension is you know dot txt dot com.

137
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,550
No,

138
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:11,690
to suppose.

139
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,220
Start off this.

140
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,630
I'm using this cushion month and not txt.

141
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,410
So what?

142
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,890
It is going toe out where it is going to give me.

143
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:23,160
So it will search for the files.

144
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:31,810
You know who's starting bodies file on after that single character like won t five,

145
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:32,570
you know,

146
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:38,250
79 This it 64 and two.

147
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,110
There's one more fighting.

148
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,800
This one here.

149
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,790
We have no God that were part of this fight,

150
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,770
because this file is having two characters.

151
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,480
Suppose I have credit one find,

152
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,460
like this one touch file on.

153
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,580
I'm giving this one authority doctor used to.

154
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,000
So you fighting this?

155
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,480
Come on.

156
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,140
I'm not getting this output.

157
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:03,120
I want to get this out by any news to cushion so it would suffer the fires.

158
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,050
Whose you know,

159
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,770
having two characters.

160
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,490
This one on this 12 characters.

161
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,330
Suppose I am having the file,

162
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,850
which is having three characters.

163
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:14,490
So I need to use three question marks.

164
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,450
Okay,

165
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:23,500
So this is one thing on Did suppose I want to use this?

166
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,360
The last one?

167
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:30,740
This is so how we can use that.

168
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:36,530
So here you can see that I have a lot of files that is ended with dot com for not txt so I

169
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,360
can use this one.

170
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:44,510
It's less a T C and I'm I'm already in this location on going to use this one on the this

171
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:47,750
one file on after that.

172
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:53,440
Closing it on this is tough dot So it would list.

173
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,640
Told me all the files that has been started with this one.

174
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,820
This is one thing we have here you're going to use txt s.

175
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,110
Well,

176
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:04,400
we do not have such any fighting.

177
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,880
It's txt.

178
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:12,680
So for their cell for this lecture hope you got an idea how we can use the wild cards.

179
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,690
Andi,

180
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:14,510
just google it.

181
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,330
We will see a lot of,

182
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:15,610
you know,

183
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:19,440
documents that we have for the wild cards on gets a lot of,

184
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:19,860
you know,

185
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,260
practice lab station as well.

186
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:25,170
So I've already shown a lot of practice for these wild cards,

187
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,090
Andi,

188
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,470
and do practice from your end as well.

189
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,350
On duh.

190
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:32,030
If you want to do some more practice,

191
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:35,800
so just Google and find a lot off exercise on my cards.

192
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,560
So that's very important to have in a practice by your side as well.

193
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,870
That's all.

194
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,740
But I take it will soon The next lecture
