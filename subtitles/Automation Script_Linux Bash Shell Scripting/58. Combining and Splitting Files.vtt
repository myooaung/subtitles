00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.950
next topic we have is combining and splitting files.

2
00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.350
You could combine multiple files into one,

3
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:18.350
and you could combine one file so you could split one file into multiple files,

4
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.770
like just an example right here.

5
00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.690
And you cat it for or three files you could up.

6
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.310
Put the cat output off all those files into 1/4 file,

7
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.400
which is you call it Filed four.

8
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.790
So what will happen is whatever is inside,

9
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.790
whatever the contents off those files 123 there will be combined.

10
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:46.450
And they were pushed out two word file for So that's how you combine it.

11
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.920
So how do you split it,

12
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.310
and why do we need to split it?

13
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:50.760
Okay,

14
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.210
well,

15
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.800
there are certain times when you do have big,

16
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.650
huge files and you do need toe either compress it.

17
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.930
If the compressing is not an option than what you could do is you could split it,

18
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.530
meaning your chop that file into different files.

19
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.070
And the reason you do that is because sometimes you have to send files across one computer

20
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.390
to another or to 1/3 party winder,

21
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.720
or,

22
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.110
if it's a log file,

23
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.070
that they have to check that the check and it's huge.

24
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.450
It's huge.

25
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.940
So the only way to do and your only friend is out there is the split.

26
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:32.780
So you split it,

27
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:33.320
chop it,

28
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.850
whichever the number of files that you want to do and boom,

29
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:36.480
you will have it.

30
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.400
So let's look at this file that we have,

31
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.670
Um and we will create some files.

32
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.640
And in this example,

33
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.170
you see,

34
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.550
I have a file and ah,

35
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.640
I'm splitting the file in 300 lines per file and putting it into ah,

36
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.870
file called child file.

37
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:57.460
Let's look at our Lennox machine and I will explain it to you much better while they're

38
00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.960
doing it through the command line.

39
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:05.330
Okay,

40
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.070
this is our legs terminal,

41
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.700
which you guys are very familiar with.

42
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.250
Okay,

43
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.680
we are in our home directory.

44
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.490
Just confirmed that,

45
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:19.560
so we don't have to put all the practice files or the stuffs that are not belong to other

46
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.260
directories.

47
00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.340
So we know we are in the right directory now.

48
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.000
I want you to create a file that's called it,

49
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.990
um,

50
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.220
countries are,

51
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.400
you know,

52
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.850
continents.

53
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.770
That's called country.

54
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:38.550
That's fine.

55
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.900
The file is created,

56
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.280
and I am using the I.

57
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.730
So the first line I'm gonna create is England.

58
00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:52.870
This is just a country.

59
00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.050
2nd 1 is U S C.

60
00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.830
3rd 1 is Canada and so on.

61
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:08.930
But if you don't know how to use the I at this point you will be learning the I later on.

62
00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.530
But if you don't know how to use V I at this point so what you could do is echo.

63
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.150
Let's remove the country's file,

64
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.730
then do echo.

65
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:25.380
But USA into countries cat it and you will see Yes,

66
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.080
it's there.

67
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.270
Next one,

68
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:42.120
you put an echo u K and U I'll put but to redirects to countries,

69
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.450
make sure it's there.

70
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:44.770
Yes,

71
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:45.950
we have two countries.

72
00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.060
We will keep doing that until we have some text in it.

73
00:03:51.060 --> 00:04:10.470
So u k u a e and um can and ah and for us on.

74
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:16.560
And so it's land.

75
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.350
I will stop here.

76
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.030
Japan.

77
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.250
So just do that.

78
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:28.110
Confirmed that you have all those contents in there.

79
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.190
So right now,

80
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.470
how maney lines we have will do.

81
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.450
We have seven,

82
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:46.420
So I'm gonna make split them into split and just check the option is minus spell.

83
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:57.390
Endless split two lines each off countries and I'm gonna put them in a file called Separate

84
00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.390
.

85
00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.550
Just sip and I'm gonna hit.

86
00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.370
Enter now let's see what we have.

87
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.120
So you see,

88
00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.760
automatically Lennox knows that once I'm gonna create file Sepp,

89
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:10.320
Of course,

90
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.390
I requested to create two in each file.

91
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:20.880
It has automatically appended with names like a a B a c a d.

92
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.370
So let's look at what's in our A file.

93
00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.840
We have USA and UK BB.

94
00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.440
Sorry,

95
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:41.420
A B you a in Canada a C.

96
00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:46.850
France since is the land and the last one is Japan.

97
00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.010
Okay,

98
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.250
so every file has two entries wide.

99
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.340
We don't have two entries in the last file.

100
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:55.670
Think about it.

101
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.250
I'm gonna give you a couple of seconds,

102
00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.310
Okay?

103
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:02.670
I hope you guessed it right,

104
00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:06.250
because we do not have.

105
00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.280
If you go to countries fall,

106
00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:14.590
we do not have the exact numbers meaning we don't have eight lines.

107
00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:20.140
So that's why it took the first to put it in one first to second file first to third file.

108
00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.560
And since we didn't have anyone,

109
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.100
Japan was the only one left alone.

110
00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:30.580
So our Japan and that's why it went just into one line to that file.

111
00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.340
That's how combining file and splitting files work.

112
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.190
Um,

113
00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.300
this is a helpful tool.

114
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.390
Then you have to split large,

115
00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:39.990
long,

116
00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:44.650
huge files and you have to transfer from one computer to another.
