1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,730
how everyone in this lecture will understand about the nomadic comparison.

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,390
So in the last few letters,

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:11,240
we understood about many Commons like desk.

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:11,730
Come on,

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,090
if else come on and many more commands.

6
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,190
So while using these commands many times,

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,870
we have to do the nomadic comparison.

8
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,330
So to do that,

9
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:22,120
no matter cos.

10
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,980
And we have to use different operators.

11
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:31,470
So this lecture will see what are those operators which can be used to do the nomadic

12
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,370
comparison.

13
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:36,800
So let's see nomadic comparison using the falling operators.

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:43,130
So these air operators you have used to do the nomadic comparison that is equal toe greater

15
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,090
than and called So that is d get her,

16
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:52,350
then Only that is DT alleys last night and he called to lt and Annie.

17
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,450
That is less than and that is not equal to that is any.

18
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:03,180
So I've created a simple script in which I have used all those operators.

19
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,350
So it's a very simple a scrip.

20
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:06,900
In the starting,

21
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,750
you can see that it is asking,

22
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,730
please under your age.

23
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:15,370
Obviously you're going toe under your is in some nomadic number.

24
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:20,940
It's an interior light 25 25 40 right,

25
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,450
so no matter comparison.

26
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,810
That is a number only.

27
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,220
So here you can see that.

28
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,930
Suppose you have enter that I'm a 10 year old.

29
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:30,460
You are going.

30
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,950
You have enter number 10.

31
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:37,920
Now let's see if test dollar eight.

32
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,530
Right.

33
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:43,430
So here Suppose you have entered attempts of 10 is going to save into this variable name

34
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,250
That is age.

35
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,690
Now in this line,

36
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,060
it is going to compare this one.

37
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:52,870
Here it is type headed with 10 is less than on equal to 13.

38
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,450
My condition has been satisfied here.

39
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,590
Then it will immediately echo that you are a child.

40
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,380
Suppose I have entered that I'm a 15 year old.

41
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,750
So what will happen here?

42
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,550
It will desk like 15 is less than or recorded.

43
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,590
13 condition is not satisfied here.

44
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,250
So it will move towards the next statement.

45
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,550
This one.

46
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,950
So this is Tim and I've used live.

47
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:21,200
And here you can see that I have used this one.

48
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,240
That is 1% twice time.

49
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:27,850
So my this condition on this condition we have to condition in this line.

50
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:33,410
So both the conditions should be satisfied then only it is going to tie that you are a teen

51
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:33,900
age.

52
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,130
Suppose I have type 15.

53
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:36,750
Let's see,

54
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:41,610
15 is greater than or recorded Harding?

55
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,450
Yes,

56
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:47,040
15 years less than on equal to hearing years.

57
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,650
My condition has been satisfied.

58
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,750
Here it is going to type that you are a teen age.

59
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:59,520
Suppose you have type 25 number So 25 number that is greater than 30 years.

60
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,120
25 number is last than any cold waiting.

61
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,840
No,

62
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,260
it is not satisfying here.

63
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,430
So it will move towards the next condition next statement.

64
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:13,440
So this 25 is greater than getting Yes,

65
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,390
25 is less than and equal to 40.

66
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,130
My condition has been satisfied.

67
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:24,990
It is going to tie that you are so this way you can do the pneumatic comparison.

68
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:29,010
So these air operators you have to use to make sure you keep in your mind that these

69
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,330
operators we have to do for the nomadic comparison.

70
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:37,840
So moving to the next property that is father a string comparison.

71
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,760
It stings some,

72
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:40,990
you know,

73
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,150
letter some war.

74
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:46,750
This team comparisons can be done using test if else left commands.

75
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,530
So here we have some,

76
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,050
you know,

77
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,460
examples And Syntex.

78
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,280
The strings are equal.

79
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,380
So you have to use this operator is equality.

80
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,480
Single time is toasting one called twisting toe.

81
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,570
These things are not equal.

82
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:06,820
So here this is a symbol for that exclamation is involved.

83
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:13,680
It is that my sting one is not equal to string Toe the land of the sting is zero.

84
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,670
What does it mean?

85
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:21,440
Suppose I have asked that Skip that please under your name on you have not entered anything

86
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,590
you have just simply press enter.

87
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:30,150
So how would I know that the user has not pressed anything while the salad scream are you?

88
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,190
This is stream hyphen,

89
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,530
dead and history.

90
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:36,160
So it will come to know that Oh,

91
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,700
you have no time Anything So we can respond back that if user if anybody who's executing

92
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,510
the script and if they have no time anything,

93
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:49,650
it will immediately reply back that you have to type something so you have to use hyphen

94
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,340
develops way have a lot of other options as well.

95
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,200
So here,

96
00:04:54,200 --> 00:05:00,470
after the simple script here for the fitting comparison Now it is asking toe under your

97
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,060
name.

98
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,360
So obviously you're going toe under your name.

99
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,430
It's a string on Lee was my name is Shaker so I'm going to type Chicana Suchai Keita It's

100
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,360
not a nomadic.

101
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,300
It says thing.

102
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,520
So it is going to save and Oh,

103
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,250
this variable the name off my variable His name now Echo test.

104
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,990
This variable is equality,

105
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,340
John.

106
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:26,000
So here you can see that I used single time is equal to So this is what I want to tell you

107
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,000
.

108
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,520
What are the operators we have?

109
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,550
The use further ist in comparison so dissatisfied him.

110
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,700
Suppose I have time,

111
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,010
John.

112
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,810
Only then you are selected for this job,

113
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:36,630
right?

114
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,970
Suppose have time like some other name.

115
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:44,180
Like sugar So let's see So she could is not satisfied here,

116
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:49,420
so it will move to the next line They live so here we have to condition first condition

117
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,720
that shakers should not be called John.

118
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,560
Yes,

119
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,000
that is satisfying One more condition.

120
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,040
It should not be an empty as well.

121
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,320
Right?

122
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,460
I used this sign.

123
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,190
It means that it should not be on empty as well.

124
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:06,590
I have type something So my condition is satisfying here then.

125
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:06,930
Sorry.

126
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:08,010
You are more selective.

127
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,530
Suppose you have not time.

128
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:16,140
Anything you have pressed enter Only then it is coming to this condition.

129
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:20,200
Suppose our press enter and I'm checking this here and remains.

130
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,960
This one is not equal to John.

131
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,170
This has been certified here.

132
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,440
Suppose I have press,

133
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,140
enter only and press.

134
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:32,060
So I'm just checking with this so empty is not equal to join.

135
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,170
This has been 70.

136
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,220
This has been satisfied.

137
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,240
But I have to,

138
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:35,600
you know,

139
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,050
check for this condition as well.

140
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,390
It is saying that it should not be an empty.

141
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:42,150
So this this condition is not satisfying here.

142
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,620
So it will be coming here it live.

143
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,960
It should not be an empty please.

144
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,890
Under your name cannot be except on empty name.

145
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,340
So there's a simple,

146
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:51,530
you know,

147
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:57,090
escape in which I have tried to show you how to do the distinct comparison So made motive

148
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:00,300
off the selected is to understand the operators.

149
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,640
That is for your string comparison This one This one on this one.

150
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,010
Hyphen!

151
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:05,340
Jared!

152
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,040
Exclamation!

153
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,850
All those things!

154
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,050
So friend there.

155
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:11,680
So for the selected banks in the next lecture will show you what are the you know,

156
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,350
file attributes comparison.

157
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,140
So thanks for watching.

158
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:14,890
If you have time,

159
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,390
please join with the next lecture
