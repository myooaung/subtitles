00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.690
some of the most important things that you should know about Lennox.

2
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.850
The Knicks had a super administrator account called Route.

3
00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:17.280
Just like of Windows Has Administrator account with Lennox has Are UNIX System has ruled

4
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.850
account that could do anything that could actually clean out the entire file system.

5
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.390
Fruit is the most powerful account that can create,

6
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.200
modified the lead accounts and make changes to system configuration files.

7
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.960
Lennox is case sensitive system,

8
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.960
meaning if you typing in in finally with upper case,

9
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.650
it will be a per case,

10
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.970
not like windows of upper case.

11
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.010
Lower case does not matter in minutes.

12
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.120
It does matter.

13
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.340
So keep that in mind.

14
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.990
Avoid using finally,

15
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.860
with spaces.

16
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:52.590
Lennox.

17
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.960
Of course,

18
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.350
it does not like spaces in the final aim,

19
00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.240
so try to avoid any file names that has spaces in them.
