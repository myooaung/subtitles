00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
copy files to remote hosts.

2
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.150
Um,

3
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.480
in this lesson,

4
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.700
we are actually going to write a script.

5
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.240
This is also ah,

6
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.350
four loops script.

7
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:13.550
Very useful.

8
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:14.340
Ah,

9
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.770
I used it many times,

10
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:21.670
and I know a lot of my friends who are in I T or in Lenox write scripts that,

11
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:22.050
actually,

12
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.450
copies filed from one location to multiple servers.

13
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:32.760
You could copy files from one system and to second system to the third system using

14
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.550
commands like FTP or sftp.

15
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.810
But if you have multiple systems,

16
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.920
you don't want to do it one by one by one.

17
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.490
So this is a very short lesson.

18
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.800
I wanted to show you how you could copy files and how you could use four Luke commands for

19
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:46.150
that.

20
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.790
And if you remember exactly how for her loop is done,

21
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.710
I'm sure by now you are exporting for loop,

22
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.810
and you should be able to do yourself.

23
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:55.370
If not,

24
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.410
just follow me,

25
00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.620
and I will go into my machine and clear the screen.

26
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.050
I will name this script as a copy.

27
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:20.950
Miles so remote and you know what we have to do then,

28
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:21.690
uh,

29
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:31.150
date you a 8 2020 um,

30
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.250
description.

31
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.250
This script Well,

32
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.750
copy falls to remote.

33
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:42.920
Hey,

34
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:43.320
guys,

35
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.350
I missed one thing.

36
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.750
What is that?

37
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.820
Yes,

38
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:50.680
it's very important.

39
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:57.070
Because if you are writing a script and you have multiple system engineers administrator in

40
00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.110
your department,

41
00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.250
they also writing the script.

42
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.550
Then this is the easiest way to find out who wrote that.

43
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.450
And they would simply get in touch with you and ask you Hey,

44
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.940
the script is not doing what we wanted to do.

45
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:10.950
Can you modified?

46
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:11.920
Okay,

47
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.050
so now four,

48
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.750
I pick I variable again.

49
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.310
N Now you put the host name or the i p.

50
00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.750
Address of the machine that you want to transfer it.

51
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.780
Um Just says push just for giggles.

52
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:30.730
I'll put the host name,

53
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:31.250
Let's say,

54
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.950
um red hat one red hat to red hat three.

55
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:37.860
Read ahead.

56
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.820
Four or as many servers that you want to transfer over.

57
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:41.450
You could do that.

58
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.820
So you know that now you're putting four red hat servers into a container and the container

59
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.420
name is I Okay,

60
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.630
it is into container.

61
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:51.550
What do you want to do?

62
00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.820
He wanted to do a CP off.

63
00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.960
Ah,

64
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:56.650
file.

65
00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:57.530
Right.

66
00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:58.930
You want to transfer the partner?

67
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.270
So the file name is like some file.

68
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.750
I don't know which.

69
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.930
Because this script that I'm writing,

70
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.370
it's just a lab.

71
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.180
A test script.

72
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:14.050
I am not going to test or run the script because I do not have multiple than X servers in

73
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.050
my lab environment.

74
00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.610
If you do have it,

75
00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.870
then you could go in and actually change the host name right here,

76
00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.350
which is right Had 123 to the actual host name that you have and to the actual some file to

77
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.250
the actual file.

78
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.900
Okay,

79
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.430
so you're a CP.

80
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:37.630
Some file wear to I eyes what isa container and the container has what container has all

81
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.840
your host names and colon slash.

82
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:50.720
Let's say you want to transfer to 10 and this is right here is just a standard way right

83
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.820
here,

84
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.550
starting from calling two if you want to transfer while,

85
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.960
and I'm sure you know that.

86
00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.980
And so this is actually,

87
00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:01.530
as you know,

88
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:02.670
I let me repeat it again.

89
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.120
This is going to copy some files to read,

90
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.850
had 123 and four.

91
00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.860
And if you have multiple files,

92
00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.290
you could also what you could do.

93
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.600
You could put all those files in Ah,

94
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.270
file.

95
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:17.070
Create a file.

96
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.690
That's a,

97
00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:18.700
um,

98
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.150
ABC and put all the list.

99
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.850
Let's see if you have 100 servers,

100
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.150
then you don't want to write those hundreds over right here.

101
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.700
And what do you have to do?

102
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.150
You have to specify.

103
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.360
Ah,

104
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.150
variable.

105
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:37.650
That would do a That's it is a variable hat.

106
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.440
Their files.

107
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.150
If the file is slash home,

108
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.950
I have solved ABC.

109
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:55.450
You catting their file now you're telling it for while in dollar a,

110
00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.050
then you do same thing again.

111
00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.760
So now you don't have to special all your host names into the script.

112
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.710
You could specify all your hosting Minto file and then you tell the script to go and read

113
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.050
their fall and execute that command against.

114
00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.540
That's pretty much it about this lesson.

115
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:14.290
Ah,

116
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.950
if you actually have multiple hosts that you could try on,

117
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.450
go ahead and try,

118
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:20.450
and I'm sure your war
