00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.490
however,

2
00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.650
if one So this lecture will do some more practice using come online argument.

3
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.640
So I'm going to create a simple script that is,

4
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.170
addition off two numbers.

5
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.550
But those two numbers I'm going to pass on as an argument to the script.

6
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.450
So let him feel the script are additional to number.

7
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:30.340
So I'm going to use a name of variable it.

8
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.950
That is my first on woman.

9
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.440
These,

10
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.630
my second are woman,

11
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:35.550
right?

12
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.090
So while executing this script,

13
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.510
I need to supply the number that is number eight and number two like,

14
00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.570
supposed 10 number I have supplied on 20 number.

15
00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.010
So 10 plus 10.

16
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.710
10 is my dollar.

17
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.580
One that is forced.

18
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.760
Our woman see is the,

19
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.650
you know,

20
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.400
some off board the numbers.

21
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.060
That is it plus dollar.

22
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.530
Be right after that echo on.

23
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.340
I'm like a pig.

24
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.890
Some off two numbers.

25
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.370
Uh,

26
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.900
that is See,

27
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.290
like about from that.

28
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.080
Let me print,

29
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.800
you know,

30
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:26.150
arguments past to tell number off parliaments fast.

31
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.700
That is dollar hash,

32
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.320
Right.

33
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.810
Apart from that,

34
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.490
if you want to bring the arguments that we have passed to the script,

35
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:46.950
suppose I have passed our woman number 20 and 30 I want that when my script,

36
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:47.340
you know,

37
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.450
executed It should also bring the arguments that we have supplied with a script.

38
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.760
So for that,

39
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.300
you know you have to use print.

40
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.800
Hold on.

41
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.870
Are humans Pasto this script?

42
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.330
So we have to commands for them.

43
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:14.490
The 1st 1 is your That is dollar and the rib on the second.

44
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.620
Come on is that is dollar Astra's,

45
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.760
this one.

46
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:28.070
So it will simple execute this command So we'll see that output aboard the commanders seem

47
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.070
.

48
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.440
But there's a difference,

49
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.680
so we'll understand the difference.

50
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.970
So let me first,

51
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:32.400
you know,

52
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.520
make it executable.

53
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.650
Okay?

54
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.050
Cactus.

55
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.250
Okay,

56
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.860
so I'm going to add the perimeter.

57
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.560
That is 12 plus 30.

58
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.130
So 12 is going to save on my variable.

59
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.310
A on 30 is going to save on my variable.

60
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.490
Be right,

61
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:54.300
This one.

62
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.290
So here we have our I go something.

63
00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.750
Texeira,

64
00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.090
Let's see where we have a center.

65
00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.460
Sarah.

66
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.540
Okay.

67
00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.930
I have to give us space here.

68
00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.320
I don't need to give this one like,

69
00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.190
but I So that was the script.

70
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.660
My Okay.

71
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.000
I'm going to exhibit this one.

72
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.680
I can see that I have got an output.

73
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.520
Right?

74
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.550
Some of to number that is 42.

75
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:27.010
So that is my 12 plus 30 is 42 obviously total number of arguments that is,

76
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.140
to 12 on 30.

77
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.430
He had been all the arguments passed through this camp.

78
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.180
So here it simply passed,

79
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.550
you know,

80
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.380
12 and 30 with the second come on.

81
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.350
That is dollar Rest is also have got the same output.

82
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.230
Then what is the difference but in both the command?

83
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.530
So there's very important an interview question as well.

84
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.010
So let's in this time,

85
00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.840
see if you're going to use this.

86
00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.450
Come on,

87
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.780
it is going to print the arguments.

88
00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:03.020
Your argument is your dollar one dollar too right on while it really printed,

89
00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.750
you will see there is a space by 12 and then a space and 30.

90
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.150
So that's the default behavior off your dollar at the scene.

91
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:19.020
But if you want that when the argument should be printed while exhibiting my script,

92
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.170
it should follow some different pattern.

93
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.450
I want that it should be like this one,

94
00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.590
I wonder.

95
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.110
Should be like printing dollar one on I wanted should be printed like it should be comma

96
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.850
this way.

97
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:36.650
So if you want to change the deformed behavior.

98
00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.980
How you know the arguments should be in a printed.

99
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.320
Then you have to go with this one.

100
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.570
That is this $1 Estrich.

101
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.520
So you can take the different behavior.

102
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.000
How we gonna do with the help off?

103
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.550
If s if a little bit We had discussed aboard I first.

104
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:54.300
Initially.

105
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.950
So here you have to use my effects.

106
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.010
My office.

107
00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.660
I did.

108
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.650
I'm going to use this one.

109
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:08.550
So deport favorites that this space on then tab and next line.

110
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.220
So that's before baby off your infests.

111
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:17.440
So before behavior for both the commonest seem But I won't detain the behavior off this one

112
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.440
.

113
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.800
So here I have to use a comma on.

114
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.160
Then I'm again going to execute this one.

115
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.420
And I'm putting 13 and 40.

116
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.970
I can see that both outputs are different now,

117
00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:32.940
right?

118
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.830
Cat s so that here after that,

119
00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.280
before baby off affairs let it was Tab Sunny.

120
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.540
It was a space between the arguments 12 and 13 and 14.

121
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.780
You'll see a space Now you can see I have to use the default behavior off.

122
00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.170
I first with coma.

123
00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:53.290
Right?

124
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.860
So with all the arguments you can see Akamai's there.

125
00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:57.260
Right?

126
00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:02.410
So when their son for this lecture hope you have understood the difference between dollar

127
00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.050
at a rate and dollar gastric.

128
00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.140
So thanks.

129
00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.420
So watch if you have time,

130
00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.680
please.

131
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.830
Gently in the next lecture.
