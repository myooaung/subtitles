00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200
how everyone in the selected will understand a very simple and interesting topic.

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.420
Elias is Elias is is just like a shortcut commands.

3
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.680
So in simple words,

4
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.720
suppose there is a Landy Come on,

5
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.600
like Ellis happen.

6
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.180
Antilla.

7
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.950
But I want a shortcut to that,

8
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:28.310
like I want to type a single character like L only and I want to get the same output as I

9
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.130
was getting in l.

10
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.200
A.

11
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.810
Seven idea.

12
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:30.260
Come on.

13
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.480
So in that case,

14
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:38.650
I have to create the Elia's So Elia's come on can be used to display list off.

15
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.520
All define Elia's so feel simple.

16
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.160
Fire Elias and enter It will see water.

17
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.010
Old Elia's has been defined for that user.

18
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.930
If you have logged into a normal user on If you're fighting Elia's,

19
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.730
so it will show you the aliases for that user.

20
00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:02.290
I suppose there's a user like John and John has skated fuel e asses.

21
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.960
As for their,

22
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:04.390
you know,

23
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.240
you know the car Mandel S.

24
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.690
P s for their convenient.

25
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:14.120
No user wants that whenever he or she longs to the box,

26
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.340
those Elias is should be automatically up line.

27
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.660
So in that case,

28
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.560
users need to,

29
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.780
you know,

30
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:20.690
added this fine.

31
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.290
That is a bash profile,

32
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.680
Bashar,

33
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.350
See profile.

34
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.460
I need to put those ideas into that file.

35
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.540
So whenever the user is going along to the box,

36
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.290
those Elia's will be automatically applied for that using.

37
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.750
So let me long into the box and we'll show you how to,

38
00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:38.040
you know,

39
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.750
create and use.

40
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.790
Elias is first of all,

41
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.830
I will show you the syntax off simple Aaliyah's you need to fire Elias.

42
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.990
Name any name you can give on here the common like any.

43
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.690
Come on for what you want to create,

44
00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.560
Value us like so here.

45
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.150
I'm going to create an Elias for a common like up time.

46
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.450
Now I want to use only a single collector You.

47
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.120
So I have given Elia's name.

48
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.910
That is a shortcut.

49
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:08.900
Name is you.

50
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:09.880
For which Come on,

51
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.820
that is my up time.

52
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:11.160
Come on.

53
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.880
So this has been good or no?

54
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.680
So if I'm fighting up time,

55
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.330
I'm getting the output of that time on.

56
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.260
If I'm simple firing you,

57
00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.630
I will get the same out because I have created a short cut off up time command that is a

58
00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:26.680
single character,

59
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.940
a single character that is you like this way you can clearly no other Elias as well like I

60
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:34.750
want to create,

61
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:35.920
you know,

62
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:36.410
see,

63
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.660
notice for clear.

64
00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.190
So clear is a common.

65
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.370
You can see that which will clear this screen Right on.

66
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.760
Let me care one more.

67
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.760
That is easy call to date.

68
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.840
So you found Bindi.

69
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.100
So these are the aliases I have created for user route because I have loved into the boss

70
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.150
as a usual route.

71
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.260
If I'm hiring Elias symbol,

72
00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.600
come on.

73
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.960
Here.

74
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.130
You will see that whatever the Elia's have defined,

75
00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.170
it is showing there.

76
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:12.370
So l e l c that is far clear on the data have created on this one up time.

77
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.290
So three el es I have corrected on.

78
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.960
Apart from that,

79
00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.790
you can see that the system has defined fuel es by their own.

80
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.850
So the other's ideas I have not defined that has been defined by o system.

81
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.690
So that is one thing right now.

82
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.910
Suppose you know I want to,

83
00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:29.350
you know,

84
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.700
create an alias for a user.

85
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:32.820
And before that support,

86
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:33.200
I won't.

87
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.880
Do you no remove or,

88
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:35.250
you know,

89
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.160
remove the Elias.

90
00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.460
Then what is the common for that?

91
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.870
So That is an early US very simple.

92
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:41.490
And after that,

93
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:46.360
you have to give the Aaliyah's name so you can put you sew up time.

94
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.560
This one will be removed now.

95
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.950
So let me show you.

96
00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.980
I can see then the output.

97
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.490
This Elias U is not showing there because I have removed at Elia's.

98
00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.220
So it's very simple to,

99
00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.720
you know,

100
00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.880
assign are removed.

101
00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:59.550
Elia's.

102
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.220
The next thing is,

103
00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.680
you know how to do that.

104
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.570
How do you know?

105
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.760
Make it a permanent for any user.

106
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.810
So I haven't used a life,

107
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:08.170
John.

108
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.880
So I'm going to log into the box as John User.

109
00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.100
So I have looked into the box as a user.

110
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:16.480
John,

111
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.580
I'm in this location.

112
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:19.360
You will see.

113
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.110
Ah,

114
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.730
hidden file.

115
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.680
That is Bash,

116
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.960
daughter.

117
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.430
I'll see.

118
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:31.760
I'm going to add in this file on the last time I'm going to put fuel es is so like this one

119
00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.760
.

120
00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:32.330
Elias,

121
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.850
This one Onda See,

122
00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.650
that is clear.

123
00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.880
Well,

124
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.960
I'm giving l that is far Unless I find an tear.

125
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:55.930
Andi And when Morelia's I want to give like you can give any Ah,

126
00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:56.340
yes,

127
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.230
that is up to you.

128
00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.850
Suppose you know Ah,

129
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.390
I have a common like,

130
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.150
um Okay,

131
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.880
so So a little bit coming.

132
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:10.060
Like,

133
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.290
um,

134
00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:11.590
up did you can put,

135
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.830
like,

136
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.800
update on here.

137
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:22.990
You give e m object three in?

138
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.190
Well,

139
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.450
yes,

140
00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:24.630
I have different for that either.

141
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:32.540
So if I am fighting Elias here so that it is not going to show you because to make it,

142
00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.790
you know,

143
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:33.460
visible there.

144
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.900
I have to re log into the system as it uses John.

145
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.950
So I'm using such user created from here.

146
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.760
If I am finding see here,

147
00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.800
you can see that as a heart is not applied.

148
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.200
So I need to,

149
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.390
you know,

150
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.310
re log into the box as they use up.

151
00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.750
John,

152
00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.650
all my Elia's has been applied.

153
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:52.560
If you want to see,

154
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.460
you can check it with that.

155
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.490
I can see that this sea is clearly showing that this,

156
00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.720
um,

157
00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.930
update on this.

158
00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:00.540
The 3rd 1 is my this one.

159
00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:01.280
Let's have an idea.

160
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.600
So if I'm fighting,

161
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.160
l only you can see that I'm getting the same output.

162
00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:05.390
Ellis,

163
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:06.150
have an idea.

164
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.250
Let me go to tamp location.

165
00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:12.660
You can see that I am getting out output at same.

166
00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.780
I will be getting over with less of an idea.

167
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.690
Okay.

168
00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:17.460
Sees what?

169
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:17.950
Clear.

170
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.060
So that is for for money,

171
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.750
right?

172
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.590
So I never But John user is going too long into the box,

173
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.830
so these areas will be automatically,

174
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:27.210
you know,

175
00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:28.100
applied.

176
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.250
They suppose,

177
00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:30.510
you know,

178
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:31.820
if I'm fighting Elias here,

179
00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.470
even see that different ideas are there.

180
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.830
Suppose I am firing this Alice Common.

181
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:41.480
So here you can see that the system has already applied Somalia's for them in the L s

182
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:41.780
command.

183
00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.000
You will see that some color is coming,

184
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.090
because off this,

185
00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:49.420
like so it's basically just running this.

186
00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:49.820
Come on.

187
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:55.250
So that's why you know I'm getting seen or different color for this blue color is coming.

188
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:56.110
Okay.

189
00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:57.780
Suppose I want to,

190
00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:58.280
you know,

191
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.250
ignore any ideas and he has already created.

192
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:02.280
And I want to ignore it,

193
00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:02.980
like this one.

194
00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:03.780
You can see some,

195
00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:04.130
you know,

196
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:05.350
colored output is there.

197
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:07.610
So this Elliot I want to ignore.

198
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:08.840
So if you want to,

199
00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:09.130
you know,

200
00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:13.250
ignore any Elias you can simple use this backs less.

201
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.260
Alice.

202
00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.000
I can see that I'm getting our put off.

203
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.660
Only ls.

204
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:18.070
Come on.

205
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:22.350
The only earth which was defined for Ellis has been ignored now.

206
00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:29.190
So this way I can ignore and Elia's as well they If I am fighting the C,

207
00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:30.490
I scared me clear.

208
00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:32.190
But if I am oneness slash C,

209
00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:33.430
it is going to ignore this one.

210
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:38.560
You can also use this one double court as well,

211
00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.080
so this will do the same thing as your satisfaction.

212
00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:41.360
ISS.

213
00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.260
So from the vessel for destructive hope.

214
00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:48.250
You have got an i d off Elia's startling practice from yourself as well,

215
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:50.570
so they're solvable to in the next lecture.
