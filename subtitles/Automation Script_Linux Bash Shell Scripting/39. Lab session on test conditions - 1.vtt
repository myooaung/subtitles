00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.980
how everyone.

2
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.050
So this is a practice lab session.

3
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:05.950
So in this practical obsession,

4
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.850
I'm going to show you how to use the test common in conditional execution.

5
00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.800
So I'm going to care A symbol,

6
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.550
a script here.

7
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.260
So in this clip,

8
00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:28.110
I'm going to ask for the user to enter a number 100 on will cross check this condition

9
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.490
whether the user has under 100 number or not using test.

10
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.830
Come on.

11
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:47.040
So first time window after they user like enter Number 100 on the credible name is you can

12
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.590
give any name.

13
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.010
I've used number.

14
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.850
Ok,

15
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.050
now I'm going to use check.

16
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.170
No,

17
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.480
Jack.

18
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:54.910
A stunner.

19
00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:08.420
If desk dollar number is equal to 100 the user has under number 100 then echo.

20
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.240
Good.

21
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.150
You have and hurt number 100.

22
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:26.870
This is what I'm closing it here I am going to use another statement if you can also use

23
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.080
else as well.

24
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.240
But I wonder so other way as well.

25
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:39.440
If test dollar number is not equal 200 that might be possible that the user has entered in

26
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.550
some different number.

27
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.300
So in that case,

28
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.950
you can type echo.

29
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:58.540
Why did you and another number I'm closing it.

30
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.240
So let me make it executive in this one.

31
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.980
Okay?

32
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:04.670
And I was good in here.

33
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.940
And so the number 100 it is asking me.

34
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.000
I'm going to put 100.

35
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.360
Go.

36
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.650
Do you have enter Number 100?

37
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:11.630
Okay,

38
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.750
I'm going to add some other number like this one.

39
00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.350
Why did you enter another number?

40
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.770
So we have two conditions here you're going to use else as well.

41
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.150
I start off this.

42
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.050
Simply put this one here,

43
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.950
okay?

44
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.250
Headed into port else,

45
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.340
so as well.

46
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.010
Also want care because the user can put 100 or some other number.

47
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.370
Right.

48
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.450
So let me come on from here and I get I'm going to run this one.

49
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.700
This 100 you have under $100.

50
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.200
I'm putting this.

51
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.750
Why did you enter some of the number?

52
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.760
I'm going to bring this one.

53
00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.010
So from their soul for this like that in the next election,

54
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.640
I'm goingto get another skip on using the desk.

55
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.890
Come on.

56
00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:04.260
Only,

57
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.280
but that would be a little bit,

58
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.460
you know,

59
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.130
complicated.

60
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.830
I'm gonna be used,

61
00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:07.190
you know,

62
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.050
some more conditional statements like live else.

63
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.920
So thanks for watching,

64
00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:13.750
but I take it
