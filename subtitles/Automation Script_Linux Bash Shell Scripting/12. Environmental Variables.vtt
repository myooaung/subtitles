00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.770
Welcome to Atlantis classes.

2
00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.670
So let's continue and understand about the environmental variables.

3
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.140
The last lecture we have.

4
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:08.490
Simple,

5
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.320
understandable,

6
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.650
the local variables.

7
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.360
So where winter variables we can say an environmental variable is a level toe.

8
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.080
Any child process off the cell.

9
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.060
Some programs need environmental variables in order to function correctly.

10
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.390
Usually,

11
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.320
a shallow script defines on those in when environmental variables that are needed by the

12
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.350
program static islands.

13
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.000
So what does it mean?

14
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.960
It means stop environmental variables are inherited by the Chinese shells or how we can

15
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:38.630
define it.

16
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.400
We have to use the Commons export variable is going to value,

17
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.460
so let belong to my source and we'll explain you.

18
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.890
So this is myself.

19
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.410
Suppose you know I have given is equal to let me clear it.

20
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.890
Okay,

21
00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:02.350
suppose after it is a good 100.

22
00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.390
Okay,

23
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:14.730
on the basic Alito 200 season got back in his expression.

24
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:26.680
These are my local variables,

25
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.210
I can see.

26
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.250
So let's unlistenable the environmental variables.

27
00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.950
I'm going to create a simple skip,

28
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:49.980
and the simplest kept like this is the simplest combat here have given busy quarto tienda

29
00:01:49.980 --> 00:02:07.370
on C is equal to dollar a plus dollar being this kid,

30
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.950
what I have done,

31
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.320
I have simply given visible do tender on sees 1/3 variable and that will be the some off

32
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.380
variable e and B But I have not defined what is in the script.

33
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.660
And at last it would equal whatever the value off.

34
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.160
So let me come out from that simply script have greater Let me get the script for you.

35
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.640
So this is a script 1/2 Okay,

36
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.780
Like it Make it executable.

37
00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:41.710
Now here I have given in this cell is equal Do 500 value of bees going to three under So

38
00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.550
see would be somewhere 800.

39
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:44.550
Let me is good.

40
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:52.260
I'm not getting the desired output isn't big because is a local very well.

41
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.590
And when I initiated this kid,

42
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.450
what happened?

43
00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:02.260
But J process has been initiated and I already served that these are local variables and

44
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.760
those variables is not,

45
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.980
you know,

46
00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.850
inherited toe any programs or any further shells.

47
00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.750
So it is not taking that value.

48
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.450
So that's why they accord local variables.

49
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.730
No,

50
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.950
What?

51
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:15.430
I'm adamant.

52
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.900
Delorme's so here.

53
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:24.530
If I'm giving is equal to export is equal to 200.

54
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:25.370
So what happened.

55
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:33.020
I have I have just created It is good to under But this is my environmental variable Now

56
00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.750
what happened?

57
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:41.780
If I'm again going as good the script I can see the output 400 100 plus 200 That is 400

58
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:48.890
Because I have created a is my variable on the value of my variable is 100 But that is my

59
00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.030
environmental variable This is not my local variable So from this shell,

60
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.710
any further shell is going to initiate it or we can see any child process is initiated So

61
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:00.590
this will Okay,

62
00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.090
it really did the simple definition off.

63
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.530
You know,

64
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:09.170
environmental variables are inherited by the Seychelles So whatever the child shells any

65
00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.110
program is initiated from their shop so it will take your environment available.

66
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.500
So this is the simple definition off you environmental Very bad But this example I can

67
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.870
understand it I can I hope that you can understand what is environmental Very bad.

68
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:33.030
So from their cell for this lecture hope you have understand the next elected will

69
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:39.080
understand about your system variables and what are different commands like your e envy and

70
00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.850
set commands.

71
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:40.650
So thanks for watching.

72
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:41.660
And if you have time,

73
00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.250
please join with me the next lecture
