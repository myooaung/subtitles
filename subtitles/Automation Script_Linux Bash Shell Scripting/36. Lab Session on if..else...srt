1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,050
how everyone.

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:06,850
So let's continue and do some more practice using if else in your script.

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:11,060
So my next script is very simple.

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:18,550
I'm going to ask for the user to enter some password on that password is going to save into

5
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,840
some variable on that.

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,520
Very well.

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,900
Im going toe compare with some in award or some safe password using if conditions.

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,810
If it is matches,

9
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:32,350
then I will echo that password verified else.

10
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:33,250
Password denied.

11
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,490
So let me,

12
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:34,850
Kate,

13
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:40,150
this escape a simple script in which I'm going to show you how we can use if else to check

14
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:40,780
the condition.

15
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:46,390
Okay,

16
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,320
So echo on.

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:01:00,400
Then enter the muscling Onda and I'm going to use hyphen s so that whatever the password is

18
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,560
you there's going to type.

19
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,300
It is not visible on the screen.

20
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,450
So that's why I have used have anus option.

21
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:06,980
Okay,

22
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:10,040
Now the user is going toe enter some passport.

23
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,570
That password is going to save until this variable.

24
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,070
So this is a name of variable.

25
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:28,620
Now I'm going to use a felt condition if my this little okay is equal to I'm giving pass

26
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:28,720
for,

27
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:28,930
like,

28
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:36,250
reading then If it is satisfied if this line is satisfied means that the out port,

29
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:41,850
after the companies and output would leave one zero for it is not satisfied.

30
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,470
One means the condition is too.

31
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,460
It is satisfied.

32
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,620
Then my skin will move to the next line.

33
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,050
That is after then.

34
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,240
Okay.

35
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,440
On here.

36
00:01:52,440 --> 00:02:00,130
I can put like echo plus one verified else.

37
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:03,870
Suppose you have our enters some other passport apart from Reddit.

38
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,320
In that case,

39
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,820
it will move to the line,

40
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:11,310
which is started with else Echo bus.

41
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:11,650
What?

42
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:12,350
Denied?

43
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:15,210
If so,

44
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,190
that's a very simple script.

45
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,150
Let me come out dark.

46
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,130
Let me make it executable.

47
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:24,450
Okay,

48
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,020
so I'm going to execute this car.

49
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,850
It is asking for the password.

50
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:30,820
I'm going to type.

51
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,160
Ready?

52
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,050
Plus a very fight.

53
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:38,670
I'm going to type in a 12345 password.

54
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,250
Denied.

55
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,050
Again.

56
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:43,150
I'm going to type some other like anything by Sunday night.

57
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,230
So here again,

58
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,090
understand?

59
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,150
How have used this,

60
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:53,340
if else to compare the conditions.

61
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,050
Right.

62
00:02:54,050 --> 00:03:00,310
So here you can see that I have used if it is comparing the entered password with a red

63
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:00,580
head.

64
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,200
Okay,

65
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,660
Now moving to the next 50.

66
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,990
Now this condition statements.

67
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,400
So in this you know people,

68
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,700
you will see that they have used,

69
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:11,900
you know,

70
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,170
multiple conditions.

71
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:15,570
And if you have multiple conditions,

72
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,850
then you can use a lift.

73
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:19,690
Suppose I was talking with my first sentence.

74
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:27,540
Like if on some condition are there like condition could be like anything I suppose a user

75
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:27,850
has,

76
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:28,420
you know,

77
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:34,650
enter some number and I want to check that the number is our even our zero.

78
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,180
So that gives our views,

79
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:36,440
you know,

80
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,770
multiple conditions.

81
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:38,980
So if you have,

82
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,540
you know,

83
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:45,020
more than one condition to satisfy or to check In that case,

84
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,250
you can use a lift.

85
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,960
So first condition here.

86
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,820
If it is satisfied,

87
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,090
then it will be done here.

88
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,770
It is not going to with the next one.

89
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:56,590
If it is not satisfied than it will look for the next expression.

90
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,480
Okay,

91
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,710
If it is satisfied here,

92
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,180
then it will print.

93
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,910
It will do whatever you have mentioned here again.

94
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:03,940
If it is not satisfied,

95
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,350
you can use another.

96
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,450
You know it live.

97
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:14,090
And at last you have come to We know that if you feel that now I have left on living one

98
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,550
condition then you can use with else.

99
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,450
Okay,

100
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:19,300
so here,

101
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,870
you can use multiple conditions.

102
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,160
So,

103
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,070
friend there so far this lecture in the next lecture,

104
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:30,800
I'm goingto Crayolas shall escape to check if the number you enter is are even on zero.

105
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,460
So for that,

106
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,400
I'm gonna be use a simple,

107
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,980
shallow script in which I'm going to,

108
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:36,330
you know,

109
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:42,220
use multiple conditions using if else and l f So thanks a watch.

110
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:42,920
If you have time,

111
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,280
please join me in the next lecture.
