1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
Hi,

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:03,600
everyone.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,640
Let's go.

4
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,100
Our our celeb us.

5
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,960
What exactly are we going to cover in this class?

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:17,050
I have actually divided my class into five different sections.

7
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,050
Section one,

8
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,680
which is the lab set up in this section.

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,050
We will cover what is award for machine.

10
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:27,630
How does it work?

11
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:34,680
Downloading and installing award jewel box creating first worship machine and doing the

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,650
linens installation.

13
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:36,410
Now,

14
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:36,760
please.

15
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,490
Remember,

16
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:45,250
this section is for those who actually have never installed or who do want to install a lab

17
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:51,440
linens machine in their laptop or their work station if you already have Ah,

18
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,480
Lennox machine.

19
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,270
And you wanted to start practicing your land exc scripting skills from this course.

20
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:04,230
Then you could simply skip through this entire section and go right into Section two in

21
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,710
section two will start off with shell scripting basics.

22
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,060
And what those basics are starting with Colonel.

23
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,520
How Colonel interact with shell.

24
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,620
What is a shelter shell scripting How the shell scripting Come along.

25
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,850
How can we take advantage off it?

26
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,930
What are the different type of shells?

27
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:23,350
Of course,

28
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,000
there are tons of different shells.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,830
Eash Okay,

30
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:26,730
Shal see,

31
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:27,750
show bashful.

32
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,920
What is our focus in this limp in this up in this class.

33
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,450
And of course,

34
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:33,880
our focus is bash scripting.

35
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,150
But I will cover other shells as well.

36
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,950
Starting a shell,

37
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,750
how to run a shell script,

38
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:46,690
then moving on to section three we have in section three.

39
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,160
We will cover the scripting standards.

40
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,550
What exactly the standards that you should follow when you are riding a shells.

41
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:57,410
And those are how to name yourself shell scripts.

42
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,160
In this way,

43
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,550
you would have proper naming convention for your shells,

44
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:05,610
script file permissions.

45
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,720
So when you create a script,

46
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:13,060
you would need a Pacific execute herbal permissions and what those permissions are,

47
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,850
and how can we assign them,

48
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,160
then shell scripting format.

49
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,900
What goes inside of a script?

50
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,280
What are the comments?

51
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:20,950
What is,

52
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,050
um where do you define the shell?

53
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:29,350
What are the variables that sequence off shell script?

54
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,970
Then we'll wing onto the section four,

55
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:36,070
which is very going to start off his actual writing scrips,

56
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,850
the basic shell scripts.

57
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:41,050
And I'm not gonna overload you on this section with,

58
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:41,260
like,

59
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,150
huge script.

60
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,710
So I'm gonna start.

61
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:48,850
I'm gonna take baby steps with you as if you are starting fresh with me and Lennox Shell

62
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:49,350
scripting.

63
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:56,470
Then I'll show you how to create your first group script to run basic task in those task.

64
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,970
Our system.

65
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:57,950
Administrative tasks.

66
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,810
Defining variables,

67
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:00,830
input output,

68
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:01,150
script,

69
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,950
conditional scripts.

70
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,080
If else statements groups will cover the case statements,

71
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,540
groups look over.

72
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,240
Four loose skirts will write it.

73
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,740
I'll give you examples will create do wild scripts.

74
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,750
How do they work?

75
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,570
What are the exits Status?

76
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:20,850
How can be used the exit status and shell scripting and make use off it.

77
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,580
And then we have a bunch of handouts,

78
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:28,940
as you could read on shell scripting that will help you write war script and understand

79
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,860
scripting details.

80
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:35,140
Six Scripting basics as well moving on to the Section five,

81
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,250
which is our biggest section,

82
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,620
and you should be ready for this section.

83
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,160
By the time you come to this,

84
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,130
you would know exactly how to start,

85
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,820
how to get your hands dirty,

86
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,940
and you are already on a driving seat.

87
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,650
At this point,

88
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,230
this is where we have.

89
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:53,180
He will core their real life scripting examples,

90
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,280
and some off them are accessing data from falls.

91
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,580
Check remote server connective ity script for scheduling and notification script to delete

92
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:09,050
all files backup file systems when you wanted to back up your system and you don't have a

93
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,440
1/3 party backup tool.

94
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,350
How you could use a scripting language to do that?

95
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:17,920
Four Loops Scripts for Fire System That is,

96
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:23,440
for one of the section and I have not included just 14 loop This lesson.

97
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,710
This Pacific lesson would have like four or five four loop scripts that I have covered in

98
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,090
this one section.

99
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,650
So in this one lesson,

100
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:36,470
then four Loops group for file system to now.

101
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:37,650
This is another lesson.

102
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:40,760
I have split that entire lesson into two lessons.

103
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,020
Why?

104
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:48,840
Because I'm covering like 5 to 8 different scripts moving on copy files to remote host user

105
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,350
directory assignment.

106
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:56,010
You will see how we could check if if a directory exists and doesn't belong to a user.

107
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,570
This is a security risk.

108
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,850
How we could put a script around in real life examples.

109
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:03,490
A game moving on to Section five.

110
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,950
Section five is not finish it.

111
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:09,560
List of user logged in by date Central Logging script.

112
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,170
If you do not have Splunk,

113
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:15,290
which is a Logan logging third party tool in your environment,

114
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,170
it's OK.

115
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,430
We'll create our own Splunk.

116
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:24,190
Our own logging system locks script that will run like a Splunk collection logs script for

117
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:28,540
user CAL management Disabled in active users.

118
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,850
That's a scribble core check process status and killing it.

119
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,480
Status and total number of files.

120
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,250
Scripts to create system inventory,

121
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,290
getting online help,

122
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,380
homework.

123
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,160
And there's gonna be so much,

124
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,400
many other scripts that I cannot just add everything here in the syllabus that I will be

125
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,020
keep adding it later on.

126
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:55,250
So this is the This is what be actually going to cover in this entire course.

127
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,150
So are you ready with me?

128
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,680
Are you ready to go ahead and start?

129
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,450
Let's go.
