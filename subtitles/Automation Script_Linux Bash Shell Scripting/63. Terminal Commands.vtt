00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.980
terminal commands.

2
00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:08.920
There are some terminal commands that are used to help you manage your terminal more

3
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:09.600
efficiently.

4
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.560
No number one command that I have listed here is a clear command.

5
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.860
So clear commandment.

6
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.550
You log into your terminal your own certain commands,

7
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.850
you could just simply type clear to clear your screen.

8
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.830
The next command we have is the exit command as it comment allows you to exit out of

9
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.900
session a shell session.

10
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.190
If you have gone into different shell terminals,

11
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.990
you can exit out to come back to your roots sensation,

12
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:41.290
or you go as it out of the terminal that you have opened up or you could exit out of user

13
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.800
session.

14
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.810
So if you have become a different user by switching it to s you to a different user,

15
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.760
you could simply type exit to come.

16
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.390
Come back to your own session,

17
00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.960
then The last one is the script.

18
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.600
Script is very helpful.

19
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.230
Command.

20
00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:03.660
It's a commander stores terminal activities in a log file that can be named by a user.

21
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.910
You could run it and you could name anything that you want.

22
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.610
When that name is not provided by the user than the default file name is used and that is

23
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:13.550
typescript.

24
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.190
The name of the file.

25
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.180
So let's try all these three commands one by one in our Lennox machine.

26
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:26.570
Okay,

27
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.500
So when you run ls lt are who am I?

28
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.320
And bunch of other stuff.

29
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.370
Unless myself tr on the temp directory,

30
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.160
all that stuff that comes up so you could hit,

31
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.550
enter,

32
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.900
enter,

33
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.270
enter,

34
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.840
enter to bring your clear up your screen or simply his type clear.

35
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.500
This will clear your screen.

36
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.050
And many times when people run scripts,

37
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.260
the first thing they put it in the script is clear.

38
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:57.850
So the so the output will clear up everything on just green and then start from a new line

39
00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.850
.

40
00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.170
Then you have the next command is exit exited simply when you type exit,

41
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.410
it will exit out of your script if there is any script it was running before.

42
00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.150
So I'm just gonna clear that I'm gonna type exit again one more time.

43
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.660
And there you go.

44
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.190
It has exit out.

45
00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.090
I had a few scripts commands that were running previously.

46
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.160
That's why I couldn't get it out earlier.

47
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.850
But anyway,

48
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.640
the last one got me out.

49
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.560
I'll open up a terminal again.

50
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.060
And this time I'm typing exit again to exit out of the terminal.

51
00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.830
So this will explain better how the exit works if you become a different user and that's a

52
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.340
S u spider you put in the past board.

53
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.230
Now you see you are logged in as spider.

54
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.450
What?

55
00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.590
If you want to go back into your original session,

56
00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:51.810
which is I absolve you.

57
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:52.330
Just type,

58
00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.600
simply exit,

59
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.440
and you could be come back again to yourself.

60
00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.590
So this is what the exit Command is mostly used for and the last command,

61
00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.650
which I personally like,

62
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.780
because it records everything that you do on your session.

63
00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.350
So what it does is when you run script,

64
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:17.310
do you have to specify the name I will put in a transaction Or,

65
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.720
you know what?

66
00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.260
Log file activity.

67
00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:30.810
Not Long and I had entered its His script started file is log dash activity dot law and

68
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.460
that lock file is created but in the same ah directly that you are in.

69
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.560
So and you run ls minus.

70
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.060
Lt are.

71
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.950
You'll see at the end it is.

72
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.080
It has created a file called log activity.

73
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:48.670
I just ran this command Ellis miner lt are this output off This command will be recorded in

74
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:49.080
that.

75
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.330
So if I go into other directors,

76
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.980
let's say at sea slash Ah,

77
00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:55.950
cd,

78
00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:02.230
slash etc Run ls minus lt are clear My screen type history,

79
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.330
command our type e w d.

80
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:12.600
And whatever that I am doing in my session everything is recorded in my log file Right now

81
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:20.360
you'll see if I do CD and if you go back to my home directory Thai pwd and I do ls minus.

82
00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.850
Lt are You see the lawful activity.

83
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:29.490
The size is keep increasing because it is keep recording all the commands and all the

84
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.190
output that's coming from those commands.

85
00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:37.360
So now if I wanted to be done with the script command all just simply type exit.

86
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.720
Once I do exit,

87
00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.880
it will tell me Script done file is log while dash activity That law,

88
00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.790
it means now it is not recording anything.

89
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.130
It has finished capturing the,

90
00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.310
uh,

91
00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.820
put off your session Now you could view it's clear the screen.

92
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.370
You could view that log activity which is right here,

93
00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:06.380
and I do more on the file I had enter and you will see the first command when I ran after

94
00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.750
running the script Command was ls my cell tr It recorded the command,

95
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.900
recorded the output off the command,

96
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:13.670
keep going.

97
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:21.640
And then I went to that seek of directory and I did ls my cell TRT reported everything I

98
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:29.460
did see all the commands or everything that I did while I was running the commands after

99
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.080
the script.

100
00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:37.910
The reason that I used the script command most of time is because when I am troubleshooting

101
00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.340
an issue or if I am creating some,

102
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.360
uh,

103
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.930
some tools or creating some scripts,

104
00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.310
this would record everything for me.

105
00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.450
So in case a month from now or a year from now,

106
00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.000
and I wanted to perform the same tasks,

107
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.900
I don't have to look up the commands to execute that on the terminal.

108
00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.230
I could just simply go into my log file activity,

109
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.850
and I will view that and remember Oh,

110
00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:04.240
yeah,

111
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.370
these are the commands.

112
00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.920
Iran.

113
00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:06.520
Awesome.

114
00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.210
It's like a logbook recording.

115
00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:10.480
Ah,

116
00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.250
way.

117
00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.500
It records all your commands in a locked file
