1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,910
how everyone.

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,840
So let's continue.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,570
So I'm going to create a shallow script to chat.

4
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:12,920
If the number enter is all even a zero.

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,100
So here are the use.

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:15,610
You know,

7
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,680
multiple conditions.

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:25,100
So I'm going to use if they lift else they So I'm going to play this escape.

9
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:25,680
That is good.

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:40,530
So what is my script like?

11
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,190
Come into you?

12
00:00:41,190 --> 00:01:04,350
That is It's a shell is clipped to check If a number is odd even up zero I didn't to listen

13
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:04,650
time.

14
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,350
First of all,

15
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:17,150
I'm going to ask for the user to enter the part number and a number Onda And I'm going to

16
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,250
save that number into available.

17
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:25,720
My edible name is a You can give any name It is up to you know I want to check first I want

18
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,720
to check the enter number is zero.

19
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:38,700
Nor so for that I'm going to use a condition using If this dollar is my the name of

20
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,750
variable on which the user has entered The number has been saved.

21
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,250
Is it called Geo and I?

22
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:54,750
If this condition satisfied then simply you know type hit.

23
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,790
It's ah zero number your time.

24
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,250
Okay?

25
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,440
No,

26
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,750
I want the check.

27
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,350
The number has been type is you know,

28
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,760
even a little on.

29
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,050
But I just want to check first.

30
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,910
The number is even or not.

31
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:19,150
So how do chat So let me come on from here.

32
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:25,800
So for that I need to use the expression here Suppose user has entered number 10.

33
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,460
Right then B is equal to have a use expression here.

34
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,750
Andan expression.

35
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,900
I'm going to divide this number.

36
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:42,090
That is a that is 10 on did it This you know,

37
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:42,580
operator,

38
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:49,700
I'm going to use that is more jealous on to they.

39
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:56,300
So if the output off this come on is going to be zero,

40
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:04,370
it means that the user has entered a number that is even number.

41
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,240
Let's see Echo dollar be right.

42
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:08,840
Yeah.

43
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,270
If I'm going to type some other number,

44
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:16,870
it means that when you're going to divide that number with two number supposed,

45
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,120
the user has entered 11.

46
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,690
So obviously,

47
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,670
if you're going to divide 11 by two simple mathematics,

48
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:30,070
you're there will be some reminder they so again if I'm fighting this come on on this I

49
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,250
could be I'm getting one number.

50
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:41,430
It means that the number is not even so check whether the number is even but not you have

51
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,470
to use this expression.

52
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,610
So this is called Model s operate.

53
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,550
Every time will be used.

54
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:49,880
This is dividing that number by two on.

55
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,660
If it is even obviously there won't be any reminder here.

56
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:59,150
So that would put world with zero here the same I'm gonna be using my It's good as well.

57
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:08,150
Okay.

58
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,240
So how can use this?

59
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,320
So I have another condition.

60
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:17,740
I'm going to use this one A lift Here.

61
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:23,950
You can see that after a left there is a expression They asking for the condition here.

62
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,810
So straightforward.

63
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:34,460
I'm putting my script that his expression on a dollar A that is the variable name Will the

64
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:43,350
user has entered on this to okay on.

65
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,320
This is what I have to use this one.

66
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,590
This expression for it is equal to zero output zero.

67
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:55,830
It means that it's a even number.

68
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:00,130
Then echo.

69
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:08,750
It's an even number.

70
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,450
Your type.

71
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:19,820
So obviously use it has type.

72
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:24,180
Even our else echo.

73
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:29,650
It's a number.

74
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:47,280
Okay,

75
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,360
I'm going to execute this one.

76
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,450
And you know what?

77
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,000
I want to enter this 12.

78
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,590
It's a even number.

79
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,790
Your time I'm going toe,

80
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,140
enter the number zero.

81
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,140
It says,

82
00:05:59,140 --> 00:05:59,310
You know,

83
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,010
nobody time.

84
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,750
I'm going to enter a number like 15.

85
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,010
It's an odd number,

86
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:04,550
you type.

87
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:09,550
So this is a very simple tell a script to check if the numbers are even on zero.

88
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:15,100
So when their cell for this lecture in the next lecture will understand more escapes.

89
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:15,750
Thanks for watching.
