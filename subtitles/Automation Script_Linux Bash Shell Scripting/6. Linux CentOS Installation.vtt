This is the fun part.

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:06.810
Yes,

4
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.470
this is where we going to get our hands dirty.

5
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:16.420
We gonna go ahead and download the center Will s I s O image file from the from the

6
00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.950
Internet.

7
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.970
Once we have it downloaded,

8
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.550
then we will go through the installation.

9
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.760
A complete installation off sent OS Lennox operating system.

10
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.750
So you ready?

11
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.820
So now I want you to go ahead and open up your browser.

12
00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.270
Any browser that you prefer,

13
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.650
whether it's ie,

14
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.750
Firefox or chrome.

15
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.090
So let's go in.

16
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.650
I have my browser open already.

17
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.350
Um,

18
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.120
I will go into Google now.

19
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.760
The second step is you could use Google or any search engine that you like and I want you

20
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:55.110
to type sent os download and hit Enter.

21
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.180
Once you hit enter,

22
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.160
you will get the first length I want you go and click on it.

23
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.540
Or you could simply go and click on download.

24
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.990
But first,

25
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.150
let's go to this first link.

26
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.080
So in the first slink or the first page,

27
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.590
you will see download Santo s Now,

28
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.750
Sometimes you will see three options in this page.

29
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.130
One is a DVD.

30
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.350
I s o second one is everything DVD I eso and 3rd 1 is minimal.

31
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.980
I s o If you are seeing three or if you're seeing too right now,

32
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.530
it doesn't matter because what we need is DVD.

33
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.280
I s so this is the one that we need to click on.

34
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.730
So go ahead and click on DVD.

35
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:41.210
I So this will bring you to the links where the eyes are.

36
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.690
Images are saved.

37
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:49.400
So all those links are actually the links to the servers or they're often time referred to

38
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.380
as mirrors.

39
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.610
These mirrors,

40
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.530
when you click on it,

41
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.580
will take you to the file where the file location is.

42
00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.690
So go ahead and a pick Anyone off your choice over recommend that you pick the 1st 1 So go

43
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:08.210
ahead and click on the 1st 1 Once you click on the 1st 1 it will ask you or prompt you to

44
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.330
save the file.

45
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.950
You have to save the file.

46
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:11.750
Ah,

47
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.910
to you to the locations so going.

48
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:14.190
Click.

49
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.720
Okay,

50
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.100
if you do not know where the file is being saved,

51
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.110
you see this little arrow here?

52
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.960
If you are using the,

53
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:22.400
uh,

54
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.280
fire walks,

55
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.220
he will see this little arrow here.

56
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.050
Click on it and it will tell you that it is being downloaded.

57
00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.600
Right now.

58
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.550
I do not want to download because I have already downloaded that file previously because I

59
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:36.870
don't want to waste time,

60
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.630
your time and my time to go through the company download.

61
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.650
So let's minimize this page.

62
00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.150
Let's go to a desktop because all my,

63
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.000
um,

64
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.870
downloads go into my desktop now.

65
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.900
You already have this center west.

66
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:53.970
Okay,

67
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:54.280
Now,

68
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.740
I want you to go ahead and click on a double click on your Oracle War Troll box.

69
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.420
The icon you have on your desktop.

70
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.780
If you do not have that icon,

71
00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:03.620
your desktop,

72
00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.110
then you go to start menu and find that up and you will go ahead and start from here.

73
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.140
When it opens up,

74
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.440
you will see the my first Lennox for Lennox PM.

75
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.800
The one recreated earlier.

76
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.400
These two You're probably not going to see it because I was playing around with some

77
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.710
windows.

78
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:19.570
Were for machine anyway,

79
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.060
it's just you could just ignore them.

80
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.300
Um,

81
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.040
click on the first,

82
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.610
my first Linux VM and click on start.

83
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.030
Now,

84
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.790
this is powering up yours from machine.

85
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.510
This is exactly the same way as if you powering on your physical machine,

86
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.150
but pressing the button on it.

87
00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.240
So now it is asking,

88
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.350
since this washing machine has no operating system,

89
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:52.550
so by default is asking you to attach award actual disk to it.

90
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.570
So it is asking where is the location off that were actual disc,

91
00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.710
which you want to install that operating system.

92
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:05.700
So go ahead and click on this little icon which will browse us to our desktop where we have

93
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.430
our eyes.

94
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:07.350
So image safe.

95
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.060
Click on this one,

96
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.370
and you will see right here on our desktop folder.

97
00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.750
When you click on our desktop,

98
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.540
you come down and you will see right here say,

99
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:19.890
Santo s seven,

100
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.230
which we have downloaded Ah,

101
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.280
few minutes ago.

102
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.450
So go ahead and click on open and click on start.

103
00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.770
Ah,

104
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:33.200
by the way,

105
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.890
this top thing right here is telling you have option to capture key ward option.

106
00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:37.410
Turn on.

107
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.940
This will cause the upper virtual machine arm of the capture.

108
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.780
You could just go ahead and cancel it.

109
00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.610
Now it's telling you at this green is selling you.

110
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.950
This is a cent or seven installed center or seven.

111
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.440
Test this media and installed center a seven,

112
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.640
or do the troubleshooting right now by default.

113
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.240
Test this media and install center.

114
00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.960
A seven is selected.

115
00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.180
You do not want to test this media.

116
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:07.360
Usually this option is picked when you have a DVD install and the reason we do the test

117
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.920
because sometimes the DVD have scratches on it.

118
00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.890
That's why we wanted to go through the test.

119
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:13.490
So since this is I saw image.

120
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:14.390
We don't do that.

121
00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:21.910
So go ahead and hit up arrow key on your keyboard and it will select or highlight the top

122
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:22.160
one.

123
00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.690
It's State installed Cento a seven and now go ahead and hit.

124
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.580
Enter It is actually bringing the eyes.

125
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:40.550
So image copying the files that are needed to actually install the operating system so it

126
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.160
will go through certain start up processes.

127
00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:49.220
It will start up the gui that will allow us to go through the installation off the lyrics

128
00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.150
Center s are bring system.

129
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.650
We will give it a minute for the going to come up.

130
00:05:54.650 --> 00:06:01.860
See right here says starting installer one moment and installer.

131
00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.850
The Gui itself is called Anaconda.

132
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.570
This is a name they have given Why?

133
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:09.430
I don't know,

134
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:16.470
But this is the name If you want to keep in mind Um you just remember that anaconda is the

135
00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:19.090
Gui tool or degree Viz erred.

136
00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.810
That will help you to install the Lennox offering system.

137
00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.910
Now you are under welcome to Cento a seven.

138
00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.040
Ah,

139
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.870
welcome page.

140
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.870
What language would you like to use during the installation?

141
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:32.760
Ah,

142
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.560
by default English and I'm in the United States.

143
00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.610
I'll pick English United States if you are in any other country.

144
00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:40.290
Ah,

145
00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:43.680
we recommend is you pick that country or if you want to pick a different language,

146
00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.810
you could pick that.

147
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:45.590
However,

148
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.380
I am not going to tell you how you could go through the installation with different

149
00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.920
language anyway,

150
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.060
So I support for that.

151
00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.790
You stay on English and then you definitely you could pick a different country.

152
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.200
Now go ahead and click on.

153
00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.350
Continue at the bottom.

154
00:06:59.350 --> 00:06:59.750
Right.

155
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.760
Okay,

156
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.880
so now it says,

157
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.910
please complete items mark with this action.

158
00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:08.650
This icon before continue to the next step.

159
00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:15.030
Now the date and time is the 1st 1 we have already pre selected America's New York Time

160
00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:15.280
zone.

161
00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.220
If you wanted to change the time zone,

162
00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:22.010
depending on which times of your and go ahead and click on it and change the time zone

163
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:24.520
keyboard by default.

164
00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:29.770
It selects English and U S um language support a gain.

165
00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:33.630
English United States installation Source.

166
00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:34.830
Local media,

167
00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:40.330
Which means that we are installing the operating system through the local Aiso image,

168
00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:41.730
so it's already been selected.

169
00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:42.500
Perfect.

170
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.090
Next stop software selection.

171
00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:50.350
This is where it has by default the software selection as minimal install.

172
00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:53.750
If you leave that as is minimal installed,

173
00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:56.580
then it will install the lyrics operating system,

174
00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:59.450
but it will not have any gooey on it.

175
00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:00.350
Well,

176
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:02.190
remember one thing most of the time.

177
00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:03.540
Incorporate Marmon.

178
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.790
There are no gooey on Lennox,

179
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.720
but since we are going through some practice,

180
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.410
we will go through some GUI practices as well,

181
00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:15.960
because I do want you to know how Gui works in Lenox as well.

182
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:19.160
So we'll go ahead and click on software selection,

183
00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.890
and that's where we will pick um,

184
00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:26.920
a couple of different additional software that are required in the middle installed.

185
00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:27.370
Ah,

186
00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:28.980
we have other options as well.

187
00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:34.360
If you want to use system administration tools are any other tools you could pick them.

188
00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.650
We could leave as default.

189
00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:37.150
Compute nodes,

190
00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:38.450
anything.

191
00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:39.750
Any debugging tools,

192
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:40.830
directory clients,

193
00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:42.360
hardware monitoring tools,

194
00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.500
development tools.

195
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.300
Most of these tools are used by developers.

196
00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:49.030
Since we are not going through the development training,

197
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:50.970
we we will leave that.

198
00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:53.850
As is infrastructure server.

199
00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:54.660
Ah.

200
00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:58.750
What type off server are we going to run on this machine?

201
00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:01.210
I will tell you you could pick,

202
00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:01.830
um,

203
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:04.840
anyone that you think you might need it later on.

204
00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:05.690
Um,

205
00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:11.200
you could pick the d n a server for now because we are going to core DNS,

206
00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:16.910
which is bind in this training so you could pick DNS if you do not pick Deanna Sarah this

207
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:17.340
time,

208
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.300
there is no issue.

209
00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:23.830
We could always insult the in a server or package later on,

210
00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:24.760
but anyway,

211
00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.490
just to show you how it works,

212
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:28.700
I just selected one DNS name server.

213
00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.640
Anything else that you want to select here?

214
00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:32.470
You could.

215
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:35.050
If you don't want to just follow my lead,

216
00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:38.720
then let's go to the next one says file and print server.

217
00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:42.330
You could leave everything as is a said basic Web server.

218
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:43.030
You don't need it.

219
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:46.720
Work authorization hosts and no several with Cool.

220
00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.090
Yes.

221
00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:48.480
This is where we have to come in.

222
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.650
And if you notice as you are going down,

223
00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:59.100
all the other options that were available on the base environments are actually added here

224
00:09:59.100 --> 00:09:59.680
as well.

225
00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.070
So don't worry about it.

226
00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:01.940
They're repetitive.

227
00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:07.100
It's not that this option will have a different d n a server and with this based

228
00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:07.850
environment.

229
00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:12.160
So right now we are in the server with Gui Environment.

230
00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:19.890
I want you to go down and pick um que d e which is Katie easa.

231
00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:23.710
Plasma workspace are highly conferred with graphical user interface.

232
00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:28.440
I also want you to pick Java platform because if you are running certain application that

233
00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.400
requires Yaba,

234
00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.950
we could bring that up.

235
00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:32.570
Um,

236
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:33.950
that see what we have?

237
00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:36.310
You have all the virtualization tool.

238
00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:38.550
Um,

239
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:42.530
okay,

240
00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:44.320
I think we are good hair,

241
00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:51.570
but the Katie eat now The next one is genome desktop now Genome desktop are the ah,

242
00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:55.860
the desktop that also per wide some type of applications.

243
00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:56.420
Um,

244
00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:57.220
for the user,

245
00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:00.440
let's say if you want to use Firefox or if you want to use,

246
00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.950
um calculators or something on the gooey side,

247
00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:04.840
then you could select this.

248
00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:05.780
That stop as well.

249
00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:08.810
So go ahead and click on genome applications.

250
00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:10.900
Um,

251
00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:14.620
any other tools we need Internet application,

252
00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:15.010
email,

253
00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:15.400
chat,

254
00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.790
video conferencing software.

255
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:20.160
We don't want that because most likely incorporate environment.

256
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:26.170
You will not be using any of thes Katie plasma workstation workspaces development and

257
00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:27.370
creative workstation,

258
00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:28.870
and that's pretty much it.

259
00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:35.050
You don't really need any other applications or add ons for the selective environment.

260
00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:36.860
Now go ahead and click.

261
00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:37.250
Done.

262
00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:41.640
Now you will see this option right here.

263
00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.150
It will tell you checking software dependency.

264
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:49.120
It means it is going toe our ISA image and asking that isa image.

265
00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:49.480
Hey,

266
00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:53.470
this user has selected thes these many packages.

267
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:58.780
Do you have these packages for me to install on this harboring system is going to say,

268
00:11:58.780 --> 00:11:59.050
Hey,

269
00:11:59.050 --> 00:11:59.550
okay,

270
00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:00.600
no problem.

271
00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:01.970
Let me go ahead and check that.

272
00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:04.150
So it's checking the source,

273
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:07.260
and it's checking the software dependency as well.

274
00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:16.360
So what is needed for those add ons that we need to install installation destination while

275
00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:17.880
it's running will go to the next one.

276
00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.810
It's his installation destination now.

277
00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:27.160
How do we want to protection our disk and solution destination right now?

278
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.960
Says automatic partitioning selected If you want to change that?

279
00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:31.990
Meaning Right now,

280
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:32.900
we have 10 gig.

281
00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:38.950
This is the discus size that we selected when we were creating the worship machine.

282
00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:45.110
This this size has shown up here is telling us we have 10 gig of disk space.

283
00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:47.050
How do you want to partition it?

284
00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:51.830
We're telling it automatically configure the partitioning if you know,

285
00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:59.260
or if your organization has a requirement to partition a disk into different slices or

286
00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.180
different partitioning than you will go ahead and click on.

287
00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:03.280
I will configure,

288
00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.120
Petitioning.

289
00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.070
Now,

290
00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:06.250
go ahead and click on.

291
00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:06.660
Done.

292
00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:13.050
Next one is K dump.

293
00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:17.590
Que dump is enabled If something goes wrong,

294
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:18.990
K means Colonel,

295
00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:23.210
if there is something wrong with your system Ah,

296
00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:26.710
Colonel is going to write some messages,

297
00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:26.860
um,

298
00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:33.810
logs that is often referred in Lenox language as a dump that is enabled.

299
00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:38.190
So it's always a good practice to leave that enabled.

300
00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:39.990
So this way,

301
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:41.950
if you are troubleshooting with your vendor,

302
00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:45.270
let's say if you have cento us red hat involved,

303
00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:48.120
they could go at and take a look at your logs.

304
00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.900
Next one we have is networking and host name.

305
00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:53.560
Okay,

306
00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:58.000
you We are on a network and host name configuration.

307
00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.490
At the bottom,

308
00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:00.710
you'll see Host name.

309
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:04.510
Go ahead and highlight what we have right now and hit,

310
00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:08.640
delete and type in the host name off.

311
00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:18.280
The Lennox operating system will type the same one as we picked for R V M my first Lennox

312
00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:23.710
VM and click on Apply as soon as you click on apply.

313
00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:27.350
You'll see the current host name was changed to the host name that you have picked.

314
00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:31.680
Now the second thing is to configure the even it.

315
00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:32.190
Now,

316
00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:32.630
remember,

317
00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:35.890
by default if your machine or the washing machine,

318
00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:37.060
this is your washing machine.

319
00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:40.990
If it is running on a PC that has one gig,

320
00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:42.990
often network port,

321
00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:46.380
it will show up here as beat one gig,

322
00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:53.910
and right now it is showing its wired for me because I have selected or I are my machine

323
00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:57.250
where I'm running this worship machine is wired,

324
00:14:57.250 --> 00:15:07.390
so go ahead and click on configure and by default it will show up The tab as Ethan at E E

325
00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:12.050
and P zero s three is the name off our network adapter.

326
00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:18.850
So we'll click on General and we click automatically connect to this network when it is

327
00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:26.400
available that arrest of this setting is blacked out by default.

328
00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:31.980
You could leave as default I PV before setting is the setting for automatic DCP.

329
00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:34.850
If you want to assign an I P,

330
00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:37.970
then you would have to change it to manual.

331
00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:40.520
But we want the I P to be assigned automatically.

332
00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:45.930
So if you leave it as is I'm the last one is i pp six settings.

333
00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:47.610
We don't use that right now,

334
00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:49.550
so go ahead and click on safe.

335
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:52.770
So once you click on save,

336
00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:55.800
you will see its tells you automatically connected.

337
00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.610
It is given an I.

338
00:15:57.610 --> 00:15:58.800
P Already.

339
00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:03.060
And now you could go ahead and click on Done.

340
00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:04.940
Okay.

341
00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:08.380
And so our network and host name has been configured.

342
00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:08.600
Now,

343
00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.940
the last part is security profile.

344
00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.120
No profile is selected.

345
00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:20.070
You believe that as as unless your organization has a specific procedure to put in place

346
00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:21.440
for security policies,

347
00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.150
then you could define it here.

348
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:24.380
But for now,

349
00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:26.060
you could just leave as is,

350
00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:28.800
and go ahead and click on begin installation.

351
00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:33.730
Once you click on begin installation,

352
00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:34.980
you will see at the bottom.

353
00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:38.380
It will start creating your your partitions.

354
00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:42.580
That were selected that you ask the system to select it for you.

355
00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:46.540
Now it's going to starting package installation process.

356
00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:49.850
While this is going through the package installation,

357
00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:50.760
we have to,

358
00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.040
um,

359
00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.090
uses settings to define.

360
00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:56.010
First is root password.

361
00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:58.350
So go ahead and click on root.

362
00:16:58.350 --> 00:16:59.640
Password is not set.

363
00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.570
And here you would have to put in the root password.

364
00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:12.400
Pick anything that you you will remember if you notice I picked a week Password.

365
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:16.210
You should pick a strong password if you are,

366
00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:16.960
Um,

367
00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.730
if you're working for a company or for you or an organization,

368
00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:24.530
But if you are just following my lab or you're doing this everything as a tutorial,

369
00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:25.170
that is fine.

370
00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:26.340
You could pick a week password.

371
00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:27.330
However,

372
00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:30.950
if you notice at the bottom it says the password you have provided it is weak.

373
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:32.820
The password fails.

374
00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:33.760
The directory check.

375
00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:39.110
It is based on a direction dictionary word which you will have to press done twice to

376
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.610
confirm.

377
00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:41.830
So okay,

378
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:43.720
I understand it is a weak password.

379
00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.820
In order for me to keep that password,

380
00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:48.270
I have to press it done twice.

381
00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:53.620
One to now it has taken that weak passwords,

382
00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:59.620
user creation Let's go ahead and create our first user.

383
00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:02.050
Full name.

384
00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:06.330
Let's put in our first name by default.

385
00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:09.630
Lennox takes the first name as the first letter.

386
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:12.190
First initial last name is complete.

387
00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:12.720
Last name.

388
00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:13.260
So for me,

389
00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.110
the user name will be I of soul.

390
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:21.660
Keep your user name shorter than 32 characters and you do not use spaces.

391
00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:22.690
That is fine.

392
00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:27.410
We are not using any spaces were wholly using six letters.

393
00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:29.500
Make this user administrator.

394
00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:30.650
You could lead that out.

395
00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:33.140
Requires a password to use this account.

396
00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:33.660
Yes,

397
00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:36.350
the pickup password.

398
00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:37.130
Again.

399
00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:37.880
It is weak.

400
00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:38.860
I understand.

401
00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:41.160
And I would have to do the same thing Done twice.

402
00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:44.540
Okay,

403
00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:45.400
it is done.

404
00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:52.200
Now if you come down and you notice right here it The operating system is installing or

405
00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:56.950
this Viz erred is installing packages for this offering system.

406
00:18:56.950 --> 00:19:03.050
Total number of packages that are required to be installed are 1397.

407
00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:08.500
You might have a little more or a little less,

408
00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:09.460
but that's okay.

409
00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:12.340
It depends and it changes over time.

410
00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:13.700
What other packages are installed?

411
00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:13.980
Water.

412
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:16.340
The dependencies aren't still so again,

413
00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:20.200
If your packages do not match with my packages do not panic.

414
00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:20.600
You are.

415
00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:21.130
Okay,

416
00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:24.920
so now you'll see it is going through the packages installation.

417
00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:25.700
At this point,

418
00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:26.260
it is.

419
00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:33.710
It has installed almost 400 packages and they're still about ah 6 to 800 packages that

420
00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:34.620
needs to be installed.

421
00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:36.570
And this process will take.

422
00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:41.670
I would say somewhere between 10 minutes to 30 minutes,

423
00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:46.950
I am going to fast forward this entire process to save time.

424
00:19:46.950 --> 00:20:07.270
Now the packages installation has been completed.

425
00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:10.950
Now it is going to some post insulation set up.

426
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:32.570
All right.

427
00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:33.120
Finally,

428
00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:36.230
our installation has been completed successfully.

429
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:41.120
Now Santo s is now successfully installed and ready for you to use.

430
00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.670
Go head and reboot to starve using it.

431
00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:48.360
Click on Reboot West.

432
00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.700
Since the system comes back online,

433
00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:53.540
it will give you the initial set up page.

434
00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:55.600
The first page is about licensing.

435
00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.080
You have to accept the license.

436
00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:09.470
Click Accept license every hman click on done network and host name if you notice.

437
00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:14.760
We have already selected this network and host name configuration during our installation

438
00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.340
so that you don't need to do it again.

439
00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:17.130
Click done.

440
00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:21.440
And right here says finished configuration.

441
00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:23.760
Go ahead and click on finish configuration.

442
00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:28.370
All right.

443
00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:29.140
Finally,

444
00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:33.100
our entire Lennox installation has completed.

445
00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:35.390
Now we have to log in the first time,

446
00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:39.990
Click on your name or you could also log in as root.

447
00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:43.070
If if you remember,

448
00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:44.790
you have picked the root password,

449
00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:46.260
you would have to click on,

450
00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:49.270
not listed and type and using him crude and password.

451
00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:49.790
But for now,

452
00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:54.450
we'll go in as ourselves and we will put in a password,

453
00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:57.710
click on Sign in or had enter.

454
00:21:57.710 --> 00:22:01.950
All right,

455
00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:03.250
this is the desktop.

456
00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:10.380
This is how it looks like in Cento as it is very similar to Red Hat Cento s.

457
00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:12.620
You have these icons right here.

458
00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:14.980
You can resize them if you want to.

459
00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:18.540
You could delete any I conjugal create icon.

460
00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:23.850
Um and you could explore other things on the application and spaces.

461
00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:24.870
So also,

462
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:26.370
one more thing when it starts up,

463
00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:28.890
it also gave you this welcome page.

464
00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:31.040
So you just leave as English.

465
00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:35.030
Go ahead and click on next typing.

466
00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:40.460
If you want to change anything you believe a default location services,

467
00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:42.350
I usually keep it off.

468
00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:43.980
If you want to leave it on,

469
00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:45.060
it's really up to you.

470
00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:48.590
Click next connect to online accounts.

471
00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:50.500
You don't have to do that clicked,

472
00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:50.850
skip,

473
00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:55.310
and then start using sent Os Lennox.

474
00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:57.300
So once again,

475
00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:58.760
congratulations.

476
00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:03.900
So now you know how to do the complete Lynn accent OAS installation?

477
00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:09.980
If you think that you missed something that I would recommend you to go ahead and delete

478
00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:11.940
this entire Lennox,

479
00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:15.260
we m and go ahead and create a new washing machine.

480
00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:18.450
And do the Lennox insulation again from scratch.

481
00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:19.520
The more you do,

482
00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:20.760
the more practice you'll do,

483
00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:21.890
the more you will learn.

484
00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:23.210
All right.

485
00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:23.850
Good luck.
