00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280
soft links and hard links.

2
00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.800
This is,

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.140
Ah,

4
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:14.890
one of the important topics in Lenox and something that you will have to remember because

5
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:20.950
you will be working on creating soft links and hard links in your linens career.

6
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:26.620
Or if you're gonna be working in the system administration capacity before I tell you

7
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.260
anything above what a soft link and hard link is,

8
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.050
I have to tell you,

9
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:41.640
I knowed what I know is I know is basically a pointer or a number off a file on the hard

10
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.130
disk.

11
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.160
So if I create a file call,

12
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.150
let's say Hulk,

13
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.170
that file name is H U l K.

14
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.560
That is a name for me as a human for me to understand the name of the file.

15
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.460
But computer does not understand names computer,

16
00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.770
understand numbers.

17
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.580
So every time you create a file,

18
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.810
computer assigns a number to that file on ah,

19
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.650
hard disk and associate that number to it,

20
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.750
that number is called.

21
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:13.490
I knowed.

22
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.610
And every time he tried to retrieve the file or read a file,

23
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.150
it goes and retrieve that number.

24
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.920
So now,

25
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.500
now you know that I know.

26
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.940
Let me tell you about a soft link.

27
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:33.690
Now a soft link is a link that when created and it will be removed if ah,

28
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.650
filers removed or renamed.

29
00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.950
So if I create a file and I link,

30
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.940
create a link a soft link to that file so once it created,

31
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.690
it actually looks for that.

32
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.220
I know through that file,

33
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.440
so that creates a softening.

34
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.000
So if I removed the source file,

35
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.840
it will remove the destination.

36
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.710
Like whereas Hard Ling has been the leading A renaming the source file,

37
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.910
the heart link will not change.

38
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.750
It will remain the same as if you have copied it.

39
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.110
To create a hard link command,

40
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.210
you will run l n as a link to create a soft link.

41
00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.720
You will run the same command,

42
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.770
but with the option minus s.

43
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.240
And I have a picture right here which,

44
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.800
of course,

45
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.270
as picture speaks 1000 words.

46
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.200
So if you see on the right hand side,

47
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.180
it's myself.

48
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.500
Link.

49
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.320
It is connecting through my file to the I note where,

50
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.420
as my hard link is connecting straight to the I note.

51
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.010
So if the middle part,

52
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.570
which is my file dot text goes away,

53
00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.070
my soft Lynn goes away However,

54
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.950
in my hard link file,

55
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.900
if middle file my file dot text goes away,

56
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:51.700
it doesn't matter.

57
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.150
The file stays.

58
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.080
Let's get that log into our machine are letting machine,

59
00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.250
and I will explain you much better how those lengths work.

60
00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.720
By the way,

61
00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.430
one more thing I should mention.

62
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.610
Link is just like a shortcut in a regular term,

63
00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.420
as if you are creating a shortcut on your desktop.

64
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.330
In your Windows environment,

65
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.150
you have a fire located somewhere in window system 32 blah,

66
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.390
blah,

67
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.930
blah blah.

68
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:17.320
Of course,

69
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.460
you have to go to the file all the time by navigating through that file system.

70
00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.810
Click,

71
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:23.020
click,

72
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.210
click,

73
00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.370
click,

74
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.600
click,

75
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.800
click,

76
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.980
click,

77
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:24.200
click.

78
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.890
So much work,

79
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:26.300
man.

80
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.320
So what do we do?

81
00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.420
We create a shortcut to our desktop.

82
00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.830
All you have to do is double click and boom.

83
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.290
It runs the same.

84
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.040
Just like that.

85
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.450
We have linen softening and hardening.

86
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.350
So without further ado,

87
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:47.170
I'm gonna log into my machine and I'll explain you and this is our machine.

88
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.850
It's gonna drag it'll and more to the left.

89
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.730
Just why?

90
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.500
To confirm again it I am logged in as myself.

91
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.760
This is my name.

92
00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.990
This is my home directory.

93
00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.350
Perfect.

94
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.080
I want to create a file.

95
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.430
Cold Hope everybody knows Hulk,

96
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.850
right?

97
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.350
One character,

98
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:09.620
big joint character.

99
00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:10.450
I like it.

100
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.190
Like his movies.

101
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.280
Okay.

102
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.740
Anyway,

103
00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:13.680
uh,

104
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.570
I created Ah,

105
00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:15.330
file call,

106
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.990
Hulk.

107
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:21.950
Now I will like to create a link to that file Hook.

108
00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.150
I will go to temp directory.

109
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.400
I am in Tempt Not in my home directory.

110
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:37.310
And I want to create link soft link to hook and hook fire location his home I have solved.

111
00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.780
And the name of the file is hooked.

112
00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.350
Boom.

113
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.870
It created the file link.

114
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.570
How do we verify it?

115
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.690
Your friendly command.

116
00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.050
Unless my SLT are.

117
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.850
And if you see right at the bottom,

118
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:57.380
it is telling you it has created a link and Lennox operating system.

119
00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.040
Since we are running Lennox with the goo,

120
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.180
it's changes some off the color changes to blue.

121
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:10.160
So right here the first bit it's telling you it is l What is l four?

122
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.320
L is for link.

123
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.590
What is D for D is for directory?

124
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:18.020
Yes,

125
00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.520
very good.

126
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.620
And what is a file that doesn't have anything?

127
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:23.160
Of course,

128
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:23.710
it's a while.

129
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:24.990
I already answered that.

130
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.530
Okay,

131
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:25.990
anyway,

132
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.500
so it created a link.

133
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.090
Now I will go back to my home directory,

134
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.540
but just typing C d p w d to just confirm I am in my home drippy.

135
00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.730
Yes,

136
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:36.250
I am.

137
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.710
And I will type something in my file call hook.

138
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.150
So I'll do echo and do,

139
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.370
um hoc is ah,

140
00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:49.750
super hero.

141
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:50.670
Okay?

142
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:55.050
And I will put that to poke fall when I do Cat hook,

143
00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.660
it's their right.

144
00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:57.050
Okay,

145
00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.650
Now I'm gonna go to my temp directory,

146
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.460
and I'll do cat this.

147
00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.680
Confirm I'm in my temper.

148
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.130
He is,

149
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.170
And I'm gonna cat the hoc.

150
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.080
And you see,

151
00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.480
it has the same content that's just typed.

152
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.400
And so it's just a short,

153
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:15.560
good,

154
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.270
just a link.

155
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:23.880
I will come back to my home directory and I will run ls minus.

156
00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.940
L I What is I?

157
00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.750
I stand for,

158
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:35.540
I notes if I wanted to find out the I know off this file I will run.

159
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.850
I So,

160
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:40.090
um yeah,

161
00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:40.610
it's there.

162
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:45.450
But since I didn't type unless minds lt are went into middle school type talismans lt r and

163
00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:45.950
then high.

164
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:47.890
So this way it will be at the bottom.

165
00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:54.330
If you see that I know number right here is the number that is associate ID with my file

166
00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:55.050
hook.

167
00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:56.430
Again,

168
00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:01.750
I note is the number that is remembered by your operating system.

169
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.390
And it is on your disk.

170
00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:04.550
It doesn't remember hope.

171
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:10.850
When I go to temp and do ls my cell to your and right here.

172
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:11.320
If I do,

173
00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.020
it s minus.

174
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:16.700
Lt are I to find out the I know off this hook,

175
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:20.150
it has a different I knowed.

176
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.450
Is it a different?

177
00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:23.340
I'm not sure.

178
00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:24.690
Let's check ls minus.

179
00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:26.750
Lt are I.

180
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:29.080
And I'm gonna do home.

181
00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.350
I have so hook,

182
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:36.410
it has a different I knowed.

183
00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:40.280
So this one is remembered as a different file.

184
00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.390
It is remembering at its link.

185
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.860
It does not know that it is actually.

186
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:44.930
Ah,

187
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:45.650
file.

188
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:46.950
It just knows it's a link.

189
00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:49.750
So this number is associated to a link.

190
00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:53.250
Now I will go to my home directory again,

191
00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:56.700
and this time I'm going to remove the Hulk.

192
00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:59.330
Public is gone from my home directory.

193
00:07:59.330 --> 00:07:59.780
Right?

194
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:04.960
I'm gonna go back to temp directory and I'm going to see where my whole kids But if I just

195
00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.790
type Hoke will just give me hook.

196
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:08.080
So,

197
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:08.400
Hulk,

198
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.280
is there but it's no longer blue or its look crooked.

199
00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.590
Why looks crooked?

200
00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:15.310
Because the file is gone.

201
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:18.070
If I do cat right now and do hook,

202
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:19.890
tell me what will happen.

203
00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:23.010
No such file or directory.

204
00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:24.040
Of course,

205
00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.230
there is no flat file because the link is removed,

206
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:31.510
the source link is removed so the link will still linger around,

207
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:34.340
even though the source off the link is not there.

208
00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.080
So it's better they'll just remove the link as well.

209
00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.460
And just verified.

210
00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:40.640
Yet it's gone.

211
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:44.710
If I just wanted to do ls myself tr just through hoc.

212
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:45.140
Yeah.

213
00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:45.360
See?

214
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:45.600
No.

215
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.090
So that's how the soft link works.

216
00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:52.890
Now I will explain you how the hard link works.

217
00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:57.850
Let's go and create our file again.

218
00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:00.650
We'll call it Hulk again,

219
00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:06.850
and I will put something inside the file that go.

220
00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:13.650
Hoke is a super hero.

221
00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:15.370
Okay,

222
00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:16.750
I'll put that in hook.

223
00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:18.360
I do a verified.

224
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.950
We'll just do cat the file.

225
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:21.040
And yes,

226
00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.650
Hulk is a superhero.

227
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:23.550
The continents there.

228
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:31.800
Now I will go into temp directory and I want to link to this file creating hard link.

229
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:32.190
You see,

230
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:41.980
I'm not going with minus s option s stands for softly so I'll do link home.

231
00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:46.560
I have saw Hook Link is created.

232
00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:52.750
How do we verified you just run ls minus l to your and you will see at the bottom.

233
00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:59.460
It's telling me that the link is created now.

234
00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.350
The difference between this link,

235
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:08.350
hard link and soft link is that there is no pointing to other file.

236
00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:12.260
That is the difference off Harling softly.

237
00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:13.380
Now,

238
00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:14.240
if you'll read.

239
00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.750
If I read the content of this file,

240
00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:20.510
it says Hulk is a superhero is the same content,

241
00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:21.360
everything the same.

242
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:26.030
Now let me go back to my home directory.

243
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:28.840
I'm in their home directory.

244
00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.250
Let's check that hook file,

245
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:34.780
and I will write down something else in it.

246
00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:42.570
Now that go 123 and then to hook.

247
00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:44.180
Let's read it.

248
00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:47.350
Hug is a superhero,

249
00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:49.150
and then 123 in the line.

250
00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:55.150
I'll go back into my temp directory and cat hook,

251
00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:58.540
and it is added here as well.

252
00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:03.750
So what is telling us that you could modify the source file?

253
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:06.870
You could modify the contents of the store source file.

254
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:09.250
It will modify the destination link,

255
00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:10.350
which is perfect.

256
00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:14.450
Now let's go to my home directory again.

257
00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:16.950
And this time I will remove hook.

258
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:18.290
All right,

259
00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:19.300
health file is gone.

260
00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:21.350
He confirmed it.

261
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:23.160
It's not there now.

262
00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:29.730
I will go back to temp directory and I will do Unless my SLT are again and you will see the

263
00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:31.300
file still exists.

264
00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:32.630
The link still exist.

265
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:34.460
And when we do,

266
00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:37.920
Hoke and Indust still have all the contents.

267
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:38.850
Have you put it in?

268
00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:40.150
Well,

269
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:41.160
okay,

270
00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.750
so what is it telling us?

271
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:45.930
It's telling us that in the hard link,

272
00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:49.340
when you remove the source off the file,

273
00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:51.950
it does not remove the destination.

274
00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:57.720
So that's the basic difference is I'll go ahead and just remove this hog file as well.

275
00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.120
The Hulk A link as well.

276
00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.160
So,

277
00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.050
um,

278
00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:05.650
please do remember the difference between soft link and heart link.

279
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:06.460
Many times,

280
00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:08.930
these question will be asked during the interview.

281
00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:10.550
If you're not going for the interview,

282
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:12.510
if you are just wanted to,

283
00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:13.330
um,

284
00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.250
level up your career,

285
00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:16.350
have fun
