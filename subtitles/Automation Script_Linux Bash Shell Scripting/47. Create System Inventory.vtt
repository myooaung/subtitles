ï»¿1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
create system inventory.

2
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:06.420
Ah,

3
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.550
step by step user input.

4
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.600
Um,

5
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.440
in this lesson,

6
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:18.620
we are actually going to create a script that will ask from a user for its input any type

7
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.750
off form or record that VR you will have to create and limit.

8
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:24.940
Now,

9
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.450
if you are running,

10
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.450
let's say your Apache server are your Web server.

11
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:36.940
Then you probably would have to give some kind of form to the user so they will come in and

12
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:37.780
type in,

13
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:38.440
Let's say,

14
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.600
even a DNS record or you in a ah system Inventory in our case will put in a host name you

15
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.100
put in an I P address,

16
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.050
you put in a description or any other information that's a kind of form your given right

17
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.050
and then you click on Save at that record is safe.

18
00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:01.560
That's how we really see it online whenever we go online and we never be typing and from

19
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.010
information that is saved somewhere,

20
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.550
most likely in bigger companies it has saved in a database.

21
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:08.500
But now,

22
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.740
since we're creating our own little database only inventory,

23
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.350
we will keep track off all assistance of you build,

24
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.540
so there has to be away so you could we could have the script together and we could expose

25
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:29.750
that script on our web server so user can use it as a form and put that information in

26
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.580
anything that you want to do that could be done later.

27
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.080
But now,

28
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.530
for now,

29
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:34.350
for this lesson,

30
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.430
you will learn that the first group that will create is that script that will add a record

31
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.430
.

32
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.780
So it will ask you,

33
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.800
Do you want to add a record?

34
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.600
And so please,

35
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.860
pride provide host name Second question will ask you.

36
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.060
Please provide.

37
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.450
Um I p address of the system.

38
00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.950
3rd 1 is pleased Provided description of the system.

39
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.650
Once all that information is provided,

40
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.750
that information is saved into ah file.

41
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.900
Since it's the Lennox machine,

42
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.750
it will be saved in a regular text file.

43
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.580
Um,

44
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.350
if you are using Windows,

45
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.530
the most of people create this excel sheet to keep track of all their equipment.

46
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:22.750
Do all type of s and manage second type of scribble will cover is about deleting erect.

47
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.950
So this scribble asked,

48
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:25.940
um,

49
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.040
pretty much the same things that the first group,

50
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.030
but in this case,

51
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.250
it will ask to delete the wreck and the third script that we will cover.

52
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:41.140
It's about combining both the above scripts off to add a record and to delete a record.

53
00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.400
So we will use a K statement in which it will ask High User,

54
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.320
What do you want to do?

55
00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.880
Do you want to add a record,

56
00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.350
or do you want to lead a wreck?

57
00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.400
User picks a off to add a record or be to the leader record,

58
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.750
depending on their choices.

59
00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.250
Then it will take them to the either the first script or the skirt seconds script.

60
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.950
So this is what we are actually going to learn.

61
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.480
So let's let me get into real quickly.

62
00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.550
My limits machine.

63
00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.060
Okay,

64
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.450
I have it open.

65
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.240
Um,

66
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.400
I am logged in as myself.

67
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.650
And I am in my home,

68
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.720
my Home directory and PS directory,

69
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.220
which is the professional scripts directory that created Now the first thing before I start

70
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.980
writing a script,

71
00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.750
I need to create an MT.

72
00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.850
File there.

73
00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.250
All the input will be stored once,

74
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.050
um,

75
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.840
once actually provided by the user.

76
00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.560
So I'm gonna create touch database.

77
00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.650
I'm gonna call it database.

78
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.250
That's verified steer yet,

79
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.330
but the last one is the data Okay,

80
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.510
let's clear the screen now.

81
00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.150
The first thing I want to do is to add a record.

82
00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.350
So let's create a new script call ad record.

83
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.810
And you know what we have to do here?

84
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.630
We have to define the bash.

85
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:31.500
The comments and the comment could be the author date description.

86
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:42.350
One of my favorite this script will ad system in Mentor.

87
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:50.050
Two database files modified.

88
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.050
Leave the same date.

89
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.850
Okay,

90
00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.790
all of formalities are done.

91
00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.010
Standard is followed.

92
00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.250
Now let's get into asking question from the user.

93
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.780
What do you want to ask?

94
00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:09.650
The first question.

95
00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.100
And when you ask the first question,

96
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.870
you have to throw that question on the screen.

97
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.580
And to display that question on the screen,

98
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.450
you have to use which command echo.

99
00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:21.450
Yes,

100
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:22.950
Echo,

101
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:32.050
Please enter host name because we are going to create an inventory off our system.

102
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.550
I've been every building new system.

103
00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.950
You could add your system inventory into this database file.

104
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.700
Please end to you host name,

105
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:42.840
question Mark.

106
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.210
And then what do we do with that?

107
00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.500
Once we throw that question on the screen,

108
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.200
to the user,

109
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.230
the usable and to the host name.

110
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.250
Once the host name is entered on the screen.

111
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.680
Then we wanted to capture that and put that into variable.

112
00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.050
Right?

113
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.310
And to put that answer into a variable,

114
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.750
we have to use a command read,

115
00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.450
read.

116
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:09.550
Um,

117
00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.740
could use any variable name that you like,

118
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:20.320
but I'll pick hosting just host because host name itself is command.

119
00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.830
And I don't want to confuse you with the actual command,

120
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.950
so I'm just gonna leave read host Echo.

121
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:35.620
The second echo I'm adding is because too put in an empty line on the screen so it will

122
00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:36.650
look neat.

123
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.450
All right,

124
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:45.750
Now what we wanted to do first thing first before I add a record into my database fall,

125
00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:53.290
I want to check the host name the user has entered Does not previously exist in the

126
00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:54.840
database file.

127
00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.010
If it does,

128
00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:04.240
I am going to ever out that So two error that out.

129
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:13.950
Let's do grip my s Q Q isn't for silent and dollar host.

130
00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:18.650
His host is our variable.

131
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:21.050
From where are regretting this,

132
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:24.350
we have to define absolute path.

133
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.150
Andi,

134
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.350
the Absolute Path file,

135
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:31.940
which is home life Soul P s database.

136
00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:35.750
Remember this is the while be created before we started working on the script.

137
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:36.950
Okay,

138
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:41.850
so this is going to actually grab from this.

139
00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:43.690
Um Ah,

140
00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:48.050
grip the output off the host from this file.

141
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:49.240
Okay,

142
00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:49.650
Perfect.

143
00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:55.850
Now next thing is simple.

144
00:07:55.850 --> 00:08:01.350
If then if the output.

145
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:07.190
Which is what is that The return code?

146
00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:07.900
Yes.

147
00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.650
If the output is successful,

148
00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:11.780
which is equal,

149
00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:14.910
zero does find it.

150
00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:35.300
Then echo ever host name which is the host that you entered already exist and simply go out

151
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:39.650
another line just to make a niedere an exit.

152
00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:47.650
This and fee for the F Debbie opened up.

153
00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:53.850
That's pretty much it's for hosting.

154
00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:58.050
Now we will do the same thing for sick in question.

155
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:00.390
First we'll ask the second question,

156
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:01.350
which is echo.

157
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:08.350
Please enter I p address.

158
00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:18.110
Read that I p put in an echo as an empty line and then I will do the same thing.

159
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:27.700
Grab minus cures and silent $4 I p which is the variable from where from home I have solved

160
00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.050
PS and a database fall.

161
00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:34.350
If the output,

162
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:38.260
which is dollar question mark,

163
00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:53.550
is equal 20 which is the return satis it's successful then never I p which is the variable

164
00:09:53.550 --> 00:10:00.940
already exist then simply eco again.

165
00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:05.310
It's a line exit here too.

166
00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:06.440
If the I p exists,

167
00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.550
just don't do anything.

168
00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:15.110
And then pretty much and if with feet nice.

169
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:15.380
Okay,

170
00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:21.960
so we have asked two questions and we wanted to verify or validate these two answers

171
00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.350
against our database fall if that,

172
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:25.560
um,

173
00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.350
answer provided by the user already exists or not.

174
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:29.360
Perfect.

175
00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:35.920
Now that there the question I want to ask the user is let me hit and her keys.

176
00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:40.050
So this way it will be easier to see on the screen.

177
00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:42.350
So echo,

178
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:45.850
please enter description.

179
00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:58.150
And we want to read the description and put in one more eco.

180
00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:03.950
And now just go out that host,

181
00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:10.150
which we have the host that we asked on the first question right here,

182
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:15.050
Host with the I p.

183
00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:19.350
With the description,

184
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:22.190
I'm just gonna copy description.

185
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:30.440
So this year I don't make a mistake in dispelling and to read Eric,

186
00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:38.090
sign to our database files could use one,

187
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:40.970
but then every time the script runs is gonna override it,

188
00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:44.150
and it would delete all the records that were added previously.

189
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:47.070
So it's gonna add,

190
00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:50.450
and then I could put at the end Um,

191
00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:53.690
no.

192
00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:55.530
Before I to that,

193
00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:58.250
um I will just put right here.

194
00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:07.850
Co provided record has been perfect.

195
00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:08.800
Right?

196
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.250
And just put one maurico just for it to look.

197
00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:14.650
Save it.

198
00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:17.550
Okay,

199
00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:19.270
now assigned.

200
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:24.850
Execute permissions to run it.

Ah,

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:52.750
Version six.

209
00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:56.850
The provided record has been added.

210
00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:58.650
Perfect.

211
00:12:58.650 --> 00:12:59.850
Okay,

212
00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:01.250
Sanel,

213
00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:06.000
when we go and do cat our database file,

214
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.150
you will see that record being added.

215
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:09.910
See,

216
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:10.850
now,

217
00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:12.700
what we could do is to make it look,

218
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.150
um hello.

219
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:17.240
Neat and clean and organized.

220
00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:19.350
We could just v i r database file.

221
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:21.550
And right here we,

222
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:26.700
um um the name,

223
00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:34.050
which is the host name I P and description.

224
00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:38.110
It has not no effect on a script.

225
00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:41.850
It's just that I am putting it in so it will be easier.

226
00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:44.310
Okay,

227
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:51.850
The record is added now that me try to run the same script with the same record,

228
00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:58.490
So then we will see it will complain that this record already exists So that's clear the

229
00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:01.050
screen Bad.

230
00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:03.340
Please enter.

231
00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:04.730
Host Name read.

232
00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:10.750
Had one from ever host named Red had already exists.

233
00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:11.750
Perfect.

234
00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:13.550
It is doing its job.

235
00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:15.200
Please enter.

236
00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:20.650
Hosting bread hat to it doesn't exist right now.

237
00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:26.850
Let's please enter I ps 1 90 to 1 68 Towanda too.

238
00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:34.700
Add record line 23 Error Command now found.

239
00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:35.320
Okay.

240
00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.700
We have an issue in the script,

241
00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:38.250
guys.

242
00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:43.190
So let's look at it while it is actually validating the I p.

243
00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:44.600
Better sexist or not,

244
00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:50.240
it is complaining that the something is not right in our and what is not right.

245
00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.330
The line in line 23.

246
00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.300
It's his error command,

247
00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:54.950
not phone.

248
00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:55.860
Why?

249
00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:57.090
Because first of all,

250
00:14:57.090 --> 00:14:58.990
error itself is No.

251
00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:00.550
There is not a command.

252
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:02.750
We should have an echo in front.

253
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:04.750
Probably don't have that.

254
00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:07.570
So let's go look at Line 23.

255
00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:13.310
This V I add record and just put cold.

256
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:16.950
23 will take a straight to that line.

257
00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:19.850
Ah,

258
00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:20.610
yes.

259
00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:21.210
You see,

260
00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:23.840
what I did is I put it in.

261
00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:28.050
If the return status is zero which is successful,

262
00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:34.250
then it should have been here and then echo.

263
00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:36.320
This should be echo you don't want that.

264
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:40.050
Then error the simple picks.

265
00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:42.000
Also,

266
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.560
make sure whenever you run and you get an error message back.

267
00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:46.200
Read it.

268
00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.450
See what had Saiz.

269
00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:48.850
Okay,

270
00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:49.650
lets try again.

271
00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:50.950
Now add record,

272
00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.130
please enter Hosting.

273
00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:53.400
Read.

274
00:15:53.400 --> 00:16:02.250
Had to please enter I p address 1 92 toe 1 68 Towanda to this time.

275
00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:03.850
Ah,

276
00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:06.790
the I P address already exist.

277
00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:07.030
OK,

278
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:12.200
now we know our check about host name and I p address works.

279
00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:12.490
Per,

280
00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:19.780
um that's ad command in my ad record.

281
00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:23.050
And that command I wanted to do is every time it runs,

282
00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:25.250
it's clear the screen first.

283
00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:29.020
So this way you don't see anything that you already working on.

284
00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:30.250
It should bring up a news.

285
00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:31.580
Okay,

286
00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:32.450
so that's running,

287
00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:35.450
and you will see what I'm talking about.

288
00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:38.920
So then you run ad and it better,

289
00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:39.730
you see,

290
00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:41.320
came over the newer screen at it,

291
00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:46.330
actually pushed all the stuff that you had on the screen,

292
00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:46.960
pushed it up.

293
00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.130
So it looks better.

294
00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:49.850
Looks profession,

295
00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:56.030
please enter Hosting red hat to Okay,

296
00:16:56.030 --> 00:17:03.060
please enter I ps one eye to the 1 68 1.3 Please enter description.

297
00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:08.350
Red hat work seven.

298
00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:10.380
Perfect.

299
00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:15.760
That provided record has This is just the information that we have a deal.

300
00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:16.890
Okay,

301
00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:20.380
So this is what we we wanted to do to create or add.

302
00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:24.660
Now we need to create another script that will,

303
00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:25.850
instead of adding it,

304
00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:28.520
it will delete that.

305
00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:28.660
Right?

306
00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:32.170
So before we go ahead and try our delete record,

307
00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:33.440
let's add another record.

308
00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:37.440
So we could actually have quite a few record to play with,

309
00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:39.260
So,

310
00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:39.870
um,

311
00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:41.480
please enter host names.

312
00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.160
Red Hat three.

313
00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:47.550
I PS just 19 to 1 68 at $1 for,

314
00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:49.260
um,

315
00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:55.710
Red Hat test machine at it.

316
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:56.040
Now,

317
00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.710
if I do cat database,

318
00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:58.300
we'll see.

319
00:17:58.300 --> 00:17:59.420
I should have three records.

320
00:17:59.420 --> 00:17:59.740
Yes,

321
00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:00.050
I do.

322
00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:01.310
All right,

323
00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:02.770
so now clear the screen.

324
00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:04.800
And now I want you to copy,

325
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:08.050
add record to delete.

326
00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:10.670
Right now,

327
00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:13.160
we have copied be either delete record.

328
00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:20.720
And you could just sleep everything up and delete everything right here because starting

329
00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.240
used and change the description.

330
00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:23.660
Of course.

331
00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:39.160
This will the elite system inventory the system from inventory data?

332
00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.870
No.

333
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:45.760
Now what we want Firsts.

334
00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.210
Always asked the question.

335
00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:50.550
We cannot at any record if you don't ask questions.

336
00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:51.240
Dad,

337
00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:57.470
please enter host name or I p address.

338
00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:01.090
And now why am I asking either host name or I p s?

339
00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:08.050
The reason I'm asking is because either the user enters the I P address or Deep host name.

340
00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:09.950
We should give that option right in front.

341
00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:16.360
So they should that next come ever basically would grab for that input and delete the Rick

342
00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:16.360
.

343
00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.280
It's just that simple.

344
00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.530
I don't have to ask please into the i p address,

345
00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:20.780
please into the host name.

346
00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:25.810
And then it will go into either entered from the host name or grab it from the I P.

347
00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:27.520
It's a bit cumbersome,

348
00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:28.650
so we'll just ask.

349
00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:29.560
Just put an I p.

350
00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:31.550
R or host name and I'll do the job.

351
00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:36.270
And then what we wanted to do with their output.

352
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:37.260
We wanted to read it.

353
00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:41.520
Read Host our host I p.

354
00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:42.050
Whatever.

355
00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:45.450
Variable name that you want a specimen.

356
00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:48.160
Give it a go to for the empty line.

357
00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.350
No,

358
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:50.260
Griff.

359
00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:52.820
Minus que Again?

360
00:19:52.820 --> 00:20:00.760
Quiet host I p from my database file.

361
00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:03.660
Yes,

362
00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:10.260
that returns.

363
00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:16.660
Um zero zero.

364
00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:23.050
If the excess status zero then echo.

365
00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:34.050
Now be have found i p or the host name provided by this by the user.

366
00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:34.960
And now,

367
00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.950
before we go ahead and deleted,

368
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:42.990
we wanted to make sure the I P or the host and provided by the user actually exist in that

369
00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:43.840
database fall.

370
00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:45.850
We're not just gonna go into the violence,

371
00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:47.220
start the leading it.

372
00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:47.440
What?

373
00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.910
We don't have anything,

374
00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:51.030
So we first need to validate if it exists.

375
00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:52.640
And to make that validation,

376
00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.350
we have to grab Dad,

377
00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:57.030
provide a name from our file.

378
00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:59.510
And if I get the result,

379
00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:00.730
which is right here,

380
00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:02.550
if the result is successful,

381
00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:06.230
then you could go ahead and delete it.

382
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:10.830
And to delete a record and updated you have to use a command,

383
00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:12.430
said said,

384
00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:14.080
is a very powerful command,

385
00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.560
one of my favorite commands that could do a lot of things.

386
00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.680
A lot of wonders in a farm.

387
00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.200
Um,

388
00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:21.350
one of modification.

389
00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:44.950
So said minus I single code slash host I p single coat coat around the variable single coat

390
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:49.450
from home lie of Soul PS to you.

391
00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:52.820
So don't worry.

392
00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:53.790
Let me explain it to you.

393
00:21:53.790 --> 00:22:01.070
It's what it's doing is it's going into this file and it's trying to find host I P,

394
00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:03.050
which is provided by the user name right here.

395
00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:04.850
And once it finds it,

396
00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:06.550
deletes it.

397
00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:12.240
So you see that slash and slash What I'm saying is,

398
00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:19.200
whenever you find this this provided variable and slash deed,

399
00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:20.250
replace it,

400
00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:21.260
replace it with what?

401
00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:23.450
But D And but he is,

402
00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:27.060
it's to delete that line.

403
00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.400
If you want to put in.

404
00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.920
Let's see if I put it right here.

405
00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:36.780
Is Jose P with old just like that and then I will do so.

406
00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:38.450
Put an s here.

407
00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:39.670
Then it would.

408
00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:42.680
What it will do is actually through place.

409
00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:46.250
That name provided with the name old,

410
00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:47.910
but we don't want to replace it.

411
00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:49.650
We want to delete their records.

412
00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:57.250
So it's that take out the substitution which is s and take out the word old and put d the

413
00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:58.660
actual delete delete.

414
00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:07.460
So this is what it's doing and then go the host i p,

415
00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:08.740
which is the variable,

416
00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:11.450
has been deleted.

417
00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:13.850
Nice.

418
00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:15.460
Okay,

419
00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:21.960
so now be a good We found the provided host name or i P and we checked.

420
00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:25.360
We validated it from the database and we deleted it.

421
00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:31.550
What if it does not find from this file the uses,

422
00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:32.580
his hate go ahead in the lead,

423
00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:33.290
right had five.

424
00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:33.620
Hey,

425
00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:34.940
I don't have a read of five.

426
00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:38.750
If that return status is not zero,

427
00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:48.260
then do what Then we'll say Else cool record,

428
00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:52.510
which is the host i p,

429
00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:53.450
which is a variable,

430
00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:55.930
does not exist.

431
00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:59.550
Simple Is that en re close our fee?

432
00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:03.950
Sorry if that's it.

433
00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:06.350
Hopefully you understand.

434
00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:09.550
It's very simply written and done,

435
00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:18.590
and I'll go ahead and try to run that Delete records hit.

436
00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:19.050
Enter,

437
00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:22.850
please enter host name or I P Address.

438
00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:29.590
Now I'm going to do the same thing I did in my earlier script to clear the screens.

439
00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:34.650
I'm just going to control sea N b I the script again,

440
00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:38.450
and I'll just put in clear this tough.

441
00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:41.260
So again it will look profession.

442
00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:44.260
Let's run it Delete.

443
00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:45.540
Okay,

444
00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:47.460
Please enter Host name or I P.

445
00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:47.770
Ed,

446
00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:54.640
I'm gonna put a red hat 36 just to check this to play with it,

447
00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:56.850
see if it actually finds it or not.

448
00:24:56.850 --> 00:25:00.850
Record Red Hat 36 does not exist.

449
00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:01.990
Perfect.

450
00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:04.130
This is what I want my script to do.

451
00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:06.330
And it is doing its job.

452
00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:06.760
Perfect.

453
00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:07.540
No,

454
00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:10.170
let's delete a record actual record.

455
00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:12.990
We remember we have a record Red Hat one.

456
00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:18.080
Let's try that redhead one read had one has been deleted.

457
00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:18.920
Nice.

458
00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.850
But is did it actually delete it?

459
00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:25.190
How can we verify We could actually do cat our database file,

460
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:25.450
right?

461
00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:31.010
It actually goes into this file database and it deletes it from this database.

462
00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:31.350
Right?

463
00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:32.660
So that's very fight.

464
00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:34.160
Yes,

465
00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.480
The redhead one.

466
00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:36.760
It's gone.

467
00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:37.850
Perfect.

468
00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:39.500
Okay,

469
00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:42.010
so I have add a record.

470
00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:43.540
I haven't a leader record.

471
00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:48.280
Now I am going to create 1/3 script right here,

472
00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:55.580
which will combine both of these scripts and asked the option from the user to what option

473
00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:56.270
they want to pick.

474
00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:57.660
Do they want to add record?

475
00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:59.050
Or that we want to delete a wreck?

476
00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:01.010
So I will go.

477
00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:08.090
Here is what I will do is I'll copy one of the script add record and I'll rename.

478
00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:11.160
Is this inventory A management?

479
00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:15.870
Nice.

480
00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:16.240
Okay,

481
00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:18.450
so now inventory management,

482
00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:20.260
Let's come down here.

483
00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:21.250
Description.

484
00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:32.160
This script will I ask to add or delete a wreck from database?

485
00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:39.550
The rest is okay.

486
00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:40.830
Clear?

487
00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:41.180
Yes,

488
00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:43.260
I want to Clear right below.

489
00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:43.620
Clear.

490
00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:47.050
Just go ahead and delete every you could start from.

491
00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:48.350
Okay.

492
00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:52.880
First thing first echo.

493
00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:55.680
Clear line another echo.

494
00:26:55.680 --> 00:27:03.450
Please select one off the following up,

495
00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:10.760
and those options are Go to the line echo comma.

496
00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.020
So I,

497
00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:16.260
uh dot com a coat single coat a equal.

498
00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:23.950
Add a right single court second,

499
00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:27.590
what do you want to give the option for the 2nd 1?

500
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.950
D?

501
00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:30.930
Because the leader the leader record,

502
00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:31.200
right?

503
00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:31.870
You could pick be,

504
00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:32.300
too.

505
00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:38.350
But it's better to pick d delete all right,

506
00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:43.560
And that so far,

507
00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:46.000
what the script is going to ask is,

508
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.450
please select one of the options following option.

509
00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:52.860
And options are a is to delete at a record,

510
00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:58.660
and D is to delete a record so the user has to either enter A or D.

511
00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:00.180
So now,

512
00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:01.190
at this point,

513
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:04.480
whatever the choices that are made by the user,

514
00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:09.950
I will read those choices and I will put in a variable and we'll call that variable choice

515
00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:12.160
is just a variable.

516
00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:13.570
It's not actually choice choice,

517
00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:14.540
some kind of command.

518
00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:18.070
So you could even put to read I if you wanted.

519
00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:24.610
That will be a variable where answer off the user will go inside of their variable,

520
00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:28.720
so I'll put pick choice now,

521
00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:42.050
once I read the choice I will say case case is the statement and I will do dollar choice in

522
00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:45.520
all my choices.

523
00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:46.950
Whichever the choice that's a pick.

524
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:49.780
Put it in a case statement.

525
00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:52.270
And once the case statement is being put in,

526
00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:53.350
then what to do?

527
00:28:53.350 --> 00:29:07.050
So for a do this home I of soul PS head correct,

528
00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:07.970
Right?

529
00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:15.080
This is a script that will actually adds a record cold and semi colons chemical.

530
00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.730
This is how the case statement works,

531
00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:25.550
De whom I have solved ps the leak right?

532
00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:29.630
Semi colons him perfect.

533
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:38.160
Anything else if use it enters anything s else beside a or d Then just say echo in Belet

534
00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:50.950
choice by and we will end.

535
00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:52.000
Oh,

536
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.850
are que statement would e s a c?

537
00:29:57.850 --> 00:30:00.450
Why an empty line here?

538
00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:01.570
Nothing.

539
00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:03.650
No reason you could put it here as well,

540
00:30:03.650 --> 00:30:06.540
but I just wanted to make okay,

541
00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:09.160
so I Hopefully you understand what I just did here.

542
00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:10.380
So basically,

543
00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:14.260
from here to here is just what it is throwing in the screen.

544
00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:18.640
And then whatever the option is picked by the user,

545
00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:21.020
it will lock in into this variable choice,

546
00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:26.000
then is going to read those choices in and it's going to run based on the choice.

547
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.060
If the choice is a right here,

548
00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:29.690
the choices a run,

549
00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:32.950
this command the choice is D.

550
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:34.260
Run this command.

551
00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:37.370
If the choice is anything but A and D,

552
00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:37.960
then says,

553
00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:38.290
Hey,

554
00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:43.930
involve a choice by and then close this thing just that simple.

555
00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:44.490
Safe.

556
00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:45.050
Our script.

557
00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:52.100
Run our script in Mentor E Management and,

558
00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:52.260
er,

559
00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:55.950
please select one of the following options.

560
00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:57.160
Hmm.

561
00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:01.070
Add a record de to delete a record.

562
00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:02.460
Let's try adding a record.

563
00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:03.750
First a hit.

564
00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:04.050
Enter.

565
00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:05.120
Okay,

566
00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:05.400
See,

567
00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:06.940
It took us to another script,

568
00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:08.580
and that script is to add a record.

569
00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:12.450
Now we'll add a record Red hat five.

570
00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:13.840
I p.

571
00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:19.780
Address 19 to 1 68.1 dot six description.

572
00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:20.350
Red hat.

573
00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:22.160
Um,

574
00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.220
second,

575
00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:24.160
whatever did it.

576
00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:26.690
The provider record has been at it.

577
00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:27.800
Awesome.

578
00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.480
Now let's do the same thing for delete inventory.

579
00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:34.160
Managed police like one of the appalling options.

580
00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:34.550
Now,

581
00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:35.040
this time,

582
00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:39.380
selectee and a took us to the second script.

583
00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:41.340
Please enter host name or I P address.

584
00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:45.850
Now I'm gonna pick 1 90 to 1 68.1 dot six.

585
00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:51.450
The address I just entered Hit Enter that I p address has been deleted.

586
00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:52.380
Awesome.

587
00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:52.770
Awesome.

588
00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:53.210
Awesome.

589
00:31:53.210 --> 00:31:53.660
Now,

590
00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:55.200
the last choice,

591
00:31:55.200 --> 00:32:01.540
if I just accidentally hit um be and B is not one of the choices,

592
00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:01.760
right,

593
00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:11.250
guys and her invalid choice by perfect See how easy it becomes to put that in a a real

594
00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:12.650
structural form.

595
00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:15.090
Way to add inventory.

596
00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:15.450
Now,

597
00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:19.760
adding an inventory is just one of the example that I picked.

598
00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:25.310
I have work many times in the past where I would have to create Ah,

599
00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:32.640
some kind off file or keep track off some inventory regardless off host name right here.

600
00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:33.200
Anything else?

601
00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:39.190
So you could actually use this script and provide that to your users so they could add it

602
00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:44.850
instead off v eyeing the file and adding the record because most people are not comfortable

603
00:32:44.850 --> 00:32:44.850
.

604
00:32:44.850 --> 00:32:46.550
V i the fire.

605
00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:50.080
So try that and try it.

606
00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:50.910
But different options.

607
00:32:50.910 --> 00:32:56.110
You could also add four scripts or five different scripts and put all those scripts

608
00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:57.850
together into one means
