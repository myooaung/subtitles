1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,980
how everyone in the section I'm going to discuss about a script which can be used to fete

2
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,750
all the recording formation from the system.

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,050
Information could be like in all the network details.

4
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,060
User details,

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,050
Lord average on your system.

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,830
Memory tradition,

7
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,600
separate logician horse details,

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:29,360
internal I p up time doubting table DNA's architecture and many more information.

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:38,670
So did we have discos on learn a lot off topics with vertical as well as practice lab

10
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:39,150
station,

11
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,250
not time has come to explore them.

12
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,630
Loving is important,

13
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:48,480
but most important is how to explore them.

14
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:56,410
So this section is only man for exploring all the topics which we had discussed previously

15
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:02,710
In this course I'm going to show you one off my task which I had God in my previous

16
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:03,240
president,

17
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:08,900
task is very simple here.

18
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,250
You can see that this is my environment.

19
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,120
Here we have multiple servers.

20
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:14,990
So these other sauce,

21
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,900
this is my one somewhat to 17.

22
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:17,410
So,

23
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,870
like this were we have multiple,

24
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,750
so was present in my environment.

25
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:25,560
And if the in the middle you can see that I have once and twice over as well.

26
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,550
So what is in twice over?

27
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:32,220
Sent rice over is the servers from where I can access all my souls.

28
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,810
Wait,

29
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:34,960
No,

30
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,600
My task was very simple.

31
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,950
I have to create a script on that.

32
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:43,850
This group is basically fighting all information from the sewer.

33
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:48,880
And then I have to put that a script toe all the souls in my environment.

34
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,740
So the script Nawas system underscore details.

35
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,650
So I have created that script and put it in all the sourced.

36
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:59,000
Now you can see that on when that man does the script runs,

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,180
it gives Ah,

38
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:06,450
file that is output file of the script on that goes into this location that Islam on the

39
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:13,760
name of the finalists ACEA deaths are put off Dxy So this is the file where we have all the

40
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,850
information about them.

41
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:23,140
So now here we have one simple a So and the sentiments over we have one is clipped,

42
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:23,740
another is good.

43
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:28,530
So the purpose off that descript that is present on a central server is to,

44
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:28,980
you know,

45
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,100
goto all the several one by one,

46
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:36,360
like this is my central service hereafter added one more script.

47
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:42,010
So the purpose off that script when it runs it goes to force over on looking for this file

48
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:45,380
and copy it from their imported in the central I sell.

49
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,640
Then it goes to a second server on.

50
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,390
Do the same thing.

51
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,360
Copy this file.

52
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,460
Output off that script.

53
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:56,510
Put it in the centralized location on this group that you can see on all the soldiers it is

54
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,190
running by.

55
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:57,690
Kron,

56
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,450
we have should do the job with the help off con,

57
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,810
which is exactly you know,

58
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:06,750
running this is Kip on vehicle abysses.

59
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,500
And here also,

60
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,440
we have a script that also runs on the weekly basis.

61
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,200
No word is a benefit off that so benefit is very important here.

62
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,430
Suppose one off my system,

63
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:23,150
that is first system that goes down on it is not coming up.

64
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:29,800
So a system admin whose troubleshooting that issue he or she needs all the required

65
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,120
information off the sour If my silver is down,

66
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,380
how would I know that?

67
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:35,820
What?

68
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,580
Waas you know,

69
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:41,090
the system details the mammary days on the file systems.

70
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,380
The district is so all those information.

71
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,470
I need to troubleshoot more on that bus.

72
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,210
So in that case,

73
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:52,350
we already have one centralized servers where we have the information off all the servers

74
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:55,140
so I can go to that server that is centralized server.

75
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,000
And from there,

76
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,990
I concert for the file of their server.

77
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,180
Right on.

78
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:00,750
From there,

79
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,680
we can find out like,

80
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:01,900
Oh,

81
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,810
this is the service.

82
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:03,990
This is my network retail.

83
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,820
This is the district sales.

84
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,700
These are the file systems that were present on the system.

85
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,090
So all those information,

86
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,650
we can get it from my sin delays over.

87
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:18,670
So this section I'm going to show you this a script that it's system on the school details

88
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:18,670
.

89
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:24,880
So I'm just moving here to my this box that I have Peter Descript and same script I'm going

90
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,950
to discuss in this section.

91
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,990
So I'm just sending for you.

92
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:29,730
So just see,

93
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:33,520
you have just executed describe it is collecting the same system Information.

94
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,110
The Internet is connected.

95
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,570
Operating system type.

96
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:40,610
So tired distribution architecture in the kernel.

97
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,610
Dale's holds name.

98
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:45,380
I be lobster rolls them slab this.

99
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,250
You know,

100
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,060
Lord,

101
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,450
every system of time,

102
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:48,880
Colonel.

103
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,400
So it is collecting almost all the information's.

104
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,330
If you want to add any off more commands,

105
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,040
you can add on and here you can see that output,

106
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,030
which I'm getting it isn't,

107
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:58,360
you know,

108
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,550
pretty good.

109
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,450
Some color are there.

110
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:03,090
My first is You know,

111
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,150
you can see that is in green.

112
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,710
And after that,

113
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:05,650
output is in red.

114
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,360
So we have to learn that as well.

115
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,010
How we can,

116
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:08,760
you know,

117
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,010
put the color in the shallow script so that the output is,

118
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:12,330
you know,

119
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:17,050
in color so that it is easy to know segregate the output as well.

120
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,000
So,

121
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,230
friend,

122
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,430
that's all for the selector.

123
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:24,060
The next electorally start with the bash colors How we can,

124
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:24,210
you know,

125
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,910
put the colors and output off the script.

126
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,030
So that's all for this lecture with you in the next lecture,

127
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:30,550
but by
