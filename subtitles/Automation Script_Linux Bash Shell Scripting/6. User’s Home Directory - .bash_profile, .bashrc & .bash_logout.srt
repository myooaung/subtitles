1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,970
how everyone So in this,

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,640
like tell will understand about the log in.

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,460
Now we have the shell we understood about the Shadow.

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,210
Now the next party,

5
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,090
the users.

6
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:11,920
Now,

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,310
if he harbor land X box.

8
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:18,550
Obviously there will be a lot off users who is going to long that box.

9
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:25,360
Suppose I have a box on that is a production box on some dollars is an application is

10
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,960
running on that box so there would be in a few users that belongs to,

11
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,180
you know,

12
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,350
application team.

13
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,930
And also there would be some users that is,

14
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,930
from the database team on future users from your units.

15
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,660
All Annex Team backup team is tourist to him.

16
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,860
Who is going to manage the entire server infrastructure?

17
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:53,420
Suppose a normal user like Devi user who wants to in a long into the box.

18
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,010
He has to supply some cutting share,

19
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:01,110
so allocating the user we also create.

20
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,460
It's possible as well,

21
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:08,520
so user needs to supply the user name and the passport,

22
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,750
and after that,

23
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:18,110
users would look into the box on by before the user will always go to the home dedic two of

24
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:18,710
the user.

25
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,750
So let's understand.

26
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,690
Ah,

27
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:22,720
home directory,

28
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,110
also called a log in directory and in the directory online.

29
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:32,400
Next likes operating systems that solved at the repository for users,

30
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,310
personal files,

31
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,080
directories and programs.

32
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:40,750
It is also directly that a user is forced in after logging into the system.

33
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,150
So that is rest home.

34
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,880
Suppose I have a user,

35
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,450
Sam,

36
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,800
when Sam is going too long into the box,

37
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:55,960
so by before it will be going into slash home and that we have for the subdirectory that

38
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,650
it's Sam.

39
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,530
So all the,

40
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,060
you know,

41
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:04,720
users home directories would be created inside Celeste Holm by deformed.

42
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,650
You can care some,

43
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:07,370
you know,

44
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,620
other part as well.

45
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,680
But by the fall is your slash for Ah,

46
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:17,850
home directories kitted automatically for every ordinary user in the,

47
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:25,200
you know Celeste Holm as tender sub directly for the rude attitude that this list.

48
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,310
So for road users,

49
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,190
the home directories less rude.

50
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,400
Only apart from that other users,

51
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,830
their home directly would be in slash home in that we have the subdirectory that is with

52
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,520
the same name as the user name.

53
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,950
It is Sam over this John.

54
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,130
So it will re slash home slash John,

55
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:51,720
Apart from having ah home director toe create and store files.

56
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:58,060
Users need an environment that gives them access to the tools and resources.

57
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,760
When a user log in to a system,

58
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,290
the users work environment is deter mined by in this location files.

59
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:12,850
These initialization files are defined by the use of this terrible script shell which can

60
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,620
very depending on the release,

61
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,430
the default initialization files in your home directories enable you to customize your

62
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,170
working environment.

63
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,990
So what does it mean?

64
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,140
It means that you know,

65
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:29,740
when I use a log in to the system so But before you know different initially in size and

66
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:33,040
files will be executed toe customize their,

67
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,290
you know,

68
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,050
environment.

69
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,190
So here,

70
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:41,450
we need to understand if you file So this is a file this the 1st 1 that it's less disease

71
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:42,260
less profile.

72
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:46,420
This is system white file that a system administrator,

73
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,240
man Danes.

74
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,000
So this file can be,

75
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,540
you know,

76
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:54,490
modified by a good user only on its ah,

77
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,050
you know,

78
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,240
system wide.

79
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:56,510
Fine.

80
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:03,140
We can see that this vile defines task that the shell execute for every user who logs in.

81
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:09,340
So if you're going to put anything on that file so that would be applicable for all the

82
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,020
users.

83
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,330
Suppose I have 50 users in my box?

84
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:20,290
I want something for all the users that I have to put in this file like I want that

85
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,800
whenever the user log in,

86
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:26,550
they will get some message like some warning message or welcome toe.

87
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,860
You know this environment this is a critical.

88
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,260
So where you want.

89
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,910
Whenever I use a lot sin,

90
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,960
they will get some message on.

91
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,400
That is for all the users.

92
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,400
Then this is the file.

93
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,640
It's a system wide on.

94
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:46,480
It is applicable for all the users who log into that box destruction in the file.

95
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,310
Usually second cell variables such as party,

96
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,350
user and host name.

97
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,810
So you will see different,

98
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:52,510
different and please.

99
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:57,440
But the main meaning off this filers that if you want to,

100
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:57,800
you know,

101
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,740
apply something for our entire users in a system that you have to look for this file.

102
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,390
No,

103
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:07,450
there's another file that is dark bash profile.

104
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:12,350
So these file that is doctor profile or dot RC and dart lagarde file.

105
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:17,670
So these files these are the confrontation files you will find in the inside the user's

106
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:18,550
home directory.

107
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:22,620
Every users has its own in isolation file.

108
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:29,320
Suppose I have a stand user So Sam User has its own bash file own RC file.

109
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,650
Best underscore ossified own Lord file.

110
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:37,890
If I were John User so John User would be having its own you know,

111
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:40,020
this file profile file,

112
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,980
RC file and longer file.

113
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:48,650
So don't bet Bashar see profile is a confrontation file for configuring user environment.

114
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:54,540
The users can modify the default settings and at any extra quantification so we'll have a

115
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,040
lab station is also nobody's.

116
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:01,480
So there's another file that is dot best ourselves a shallow script vigilance every time a

117
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,860
user opens a new shell.

118
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:08,420
So when a user log in so you will see that the first file that will be executed If you have

119
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,600
put something in that file,

120
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,520
it will be executed on,

121
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,920
then this file will be executed on.

122
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,680
If we'll go inside to this file,

123
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,850
you will see that this file calls you this file that is best underscore R c.

124
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:25,400
So it will be executed by this file on then.

125
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,350
This file is already executing on this is the longer form.

126
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,850
When you let go from the system,

127
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:40,170
your dot best underscored lago file will be executed now.

128
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:45,840
One more thing dot Best profile is executed for logging shells while dot bash our seas

129
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,170
executed for interactive logging Non log in shells.

130
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,620
So what does it mean?

131
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,240
It means that suppose you know there is a user,

132
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,250
Sam Sam is going toe to toe any of the server.

133
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,770
So that is the logging shell.

134
00:06:58,770 --> 00:06:59,910
They will get some log in shell.

135
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:02,350
So at that time,

136
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,160
what will happen?

137
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,180
All your system Why file will be executed?

138
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,950
That is your slash city profile will be executed on Apart from there,

139
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:10,970
you know,

140
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:17,000
it's in this latest and file will be also executive that is dot best RC and dot best

141
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,440
profile will also executed.

142
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,540
But if you are already,

143
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:20,820
you know,

144
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,900
taken discretion you have taken,

145
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,350
You know,

146
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:26,790
your log in session on from that session.

147
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:27,130
You know,

148
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:27,890
if you're going to,

149
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:28,360
you know,

150
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,920
simple fire the best common.

151
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,510
So that would be a non logging shell.

152
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,160
So in that case,

153
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,410
you will find that on Lee.

154
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:35,820
This is executed.

155
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,880
That is taught Boesch RC.

156
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:43,590
So when you're logged in type user name and password by counsel at the sitting at the

157
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,250
system or remotely.

158
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:45,400
Why,

159
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,450
Asset doctor?

160
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,480
So at that time,

161
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,860
you'll find that dot that profile is executed to configure yourself before the

162
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,520
initialization.

163
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:52,940
Come on.

164
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,720
But if you have already logged into your system,

165
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:01,620
it means that if you have only taken log into the system and open a new 10 minute like

166
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,160
extra,

167
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,330
so that gives a new best.

168
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,780
Shelly will get they.

169
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:14,720
But at that time on this five millions of dot bashar see So dog best RC they executed

170
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,660
before the window.

171
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:21,500
Common problem So dark Best arses also run When you start a new best instance like if you

172
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,500
fire this coming so nobody's I can understand that that is little bit,

173
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,050
you know,

174
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:32,860
take it for you on confusing so resolute is tryingto tell the difference between dot bash

175
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,350
profile.

176
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,700
In this we'll have a live fish in as well.

177
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,480
So in the last session I will be,

178
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:37,880
you know,

179
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,770
telling you and in detail so that you can understand the difference.

180
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,870
So when did so for this lecture?

181
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,080
