1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,830
how everyone.

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:02,980
So let's continue.

3
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,610
So the last,

4
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:06,200
Lechter,

5
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:11,830
while defining the variable for operating system time we have mentioned like this way We

6
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:13,950
have mentioned dollar on in the bracket.

7
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:19,420
We have mentioned you name hyphen or on in the next line you can see that I have defined

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,830
available right,

9
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,030
that is type B.

10
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:22,910
But the way off,

11
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:23,480
you know,

12
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,410
defining the variable list differ.

13
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,650
So both are correct.

14
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:31,270
So if I'm using the same way this one So that is also correct.

15
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:32,300
So don't be confused.

16
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,010
That's family showing you here as well.

17
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:49,920
I can see that the same output I'm getting right Next one is your distribution.

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,460
That is your that did it.

19
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,360
So we know that we have,

20
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:54,770
you know,

21
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,830
different distribution off Lenox,

22
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:01,640
Like your redhead saying toe is Susie Mandrake Debian.

23
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,520
So how would I find out?

24
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:09,430
So there is a common that is you name Hyphen is so this command will only tell you that

25
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,730
whether it's a Lennix.

26
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:17,550
But what distribution off Lennox is that it's a red hair sent to is for that I have to use

27
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:17,930
simple,

28
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:18,190
you know,

29
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:19,150
if else condition.

30
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,050
Right.

31
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,660
So one more thing here If it is there,

32
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:22,870
you know,

33
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:23,870
read or send to us.

34
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:24,630
We have a file,

35
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,690
this one that is ready.

36
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:29,550
So if you have Santos and readers will find this.

37
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,940
And if we get this finally for this redder,

38
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,700
you'll see it's a ready on day for the sender's,

39
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,720
you'll see Same fine.

40
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,030
But that finally will find it is written as a Saint Louis late.

41
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,070
If it is,

42
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:42,430
you know,

43
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,040
Susie,

44
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,970
the file would be this one.

45
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:49,050
That is Susan on that is desk release.

46
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,900
So with that fine,

47
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:55,470
you'll come to know that this is my Susie Lennox on.

48
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,700
If it is Mandrake,

49
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,660
we have this one man drink that is release.

50
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,190
If it is,

51
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:02,610
you know,

52
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,390
Debian.

53
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,460
So the file would with this one Debian And here it is underscored,

54
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,200
not dish.

55
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,180
So you have to do some r and D on there so that it will find all those things.

56
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,010
So with the help of this file,

57
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,560
I will come to know that what distribution off Lennox we have.

58
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,530
Okay,

59
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:18,260
because in mind,

60
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:18,560
woman,

61
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,880
it could be a few that had few sent to his few fedora off.

62
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,450
You know,

63
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,820
Debian and few in a mandrake.

64
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,960
Susie So how would I know that?

65
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,170
So I'm just going to create a script on I'm using.

66
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,320
If else condition.

67
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,910
So I ask,

68
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:38,280
was this one okay?

69
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:44,490
So I'm using this variable that is always on guard Dollar on.

70
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:44,790
Did it?

71
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,260
That is you name Hyphen s.

72
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,320
Great.

73
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,860
So you never happen s that is on Lennox,

74
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,250
right?

75
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,630
Okay.

76
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,920
No,

77
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,690
Maybe in my environment suppose I have some sp UNIX also on do some eggs also.

78
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,630
So you can compared with that.

79
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,020
Come on,

80
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,680
If you are finding your name,

81
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,200
I finance,

82
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,650
if it is showing extended,

83
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:18,070
will simple print their se x So if I'm going to use if on the file attributes I'm going to

84
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:23,410
use if I found half Andi before that I want to use this one.

85
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:28,680
That is bliss.

86
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:37,790
They on this one,

87
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,100
That is.

88
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,770
You call to line X.

89
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,760
Okay,

90
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:52,090
Now we have come to know that this is Lennix Now I just want to know that it is a land is

91
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:57,030
But what distribution is there If it is Lennix Then again,

92
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:05,150
I'm going to use if on that I'm checking for the file that is D C Is that it?

93
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:09,640
That is release.

94
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,860
Okay on closing it then.

95
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,950
All right.

96
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:32,360
And I can put like distribution is equal to I live in they second condition.

97
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,460
I'm putting Elif.

98
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:42,820
If on death in my Lennox if the file is this one,

99
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,170
that is those through the Atlantic's.

100
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:47,780
Okay,

101
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:58,490
then I can put distribution is a no variable name I have given I'm putting this Susan.

102
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,610
Okay,

103
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:13,820
some mystic out on this one left symbol of using a lift off the next one.

104
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,920
Is this live on?

105
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,780
If my files this Mandaric that is man drink.

106
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,250
Wes,

107
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:27,930
you get close check.

108
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:31,670
You could just log into the box each box and crosscheck the feeling.

109
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,010
Okay,

110
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:39,230
you can put distribution that is equal to you mending.

111
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:43,750
If on did.

112
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,040
If you see this one,

113
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:51,360
that is for Debian on the Debian Voisin.

114
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,050
If you have the file of this one,

115
00:05:53,050 --> 00:06:00,160
then the distribution would be what should be Debian only.

116
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,780
Okay?

117
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,200
I want to close this one.

118
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:12,210
I used twice time If May know what this is Crap.

119
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,630
I will comfortable that whether it's a redhead,

120
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,660
send us or it's a you know,

121
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:23,750
Susie on all those for now I need to print as well right.

122
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,200
So how to print this one?

123
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,100
So that is this one distribution,

124
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:29,550
right?

125
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:33,750
So after port this one echo on,

126
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,220
uh,

127
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,650
hyphen E that it's less e this one.

128
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:39,620
Could you do?

129
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,830
That is for the green one.

130
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,260
Um,

131
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,850
on here after port The distribution.

132
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,570
Andi,

133
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:50,150
let me close this one.

134
00:06:50,150 --> 00:07:00,550
That IHS zero am andi and still s e this one.

135
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:05,330
I have to put the 31 for the red color on.

136
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,440
This is my you know,

137
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,150
a lot of letters distribution.

138
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,990
I e.

139
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,650
Zero Um let me close.

140
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:16,300
Okay.

141
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,320
I'm going to run this one.

142
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,420
Let's see,

143
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:22,050
I'm getting the desired output on maybe some type of mistake.

144
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,860
It is saying that Come on.

145
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,870
Not from let's see.

146
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:29,600
It should be in bracket.

147
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:38,020
If we have some space and it should be Becker,

148
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,170
others will take what?

149
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,160
It should not take this one.

150
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:47,150
You can see that I've got a desired output.

151
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,920
But one more thing.

152
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,440
Suppose you know I told you in the beginning that did.

153
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,370
If you have a file that is for those sent to us in the centres,

154
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:58,400
you will see that we have the same file late.

155
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,420
Okay,

156
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,940
so let me log into one off my sent box.

157
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,390
So the i p off my centers,

158
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,210
But that 1 90 to 1 60 years,

159
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:06,740
that is,

160
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,260
you know,

161
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,690
209 and one for two.

162
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:17,130
I can see that business sent to us right on the center.

163
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,490
They also we have the same fine.

164
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:22,060
But with my come on,

165
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,110
I will only know that this is my center is only right.

166
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:30,630
So I'm going to cut this file on.

167
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,730
I'm going to keep this fight here.

168
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:33,860
You can see this swing.

169
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,680
Let him.

170
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,130
But here it is showing,

171
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:37,520
you know,

172
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,220
sand boost.

173
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,450
So I can add a few more thing with my script here.

174
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,650
Well,

175
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:43,650
you know,

176
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:46,030
deciding whether it's a,

177
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:46,570
you know,

178
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:50,850
reading or sent to us so I can put,

179
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:51,030
like,

180
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:55,750
this way that is Get this one.

181
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,220
Okay,

182
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,820
if you have this fighting so it will cap this friend,

183
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,330
and I'm gonna be used or care So we'll discuss up in that little lectures.

184
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,690
But here and simple meaning,

185
