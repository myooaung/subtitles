00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,360
Hello,

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:10,220
everyone to this topic is Charlotte scripting So in this lecture will understand about what

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,450
is shallow scripting.

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:16,360
Why shall scripting on what we can achieve with chalice?

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:24,900
Scripting a Charlotte's crib is a file containing a city's off commands.

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:34,060
The shell leaves this file and carries out the commands as though they have been entered

7
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,520
directly on the common line.

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,150
So shells are interactive.

9
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:43,250
So what is interactive?

10
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:48,050
It means that the shells will accept comin from you.

11
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:53,250
Why keyboard and execute them So that is interactive.

12
00:00:53,250 --> 00:01:00,940
How you what if you have is store a sequence of commands.

13
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:09,230
Two attacks fight and tell the shell to execute the text file instead off entering all the

14
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:14,550
commands one by one that is known as shell program or shall a script.

15
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:23,930
It can help you to automate your day to day videos dusk,

16
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:29,120
and also it will make your work easy,

17
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,590
efficient and fast.

18
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,270
So these are the benefits of shallow scripting.

19
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,050
So in a shallow script what older?

20
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:37,590
You know,

21
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,950
key words we can have.

22
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:43,220
We will have the Commons simple commands.

23
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,880
You can put it in a Shalit's clipped like your PWD.

24
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,540
Come on back.

25
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:47,600
Oh,

26
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,420
come on read exit on many more commands.

27
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:54,330
You can put some keyboards as well,

28
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:58,010
like you can use if house for new via loop,

29
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,760
you can use some bindi commands as well.

30
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,500
You can use,

31
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:02,740
you know,

32
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,780
tax processing utilities like share or cut,

33
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,920
grab eager up.

34
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,510
Exactly functions control flow statements.

35
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,390
So with the combination off all these,

36
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:14,850
you know,

37
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:18,150
keywords will create a shallow scrip.

38
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,310
And with the help of Shell's good,

39
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,450
we can automate our work.

40
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,570
In simple words,

41
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:29,600
alteration can be achieved with shallow scripting.

42
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,430
Let me take an example.

43
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,710
Suppose you know Ah,

44
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:42,330
half tensile was and I want to do the packing on all the tens of hours on our for the

45
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,580
patting All my cell was will be devoted.

46
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,180
So this is a task I need to do it.

47
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,770
So before starting the patching,

48
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,390
I need to do the revalidation off.

49
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:59,370
All the tens of us in the revalidation have to,

50
00:02:59,370 --> 00:02:59,950
you know,

51
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:04,280
fire 50 commands from each of the sewers.

52
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:09,140
So these 50 commands the really important commands,

53
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,760
which is taking the back up off the conflagration files,

54
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,940
your network information,

55
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:15,990
your hard disk,

56
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,460
your file systems,

57
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:21,000
your half a step so obviously feel going to,

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,460
you know,

59
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:26,260
reboot any of the box so before to initiate the reboot before the mission.

60
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:33,220
The batting You need to go up revalidation catching all the commands from all the 10

61
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,230
soldiers for one ways to,

62
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:35,690
you know,

63
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:43,390
logging All the so was one by one on fire all your 50 commands on whatever that you all put

64
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,880
your getting capping in a file on putting in one safe location,

65
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,760
this exercise,

66
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:54,380
you have to do it on all the tensile was after that you can start your patching,

67
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,070
so obviously it will take,

68
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:56,690
you know,

69
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:00,440
2 to 3 hours to do this pre validation war.

70
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:07,410
We can achieve this work with the help of shallow scripting,

71
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:11,230
we can clear a script and this kid,

72
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,000
we can put all the commands.

73
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,590
And also we can,

74
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:15,800
you know,

75
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,650
use some,

76
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,090
you know,

77
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:25,450
loops so that we can initiate a script from one location that this kid will go to one

78
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:32,390
somewhere one by one and fire all the commands on what with output were getting capturing

79
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,200
on putting in,

80
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:33,720
putting,

81
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,310
putting in one location.

82
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,890
And then it will go to next.

83
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,730
So was fighting all the comments,

84
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:41,610
Andi.

85
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,570
And what,

86
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,190
without trivia getting put it in a file on,

87
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,450
then seven in a safe location.

88
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,160
So this way,

89
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:49,540
you know,

90
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:54,550
you can do this work in a very fast way,

91
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,570
efficient on easy.

92
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,240
So that is called,

93
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,560
you know,

94
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,150
smart World.

95
00:04:59,150 --> 00:04:59,850
We can see that.

96
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:05,950
So we have achieved this with help off automation on this automation,

97
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,140
we have done with the help of shallow scripting.

98
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:12,520
So this is what we're going to learn in this entire course.

99
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:12,930
Morning.

100
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:17,770
Learning off anything is not a big task.

101
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:21,040
The big task is to how to explore the things.

102
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:27,710
So this course model will help you how to explore the things like suppose.

103
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:28,120
You know,

104
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,110
I have talk to you about if then else.

105
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:35,330
But how to explore this?

106
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:44,530
This is what we're going to learn in this course more so what we can achieve with a shout

107
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,160
with the help of,

108
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,330
you know,

109
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,090
shallow scripting.

110
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:48,350
We can do a lot of things with the shallow skip.

111
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:52,270
Like you can do pre validation that we discuss.

112
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,470
We can do,

113
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,200
you know,

114
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,520
monitoring off any sores.

115
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,750
You can do the backup.

116
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,320
You can find out,

117
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:01,840
you know,

118
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,560
water.

119
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,470
The processors you have on the system which is eating your system resources.

120
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,260
Hey,

121
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,280
somebody you know,

122
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:15,380
you have the box and do then boxes,

123
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:15,810
you know,

124
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,450
having some performance issue,

125
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,830
and that is basically coming in the midnight.

126
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,360
And at that time,

127
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:21,850
you know,

128
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,570
the sources are not of living.

129
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,310
So what you can do,

130
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,410
you can simply,

131
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:27,910
you know,

132
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,260
create a shallow script.

133
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,340
In the Sala script,

134
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,380
you can put all the,

135
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:31,810
you know,

136
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,930
performance related commands,

137
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:34,410
like top.

138
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,540
Come on on the Amistad.

139
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:36,930
Come on.

140
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,000
Which will be capturing,

141
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,390
you know,

142
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,790
you know the resources information.

143
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:41,230
Like what?

144
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,340
Its CPU utilization,

145
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,540
memory utilization.

146
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,790
You're you know,

147
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,870
so descript litigation.

148
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:49,150
So different commands.

149
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,610
We have job Vienna stabbed,

150
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:50,860
shot.

151
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,200
Come on.

152
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,810
So with the help of showers kept in,

153
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,530
you can create a simple Sal escape.

154
00:06:55,530 --> 00:07:02,030
But all the commons on you have is cuticle that skip at a specific time.

155
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,260
That is midnight.

156
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:06,110
So that so that,

157
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:06,520
you know,

158
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,650
at that time,

159
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:11,660
this could well be a secure executed on output is saving in a file.

160
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,650
So next day,

161
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:13,860
when you're coming to the office,

162
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:19,160
you can simply check that file like what happened to the sour at that time war with the

163
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,350
resource which was,

164
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:20,680
you know,

165
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,150
high at that time.

166
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:29,560
So how we have achieved this simply We have kicked in the shallows kept so we'll do a lot

167
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,110
of things but this course Morning.

168
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:31,720
So,

169
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:31,930
friend,

170
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,550
that's all for this lecture will see in the next election.
