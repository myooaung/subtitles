00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.150
However,

2
00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:03.300
if one So the next commander,

3
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:03.760
the test.

4
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:04.350
Come on.

5
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.350
The test command is used.

6
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:07.230
Toe check.

7
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.940
The file types file is existing or not.

8
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.810
I also used to compare the values as well.

9
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:19.380
The test come on is used in conditional execution as well.

10
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.930
So Syntex is very simple.

11
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.230
This is a test on condition,

12
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.440
condition could be anything and you know,

13
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.350
comparison off any numbers or you can check the existing off any file.

14
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.950
So after the condition,

15
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.850
two things can be happened at the two of falls.

16
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:47.200
My condition should be satisfied or should not be satisfied if it is satisfied that it is

17
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.710
going to implement this one.

18
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.550
So here we have em person us time and to if my condition is satisfied.

19
00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.600
So whatever you have mentioned here,

20
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.950
this is going to be implement.

21
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.550
If my condition is not satisfied that this is going to be,

22
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.240
you know,

23
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.710
print.

24
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.750
That is after price time off pipe.

25
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.040
So here we have simple example.

26
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.650
Test 100 is gooder than 99.

27
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.080
I m percent price time echo.

28
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.420
Yes,

29
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.370
that's true.

30
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.000
Pipe sign Price time.

31
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.360
I could.

32
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.130
That's not that's false.

33
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.800
So this come on will print the text years.

34
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.420
That's true because hundreds skater than 99.

35
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.010
So here we have another example,

36
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.950
this one test 100 is less than 99.

37
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.830
So my condition is not satisfied here.

38
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.020
So this is going to be implement This one,

39
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.870
that is no,

40
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.330
because 100 is not less than 99.

41
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.240
So at the last you can see that is you know,

42
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.490
ah,

43
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.930
file.

44
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.400
It is going to check a file.

45
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.660
That is it easy host.

46
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:48.630
It could be any fine.

47
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.560
You can put any file.

48
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.440
As for your requirement now they're two conditions to or falls.

49
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.590
Whether the files as this thing are,

50
00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.800
the file is not existing If the file is existing So this is going to print this one after m

51
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.250
percent.

52
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.330
So I am percent means the condition is true.

53
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.750
So whatever you have mentioned after the M percent rise time,

54
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.660
so this is going to be,

55
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.240
you know,

56
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.360
implement if the condition is satisfied.

57
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:23.190
So I'm just moving towards my box on Let's do some practice test five five.

58
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.250
Is it going to five?

59
00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.890
So here you can see that the condition is satisfied because five is able to find that true

60
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.340
after that I have used twice time in person on echo.

61
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.190
I'm putting Yes,

62
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.890
on Echo?

63
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:40.510
No.

64
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.000
So it is going to type?

65
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.540
Yes,

66
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.350
because condition is satisfying here.

67
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.940
If I am putting five is equal to six,

68
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:48.910
then?

69
00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:49.160
No,

70
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.950
Because condition is not satisfying here.

71
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.630
You can put anything like Fife is not equal to someone.

72
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.180
That's true.

73
00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.930
Let me clear the fine touch on there.

74
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.790
I'm going to get a final this host,

75
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.150
Okay?

76
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.710
Death hyphen F on.

77
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:12.880
I'm looking for this file.

78
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.850
That is host.

79
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.120
Okay,

80
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.820
I know that this file is existing.

81
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:17.570
Didn't Tam now?

82
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.160
Okay,

83
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:42.490
so find missing.

84
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.120
Okay,

85
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.990
so file existing Because they just don't have the file.

86
00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:49.840
I'm going to delete this fight.

87
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.880
Okay?

88
00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:53.530
Again,

89
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:54.110
I'm fighting this.

90
00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.440
Come on.

91
00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.420
The file is missing so you can use the test.

92
00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.050
Come on.

93
00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.620
Do you know,

94
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.670
check the file types and,

95
00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.890
you know,

96
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.010
file existing off if I like this or not.

97
00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.650
And also,

98
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.080
you have seen that how we have used the test Command to compare the values as well.

99
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.360
In the next lecture,

100
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.940
I'm going to get a simple self script in which I'm going to use if else,

101
00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:14.940
you know,

102
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:15.370
check.

103
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.720
Come on.

104
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.890
So thanks for watching.

105
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.250
The Lechter will soon The next lecture about
