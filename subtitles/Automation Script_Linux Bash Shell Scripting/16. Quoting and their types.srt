1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,070
how everyone in this lecture will understand about the coating.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,210
So that's a very interesting and conceptual topic.

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,030
So let's stop your best.

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,750
Shell understands special characters with special meaning.

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,350
What does it mean?

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,470
Suppose you have created available ABC.

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,720
If he sees the name off my variable in that terrible ah ha.

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,270
Put something like any name,

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:26,000
any number.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,170
And if I want to read that variable I need to use eco on dollar ABC I will get an output

11
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:39,670
this eco Come on on a dollar which I'm using to read that available.

12
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:47,910
So dollar is my special character which is basically going toe Honda Come on under.

13
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,940
Execute the variable like this We have some system variables as well in your system,

14
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,770
like it's less homes,

15
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,380
less part ps one.

16
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,030
And also,

17
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,980
if you are using this command arcos less they're less Log Star Law.

18
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,710
This wild guard is going to be run So this is a wild card that last comma.

19
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:08,250
But suppose you know,

20
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,550
sometimes we do not wish to use variables are wild cards.

21
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:25,910
Suppose you know I want to print dollar ps one So that kiss what I'm going to use eco on

22
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:26,950
dollar ps one.

23
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,300
But in result,

24
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,710
I'm getting some output off this PS one.

25
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:33,060
But this is not my requirement.

26
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,340
I want when I use Accord Dollar PS one,

27
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,720
it should bring the same.

28
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,940
It 1/2 type here,

29
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:39,750
I notice,

30
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,500
should execute the value of PS one.

31
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,440
So that case,

32
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:44,730
you know,

33
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:45,250
you have,

34
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:45,770
tow,

35
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:51,980
enable or disable the meaning of a special characters by enclosing them in a single courts

36
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:51,980
.

37
00:01:51,980 --> 00:02:01,170
So let me show you how we can suppose you know I want to print this echo on this one dollar

38
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,080
PS one.

39
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,750
So in all,

40
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,120
put again.

41
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,530
See that I'm getting this one.

42
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,660
But my comment is that it should bring dollar beers one only.

43
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,930
So you have to type like this way.

44
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:16,320
I can see that in output.

45
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,100
I'm getting this one.

46
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:22,940
I suppose I have ABC on this.

47
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,150
I have mentioned my name.

48
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,810
Okay.

49
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:30,470
If I'm finding this a dollar embassy,

50
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,250
it was he my name,

51
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:39,360
I suppose I'm just typing this one bc The city is not defined anywhere.

52
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,550
It is not defined it all.

53
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:43,940
Even though I'm not getting any output,

54
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,650
I want to print this one.

55
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:49,860
So you have to use a single core like,

56
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:56,260
I suppose if you want to echo anything and then that's supposed dollar is coming like this

57
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:01,650
will echo on and putting um,

58
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:07,170
going with my bus,

59
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:11,280
you can see that.

60
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,710
And I would put the bus is missing because it is looking for the dollar,

61
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:18,840
but it's thinks that bus is a variable.

62
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,610
But I want to print all of us so that kids,

63
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,660
you have to use this one.

64
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,650
Okay,

65
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,190
so there is a meeting off,

66
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:28,710
you know,

67
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,010
quoting Right.

68
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,540
So there are three types off,

69
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:33,900
you know,

70
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,850
quoting two types off.

71
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:40,350
God's begins its two types of courts.

72
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,260
Let's understand each growth one by one.

73
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,410
The 1st 1 is your,

74
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:45,850
you know,

75
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,070
double court.

76
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:58,750
Okay,

77
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:03,850
so let's understand where we can use double court on there.

78
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:07,090
What's the benefit off that on?

79
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,550
Very can use double court.

80
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,080
So basically,

81
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,030
in simple words,

82
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,660
if you have any variable on,

83
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,160
if you want to define that variable,

84
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,930
then you have to use a double court.

85
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,450
So let's take an example here.

86
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,540
So what?

87
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:24,440
I want to print this echo on that I want to print this one.

88
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,510
This dollar.

89
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,600
Hey,

90
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,650
I'm getting an output here.

91
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:38,380
If I'm not using this even though I'm getting an output.

92
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,740
So what is the benefit off?

93
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,850
That benefit is there.

94
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,100
Suppose I have a very bill.

95
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:42,940
And after that,

96
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,560
I want to wear something like this one.

97
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,570
ABC.

98
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:53,150
I suppose there is nothing in the between the available and the new name.

99
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,670
So here it is,

100
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:59,990
looking for a variable a home ABC and I would put it's nothing.

101
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,230
So in that case,

102
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,420
we can segregate our variable with some other words.

103
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,010
How we can do that here.

104
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,470
I can use this one like this way.

105
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:14,360
I'm guarding output like this,

106
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:20,880
right?

107
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,530
So for variables,

108
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,940
it is Yes.

109
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,850
Let's see for the well cut.

110
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:28,510
Well,

111
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,460
cups like this one.

112
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,990
This is your wife thought I'm doing here.

113
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:36,790
Echo this web long the Starland.

114
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,930
So I'm getting an output here.

115
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:39,240
Right?

116
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,750
But they wouldn't court.

117
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,620
So if I am putting in court this,

118
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:53,010
you can see that it is just printing whatever mentioning my this under double quoted so

119
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:53,870
wild cards.

120
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:58,030
We can say that if you are using any wild cards on the double quoted,

121
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,220
it means that is going to be a dissident.

122
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,230
All right?

123
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,280
Yes,

124
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:03,970
this one,

125
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:09,470
but I even in the Commons.

126
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:09,770
Also,

127
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:14,610
you can put this one so we have few comes like this one date.

128
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:15,070
Come on.

129
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:19,460
I'm getting an output on like Alice.

130
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:19,890
Come on.

131
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:20,770
Getting an output.

132
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:27,650
So So what I want to use eco today is I can put like this way.

133
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:36,340
So for command substitution is yes.

134
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:44,330
So basically these are examples we can say off the double court right now,

135
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,500
coming to the single court,

136
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,570
the single Let's see what all the things we can do with a single court.

137
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:56,020
All right,

138
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,620
so single court,

139
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,720
Let's take some examples.

140
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,610
Like so in simple world symbol court is disabled.

141
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:06,880
The meaning of wild cards are any special characters as well.

142
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,630
So I have a special character,

143
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:11,710
this one that is dollar home.

144
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,230
So this is a special character.

145
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,970
If you're putting in a single correct single,

146
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:20,780
you know this single court this is going to disable the meaning off your you know,

147
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:24,060
special characters as well as a welcome as well.

148
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,840
So here we have an example of Why card this one on?

149
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,380
If you found simplifying this,

150
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,390
I'm getting an output.

151
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,300
It is,

152
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:32,810
you know,

153
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:37,040
expanding the wild cards when I want to disable the meaning off workers.

154
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:42,670
I can put it in a single court as well tonight.

155
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:47,250
So for double coated on single quoted,

156
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,520
one thing is common.

157
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,750
That is wild cards.

158
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:55,120
If you're putting this and single quoted as well as double quarter,

159
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,550
it is going toe the civil,

160
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:57,800
the wild cards.

161
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,120
So that is a similar to between double quarter on single.

162
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,710
Apart from that variable,

163
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:05,390
Yeah,

164
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:09,010
double couldn't this your valuable is goingto be animal.

165
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:15,850
But the single court the variable is disabled in simple words with single court,

166
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:19,940
everything is going to be disciplined Like if you have defined any variable here like you

167
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,060
can see that it is dissemble.

168
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,290
I'm not getting the upper one variable here.

169
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:25,820
Also,

170
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,820
my wild cards is disabled.

171
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:34,330
Even if I'm putting any commands inside this one like this one on If I am putting inside

172
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:34,650
this,

173
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:38,680
you'll see that the common is also not executing.

174
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,370
Because this is a you know.

175
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:40,860
Come on,

176
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,270
I'm not getting the output off dead.

177
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:51,110
So from their cell for this like to hope you have got an idea off quoting on day Still,

178
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:54,290
we have a few more things to discuss in the coating that we're going to discuss the next

179
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:54,630
lecture.

180
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,750
So thanks for watching.

181
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,700
So we'll see in the next lecture by Take care.
