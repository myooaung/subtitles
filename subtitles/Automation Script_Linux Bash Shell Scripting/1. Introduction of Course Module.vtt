Hello,

2
00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:02.450
everyone.

3
00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:11.100
Welcome to my new course model Landeck shall scripting a practical approach to learn on

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.090
explore the Charlotte scripting.

5
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.430
Learning is important,

6
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.490
but most important is how to explore your learnings.

7
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:27.400
This goes model is designed in such a way that you can lunch politically as well as explore

8
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.270
the entire course model with various industrial projects and left session.

9
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.510
My name is Shaker Wilma on I'm this tucked off this course morning I'm having 13 years off

10
00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:47.640
I t industy experience my skills are Lennox administration or omission with Charlotte

11
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:55.970
scripting Pull on and Sibon My passion is to create online job very inter and certified

12
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:56.760
courses.

13
00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.900
So after the completion off this course model students can easily start creating a small

14
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.150
smallest Crips and can automate their environment as well.

15
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.280
They can start doing a smart work and save their time.

16
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:18.230
So who would be the target is to then any system admin can grind this course.

17
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.640
Marty,

18
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.030
let's discuss the course content.

19
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.340
What?

20
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.130
We're going to a lot on a T from this course model.

21
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:30.930
I was started from a very basic that is introduction off shell programming or shall

22
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.370
scripting So first of all,

23
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:39.190
we should know that what is best shell at the type of shells off level and Lennox about

24
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:45.460
shallow scripting Boesch Ellis Tabs craves whole uses home data CSI like dot bash,

25
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.020
profile,

26
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.450
RC,

27
00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.750
and look out.

28
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.720
So these are the basic things we have discussed in my first section of this course model.

29
00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:00.370
And also we have shown how to clear a simple shall escape how to start a script like,

30
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.180
What is the first line that is she buying?

31
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.050
What the meaning off she bang And how to do that,

32
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:11.570
setting off him script on debug a script as well Suppose have killed and my script.

33
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.830
But my script is not working at all.

34
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.010
I'm getting some error.

35
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.370
So I just want to know that where is the issue in my script and how to run my skip in a day

36
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.370
.

37
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.410
But more so,

38
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:29.180
All these things we have discussed in this first section the next section is the shell

39
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.450
variables on environment that is a vest variable environmental variable system wearables.

40
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.240
All these topics are critically,

41
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.690
but we have discussed all those top topics tragically as well as practical.

42
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.950
Lab session Israel assign values to system variable cell variables customized the shell.

43
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.860
Special environments certainly envy and export commands rules.

44
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.250
Simple script using eco common.

45
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.640
Because still,

46
00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.590
this section we have this because only few common.

47
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.240
So I've found that how to kill this script using only the echo.

48
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.690
Come on.

49
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.660
And then we have discussed about the courting the types of coatings like double quoted,

50
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.660
single code back slash users Input.

51
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.830
Why keyboard read.

52
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:15.260
Come on.

53
00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
I affairs the various lab session.

54
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.590
So in this section we have discussed all those topics.

55
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.340
The next one is very important.

56
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.530
That is automatic operations performing Automatic operations Kid and Intissar.

57
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:29.470
Very Bill Constant.

58
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.240
Very bills,

59
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.990
part name expansion,

60
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.670
wild cards created,

61
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.320
use Elias is and with various lab station.

62
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:42.470
So whatever the topic you can see here we have discussed East topic with the practice lab

63
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.950
session.

64
00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.050
The next section is very important.

65
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:55.150
We have shown you how to create a simple escape which can automate the revalidation report

66
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.150
.

67
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.250
So,

68
00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.700
you know,

69
00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:58.730
till that section,

70
00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.020
what would we have learnt?

71
00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.290
We have explored with this section.

72
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.910
So in this section,

73
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.980
I have shown how to create a simple script which can be used to,

74
00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:07.380
you know,

75
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.040
first the required information from all the soldiers,

76
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.800
which is presented my environment.

77
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.340
So while discussing this section,

78
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.990
we have discussed about the bash color writing color text.

79
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:20.200
Various course we have,

80
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.560
that is for the foreground.

81
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.180
Background checks last session on best color.

82
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.060
The skirts,

83
00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.380
which can be used to fast the system information,

84
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.270
should do the script like Khan on final script,

85
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.800
that is,

86
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.200
you know,

87
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.330
to fetch the environmental report from a single click.

88
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.310
So that's a very important section.

89
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.840
So,

90
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:41.140
friend,

91
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.770
that's all.

92
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.380
There's the introduction about this course.

93
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.750
Morning.

94
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.790
I believe you're going to join this course.

95
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:46.060
Morning.
