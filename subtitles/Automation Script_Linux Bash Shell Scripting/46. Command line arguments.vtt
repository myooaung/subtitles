00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
how everyone in the selective would understand about shell Come online perimeters.

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.080
Most Atlantic's come on can take,

3
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.550
you know,

4
00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:14.740
different actions depending on the come online arguments supplied toe the common.

5
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.270
So to understand this,

6
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.480
I'm taking you into my Atlantic box.

7
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.100
So what is come online argument?

8
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.710
Come on,

9
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:30.200
line argument is nothing but an argument Cento program that is being caught.

10
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.450
Suppose I'm fighting Ellis.

11
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.300
So Alice is a come on the name of the common to be executed.

12
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.550
And if I'm using any arguments last time so it's less time is an argument here.

13
00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.670
So Alice is the name of the common,

14
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.580
and everything else on command line is taken as arguments toe this common right.

15
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.430
I'm just taking another example.

16
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.510
Tail hyphen 10 does want it easy possibility.

17
00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.770
So here it is,

18
00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.500
the common and apart from that,

19
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.550
everything is your arguments late.

20
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.850
So let's take a few more examples.

21
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.550
So here,

22
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:08.730
if I am simple fire,

23
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.330
Alice.

24
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.890
So Alice is the common.

25
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.750
There is a name off your common name here.

26
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.730
Argument name is nothing because I'm not supplied anything.

27
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.290
How simple Fire ls.

28
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:25.380
So total number of arguments past here that is zero if I am using this one.

29
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.950
Ellis and Tim.

30
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:34.460
So Alice is a common on the slash Time is the argument name on total number of arguments.

31
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.100
That is one this one.

32
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.760
Great.

33
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.470
Several times during this one.

34
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.720
E d.

35
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.120
C.

36
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.550
On this is my host.

37
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.650
Okay,

38
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.200
so here you can see that CP is the common name,

39
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.370
right on the arguments here we have.

40
00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.780
You know,

41
00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.320
this one,

42
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.190
This one on this one on a total number of arguments,

43
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.100
That is 21 and two.

44
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.650
Thank you.

45
00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:06.810
So,

46
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.410
you know,

47
00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.100
calculated,

48
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.280
like,

49
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.030
this way only,

50
00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.050
Right?

51
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.230
So I'm going to,

52
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.470
you know,

53
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.110
trade escape so that you can understand the position perimeters.

54
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.820
So here,

55
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:20.320
you know,

56
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.630
one more thing I won't tell you.

57
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.430
Suppose are fired this Come on,

58
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.070
this one.

59
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.290
Great.

60
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.170
So city is my,

61
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.750
you know.

62
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:29.830
Come on.

63
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:30.410
Name on.

64
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.050
This is the arguments on remember organs.

65
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.770
We have to.

66
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.270
So this one is doing What about this one?

67
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:47.730
You know this dollar zero on this dinner spot dollar one on this dinner's fire,

68
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.550
your dollars to so on.

69
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:54.650
All right.

70
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.650
On the total number of arguments,

71
00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.120
if you want to know that will in order by this one.

72
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.810
Like how many?

73
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.250
Once you have passed but that come on,

74
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.940
like if you have passed to.

75
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.620
So if you want to know why this could be have toe use this,

76
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.240
you know.

77
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.400
Come on for that.

78
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.600
So let me carry this.

79
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.220
Came for you so that you get in just trying it on that amusing.

80
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:26.490
Okay,

81
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.220
so the 1st 1 I told you this one,

82
00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:37.110
this one is 00 means that whatever the common,

83
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.790
if I have a script and if I am going to tell us about the script So that is the name of my

84
00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.140
script that we would rather buy this $1.0.

85
00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.270
So here I am,

86
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:48.920
putting its kept very simple,

87
00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.980
like echo this one time.

88
00:03:52.980 --> 00:04:02.970
Okay,

89
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:10.650
2nd 1 the name of my script,

90
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:16.810
This one.

91
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.570
Right?

92
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.290
So if I am going to execute this one So the first perimeter,

93
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:32.080
the first come online that is your dollars zero go the well,

94
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:40.810
you off first out woman that didn't inspire dollar one as well.

95
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.840
You can pass on something to the escaped as well.

96
00:04:43.840 --> 00:05:07.200
I will show you Echo the really off second dog woman that is a dollar to no really off Todd

97
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.760
out of woman.

98
00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:15.440
Right,

99
00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:24.640
Onder Total number of arguments don't tell number.

100
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.850
I want bust.

101
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:36.900
So that's good that we would you know about this one?

102
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.040
It waas dollar hash,

103
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.240
right dollar hash.

104
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.820
See here.

105
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:43.910
This is what I told you.

106
00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.200
This is Dr Issue.

107
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.750
Okay,

108
00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.050
so let me come on from here.

109
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.960
Make it executable.

110
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:59.360
Okay,

111
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:05.350
so let's be capped one more time so that we'll have a look on that.

112
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:06.750
What do you have to get?

113
00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.060
So this is camp,

114
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.500
you know?

115
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.210
So the name of my skip dollar,

116
00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.610
this one.

117
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.250
So if I'm going to do this one,

118
00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.020
right.

119
00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:21.160
So this is this is your dollar zero.

120
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.990
And if I want to pass any perimeter like good 12 or like hello?

121
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.140
So that is your a dollar one.

122
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:35.600
If I'm passing how that is this $1 to have boarding,

123
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.340
like I know,

124
00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:37.670
willing this one.

125
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:43.030
So that is a dollar T total number of arguments that were passed from 1 to 20.

126
00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.190
Let's see here again.

127
00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:46.640
See that this one,

128
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.550
right.

129
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:52.230
So this is my dollar zero.

130
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:54.330
This is you know.

131
00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:54.950
Hello.

132
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:56.210
How are you?

133
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:57.490
This one here?

134
00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:58.350
I have got another.

135
00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:59.700
Let's see why I've got another.

136
00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.840
Oh,

137
00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.180
because I have done some,

138
00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:05.550
you know,

139
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:09.750
type of us take you twice time out on this one.

140
00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:15.980
I won't do it under Duggan.

141
00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:19.360
So to remember,

142
00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.870
for rumors that have been passed 12 and three.

143
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:23.950
So it has come here.

144
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:27.920
And these are my arguments on each arguments has been aired.

145
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.410
Undeterred by some positions,

146
00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:31.400
like that is dollars $0.1.

147
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.480
So that is $1.0 to their side has come here.

148
00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.580
That is dollar one that a dollar to and dollar t.

149
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.270
So from there.

150
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:40.350
So for this lecture,

151
00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:41.390
in the next lecture,

152
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:42.650
I'm going to create a symbol,

153
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:47.400
a script in which I'm going to pass the perimeters on with those parameters.

154
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:47.760
You know,

155
00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:48.590
I'm going to do some,

156
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:48.950
you know,

157
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:51.500
mathematic calculations like addition off two numbers.

158
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:52.870
So thanks for watching.

159
00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:54.010
We'll see in the next lecture
