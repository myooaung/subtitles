00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.650
how everyone.

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.500
So let's continue on.

3
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.440
Do some more practice using exited status.

4
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:13.630
So I'm going to kid another script which is going to locate a user name on your system.

5
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.920
So skipped is very simple.

6
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:16.770
I'm going to create.

7
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:17.840
So basically,

8
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.400
you know,

9
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.080
when you execute the script,

10
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.250
which I'm going to create,

11
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.550
and the starting it will ask you to end a user name.

12
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.610
And once you will enter the user name,

13
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:33.790
that script is going to check that that particular user is existing on your system or not.

14
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.140
So to check this,

15
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.290
I'm going to use exited staters.

16
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.900
So the logic I'm going to use this one.

17
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.430
We know that whenever the user is created on a box,

18
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.490
it's entries,

19
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:48.050
you know,

20
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.690
enter into idiocy.

21
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:50.400
Password file.

22
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.540
So this is the file in which you will see all the users names existing on a system.

23
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.420
So here I am,

24
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.950
grab for the user like s Wilma.

25
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.660
So have simple cabinets and get up for the user.

26
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:05.710
I'm getting an output.

27
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.660
It means that that particular user is existing on the system.

28
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.140
The user is as what?

29
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.170
My hair Right.

30
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.760
I'm getting some output here,

31
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.170
so let's just check the exit of status.

32
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.010
Exited status is Jiro.

33
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.440
It means that my previous command waas run successful.

34
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.140
Suppose I am searching for a user which is not existing.

35
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.690
Like David.

36
00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.490
I'm not getting any outboard because David is not existing.

37
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.920
That's why your entry is not in the CDC password file.

38
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:34.940
Let's see.

39
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.830
What's the exit status at this time?

40
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.150
Now you can see the exit status is non zero.

41
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.540
Because my last command was not run successfully the same.

42
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.780
You know,

43
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.140
logic.

44
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.590
I'm going to use in mind Saleh school,

45
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.520
which I'm going to create.

46
00:01:49.520 --> 00:02:02.990
So let's get Okay,

47
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.610
So,

48
00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:04.070
first of all,

49
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.560
you know,

50
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.170
I'm going to set a variable here,

51
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.030
so to send the variable like I'm going to use this one,

52
00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:17.950
you're gonna give any name on the hitem specific?

53
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.240
The part off idiocy password.

54
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.520
Fine.

55
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.650
Okay,

56
00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:21.760
Andi,

57
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.870
Now get user name.

58
00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.430
So for that,

59
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.070
I'm gonna be used.

60
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.950
Read iPhone p on.

61
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.810
Enter my user name on,

62
00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:38.390
uh,

63
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.270
that I'm going to,

64
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.730
you know,

65
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.990
save it in a file that is,

66
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.630
user.

67
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.640
You could give any name.

68
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.990
So here user is available on which the supplied his name will be saved.

69
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.400
All right.

70
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.250
No,

71
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.800
the next days,

72
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.340
you know,

73
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.810
trying to certain Look it,

74
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.420
use it,

75
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.000
name it.

76
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.480
It is a passport file.

77
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.940
Right?

78
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.260
So how we can do that?

79
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.360
I'm using simple logic.

80
00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:15.540
It is a possibility that I can use this credible This dollar pass De.

81
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.050
Right.

82
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.300
So this is him and me.

83
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.760
Have you can see that on did This is grab hyphen.

84
00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.060
I w on did it?

85
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.420
My user name.

86
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:39.330
That is dollar years of they I do put I'm I don't want to get out,

87
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.050
but I just want to know that output should be like the user is existing on.

88
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.380
That's all right.

89
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.720
So if you if you're doing cat hair,

90
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.120
obviously will get some output.

91
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.540
I don't want to see that out,

92
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.670
but I just want to see in a simple word,

93
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.040
the user is existing.

94
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.880
I'm not that song,

95
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.740
so that if I have nullified right now,

96
00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.740
I'm going to check the exit status.

97
00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:59.900
Right.

98
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.830
So here,

99
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.000
I'm gonna be used test.

100
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.430
Come on.

101
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.860
You can put like a status if you called this.

102
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:23.260
You look like no If test my this status equals zero,

103
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.240
they see here.

104
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.710
If we five this come on.

105
00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.890
If it is successfully and I the user existing.

106
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.070
So this dollar question mark would be zero,

107
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.720
and it will be saving to this very well.

108
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.130
If it is not successfully US state us.

109
00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.120
This one is going to be some non zero number.

110
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.420
Same.

111
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.250
I'm checking here if task dollars status is equal to zero.

112
00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.110
All right,

113
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.750
then,

114
00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.300
echo.

115
00:04:49.300 --> 00:05:00.210
Like use it on.

116
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:09.350
I can put this one phone on the system.

117
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.960
All right.

118
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:42.350
Else I can put Go user this dollar one not phone on the system to this done.

119
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.010
Let me make it executable.

120
00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:51.610
This one exit to I'm going to exit with this one.

121
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.640
It is asking for the user.

122
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.250
I'm going.

123
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:54.440
Yes.

124
00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.170
Using s with my phone on the system.

125
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.550
I'm going to put this one.

126
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.900
Does it study?

127
00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:06.860
Use endeavoured nor phone in the system.

128
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.370
So what I have used have simply used the administrators here.

129
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.360
All right,

130
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.370
so here you can see that I have used test.

131
00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.540
If you don't want to use this one,

132
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.080
you can delete this one on the here.

133
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:27.670
You can put like this one if you can put this there is one more way.

134
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:28.990
Both the way is correct.

135
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:36.850
This one like this dollar question mark is equal to So this is also coming.

136
00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:40.420
So let me show with this as well.

137
00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:51.800
Like not phone Onda.

138
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.570
And I'm giving Sam not existing.

139
00:06:54.570 --> 00:07:02.150
I'm giving not existing use a good phone on the system.

140
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:07.060
So from their cell for this lecture hope you have understand the concept off exit the

141
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:07.670
status.

142
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.080
So thanks for watching.

143
00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.820
And if you have time,

144
00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:10.110
please,

145
00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:11.300
John video next lecture,

146
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:11.620
but
