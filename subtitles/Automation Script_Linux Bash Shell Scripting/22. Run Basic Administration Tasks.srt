1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
keep on moving,

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:08,230
so we are going to create another script that will run basic administration tasks.

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:13,820
So before we had the basic commands that we wanted to create a task in a script.

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:19,570
Tsunami Wine tour on basic tests Those are basic administration task and those basic

5
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:27,350
administrations task An example I picked as the 1st 1 is one top 2nd 1 is DF minus age.

6
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:28,880
3rd 1 is free,

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,120
which will check the memory us by the A d f.

8
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,100
Is for to check the disc space up.

9
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,330
Time is to tell it,

10
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:39,830
when was the last time system reboot and system load I o stat,

11
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,170
is input I o,

12
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:41,720
um,

13
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,940
statistics.

14
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:46,150
So I'm sure you know these commands already.

15
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:47,240
If you don't know that,

16
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:47,600
it's fine.

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,260
You could look it up and find out what the command do.

18
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:55,450
But anywhere these commands are here to check the system health.

19
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:00,170
So when I actually joined my first company,

20
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,820
this is something that we were doing manually.

21
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,350
So every time a system administrator would come in,

22
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:10,420
they will run these commands on the servers and checking the system health.

23
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,270
Are there any issues?

24
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,350
Are there any displace issue and so and so.

25
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:18,490
So when I learned somewhat of scripting the beginning,

26
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:18,840
I was like,

27
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,350
Wow,

28
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:25,670
we could do so much about this and raced in middle wasting so much time we come in,

29
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:30,160
we spend like hours just going through so many systems and running certain command.

30
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,150
So I created the first script called check scrip.

31
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,420
So,

32
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:34,960
uh,

33
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,030
and that would check the system health.

34
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:43,030
And it would actually I added so many things later on so many other commands that actually

35
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:46,260
we needed as for Aziz by the system,

36
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:46,810
But anyway,

37
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:49,490
the point is that you could,

38
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:49,620
um,

39
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:54,030
and automate all those system administration checking,

40
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,160
type of related tasks.

41
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:04,780
So let's create a new script and we are logged in as ourself.

42
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:09,260
And we are in our home directory and script Eritreans.

43
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,010
As you know,

44
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:13,040
we have thes two scripts have created,

45
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,120
and then we have a few empty files.

46
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,630
That's fine.

47
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,200
Believe them,

48
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,550
dear.

49
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,030
The next group we have,

50
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,450
you want to do admin tasks.

51
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,680
So this is a name I picked.

52
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,140
You could pick anything that bets,

53
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,150
fits the description off your task.

54
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,900
Go ahead and hit.

55
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,350
Enter.

56
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,550
What do you do first?

57
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:38,720
Define the variable Yes.

58
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,980
Then author who is writing the script that as you and my kids.

59
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:45,290
Me,

60
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:45,950
of course.

61
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,030
Um,

62
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,940
then we are doing Ah,

63
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:54,210
date 08 0.2.

64
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,500
2000 in 20.

65
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:57,950
Let's see.

66
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,590
Um,

67
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,650
then we are doing description.

68
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:16,880
The script will run basic admin commands or task whichever that,

69
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,480
um,

70
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,250
you want to pick?

71
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:24,550
Date modified since you're creating the first time.

72
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,650
Same date.

73
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,620
Okay,

74
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,460
Perfect.

75
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:39,820
Now I will always like to do at Go and Saiz this script will run basic administrative

76
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,150
commands.

77
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,670
That said,

78
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,150
this is how it's gonna come up.

79
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,020
Um,

80
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:47,450
of course.

81
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:50,050
I want to do echo hair and one echo here.

82
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,010
Okay.

83
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:51,290
Now,

84
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,650
what are we going to do?

85
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,990
We are going to run top command.

86
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:55,370
First,

87
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:57,850
I'll do echo again.

88
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,820
The F minus.

89
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,180
Etch Command Second echo again.

90
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:02,770
Again.

91
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:03,320
As you know,

92
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:09,850
Echo is just to put an empty line so it will look more organized of time.

93
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,550
Echo I O stat,

94
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:17,850
Echo and echo and off.

95
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,850
Perfect.

96
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:21,680
Okay,

97
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:21,950
good.

98
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,750
Now let's go ahead.

99
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:38,250
Save it and assigned permissions and the name off the file waas admin that.

100
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:45,350
Let's tr verify the permissions are given.

101
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,160
Okay,

102
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:53,030
so now let's run the script Okay,

103
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,140
so it did run.

104
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,720
And if you notice really quickly,

105
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,950
it spit out the line Where say's this is what the script does.

106
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:06,750
And now you noticed that the SEC the first command that I wanted to run in my scribbles top

107
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:06,750
.

108
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,330
And now it's not running other commands.

109
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,050
Why is that?

110
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:21,510
Because the top command is a command that will keep your session open and give you the

111
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,910
status off your processes,

112
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:28,520
your memory in a realtor time so it does not exit out.

113
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,750
It just stays there.

114
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:37,650
So that's why my script is kind of stuck for it to finish so it could run other commands.

115
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:42,050
So how do we overcome this problem?

116
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:42,850
Well,

117
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:50,340
one thing you could do is you could tell the output of the command to be ah,

118
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,380
simpler or,

119
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:51,890
ah,

120
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,610
pipe it to something else.

121
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:57,130
So this way it will run other commands.

122
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,560
So how how can we do it?

123
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,190
That's do quit and you see,

124
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,650
as soon as did quite out of,

125
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,850
um sorry.

126
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:09,550
As soon as I did quit out of top,

127
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:12,290
it did run all the remaining commands.

128
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:15,720
But of course we were stuck there and we didn't know what happened.

129
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,330
So what I'm gonna do is we will look back.

130
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:21,130
You will modify the script again.

131
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,050
And script Knee was admin tasks.

132
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:32,750
And this time we're gonna do is we are going to say that when top runs to skin me the first

133
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,560
10 lines.

134
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,070
That's fine,

135
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:42,560
because mostly the top part off the top command has the most important one,

136
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,570
which gives you the information about memory.

137
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,110
CPU process is important.

138
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:52,050
Most processes that are taking up most of the CPU.

139
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,750
So I'm gonna put pipe it to head of minus turn.

140
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,790
Um,

141
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,350
and then we will run back.

142
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,150
Gin scripted.

143
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:04,750
Okay,

144
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,050
so let's run it now.

145
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,250
Admin task.

146
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,510
All right.

147
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,980
See it getting gives.

148
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:17,620
You gonna wait for a few seconds and then I'll give you every because it was processing and

149
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,350
now give you from here?

150
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,400
See,

151
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,550
this script will run basic administrative tasks,

152
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:30,250
and those tasks are the 1st 1 is top and the top is giving me the 1st 10 lines.

153
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:34,670
Then it it runs DF minus.

154
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:35,420
H command,

155
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:40,350
which is giving me the output up to here then is running.

156
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,380
Ah,

157
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,770
free free is free.

158
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:48,750
Minus M is for the memory information to be include free.

159
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,070
Ah,

160
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,760
no,

161
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,070
actually,

162
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:51,840
you forgot.

163
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,220
That's why I was looking for free and it was not there Anyway.

164
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:55,950
We'll add that,

165
00:07:55,950 --> 00:08:01,310
um the next command that it was running was up time and up.

166
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,550
Time is right here.

167
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:10,880
And the system been up 47 minutes and the last commanded ran was hyo stat,

168
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,850
which is right.

169
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:15,300
And the last thing we added was end a script.

170
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,550
So of course we missed a V.

171
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,970
I Mr Free Command.

172
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:19,560
That's fine.

173
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,150
We'll go ahead and add.

174
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:26,020
And and it was after DF minus h.

175
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:36,750
So Echo three minus m here and now the missing command that we wanted to run,

176
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,410
they go.

177
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:40,130
So see,

178
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,380
it did give us.

179
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:41,890
Yes,

180
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,350
it is right here.

181
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:47,480
The city output off free minus m.

182
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,060
Okay,

183
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:52,850
so this is how you run the basic administration tasks.

184
00:08:52,850 --> 00:09:01,810
You could actually also filter out this output to through a pipe and you give you anything

185
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:05,750
Pacific that you wanted to know about this output.

186
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,220
So what happened was ah,

187
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,260
in my,

188
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,070
uh,

189
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:15,160
beginning years of an I join my first company on Iran.

190
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:15,840
This oven.

191
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,350
I created this check system.

192
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,600
Um What?

193
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,200
I did it Eventually it was throwing up so much information that we really didn't need it.

194
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,100
Toe be modified.

195
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,340
Fills dirt out a lot of output that was coming from thes commands.

196
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,550
So you could do that too,

197
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,450
depending on what exactly you're looking for.

198
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,880
Um,

199
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,820
my recommendation is to you is go ahead and create couple of scripts that will run your

200
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:45,350
basic administration task and see how they run.
