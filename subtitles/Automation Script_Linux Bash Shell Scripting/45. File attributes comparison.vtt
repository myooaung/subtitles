00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.270
how everyone in this lecture will understand about the file active use comparison in the

2
00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:12.740
previous Leichter regarded idea about nomadic and stink comparison.

3
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.050
So let's stop.

4
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:15.980
So basically file it too.

5
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:16.220
Good.

6
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:17.590
Comparison is nothing.

7
00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.490
It is basically checking for the existence off any file or directory.

8
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:28.390
Whatever suppose I want to check the particular file is existing on Norm that I can use

9
00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.580
this attributes support.

10
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.650
I want to do the backup on my system to start the backup.

11
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:40.110
I warned that particular director should be existing because I want to take the backup on

12
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.440
this particular directory.

13
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.370
So with the help of this attributes,

14
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.680
I can check that the particular directory at the location is existing on the system or not

15
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.680
.

16
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.240
If it is not existing that directly should be created on.

17
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.030
After that,

18
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.380
the back of should be started.

19
00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:02.610
So those type of things you can do with file at tables comparison so these other you know,

20
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:03.060
activities.

21
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.340
We have something we want to check for any Brock file.

22
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.130
Then you have to use hyphen B.

23
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.000
C's for the character file days for the directory.

24
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.250
He's for file like this way,

25
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.750
you know,

26
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:14.200
different,

27
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.490
different.

28
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.800
You know activities we have you can use according to your requirement Here also,

29
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.030
we have you know differently.

30
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.540
No options or activity.

31
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.450
How like here we have a few examples Discuss for final tribute.

32
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.450
The 1st 1 is very simple.

33
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.760
It is looking for this file.

34
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:32.900
What is existing them?

35
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.620
It will print like file phone.

36
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.100
Otherwise it will say that not far It is looking for this.

37
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.030
This is a block device on If it is there,

38
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.540
it will echo their block.

39
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.640
A special file phone.

40
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.860
Otherwise it will bring you our message.

41
00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.090
You that block a special file not found?

42
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.860
The last one is basically you know,

43
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.570
it is just checking for the directory.

44
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.580
And here we have.

45
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.410
This is available in which I have defined the location off the director which I'm looking

46
00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.850
for.

47
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.970
This is the meaning of this line.

48
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.950
Is that if it is not there If it is not there so meaning off this one.

49
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.220
This symbol abuse It means that if it is not there so if it is not,

50
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.390
their condition is satisfied than it is going toe.

51
00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.080
Create the directory right?

52
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.400
Otherwise,

53
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.270
if it is there,

54
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.790
my condition is not satisfied.

55
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.940
it will move here like it will message that directly is already there.

56
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.500
So from there,

57
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.500
so for this election,

58
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.360
we'll see in the next election.
