1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
do wild scripts do?

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:04,590
One.

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:09,240
Scripts are very similar to four loops for scripts.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,990
The Do Well script or statement.

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,970
Continued lead executes a block of statements,

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,200
while a particular condition is true or met.

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,520
For example,

8
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,650
if you are running a script and you created in a loop,

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,750
it will run until a certain variable is met.

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,080
For example,

11
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,680
if you have,

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:43,280
if you want to run the script until August 2015 to 2 p.m. Then you will define that and do

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,350
well script and a lot of times the scripts or the demons,

14
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,320
the process that never dies,

15
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,070
that keep running and running and running.

16
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:59,160
They always have do wild scripts because they are running content continuously until a

17
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,650
certain condition is met.

18
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,860
So,

19
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:05,590
for example,

20
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:09,210
Rana script until 2 p.m. As soon as the two PM hits,

21
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,150
you're done.

22
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:17,480
Exit out while condition do command one command to command three.

23
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,780
And once all these commands are done and the condition is done,

24
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,070
then you are done.

25
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,410
You are done with your script.

26
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:32,480
So let's look at our Lennox machine and let's try out ah,

27
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,380
do a script.

28
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:39,330
It's clear the screen where you are.

29
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,040
We are in my script Victory,

30
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,690
which is this directory we want to be in.

31
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:50,250
And this time you're gonna create in this new script and we're gonna call it script,

32
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,360
do a while again.

33
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,880
Um,

34
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,000
it's just the name I'm picking.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,570
You could pick anything you want Hit Enter.

36
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,640
You are in V I mode,

37
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:09,890
you hit insert and you start typing with the first thing that your type type hash bang been

38
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:11,110
bash,

39
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,880
which defines your shell environment.

40
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,130
And if you wanted to put a comment,

41
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:23,050
you could say this script is created.

42
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:30,490
But in Ron have so on 2018.

43
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:31,030
Yeah,

44
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,950
that's fine.

45
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,350
And if you want to put a description of the script,

46
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,190
you could do that.

47
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,880
But let's get into the script.

48
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,350
I have already written in the script.

49
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,700
I'm just gonna go in and copy it.

50
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,630
There are two scripts in my hand out.

51
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:47,720
I'm gonna take the 2nd 1 I want you to do the 1st 1 yourself.

52
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,670
Copy it,

53
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,750
and I'm gonna paste in real quick.

54
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:55,690
Let's see what this guy does the script is doing.

55
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:56,140
Of course,

56
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,260
the 1st 1 is defining the show,

57
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,650
which we already have some we're gonna take it out,

58
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:02,950
but hitting D D.

59
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:07,450
And then it's telling us that the count is zero.

60
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:12,900
The number as 10 wild account is less than 10.

61
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,470
Do echo number of seconds left to stop this process,

62
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,640
and the process is the variable,

63
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,350
which is dollar one,

64
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:31,650
and echo is just empty space.

65
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,710
Empty line.

66
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:42,220
Sleep Sleep is a command that will wait for the number of seconds that is defined after the

67
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,100
sleep command.

68
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,250
Then it has a few number of expressions.

69
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,580
These are expressions.

70
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,650
You could get it anywhere online.

71
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:55,470
I have that expression for a while that I tried out many times in my work environment.

72
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,640
It works perfectly.

73
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,550
Any phone is using in your work environment,

74
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,450
you're more than welcome to do so.

75
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,060
The next one is sitting echo,

76
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,720
and then it says echo dollar.

77
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,800
One process is stopped and echo again.

78
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,250
It is telling it that it's giving an empty line.

79
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:20,960
Let's run the script and that see what it does give execute herbal permissions.

80
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:26,280
It's his 10 seconds left to stop this process.

81
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:35,350
987654321 and done process is stopped.

82
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,950
You see that?

83
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:49,470
So these do Wah scripts are created for a certain value or certain time to be met,

84
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,450
and once that variable is met,

85
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:56,050
it will stop the process and exit out of it.

86
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:00,890
I want you to create a new script in your environment,

87
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,020
and this is a script again.

88
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,270
This is also in the handouts.

89
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,290
You could copy and paste the script,

90
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,200
create a new script and run it.

91
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:16,810
You could also be my guest to go online and just type Do wild script examples.

92
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:23,770
There are tons and tons of do while scripts that you could try and get get a low,

93
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:24,540
um,

94
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:28,370
exposure to do Y scripts.

95
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,760
I'm sure by the time you will run at least five or six scripts,

96
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,650
you know exactly what this statement do.
