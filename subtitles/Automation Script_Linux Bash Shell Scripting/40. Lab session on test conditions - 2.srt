1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,050
how everyone.

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:05,730
So let's continue and do some more practice using test.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:06,180
Come on.

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,550
So in the selected,

5
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:11,350
I'm going to get a simple script in which I'm going to use test,

6
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,370
but with multiple,

7
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:13,630
you know,

8
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:14,390
conditions,

9
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,050
multiple statements would be there.

10
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,250
So first of all,

11
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,420
let me tell you what.

12
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:18,870
That's good.

13
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,230
I'm going to get for you.

14
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,520
So Skip is very simple.

15
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,230
I'm going to,

16
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:24,640
you know,

17
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,850
ask the each of the A person who is going to execute the script.

18
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,760
Suppose I'm actually good in the script.

19
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,850
So at the beginning,

20
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:34,910
off the script,

21
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,060
it will ask you What is your it right?

22
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,540
And after that few conditions are there my first condition?

23
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,580
First condition.

24
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,680
Is that supposed The age is less than 20.

25
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:53,170
So the person who is not eligible for you know this job on what they were like Some job is

26
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,360
there and I want to check the you know,

27
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,700
you know the age criteria for that.

28
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:04,080
So I mentioned that if you have applied for the job and your age is less than 20 so if

29
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,840
you're it is,

30
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,220
you know,

31
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,000
less than 20 oh,

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,960
greater than 50.

33
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:17,540
You are not eligible you're out of the ridge out of the age.

34
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:24,790
So here I've used off means either of the conditions.

35
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:28,470
Either you may be less than 20 or you may be more than 50.

36
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,790
If any of the condition is satisfied,

37
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:31,990
you are not eligible.

38
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,160
So here I'm using.

39
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,630
Or what means you have to use the symbol pipe sign.

40
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,350
So pipe sign double means more.

41
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,650
So this is my you know,

42
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:42,150
first condition,

43
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:47,140
second condition also I'm going to put like you are.

44
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:53,300
You're is great of them 20 and less than 30.

45
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,510
So both the conditions have been satisfied.

46
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,280
Support?

47
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:56,950
I'm typing.

48
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,650
My age is 25 so 25 is greater than 20.

49
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:01,300
Yes,

50
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,910
25 was less than 30 years.

51
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:08,350
So both the conditions are satisfying If both the conditions are satisfying that I'm saying

52
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:12,190
that ico like whatever you are in the age of twenties,

53
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:19,350
right here at the top This one here I've used this army's other of any of the condition

54
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,930
right?

55
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:24,940
Either you are less than 20 or maybe get other than 50.

56
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,600
Either of any condition is satisfied.

57
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,550
Then you are not eligible for them.

58
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:33,060
But here both the conditions would be satisfied if you're looking for both the conditions

59
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:33,780
that you have to use,

60
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,290
December right.

61
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:46,730
Third condition is my this one gooder than 30 on did less than 40.

62
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,050
Then I can type like you're in the thirties.

63
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:55,800
I four condition I can put like your age should be in a greater than 40 on.

64
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,910
It should be less than 50 that I could take like you are in the aid off,

65
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,350
you know,

66
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,770
forties.

67
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,750
So I'm going to play this script here.

68
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:16,270
Okay,

69
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,570
so first of all,

70
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:18,650
I'm going to ask for the user,

71
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:24,950
Please and tell you get a gauge.

72
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,950
I get on read with age.

73
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,220
Now my first condition.

74
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:45,550
If on this dollar it I get on the if it is less than 20 Okay,

75
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:56,250
So this is my one condition on or I'm using all here or but it is,

76
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,550
you know,

77
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,880
get it over then.

78
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,240
Today,

79
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,640
on day and age is greater than 50.

80
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,520
So either of the condition is satisfied.

81
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,440
Then go.

82
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,300
Sorry.

83
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,360
Yeah,

84
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,760
Out of the age you are not eligible.

85
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:36,280
Whatever you want to die even type here now my second condition I'm only used fear this

86
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:42,450
dollar age is good of them 20.

87
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:54,730
And also it should be less than should be.

88
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:55,150
You know,

89
00:04:55,150 --> 00:05:05,450
Unless that 30 so good to them don't means 2122 23 24 25 26 27 28 29.

90
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:11,750
So if you are in the aid off from 21 to 29 that this condition is satisfying here.

91
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,630
Okay,

92
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,240
then I cook.

93
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:23,040
I can type like you are in the ego twenties.

94
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,630
They so like this with my next condition.

95
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,350
Is this one.

96
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,990
This is quite a break.

97
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:38,220
It this is my dollar is is better than 30.

98
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:49,060
On this it is less than 40.

99
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,830
So means you would be the your urine.

100
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,350
The Edo twenties thirties.

101
00:05:55,350 --> 00:06:07,660
I'm putting one more condition here,

102
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:16,550
so this condition is get to them.

103
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,530
40

104
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,150
Suppose you have type 44 right?

105
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,270
So 44 satisfying in this year.

106
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:26,030
Because 44 is greater than 40 on.

107
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,040
But it is also,

108
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,550
you know,

109
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:37,140
unless them 50 then echo.

110
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:44,780
You are in Edo forties,

111
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,570
right?

112
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:48,600
I can close it now.

113
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,870
You can put one more condition.

114
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,750
You can put else as well at the last.

115
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:56,690
Let's make it executable.

116
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:00,650
I believe everything is fine with this group.

117
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:10,920
And it I'm putting this one 19.

118
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,890
Sorry.

119
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:12,900
You are out of range.

120
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,290
I'm going to put 56.

121
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:19,690
So you are out of range and the first line?

122
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,510
The condition is satisfied.

123
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:25,770
I'm going to put this 24 missing.

124
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:26,450
Something is missing.

125
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:26,690
Next.

126
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:27,950
See what is missing here?

127
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,170
Test.

128
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:29,760
That is good.

129
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,660
If you are having some,

130
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,080
you know,

131
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,420
mistakes so that you can you know,

132
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,660
Lund more here.

133
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,750
So let's see.

134
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,460
What's the mistake?

135
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,120
Me half that if this one is satisfied,

136
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,750
they live.

137
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,550
This is great with them.

138
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:46,050
Okay,

139
00:07:46,050 --> 00:08:04,390
that is I think it's t e they This is There's this last game,

140
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:04,750
don't you?

141
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:23,310
Everything seems friends.

142
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:23,720
Tell me,

143
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,950
what's the issue here?

144
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,570
Okay,

145
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:27,220
let's do one thing.

146
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,240
Let's run this in a day,

147
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,450
but more so that we'll understand where we have this.

148
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:32,120
So how do done it?

149
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,390
I'm just putting Exhale.

150
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,980
Okay.

151
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,060
Desk this one.

Please enter your eight.

153
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,140
I'm putting this 1 25 No missing.

154
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:50,040
They're saying there's some issue with the line Number seven get hyphen.

155
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,510
And this is a test one.

156
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:52,990
This one.

157
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,440
So my line number seven in this one.

158
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,640
So they're saying that something is missing in this line.

159
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,060
So what is missing?

160
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,410
I think the spaces here.

161
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:02,860
OK,

162
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,380
I got really have issue.

163
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:09,350
So the issue is that we have not given the proper space here.

164
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:14,420
Okay.

165
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,300
