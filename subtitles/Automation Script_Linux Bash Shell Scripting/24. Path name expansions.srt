1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,750
how everyone?

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:05,050
It was like devil C about the party name expansion.

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:10,290
We'll have a little bit critical on done Will move towards the lab session.

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,750
But this topic can only we understand using the lab session.

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,570
So best shell supports pardoning expansion as shown below.

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,280
So if you want to expand toe clear any patterns,

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,370
you have to use the country.

8
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,850
Bess is so like this We like and wanting to win and in numbers.

9
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,810
If you have any file and if you will find that something,

10
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:31,240
you know,

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:31,750
There,

12
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,320
you know the extension is common,

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,190
like file one dot txt file.

14
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:36,820
Do not dear.

15
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,310
She so you can use,

16
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:38,880
you know,

17
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,100
curly braces and expand the file as well.

18
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:47,400
So we'll let me move toward smile obsession on Let's do some practice on that echo.

19
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,740
I'm here.

20
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,740
I'm just typing.

21
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:55,970
I love my mother.

22
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,140
I'm a father.

23
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,530
Let's see now.

24
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,710
I love my mother Father Right here.

25
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,700
If I am not using any space,

26
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,110
let's see what it is going to do.

27
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,800
I love my mother.

28
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,560
My father.

29
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,740
Right.

30
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,510
Suppose you know I want to,

31
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:19,970
you know,

32
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:27,070
type like this 11 to t.

33
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:31,350
So it will explain file one file to file three.

34
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,890
So here I have used the curly braces.

35
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:42,050
I can use this one this file one dot txt file to dot txt file to safety.

36
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,390
If I have a number off numbers,

37
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:47,450
like have type 10 numbers,

38
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:47,640
right?

39
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,550
For 1 to 10 you can use one daughter town.

40
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,830
So it will type all the numbers,

41
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:53,010
like,

42
00:01:53,010 --> 00:02:00,050
51 dot 55 to 60 until the number reaches toe 10.

43
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,530
Right?

44
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,270
Okay.

45
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:09,090
This is one thing I don't think you suppose if you want Oh,

46
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:16,220
view fights like your am not conference a file you have it is.

47
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,430
See if you have another fire,

48
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,000
like update Davey on the file.

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,850
I have this one says Sadiyah.

50
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,850
Okay,

51
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,850
so here you can see that simple.

52
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:29,750
I'm trying to,

53
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,200
you know,

54
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,630
list out the three fines in three files.

55
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,970
You can see something is common.

56
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:38,800
That is dot com on starting location is also same.

57
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,370
That is it's less dizzy again,

58
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:41,850
you know,

59
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:42,990
use the same.

60
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:43,280
Come on.

61
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,050
I can use it in that curly braces as well.

62
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:46,980
How we can do that.

63
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,340
So it is common.

64
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,250
The location off all these three files,

65
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:55,290
the same that is a dizzy so I can use it easy on this one.

66
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:58,330
I'm going to use I am not con.

67
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:01,770
My second file is off dead.

68
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:12,410
Devi dot com on that file assist CDL dot com No such find some type of mistake is here,

69
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:12,840
Lindsay.

70
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:19,850
No,

71
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,060
you have to put slash here.

72
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,790
I can see that I've got output he had again.

73
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:24,930
See,

74
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:28,670
that dot com is also common to all the finds.

75
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:33,460
So what I can do here at the last I can put dot com and I can remove these as well.

76
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:42,080
I'm going the same outboard.

77
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,720
So basically,

78
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:43,930
you know,

79
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:49,470
I'm trying to explain you the part name expansion so you can use such commands as well.

80
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,250
Do you know expand the files as well?

81
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:58,630
So from their cell for this lecture in the next electoral Understandable the white cards.

82
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,330
So thanks for watching.

83
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,360
We'll see the next lecture
