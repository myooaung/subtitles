1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,620
how everyone in the selective will understand about my affairs.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,080
So basically,

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,770
my offense is important to understand because many times you will see that I first have

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,250
been used in a shower scream.

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,850
So I first is nothing.

6
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,320
It's a very can,

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:16,870
you know,

8
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,240
for the divide your valuables in tow.

9
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,650
Some variables.

10
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:21,890
Suppose you know,

11
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,770
have a variable on that.

12
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:24,180
Very well,

13
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:24,910
we have different.

14
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:25,950
Different names are there,

15
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:26,840
and I want to,

16
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,120
you know,

17
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,990
divide those variables those value of variables into some variables.

18
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,780
So with the help of life as we can do that So let me try to explain.

19
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,360
I first with an example here.

20
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,840
Suppose I have a variable name off city in that very well I have defined,

21
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,910
like Delhi a London,

22
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,500
Singapore.

23
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,620
Okay,

24
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:54,750
so I have simple variable that is name off Syria.

25
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,360
The names are there late.

26
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,420
No,

27
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:03,710
What I want I want that with the help of read.

28
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:04,250
Come on.

29
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:11,070
I want to simply split my this variable that his name off city Do you know further

30
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:11,910
variables?

31
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,510
So how we can do the read hyphen?

32
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,730
R I can give my no city name.

33
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:25,650
One city to on city three on here to specify.

34
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:26,590
With the wyffels,

35
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:36,280
we have to use three symbols that is less sign two times and then this dollar name off city

36
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,120
No,

37
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,330
If I'm doing Eco City one,

38
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:45,710
you can see that I'm getting deli Andi.

39
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:48,750
And if I am putting city too,

40
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,620
it is giving London and this acidity.

41
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:58,120
So the read Come on here leaves input from the dollar name off city variable.

42
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:06,320
So here you can see that the foreign value off this dollar I have This is used to assign

43
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,520
values to three separate variables.

44
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,550
That is city one city to city three.

45
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:13,020
Your input is broken into,

46
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,460
you know,

47
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:20,050
tokens with the help off infest dollar on assigned those values to you three variables that

48
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:20,340
this city,

49
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:26,020
one city facility or in simple words begin to say that I have has very well walk to Is

50
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,440
there separator?

51
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,170
We can see that.

52
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:33,640
So here you can see them have available this deli in London and Singapore.

53
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,330
They are separated by this place.

54
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,270
Single spears,

55
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,980
Right?

56
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,210
So in that case,

57
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:40,470
you know,

58
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,380
if you have a biggest clear if you have any,

59
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,800
you know Vic Berryville in that we have three entries are there,

60
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,910
so you can further divide your enters into the sub variables late.

61
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,010
So from their cell for this lecture.

62
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,680
But my ticket,

63
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,350
we'll soon the next lecture.
