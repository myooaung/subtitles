1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,430
how everyone in this lecture will understand about the exit status off.

2
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:06,950
Come on.

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:10,750
That's really a very important topic to understand.

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:19,850
Every Lennox or UNIX come on executed by the shallow script or by a user has an exit.

5
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,660
The status in simple words.

6
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:28,210
Suppose I have logged in tow Atlantic system and I have fired at come on,

7
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:29,240
like up time.

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,750
Or did come on fire.

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,210
So in Brazil,

10
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:33,350
I will get some output.

11
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,370
Because did is a you know,

12
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,000
come on,

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,890
which is existing on your system up time is a,

14
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:40,330
you know,

15
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:41,080
useful.

16
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:41,650
Come on,

17
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,340
which is a valid come on.

18
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:50,760
So if you fire any come on individual get a proper output without any error,

19
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:58,920
It means that that is the exact status which is due If you're comin Waas successful without

20
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,620
any error,

21
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,950
you will have the devastated zero.

22
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:07,670
But suppose if you have fired come on which is not existing at all On a system like you

23
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:08,940
have simply fired a B c.

24
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:09,250
D.

25
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,540
It was really is not existing on Atlantic system.

26
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,550
It is not a come on.

27
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:16,660
So in that case you will get some better.

28
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,110
Like this Command is not existed this come on.

29
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:19,750
Not farm.

30
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,990
So if you have,

31
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:23,420
you know,

32
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,170
got some other welfare in the common.

33
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,420
It means you will have the exhibit staters a number A non zero.

34
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,060
You're exit.

35
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:37,950
The status would be a non zero for that case when the common was not unsuccessfully on that

36
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:44,760
is from number 1 to 255 When means that the common was a failure,

37
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,800
Right?

38
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,710
So that is a simple idea about that.

39
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,790
The status and we'll have a love station as well.

40
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,480
So you need to use a particular shall variable called that.

41
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,080
Is this one here?

42
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,750
You can see that.

43
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,530
That is,

44
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:56,930
you know,

45
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:57,710
dollar question.

46
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:58,590
Mark toe,

47
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,290
get exited.

48
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,550
Staters off the previously executed Come on.

49
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,610
Right.

50
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,580
So dubrin,

51
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,990
we have to fire this dollar.

52
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,090
Kashima used the echo comma or print off.

53
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:09,490
Come on.

54
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:15,710
So here we have some example This is the common Echo Dollar question.

55
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,550
Not some would have fired did come on under.

56
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:18,990
Come on.

57
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,140
And after that I can fire this print,

58
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,550
exit the status so I will get some output.

59
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,550
So first we have to fire this.

60
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:27,920
Come on,

61
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,330
debt.

62
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:33,220
So my command has done successfully on I want to check the status exited status.

63
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,280
Then you have to five this.

64
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:34,630
Come on.

65
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,550
If my previous come on like dead Come on,

66
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,680
has done successfully.

67
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,160
Then I will have the existing zero.

68
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,210
Suppose here.

69
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,630
I have fire this command which is not a valid command.

70
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:48,010
And after that they filed five this eco dollar question mark I will get some known dealer

71
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:48,450
number.

72
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:52,600
So let me move towards my this box Mannix box on.

73
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,660
We'll show you something here.

74
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,480
Suppose I am finding dead.

75
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:55,880
Come on,

76
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,610
I'm getting some output So let's see what it's like The status.

77
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:04,580
So to know the exhibit Staters off a previous command which have fired after simple fire

78
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:09,690
This Come on So this tells you number It means that the previous command that you have

79
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:14,250
fired that is dead common Waas run successfully without any error.

80
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,900
Somewhat I'm fighting this.

81
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,230
Come on.

82
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,310
So this is not existing at all.

83
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,290
I'm getting some better.

84
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:20,930
Like did want to take him on,

85
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:26,080
not found so I just want to know the exit district is off My previous Come on,

86
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,780
I need to find this here.

87
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,400
You can see that I am getting unknown deal number and illustrators.

88
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,710
That means the command was a failure.

89
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:36,750
The previous commanded to have fire or some failure.

90
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,320
All right,

91
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,250
so this way you can check any you know,

92
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:46,910
any command that you have fire was successful or not on that is really very useful.

93
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:47,150
You know,

94
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,460
when you clearly you know,

95
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:52,440
shallow scrape so many times you will see that in a shallow script.

96
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,660
We're checking by the Destatis core.

97
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:59,650
They simply can find this It is he resolved.

98
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:05,280
I just want to check this file is not Is existing are not so I'm getting zero.

99
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,760
Suppose I'm searching for any file this one like a BCG.

100
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,800
I just want to check So it is not existing there.

101
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,580
So if I am fighting this one,

102
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,040
I'm getting some non number.

103
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,080
So if I'm checking in a you know,

104
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,550
shallow script that my shallow,

105
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:23,190
scripted checking is a file is checking for the file.

106
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,840
I do.

107
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,140
If I'm getting I'm using simple this.

108
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:27,460
Come on.

109
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,100
Like Ellis on.

110
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,730
If the file is not existed there,

111
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,310
obviously I'm getting some error.

112
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:36,340
And it means that devastated would be some known dealer number.

113
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,900
So with this non zero number,

114
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,450
I can you know,

115
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:42,930
judge that the file is not existing at all.

116
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:43,410
Right?

117
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,140
So,

118
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:45,360
friend,

119
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,460
that's all for this lecture.

120
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,480
In the next election,

121
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,480
I'm going to use,

122
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:48,820
you know,

123
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,320
I'm going to kill the shallow script in the Sala script.

124
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,790
I'm going to use exact status.

125
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:55,630
So thanks for watching and will soon The next lecture,

126
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,150
but by
