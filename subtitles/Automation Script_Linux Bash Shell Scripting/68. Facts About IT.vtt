00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.580
Okay,

2
00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:04.340
let's talk about facts about information technology.

3
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.910
Now,

4
00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.400
I'm gonna go over the statistics that really numbers that I gathered together,

5
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.890
which will tell you whether you have made the right decision or not,

6
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.580
whether this I t feel is right for you or not.

7
00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.480
So let's look at a few of them now.

8
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.050
I t role in our life is very important.

9
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.840
Out days you have information technology or technology gadgets everywhere you have that in

10
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.210
TV and cars you do shopping online.

11
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.800
You have phoned full of technology.

12
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.790
Then I t jobs are expected to grow by 22% till 2020.

13
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:42.580
Now,

14
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.070
remember,

15
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.350
guys,

16
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.150
we are into 2018 and in two years it's gonna increase by 22%.

17
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.030
68% off.

18
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.520
Companies are struggling to find qualified I t candidates.

19
00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.950
What?

20
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:08.170
It means that 100% of the companies that we have here out of those 68% are still having

21
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.880
trouble finding the right person.

22
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.290
Are many.

23
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.150
I T professionals are making mawr than medical professional nowadays.

24
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.230
Now this is not just a fact,

25
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:29.220
but it's it's actually I have seen with my own eyes that there are I T people who are

26
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.650
making way more than physicians and doctor and people who are in medical field.

27
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.100
Now,

28
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:46.750
64% off the companies are investing in I t initiated companies that are not in I t.

29
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.590
That are manufacturing clothes,

30
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.530
building cars,

31
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:51.590
building pianos,

32
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.320
making carpets any kind of companies they need,

33
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.900
i t.

34
00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.890
And out of those 64% of them are investing in i t.

35
00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.870
You don't need ah,

36
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.530
high level of education to start in I t.

37
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.830
No,

38
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.140
I'm definitely not encouraging.

39
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.900
Those who don't want to go and pursue their bachelor's and master's have definitely

40
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.750
discouraged them.

41
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:23.660
I am just telling people who cannot afford to go to college or who cannot afford to go toe

42
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.890
for masters degree.

43
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:31.360
You could still get into I t buy it going through some certification,

44
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.500
some courses,

45
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.350
and you gotta gain some experience and you could enter the I T field.

46
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.020
And,

47
00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.480
of course,

48
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.800
if you have a bashes,

49
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.210
agree,

50
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.870
and if you have a master's degree,

51
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:51.340
sky is the limit and you will succeed in I t field so fast I teach job salary ranges from

52
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.760
40,000 to 400,000 again.

53
00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.610
It depends on your experience,

54
00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:57.430
your skills and,

55
00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.940
of course,

56
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.740
your qualification as poor.

57
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:10.390
Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2016 the median income off a bachelor's degree holder having

58
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.170
an entry level job in i t.

59
00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.550
Is making above $100,000.

60
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.160
Ah,

61
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.520
US tech industry worker now anyone Any U.

62
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.820
S tech industry worker.

63
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:32.610
Annual wage is above $100,000 as compare to $50,000 off any other worker in any other

64
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:33.160
sector.

65
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:46.190
And the last one is and us in 2015 the jobs that were outsourced,

66
00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.680
the I T jobs that were outsourced were over two million.

67
00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.840
The guys that that's definitely definitely something wrong here.

68
00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.020
It means we don't have the right people.

69
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.250
So we are spending our time in different fields.

70
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.360
Not that there's anything wrong with other fields,

71
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.260
but if you have a field that is growing so fast,

72
00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.710
so rapidly and companies don't have,

73
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:24.040
don't don't don't can't find people to fulfill those jobs than than what ask yourself,

74
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.230
Are you getting Are you making the right decision?

75
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.310
But getting into the right field,

76
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.680
I have to say yes.
