1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,610
que statements groups.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,600
Now this lesson.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:15,330
We will go over the statements off case where you are given options in a script to pick

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:15,780
from.

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:23,760
So it's like an interactive way off involving user whether they want to select Option ABC

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,680
so forth.

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,820
So in case statement,

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,150
if a option is selected,

9
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,680
do this be selected?

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,310
Do that CIA selected do this?

11
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,530
So these are the different options on what,

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,860
exactly a or B or C is gonna do?

13
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:41,230
Well,

14
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:45,640
it depends on what the variable you assigned to them.

15
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,620
For example,

16
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,250
if you assign a to do,

17
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,150
um,

18
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,850
to up date on the screen,

19
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,200
it will output the date.

20
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,810
What if a is selected?

21
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:57,360
Now,

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,850
let's let's look at the script.

23
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:11,990
I have a script right here.

24
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:15,050
Always starts with the show.

25
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,630
Shell is bash.

26
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:20,640
The next is Echo,

27
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,280
which is just printing out an empty line.

28
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,740
Then it's gonna echo.

29
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,250
Please choose one of the options below.

30
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:37,820
It will print out a as in for variable equals display Date in time B list file and

31
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:44,210
directories see list uses logged in and D checks system up time.

32
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:44,650
Now,

33
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:49,010
this is all just a display message that's gonna show up.

34
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,550
Once the script is run,

35
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,000
then it will read.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,780
All the choices are put all the choice in a container.

37
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,490
Then the case statement comes in.

38
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,320
It's gonna say choices,

39
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:04,370
which is this variable choices in And the container?

40
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:04,840
We put it.

41
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,550
All these choices and what the's choice is going to do.

42
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,000
A.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,890
It's going to run the command Date B is gonna run the command.

44
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:18,580
L s C is going to run the command list of users War logged in and D is going to run the

45
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,740
command up time.

46
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,590
Remember,

47
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:26,170
all of these are actual commands inside off your Linux operating system.

48
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,330
When you run it individually,

49
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,420
it will give you the date.

50
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:34,680
But this script will allow you to automate the task toe.

51
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,300
Pick these commands for you.

52
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,950
So let's copy them.

53
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:43,550
This is the whole script we have,

54
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,600
and I'm gonna go into our Lennox machine,

55
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:52,570
which I have already logged in on logged in us myself and this territory.

56
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:55,230
I'm and I'm in my home directory.

57
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,550
I'll go into my scripts territory.

58
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,620
Um,

59
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,850
I believe,

60
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:02,420
uh,

61
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,370
my scripts CD,

62
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:05,590
my scripts.

63
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:11,520
And in that directory I have already created some of the scripts that we learned in the

64
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,550
previous lessons.

65
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,840
So for this,

66
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,710
I'm gonna create a new script.

67
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:21,550
Gonna v I and I'm gonna name the file case script.

68
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:24,670
You could name it.

69
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:30,480
Anything you want once you are in V I mode hit,

70
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,550
insert by and you could just simply right click on your,

71
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:41,080
um on your mouse and it will paced everything for you.

72
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,610
The first option is once again it's just a shell.

73
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:49,070
It's telling you to run would shell environment.

74
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:56,880
The 2nd 1 is you type in anything this script is created,

75
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:03,360
but by me or yourself your name or what everyone you want to do.

76
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,750
Second thing it's doing by the way,

77
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,920
empty lines in the script doesn't really marry.

78
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,510
Believe the Empty or you could just put a hash sign.

79
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,390
Next thing echo again.

80
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:16,060
Echo is just gonna throw in an empty line on the screen.

81
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,570
And as we went over the script,

82
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,800
this exactly what's gonna do.

83
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,620
Um,

84
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,500
and you're gonna save this file?

85
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,770
Do ls my Celt er this is still a file.

86
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:33,410
It's not scripted because we have not assigned executed permissions to it.

87
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:41,270
So to assign that secured permission a plus X to assign acceptable permissions toe all user

88
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:46,920
group and others and the name off the scrip s case script Verify it has all the permissions

89
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:46,920
.

90
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,160
Yes,

91
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:47,620
it does.

92
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,220
Now we're gonna run the script by dot,

93
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,950
slash and type case.

94
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,570
Once you're gonna run it,

95
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,680
you'll see it's gonna give you that.

96
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,450
Please choose one off the options below.

97
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:03,510
So you have the list of options right here?

98
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,220
A to display the date and time.

99
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:13,090
It's nothing but exactly the display off all those texts that I have typed after Echo,

100
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,220
which you see right here it's everything after echo.

101
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,250
It's nothing but,

102
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,450
um,

103
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,610
and output on the screen.

104
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:29,690
So now if I select okay and run it it exit of the script and it gives me the date it runs

105
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:33,320
the command date itself as a few type date.

106
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,780
It gives you the date,

107
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,450
today's date,

108
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:39,690
the time and you let's run it again.

109
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:47,980
And this time will pick be once you do be it lists all the files or directories inside off

110
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,900
my current director,

111
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,850
which is the command that you already know,

112
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,660
which is Ellis.

113
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,250
Run it again.

114
00:05:53,250 --> 00:06:00,340
And this time I'm gonna pick D check system up time and to the command to check system up.

115
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,340
Time is just simply up time.

116
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:08,600
And this script will run up time command and put on the screen.

117
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,430
So this was exactly the case statement does.

118
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,590
So the last option.

119
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,990
If you notice we have a star right here.

120
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:16,610
What?

121
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:20,520
It's telling me that if any other option is packed,

122
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,400
it's gonna say echo invalid choice.

123
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,630
So by so let's try to run it.

124
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,430
And this time I'm gonna pick F.

125
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:27,900
Of course,

126
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,150
F is not one of the listing.

127
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,710
So once I do,

128
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,400
that will say invalid choice by.

129
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,720
So that's how the case script works.

130
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,410
I want you try it out.

131
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:43,400
Pick different commands that you want to run,

132
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:49,670
pick different text message that you want to associate with those commands and try to run

133
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:49,890
it.

134
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,170
Let's say if you want it,

135
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:51,830
um,

136
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,800
pick A for what is your name,

137
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,150
and it should type who for it,

138
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:01,240
and it will give you the log in name and so on,

139
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,100
and all the different commands that you have learned
