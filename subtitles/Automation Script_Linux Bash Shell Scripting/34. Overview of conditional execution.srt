1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,100
how everyone in the section we're going to discuss about conditional statements,

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,450
our decision making.

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:11,540
So that's a very important section to understand.

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,010
In the last few lectures,

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:20,680
we understood about the simple Shall scream we had killed so many scripts in that describes

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:20,680
,

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:26,620
we hardly know simply put the commands on a few variables and executed on Invisible.

8
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:27,890
We got some outputs,

9
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,440
but those were over simple scripts.

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:35,830
But if we'll see some complex scripts in which we have in our different logics are there,

11
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:37,080
conditions are there.

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:37,930
Sloops are there,

13
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:38,770
like four loops,

14
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,970
while lobes the functions are there.

15
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:42,440
As for the requirement,

16
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,900
so in the section will understandable the condition.

17
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,850
Or we can say this is a base off Sal Escape.

18
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,380
So let's understand this important topic.

19
00:00:52,380 --> 00:01:00,770
You can use the if come on toe destined condition so condition could be like I have a

20
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:01,800
script on.

21
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,540
I want that my script should be executed or any common should be executed.

22
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:14,740
If certain conditions exist like the shallows could may execute the backup Onley if certain

23
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,540
condition exists,

24
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,170
like the backup should be initiated on Lee.

25
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:20,220
If Sunday is there,

26
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,450
if it is Sunday,

27
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,030
so this is one condition.

28
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:26,480
If the file is existing,

29
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:32,640
make a backup otherwise print on error message on a screen to such type of conditions.

30
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:32,950
You can,

31
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:33,370
you know,

32
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:40,650
fulfill using If come on toward this condition.

33
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:47,250
It is an expression that values to a Boolean value that is to or falls.

34
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,320
So if a statement walks on,

35
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:49,610
you know,

36
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,440
20 falls.

37
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:58,110
So it is mainly a comparison off to lose that is zero and one in a shallow zero in the

38
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,050
gives falls.

39
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,860
If the condition is not satisfied,

40
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,850
it means the number is zero.

41
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:06,110
If you're getting number one on non zero,

42
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,040
it means the condition is true.

43
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:18,150
So a little over will do a lot off in a lab stations and nobody's so home.

44
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,460
We can,

45
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:18,770
you know,

46
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:22,250
use the if statement or we can say what this index off distant man.

47
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,220
So it's very simple,

48
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:24,650
like,

49
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,090
you know,

50
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:31,570
if on expression on Dennis statement and if I so that's is very simple,

51
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:31,910
you know,

52
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:37,640
we can see the Syntex off how to use the if statement late.

53
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,820
So this is one thing.

54
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,440
Second,

55
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:50,650
like here we have used if mouths like if specified condition is not too in that if part

56
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,250
than as far will be executed.

57
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,930
So here suppose you know I've mentioned like,

58
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,210
if I've Andi,

59
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,540
I'm looking for any file.

60
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,040
If this file is existing,

61
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,410
then you know,

62
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:10,050
make a backup else we got an output like backup is not possible because the file is missing

63
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:10,050
.

64
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:14,220
So two conditions we have used here Either it is existing or not.

65
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:19,090
If my file is existing there than this statement will be executed whatever you have

66
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,890
mentioned there else it will be going to this one.

67
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,740
That is simple.

68
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,470
You know the use off fells.

69
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:32,070
The next one is your if it lives else.

70
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,320
If I statements so it's just like a letter.

71
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,050
You can see that.

72
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,140
So to use you know,

73
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,870
the multiple conditions in which we have to use a lot off fells.

74
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,440
So here you can see the Syntex like this one.

75
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,260
If this is my first condition on,

76
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,880
we have the statements.

77
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:53,100
We have another condition here you can put and also we have another condition.

78
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:53,940
So if you have you know,

79
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,640
multiple conditions you can use a lift for that.

80
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,720
So we'll do a lab session then you can understand that if live nested one,

81
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,370
we can see that.

82
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,020
So friend there.

83
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,540
So for this lecture will start doing the practice.

84
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,340
Then you will have more confidence and more understanding about this topic.

85
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,780
So thanks for watching Will soon the next lecture,

86
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,160
but
