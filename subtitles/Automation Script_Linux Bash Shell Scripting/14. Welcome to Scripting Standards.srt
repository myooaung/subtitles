00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,730
welcome to Section four off scripting standards.

2
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:12,930
What are the basic standards that you need to remember?

3
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:19,900
Some off them that we will cover in this entire section is how you need to name your script

4
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:19,900
.

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,550
What are the naming convention that you should use?

6
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:23,470
Okay.

7
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:23,990
Hey,

8
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,630
I know how.

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:24,930
What?

10
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,110
Naming convention to use?

11
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:27,330
I don't have to worry about it.

12
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,900
I would remember everything that I would know.

13
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:30,400
Okay,

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,770
if you do know that,

15
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:32,750
be my guest.

16
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,460
Skip ahead to this lesson.

17
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,200
Double cover,

18
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,450
But trust me down the road if you are.

19
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,610
If you have created a script a year from the time you created script,

20
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:48,160
you will forget it if you do not have in a proper naming convention.

21
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,050
And if you do not have in a proper directory structure,

22
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,880
so we'll cover about the naming.

23
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,140
Convention will cover out how the script permission works.

24
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,260
So when you create a file by default,

25
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,450
it does not assigned executed permission.

26
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,280
If you want to read a file,

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,890
it has to have a re permission.

28
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,490
If you want to execute it,

29
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:08,440
it has to have execute permission.

30
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,590
We'll cover that in that.

31
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,000
In that,

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,410
um,

33
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,210
lesson.

34
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:13,060
Then shell script format.

35
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,700
How you should write a shell script.

36
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,020
What are the formats?

37
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:17,730
Um,

38
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:19,450
standards that you should follow,

39
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,260
followed by the sequence of the script.

40
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,070
Execution.

41
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:27,450
When you want to execute certain things inside off your script,

42
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,590
you want to execute ABC.

43
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,250
You need to know how they are executed.

44
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,550
And the last one is the variables and how to create them.

45
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:42,670
Variables is just like aliases will cover that in this in this section as well.

46
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,200
So these are the basic things again.

47
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,230
If you know all that,

48
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,930
be my guest.

49
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,000
You could fast forward.

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,480
But I would highly recommend you to please go over and And so this way you will have the

51
00:01:53,480 --> 00:02:00,330
right standard in your in your memory and you will know exactly when you're starting it

52
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,230
from the get go.

53
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,150
You know how to start from the right path.
