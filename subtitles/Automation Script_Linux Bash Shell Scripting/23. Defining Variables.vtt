00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320
in this lesson,

2
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.270
we are going to define variable and run those variables.

3
00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.730
So this is a good exercise where you will learn how you could define variables at the

4
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.020
beginning of the script.

5
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:18.470
So anywhere you would need to use those variables anywhere in the script,

6
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:19.650
middle or the end,

7
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:27.270
you could just simply run that container that very so what exactly a variable is.

8
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.220
So let's look at this.

9
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.970
So look,

10
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:29.320
it's,

11
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.770
um list that I have Now.

12
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:32.290
You see,

13
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.020
I have defined Ah,

14
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.180
variable for P.

15
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:44.030
I have put a pwd for l is just simply a less w is for who am I d for date and see for Cal

16
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.140
2018

17
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.860
So these are the variables.

18
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.690
The variables are the first digits pl w d.

19
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:56.380
C and the commands that that variable the commands that inside of those variables,

20
00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.150
I would say,

21
00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.250
are the ones on the right hand side.

22
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.960
So this is how we're going to create a new script by having those variable defined at the

23
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:06.450
beginning.

24
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.810
So I'm gonna log into my machine.

25
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.850
I believe I already have logged in.

26
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:11.750
So,

27
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.250
um,

28
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.060
what I'm gonna do just for just for fun just for exercise or just for practice.

29
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.850
I'm gonna go one step back and I'm gonna,

30
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:21.910
um,

31
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.100
create a new directory called M K D I R.

32
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.150
And I'm gonna call it my scripts.

33
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.610
So it's just to tell you how you could differentiate from one director to another.

34
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.270
But anyway,

35
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.390
which ever direct to you Make sure there are There's Pacific directory for every script.

36
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.010
Don't just put it in your home director or anywhere else.

37
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.950
It's not a good product.

38
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.430
Um,

39
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.750
so I have the structure created my script and,

40
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:48.930
um,

41
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.930
I am going to create a new script.

42
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.360
I'm gonna call it,

43
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.250
Let's say,

44
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.150
ah,

45
00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:01.420
variable uh,

46
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.850
test Mr.

47
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.790
And the first thing,

48
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.130
what do you have to do is been bash,

49
00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.230
And then you have to define the comments,

50
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.700
the author description.

51
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.530
The data was creating all that stuff.

52
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.520
I'm not gonna take a lot of your time to go into defining every single one off it,

53
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.060
So I'm just gonna from now on,

54
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.920
I'm just gonna define the the shell,

55
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.780
which is the mandatory thing.

56
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.750
So and then I'm gonna go straight to,

57
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:32.950
um,

58
00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.500
running script,

59
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.210
that writing the actual so anyway,

60
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.480
because I do know the time is valuable for everybody,

61
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.550
but I am very hopeful that you guys do follow the standard that I have.

62
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.550
So,

63
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:49.010
um,

64
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.540
first thing that is I'm gonna do is come put a comment here,

65
00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.980
miss it.

66
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.810
Define very okay.

67
00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.240
And those variables are 1st 1 is P equal.

68
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.550
PW 2nd 1 l and Ellis.

69
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.430
W is for who am I?

70
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.130
But you know what?

71
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.460
Actually,

72
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.070
there is a command called w and Lennox,

73
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.760
so I'm just gonna put,

74
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.840
um um who am I?

75
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.850
Just w i b.

76
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.780
That would be Who am I date for?

77
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.710
D And see now,

78
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.520
since the sea it is a calendar and that I want the 2018 calendar,

79
00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.830
so it has a space in the middle,

80
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.550
so I have to put that in cold.

81
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.080
Single coach Caliphate.

82
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.840
Cynical doesn't work in your environment.

83
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.350
Double coat.

84
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.250
That's fine.

85
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.020
Okay,

86
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.740
so now you're variable defiance.

87
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.920
No.

88
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.150
What do you do is you could just simply say echo.

89
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.950
Um run variables.

90
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.350
Tasks.

91
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.550
Back again.

92
00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.650
Now I'm gonna run command.

93
00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.610
Sorry.

94
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:10.220
I'm gonna run the variable p to define the variable to run it or to get executed,

95
00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.930
you have to start with dollar piece of this way.

96
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.420
The operating system or the shell would know that you want to run their very okay.

97
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.850
Perfect.

98
00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:20.820
Next.

99
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:21.190
Very well.

100
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.040
I wanna run.

101
00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:29.950
Is l 3rd 1 is W I 4th 1 as d and one C.

102
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.150
It's just that simple.

103
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.150
Save it.

104
00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.780
Okay,

105
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.550
now let's give it up.

106
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:40.750
Missions.

107
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.820
See there.

108
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.150
That's very for one more time,

109
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.020
if you see.

110
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.440
Ah,

111
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:56.110
the reason I came in I want to see if it has all the variables in Hey,

112
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.350
looks good to me.

113
00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.950
It's tried to run is to test a script.

114
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.830
Always run it variable.

115
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.600
Okay,

116
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.250
so we do have some kind of error messages.

117
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:10.170
Perfect.

118
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:11.020
That is fine.

119
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.830
Because,

120
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:12.790
as we learned,

121
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.900
we wanted to see where those are messages are.

122
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.190
And how can we troubleshoot?

123
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.040
As you see,

124
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:24.480
the first message that is giving us that there is in Line eight is unexpected.

125
00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.880
End of file while looking for matching coat or single course.

126
00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.480
So let's go to line eight variable to go to line eight.

127
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.860
It's just they and it's a Ah,

128
00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:37.770
see what I happen.

129
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:38.950
I put single code here,

130
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.470
and I put double coat here.

131
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:40.950
Okay.

132
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:42.020
All right,

133
00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.850
So one problem.

134
00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.080
It's fixed.

135
00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.010
Run it again.

136
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.380
Okay,

137
00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:52.950
I think it ran.

138
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:54.180
Find this time.

139
00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.850
Hopefully,

140
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:56.650
yes.

141
00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:02.750
Run variable tests and was variable as PWD is this.

142
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.530
The file is variable inside of that directory,

143
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:07.250
there's user,

144
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.050
which is a variable date and the calendar.

145
00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.250
So that's how it was coming up.

146
00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:20.360
And you notice when I ran the command earlier test variable.

147
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.750
When it had a problem,

148
00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.550
it gave me error messages on to line.

149
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.040
Do you know why?

150
00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.590
Because first line is eight,

151
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.050
which had that double coat on one side and single quote one side.

152
00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.040
So that'd be a no,

153
00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.050
that was era.

154
00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.620
But why?

155
00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:35.250
We were getting,

156
00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:36.150
um,

157
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.850
error on line 17.

158
00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:40.750
Think of it.

159
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.850
Let's check y v work.

160
00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:43.830
I know,

161
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:45.750
but I wanted to show you exactly why.

162
00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:47.250
So let's go to the file.

163
00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:48.080
And now this time,

164
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:48.850
type seven.

165
00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:51.150
Uh,

166
00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:52.650
you know why?

167
00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.780
I'm sure.

168
00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:55.750
Now you know why?

169
00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:01.860
Because in 98 the defined variable was this which had a problem.

170
00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:05.980
And in line 17 when it came down to run that variable,

171
00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:06.470
it says,

172
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:06.680
Hey,

173
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:07.680
I can't run their variable.

174
00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.650
So that's why it gave us error messages in to line.

175
00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:13.610
Okay,

176
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:14.110
so anyway,

177
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:15.850
So that's how you define variables?

178
00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:16.830
Um,

179
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:17.990
going forward,

180
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.400
I will be using scripts.

181
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.320
I will be writing scripts in,

182
00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:22.650
Ah,

183
00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:23.750
different directories.

184
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:24.490
Um,

185
00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:28.170
I could be writing in my my script.

186
00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:30.670
I could be writing in just the script director,

187
00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:31.410
but anyway,
