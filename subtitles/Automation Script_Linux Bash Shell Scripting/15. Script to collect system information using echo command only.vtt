Hello.

2
00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:06.350
Everyone in this lecture will see the rules for naming variable names.

3
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:12.820
So many times we have seen that while we're assigning are creating any very well we're

4
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:13.130
getting,

5
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:13.430
you know,

6
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:14.100
errors.

7
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:21.140
So there are certain rules which we need to follow while assigning any variable name.

8
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.140
So let's understand.

9
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.390
This is my box.

10
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.710
So wearable name must begin with alphanumeric character.

11
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.730
Or you can also start with underscore character as well.

12
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:41.940
Suppose you know I have available like like a V is available and I want to give some number

13
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:42.820
or some name.

14
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:43.130
So what?

15
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.940
I'm giving mining.

16
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.900
I'm giving like this way.

17
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.150
So is it the right way?

18
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.980
Let's see.

19
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.450
I'm getting some Adam.

20
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.750
So it is not the right way to give or to define any very well.

21
00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:04.470
Do not put the spaces on either side of the equal Sign this one equal sign while assigning

22
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.320
the value to the very book on Suppose I'm giving this way.

23
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.450
This is also not cutting.

24
00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.180
All right,

25
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.510
if I'm giving many,

26
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.210
many spaces this so this is the other wrong years.

27
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.920
So what is the right approach for that?

28
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.030
It's very simple.

29
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:38.680
This'll No variables are also the ancestors.

30
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.580
Suppose I have given a B is equal to sugar like this is one.

31
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.220
But after one e on Capitol,

32
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:54.620
a piece called What I have given this one capitally small B is equal.

33
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.390
Do John.

34
00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.020
This is my different variables.

35
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:08.020
I have given this one anything else left No on be bowtie small if I'm giving,

36
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.590
like this week,

37
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.650
like I'm giving a number here 100 times.

38
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.400
So these are treated as a different variables here.

39
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.120
You can see that baby is saying,

40
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.140
but they're different variables because variable names are case sensitive.

41
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.400
If I'm goingto active dollar baby,

42
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.850
I'm getting a different out 45 to do Echo e and Capital.

43
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.350
You can see that I am getting a different output here.

44
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.080
So,

45
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.510
like this?

46
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.690
Well,

47
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:34.690
if I am putting cab,

48
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:35.330
believe me,

49
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.240
I'm different.

50
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.730
So in simple words,

51
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.130
while defining any wearables,

52
00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.640
keep in mind that variable names are case sensitive.

53
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.680
Right?

54
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.550
So these are the important things we have to keep in mind.

55
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.700
I left one thing out.

56
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.270
What I'm going to do,

57
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.460
I'm going to kill a simple escape using a cook amounts.

58
00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.300
So I'm here now,

59
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.060
so I'm going to my time.

60
00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:10.070
My this location so you can give any name.

61
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.640
It is up to you.

62
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.750
Okay,

63
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.860
so this could be basically,

64
00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:20.350
you know,

65
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.890
which will find out the details.

66
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:24.750
Form your systems.

67
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.710
Like that system disk space,

68
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.210
Like memory uses.

69
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:29.780
The system is up.

70
00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.200
How many users are logging?

71
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.910
So what is simple is kept on going great.

72
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.640
But I am going to really use the Echo command only.

73
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.570
So let's see.

74
00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.580
So this is my you know,

75
00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:39.150
she bank.

76
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.220
You want to give any comments?

77
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.970
You can use cash Like I'm just putting.

78
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.050
This is the simple It's clipped,

79
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:56.790
which is going to I like system information.

80
00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.560
So this is just basically,

81
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.850
you know,

82
00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.610
if anybody is going to open the script so they will get the information like what this

83
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.250
company is all about.

84
00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.710
No.

85
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.640
First,

86
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:22.110
I'm going to use this one host name right on Dio.

87
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.470
So this is also,

88
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.700
you know,

89
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.750
Has it means that sick comment only it is not going to you know,

90
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:35.970
I don't when you file the commodity is not going to coming out in the This comes output.

91
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.070
So no,

92
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.520
this is my first line which is going to be executed.

93
00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.150
So this is I'm going to put like this way.

94
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:52.310
12345 Host name information.

95
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:58.510
Okay.

96
00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:59.800
And I need to put that Come on.

97
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.460
So I'm going to use coast name Syria.

98
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.550
Okay,

99
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.390
I'm going equal so that there will be a single space.

100
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.900
So I wonder if you have multiple command.

101
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.000
There should be no some space as well.

102
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.380
So,

103
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.960
second,

104
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:26.550
this is file system MySpace disk uses begins in it.

105
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:32.950
So again,

106
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:33.940
I'm going to use eco.

107
00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:34.320
Come on,

108
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.330
Onda,

109
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.650
let me copy this one.

110
00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:52.850
Did file system disk space uses.

111
00:05:52.850 --> 00:06:01.620
I need to put the fire.

112
00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:01.980
I'm putting.

113
00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:02.850
Somebody fired this gun.

114
00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:05.550
Echo this one.

115
00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:15.850
Let me put a little Come on here that this three on used my memory in the system.

116
00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:32.760
Echo this 11245 Free and used memory 1 24 flight.

117
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.190
So the come on is simple free.

118
00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:43.180
Okay,

119
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.510
that would one more thing.

120
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.020
Like system up time and lord.

121
00:06:47.020 --> 00:07:01.720
So this one sister of time and to Lord tickle this 15 times I'm putting it is up to you how

122
00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:02.100
you are,

123
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:11.580
how that would put you want to have I'm putting this currently this one obtaining so I need

124
00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.950
to put this one system up time.

125
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:26.720
I need to put the come on here.

126
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.250
I'm just putting up time.

127
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:31.050
Okay,

128
00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:35.180
So anything else I would so one more come on.

129
00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.050
Like how Maney logged in users.

130
00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:41.250
So London he uses.

131
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.750
Okay,

132
00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.820
so that is cool.

133
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:57.970
Oneto t 45 on this one is currently loved and users.

134
00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:04.050
And the common is who?

135
00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:09.560
So the soul and just putting that much of months already.

136
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.330
Let me come out from that.

137
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:12.870
Let me catch my script as well.

138
00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:16.050
There's a simplistic if you can see No,

139
00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:18.800
The next step is you know,

140
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:26.170
I need to make it executable so that I can execute it to see it.

141
00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:26.770
More hyphen.

142
00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:27.210
Axe,

143
00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:28.370
ankle.

144
00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:29.870
No,

145
00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:30.750
I won't be executed.

146
00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:34.250
Let me put clear here.

147
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:39.350
You can see that I have got an output.

148
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:42.460
I got some better here with this commodity showing free.

149
00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:42.830
Come on.

150
00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:48.960
Not from let's see what that we have in the system or it's a type of Mr Command is free.

151
00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:52.190
Okay,

152
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:52.620
again,

153
00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:53.310
I moved to five.

154
00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:53.750
This one.

155
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.650
You can see that I'm getting an output here.

156
00:08:55.650 --> 00:09:00.710
But although it put its coming in one bowl So one thing that we put some,

157
00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:01.120
you know,

158
00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:01.790
sleep.

159
00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:02.240
Come on.

160
00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.010
I want that.

161
00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:05.230
It should be there for a few seconds.

162
00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:05.750
So I am boring.

163
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:08.630
Sleep two seconds on here.

164
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:08.880
Also.

165
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.470
I'm going to put sleep.

166
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:11.350
Two seconds.

167
00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:26.410
Get on with this one.

168
00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:31.650
I will wait for two seconds.

169
00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:33.120
Again.

170
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.800
Again.

171
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.940
So this is a very simple escape,

172
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.940
which I have created using only a cooker months.

173
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:42.480
And after that,

174
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.210
I used simply no sleep.

175
00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:44.570
Come on.

176
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:46.290
So with these two commands,

177
00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:46.510
you know,

178
00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:48.320
I have created this beautiful scripts.

179
00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.170
So what it is doing this Captain,

180
00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:51.650
that details from your system.

181
00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:52.950
So not this way.

182
00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:54.470
You know what I have done?

183
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:55.480
I just put although,

184
00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:55.710
you know,

185
00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:58.110
commands in the file on executed,
