00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.820
how everyone.

2
00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:03.120
So let's continue.

3
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.860
So this is my environment on this is my central I so and I can see that I have a lot off

4
00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.220
souls in my environment.

5
00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.770
So the previous lecture we understood about the escape,

6
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.970
that skirt which can be used to fetch the system information.

7
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.080
Now what?

8
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.980
I have been here.

9
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.710
I have copied that is crypto all my source that is presented my environment like this one

10
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.390
and this one in this one and this one.

11
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.410
So my script is present on all the sewers on.

12
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.150
After that,

13
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.340
I,

14
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.040
you know,

15
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.570
should Hilda screams,

16
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.450
vaya con.

17
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.970
So the scripts is going to run by yourself using chrome.

18
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.510
And when the script is running,

19
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.270
it is generating a report.

20
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.120
So I have this Crippen this over on the script is going to execute wire Krahn on it will

21
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.190
generate one file of one report.

22
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.770
We can say that now on sentry.

23
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.930
So I have created a very simple script which is basically,

24
00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:59.430
you know,

25
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.990
fighting the report from all the sewers.

26
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:09.540
So my script is on all the souls it is executing itself by a crown on it is generating one

27
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.330
file and that file.

28
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.630
I am,

29
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:12.060
you know,

30
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.060
fetching for my centralized server.

31
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.850
So let's see how I have done it.

32
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.470
So this is my centralized server.

33
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.800
I'm in this location here.

34
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.420
I have credit a file that his host file in which we have the list off All the souls in my

35
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.140
environment.

36
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.760
Supposing news environment.

37
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.780
They are 50 silvers.

38
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.280
So you have to put the name or ivy off all the fifties hours,

39
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.050
right?

40
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.170
No,

41
00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.400
I'm going to my first summer.

42
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.080
That is this one.

43
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.550
Okay,

44
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.000
so,

45
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.230
I mean,

46
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.730
first of all,

47
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:43.750
that is so one,

48
00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.050
right?

49
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.570
So if you'll see,

50
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.410
they're different fighting this contact,

51
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:49.730
hyphen.

52
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.080
L terrible mistake.

53
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.170
That is contact by phone.

54
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.830
I can see that my script is there.

55
00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:58.640
Okay,

56
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.390
On it is executing an average 10 minutes on while it is executing.

57
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.020
Whatever.

58
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.110
The outboard is coming off the Ice Cube.

59
00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.300
It is going into this final.

60
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.900
I'm used this symbol.

61
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:11.590
This is for,

62
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.930
you know,

63
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.760
redirection channel on day water without foot.

64
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.120
Like maybe while you escape designing,

65
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.770
we have some,

66
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.980
you know,

67
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:19.580
errors.

68
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.160
Maybe you,

69
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.680
us kept,

70
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.310
is having some,

71
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.640
you know,

72
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.320
useful out water with output.

73
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.950
While executing your script.

74
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.860
It is going into this fight here.

75
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:29.100
You know,

76
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.150
you can see that I have used this host name,

77
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.600
right?

78
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.380
So my report would vacated with the host name of the server.

79
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.650
So let me show you.

80
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.650
Let me go into this direct contact into this Crips.

81
00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:42.270
Okay,

82
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.620
Onda,

83
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.720
Go,

84
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.360
Dev hyphen it.

85
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.140
No one my school visit running are executing.

86
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.870
It will be going into this location.

87
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.980
Andi here against the name off my finally board.

88
00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.210
This is the name off my several.

89
00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.730
After that,

90
00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.350
death reports start Txt Right,

91
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.580
So like this where the report is generating here you can see that my report is

92
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.850
automatically generated in every 10 minutes.

93
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.850
It is deputy at 10.

94
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.350
10 2010.

95
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.850
30

96
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:20.500
There will be another report Now I'm going to my second several second.

97
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.210
So what is this one?

98
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.700
What are so?

99
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.290
We can see that that is 1 30 right again going to this location.

100
00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.840
So this is a location where I have put my descript right gone,

101
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.320
Tep Hi Final The same against the report is coming like this for this is the host name.

102
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.150
After this I have put dish reports touched Dixie.

103
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.260
So like this way,

104
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.050
you know I have put all those curves in all my cells on with help off crown.

105
00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.070
My scripts are executing on when the script is a recruiting.

106
00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.110
It is deleting a file that is a report file.

107
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.060
And the name of the report file is,

108
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.890
you know,

109
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.650
having the name of the server like this way.

110
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.430
Now I'm coming back to my,

111
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:07.130
you know means.

112
00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.250
So that is my centralized server.

113
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.540
I'm in this location here.

114
00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.790
You can see that I have created one file that is host file in the host file.

115
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:16.940
I have kept you know,

116
00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.470
the name off I p off all my service environments over.

117
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.520
No.

118
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:22.260
Here,

119
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.630
have you simple for Luke.

120
00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:29.600
We'll have a separate section about the loops just for the sake of the knowledge use.

121
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.470
Very simple.

122
00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.090
Logical for Luke lesson this time.

123
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:39.020
So this is the report which can be used to fetch the they put from all the servers.

124
00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.610
Right.

125
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:40.950
So let's discuss this one.

126
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.200
So this is,

127
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.640
you know,

128
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.150
the file on which we have all the So his name,

129
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.710
horse name.

130
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:50.200
Okay.

131
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.620
This one,

132
00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.100
you can see that I am in this location have created a file that his host after that.

133
00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.300
You know,

134
00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.060
I am simply a city that is copying the file from my remote serve us dollar.

135
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.340
Right.

136
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.570
This is my first server,

137
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:02.150
right,

138
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.840
cat.

139
00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.250
This file is Okay,

140
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.990
So a sippy dollars,

141
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.200
my first over this one right on.

142
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.590
It is looking for this find that is very script.

143
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.130
And this it is looking for report file.

144
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.370
I have used one wildcard here that is asked risk.

145
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:21.560
Right?

146
00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.730
So obviously it is looking for the file,

147
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:24.230
which,

148
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.490
you know,

149
00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:25.720
and with the report,

150
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.910
there's text.

151
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:27.720
After that,

152
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.950
there would be a name off the file name of the Southern name,

153
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.490
and then it is copping into this location.

154
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:33.870
So this location is this one.

155
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.090
If I'm going inside,

156
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.480
let's see,

157
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.030
Do we have?

158
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.880
So I'm going to remove all my this files right now.

159
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.440
You can see that there's nothing.

160
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.430
Okay,

161
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:50.800
So,

162
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.960
like,

163
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.420
this word is going toe all myself was one by one.

164
00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.720
This is my force over second,

165
00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:57.740
several hurts already.

166
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.160
Just copying the file from that server and putting into this location.

167
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.120
So this location is this one here.

168
00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.760
You will see that we have a directly that is reports.

169
00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.210
So what?

170
00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:07.660
I'm going to do?

171
00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.690
I'm just going to execute this script and let's see whether I'm getting their desire or or

172
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:11.940
no,

173
00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:18.660
I can see that it has copied all my report files from all the sewers.

174
00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:19.580
Now,

175
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:20.800
if I'm going into this look,

176
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.430
location,

177
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:22.390
that is this one.

178
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:26.080
And you can see that all my reports have come into this one.

179
00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.060
If I'm going to cut any of the file like this one,

180
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:37.230
you can see that I have beside report,

181
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:38.210
right,

182
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:39.270
Onda,

183
00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.150
any time you can get it.

184
00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:48.570
But I you can also should ill this fetching as well with the help off crown,

185
00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:49.310
let me assure you,

186
00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:51.150
I'm just putting contact.
