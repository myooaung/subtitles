1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,050
Now let's talk about another script to delete old files.

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:08,800
Now,

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:16,880
this is a definite script that everyone might have experienced or will be experiencing.

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,200
If you are becoming a system administrator or becoming a Lennox,

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,250
you are taking over Lennox job.

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,550
So you have a system.

7
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:26,750
And,

8
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:27,850
um,

9
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:29,080
as you know,

10
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,140
that you build a system.

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:31,630
Um,

12
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:34,420
so many people law gained so many program runs.

13
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:39,380
So many locks get created as a system ages over time.

14
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,350
It creates a lot of files.

15
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,150
When a lot of files are created,

16
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:48,440
there is no mechanism inside unless you,

17
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:48,890
um,

18
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:52,840
enable couple of other services to delete all the files.

19
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,650
So what happens if you don't lead those old files?

20
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,450
Well,

21
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:00,430
it will fill up your disk space,

22
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,050
and once the disc space is full,

23
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:06,040
your system will become unresponsive.

24
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:11,550
So it is very important for all the system engineers administrators to actually keep an eye

25
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:15,250
on all the old files and that are no longer in use.

26
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,640
So in this lesson,

27
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,130
what we're gonna do is we're gonna create a script from scratch that will delete all the

28
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:25,450
files for a specified number of days or years,

29
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:28,550
or whichever that is being specified in the script.

30
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,520
And what are you gonna do?

31
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,000
Actually,

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,340
first,

33
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,550
we're gonna create files with all the time step,

34
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,130
because in my system,

35
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,020
my system is fairly new.

36
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,150
And most likely the system you are working on is also new.

37
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:44,580
So maybe you don't have older files,

38
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:50,670
so you would have to create files with the whole the time stamps so we could try out our

39
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:51,450
new a script.

40
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:57,170
Then we gonna find and delete those files that are older than 90 days.

41
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:57,980
Um,

42
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,060
why pick 90 days?

43
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,910
It doesn't really matter.

44
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,640
You could pick 100 raise 80 days,

45
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,910
whichever days that you like,

46
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,070
but in a journalist.

47
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:08,050
And it is that most of time people want to get rid of all the files,

48
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,150
all of them three months,

49
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:13,750
and then we gonna find another way or another script,

50
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,020
um,

51
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,710
which will find and rename old files.

52
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:20,640
So if instead of deleting it,

53
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,060
what you could do is you can find all the files that's older than 90 days,

54
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,240
and instead of deleting it,

55
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:32,640
how can we just rename it and renamed like a dot old or dot archive or whatever that you

56
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,770
want to rename So you need a script for that,

57
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:35,010
too?

58
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:38,430
So these these are the type of script that will work on in this lesson.

59
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,050
Um,

60
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,150
I will go straight into my Lennox machine.

61
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:45,510
Okay.

62
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,910
I have it open through my precession.

63
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,120
I am logged.

64
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,050
And as myself and I am in home,

65
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,050
I've zall p s directory.

66
00:02:54,050 --> 00:03:00,360
PS directory is something that I previously created stands for professional scripts anyway

67
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,930
Or you could put pick any directory,

68
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,210
as I mentioned.

69
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:03,800
Um,

70
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,490
earlier.

71
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,850
So now we are in this directory,

72
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,140
and when you do ls minus.

73
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:15,180
Lt are you'll notice that I do not have any file older than August 27th which is not three

74
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:15,910
months old.

75
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:19,020
So for me to test my script on older files,

76
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,560
I would have to create some files that will,

77
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,050
with all the time steps.

78
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:24,640
Well,

79
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,220
can you do it?

80
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:25,470
Yes.

81
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,160
You could do it.

82
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:26,480
Um,

83
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,650
you could do it with a touch command and,

84
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:29,420
um,

85
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,200
before mad.

86
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:37,060
For for that is touch with minus D option and you specify the time.

87
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,450
Let's sit Thursday,

88
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,050
Um,

89
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,640
Thursday,

90
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,250
Comma first March,

91
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:50,650
2018 12.

92
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:58,520
30 AM and create a file called It's called,

93
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,410
um eight Okay,

94
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,700
so now the file is created.

95
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,650
That's verify it.

96
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:04,390
If it is,

97
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,650
if it is created with all the time stamp.

98
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,460
Yes.

99
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:08,790
You see,

100
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:14,550
I didn't ls minus lt r And this option with less months lt are It will give me all my files

101
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:21,670
and the time Lee order so that the most recent one is created The bottom and all those one

102
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,460
is at the top.

103
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:27,350
So if you see the top one is this one It is created on march 1st.

104
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:31,040
Um so March 1st is a lot older.

105
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,050
I created that.

106
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,220
So now I wanted to create just like that.

107
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,430
I want to create other files as well.

108
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:40,350
So create be I'll create,

109
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,430
see,

110
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,990
create Diar,

111
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:43,770
create four files.

112
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:44,410
So this way,

113
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,570
when I run the script,

114
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:51,150
it will find all these commands all these files and executed.

115
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,650
Now let's create our script to delete it.

116
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:58,380
So first thing is to find it.

117
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,200
First of all,

118
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,570
every time you need to create a script,

119
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:04,420
it's better that you run that command so it will work in the script.

120
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,620
So do find,

121
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,150
um,

122
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,380
pat to where you finding it.

123
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,520
So I'm gonna find it in this path,

124
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,130
which is right here.

125
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:25,050
So find in this path time modify time plus 90.

126
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:30,020
And then once it finds them than what do you want to do?

127
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,950
You want to execute a command?

128
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,900
And I just wanted to see the listing office.

129
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,750
I'll do ls minus.

130
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,930
L off.

131
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:42,650
What returns and what has returned is specified with curly braces,

132
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,250
open curly braces,

133
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,650
closed space,

134
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:49,150
backslash and colon.

135
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:52,820
This is just a standard way to find files.

136
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:57,390
It's not something fancy that is only written script is just a simple commanding.

137
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,410
When you're searching online,

138
00:05:58,410 --> 00:05:59,750
you will find exactly commands.

139
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,610
So once I run this command,

140
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:05,550
you will see I will find all the files that are created three months ago.

141
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:10,350
And you see it found four files,

142
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,160
right?

143
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,850
Perfect.

144
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:17,030
So now I will create a script that will do exactly the same thing,

145
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:20,180
and I don't have to actually run it manually.

146
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:24,150
I'll just Cron tap that job and it will run on him.

147
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,120
Um um,

148
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,120
on a scheduled basis.

149
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:33,230
So if I do V I and I will put,

150
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:38,800
um um delete old files.

151
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,420
This is a name off my script.

152
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:40,900
I'll hit,

153
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,780
Enter and you know,

154
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:49,560
here What you need to do is been Bash and Author Imron.

155
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:59,510
Absolute date do eight 8 2020 description.

156
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:02,550
Very This script.

157
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,650
Well,

158
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:17,050
delete all their thin files Older then 90 days modified.

159
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,050
We need to worry about it.

160
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:21,850
Not really this time because you're creating.

161
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,550
I'll get perfect.

162
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,150
Now,

163
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,570
this is the description.

164
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:27,190
And,

165
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:27,750
um,

166
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,550
the shelf has defined I am going to right click,

167
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:35,050
which I copied that same exact while earlier.

168
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:38,250
And now just save it.

169
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:46,250
Give excusable permission to my script.

170
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:50,750
Um which is the legal files?

171
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,230
This check?

172
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:52,480
Yes,

173
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,160
the follows There.

174
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:53,340
Now,

175
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,250
when I run it,

176
00:07:54,250 --> 00:08:01,550
delete old file and you will see it is giving me hold Now I want to delete them.

177
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,590
So to delete them,

178
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:13,350
you be I'd upon a descript again and instead off execute ls you just do are delete those

179
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,950
files that are return.

180
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:24,680
So now when I run it the old files and give me my prom back it means it ran So when you do

181
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:31,370
ls my insult er you'll see all those files that I had earlier a b c d e All of them are

182
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:31,650
gone,

183
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:32,820
right?

184
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,370
So that's how you create a script that will really open.

185
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:38,380
What if you just want to rename it,

186
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,850
Let's try the same script.

187
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:42,680
And this time I'm just gonna say,

188
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:48,050
move the lead or piles to rename old files.

189
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:53,750
So now it's renamed I'm gonna change it to rename Old Falls.

190
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,850
And this time,

191
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:03,890
what I'm gonna do is I want once that those files are found I want to move whatever is

192
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:20,510
returned to return name dot old So this is going to find and move whatever it find to the

193
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:23,750
name off the fine bid dot old extension,

194
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,250
copy and paste.

195
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,830
Now I first before I run it.

196
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:31,110
I want to create those files and created earlier.

197
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:36,130
So I'm gonna hit up our key because a perky remembers all the commands that I ran

198
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:36,850
previously.

199
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,950
Okay,

200
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:49,470
so this is a one D see b and A that's verified.

201
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,030
Let's do it.

202
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:53,200
It's my cell tr and you'll see all the parts are now.

203
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,200
When I run this updated script,

204
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:03,530
it should update the name off these files from D two d dot old si dot old beat.

205
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:11,380
Our old and a daughter is to run rename old files and it ran.

206
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:19,850
Let's verify it you see a B C D got old.

207
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:23,540
So this is about the script again.

208
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,210
It's everyday script that you're gonna be using it.

209
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,950
It's a real life example script.

210
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:32,070
You need to know that you need to know how to delete all players or rename it or whatever

211
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,700
that you're trying to do with the files.

212
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,550
It will do it for you,

213
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:38,010
so try it out yourself.

214
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:46,690
I am going to include the instructions that we just followed in the lectures text in the

215
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:47,350
same lesson.

216
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,370
You'll find it.

217
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,250
You could copy paste,

218
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,750
or you could start from scratch.
