00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.590
Welcome to this machine learning course using Python and

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.560
scikit-learn designed for absolute beginners.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.105
Will start with the class scores on Python and various libraries.

00:00:18.105 --> 00:00:22.990
Then we'll dive into building machine learning models using scikit-learn.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.250
You will also understand how to create a risky paper,

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.255
your machine learning model using Flask framework.

00:00:32.255 --> 00:00:35.700
This is a completely Hudson course.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.940
As a prerequisite unit,

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.660
have some programming background and high school level mathematics knowledge.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.370
To get started with this course,

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.830
no prior knowledge of machine learning is required.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.630
Will be explaining all the concepts step-by-step

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.690
and teaching you how to build machine learning model from scratch.
