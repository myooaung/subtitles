00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:04.003
- When you have a great idea, like how to improve a process,

2
00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:07.007
or maybe a better framework your team can use,

3
00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:09.009
it takes a lot of communication at first

4
00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:12.007
to make that idea a reality.

5
00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:15.004
That's because changing a team's approach

6
00:00:15.004 --> 00:00:20.001
requires some consensus and gaining buy-in from the group.

7
00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:23.008
If advertising your ideas doesn't come natural to you,

8
00:00:23.008 --> 00:00:26.005
at first it can be challenging to get traction

9
00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:29.004
and support for them from your team.

10
00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:33.005
So let's go over a few basics for how to promote your ideas

11
00:00:33.005 --> 00:00:35.001
without it seeming like you're doing

12
00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:37.009
a bunch of self-promotion.

13
00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:39.003
The most important part

14
00:00:39.003 --> 00:00:41.007
of pitching your ideas to team members

15
00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:45.000
is to have a deep understanding of the idea,

16
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.008
including why it's beneficial for your team or product.

17
00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:52.008
Here, you want to keep the idea as specific

18
00:00:52.008 --> 00:00:56.008
and focused as possible, so that its benefits are obvious

19
00:00:56.008 --> 00:01:00.003
and its execution seems feasible.

20
00:01:00.003 --> 00:01:04.009
If it helps, prepare a list of why your idea is so great.

21
00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:07.007
Does it reduce work, cost less?

22
00:01:07.007 --> 00:01:12.002
Or maybe it avoids some big problem in the future.

23
00:01:12.002 --> 00:01:15.005
It also helps to build out some diagrams or visuals

24
00:01:15.005 --> 00:01:17.002
to accompany your idea,

25
00:01:17.002 --> 00:01:20.002
so that it resonates with a larger audience

26
00:01:20.002 --> 00:01:22.001
and it's easier for others

27
00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:25.003
to understand what you're proposing.

28
00:01:25.003 --> 00:01:28.009
Once you have a clear explanation of your idea

29
00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.004
and some materials that describe it,

30
00:01:31.004 --> 00:01:33.008
find a team member that you work well with

31
00:01:33.008 --> 00:01:36.007
and informally run it by them.

32
00:01:36.007 --> 00:01:39.005
First, you'll want to explain the approach to them

33
00:01:39.005 --> 00:01:42.004
and educate them on why it's beneficial.

34
00:01:42.004 --> 00:01:44.001
Then go into listening mode

35
00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:47.002
and pay close attention to their feedback.

36
00:01:47.002 --> 00:01:49.009
They might springboard off your original idea

37
00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:54.006
to strengthen it, or point out concerns with the approach.

38
00:01:54.006 --> 00:01:57.003
This feedback is incredibly valuable

39
00:01:57.003 --> 00:02:01.002
for building upon your original idea, strengthening it,

40
00:02:01.002 --> 00:02:05.004
and discovering some benefits you might not have thought of.

41
00:02:05.004 --> 00:02:07.007
If you can incorporate a few of your teammates'

42
00:02:07.007 --> 00:02:11.008
stronger ideas, you'll be more likely to have their support

43
00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:15.005
when you start to share it with the wider group.

44
00:02:15.005 --> 00:02:17.004
If you have good relationships

45
00:02:17.004 --> 00:02:19.006
with several members of your team,

46
00:02:19.006 --> 00:02:22.007
repeat this step with them to build a small coalition

47
00:02:22.007 --> 00:02:25.007
around your idea, and to get a little foresight

48
00:02:25.007 --> 00:02:28.001
into how it will be received.

49
00:02:28.001 --> 00:02:31.005
You'll then want to build a small presentation

50
00:02:31.005 --> 00:02:34.006
about your idea that educates the audience

51
00:02:34.006 --> 00:02:37.006
on the core concepts behind it.

52
00:02:37.006 --> 00:02:39.009
When crafting this presentation,

53
00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:42.006
think about what's important to your team,

54
00:02:42.006 --> 00:02:44.005
especially its leaders,

55
00:02:44.005 --> 00:02:47.009
then frame your message around these points.

56
00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:50.006
This can help build some common ground

57
00:02:50.006 --> 00:02:53.009
that gains support across your team.

58
00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:56.000
Once you've built the materials,

59
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.006
practice your delivery of the presentation

60
00:02:58.006 --> 00:03:01.001
and make sure you can articulate the key points

61
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:03.000
in a variety of ways.

62
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.006
Maybe through visuals, a quick story,

63
00:03:05.006 --> 00:03:09.002
or a small demonstration that you prototyped.

64
00:03:09.002 --> 00:03:12.006
After you're comfortable with the presentation,

65
00:03:12.006 --> 00:03:14.002
carve out a convenient time

66
00:03:14.002 --> 00:03:17.005
to discuss the information as a group.

67
00:03:17.005 --> 00:03:19.009
Give your audience a bit of advanced notice

68
00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:22.004
on the topic you intend to discuss,

69
00:03:22.004 --> 00:03:25.003
so that nobody in the discussion is blindsided

70
00:03:25.003 --> 00:03:27.003
by your recommendations.

71
00:03:27.003 --> 00:03:30.006
During the discussion, clearly state your points,

72
00:03:30.006 --> 00:03:33.004
and share the information you prepared.

73
00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:37.002
If someone has concerns, don't jump to the defense

74
00:03:37.002 --> 00:03:40.009
of your idea, but work to better understand them,

75
00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:43.000
and see if they can recommend solutions

76
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.003
that address the concerns.

77
00:03:45.003 --> 00:03:48.001
Most ideas don't gain traction

78
00:03:48.001 --> 00:03:50.002
the first time they're introduced.

79
00:03:50.002 --> 00:03:53.003
So be prepared for some follow-up discussions

80
00:03:53.003 --> 00:03:57.008
where you'll need to explain the idea a few more times.

81
00:03:57.008 --> 00:04:01.003
If your team seems on the fence about your idea

82
00:04:01.003 --> 00:04:03.009
and a little reluctant to buy in,

83
00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:08.006
offer to lead a small pilot that tests out the merits of it.

84
00:04:08.006 --> 00:04:12.002
Once you get some forward momentum for your proposal,

85
00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:14.001
you'll want to make the extra effort

86
00:04:14.001 --> 00:04:18.000
to ensure it is successful, because the best selling point

87
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.001
for a new idea is a track record of success.

88
00:04:22.001 --> 00:04:24.007
Before you have that track record,

89
00:04:24.007 --> 00:04:27.006
it'll be harder to get support from your team.

90
00:04:27.006 --> 00:04:30.009
But if there's value in your idea and you can collaborate

91
00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:32.009
with your team to pull it off,

92
00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:35.002
they'll start going to you for recommendations

93
00:04:35.002 --> 00:04:37.000
in the future.
