00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:04.002
- If you're passionate about technology and love learning,

2
00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:08.003
a career in software development can be very rewarding.

3
00:00:08.003 --> 00:00:11.006
When I wrote that first line of code at the age of 14,

4
00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:14.008
I could never have imagined where it would lead.

5
00:00:14.008 --> 00:00:17.008
In my career, I've led the development of systems

6
00:00:17.008 --> 00:00:20.008
that have made real impacts on people's lives.

7
00:00:20.008 --> 00:00:22.009
I've traveled all over the country

8
00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:26.002
and met some wonderful people along the way.

9
00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:30.002
That's my story so far, and it's still being written.

10
00:00:30.002 --> 00:00:33.000
Now it's time to write yours.

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.001
In this course, I've shared the tips

12
00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:38.002
I wish I knew along the way,

13
00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:40.001
so that you can achieve your goals

14
00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:43.003
without hitting the same obstacles.

15
00:00:43.003 --> 00:00:45.009
I've saved the most important tip for last,

16
00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:49.000
and it's the key to a wonderful career.

17
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.009
You have to love to code.

18
00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:54.002
So that's it for now.

19
00:00:54.002 --> 00:00:56.005
Thanks for joining me in this course.

20
00:00:56.005 --> 00:01:00.004
Now go out, find an amazing opportunity to learn,

21
00:01:00.004 --> 00:01:04.003
grow, and contribute in the field of software development.

22
00:01:04.003 --> 00:01:08.000
I can't wait to see the impact you're going to make.
