00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.002
- There's a strong demand for software engineers

2
00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:05.008
and it's expected to keep growing.

3
00:00:05.008 --> 00:00:08.003
Between 2020 and 2030,

4
00:00:08.003 --> 00:00:13.000
the projected job growth in the field is estimated at 22%.

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.003
So there are many opportunities to enter the industry,

6
00:00:16.003 --> 00:00:19.009
build your experience and advance your skills.

7
00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.005
The salaries are enticing too.

8
00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:25.006
With the average software engineer in the United States

9
00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:28.002
making right around a $100,000

10
00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:31.006
the pay can support most lifestyles.

11
00:00:31.006 --> 00:00:35.000
Software developers also tend to have a lot of options

12
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.009
once they enter the field and gain some experience.

13
00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:41.003
From a developer role you can transition

14
00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:42.008
into specialized positions

15
00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:45.006
like mobile development, cybersecurity,

16
00:00:45.006 --> 00:00:48.003
or infrastructure engineering.

17
00:00:48.003 --> 00:00:50.006
If you're dedicated and love learning,

18
00:00:50.006 --> 00:00:52.002
there's a lot of mobility

19
00:00:52.002 --> 00:00:54.008
and you can write the script for your career,

20
00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:57.001
so that you get to work on solving problems.

21
00:00:57.001 --> 00:00:59.004
you're passionate about.

22
00:00:59.004 --> 00:01:02.002
With all this opportunity and potential,

23
00:01:02.002 --> 00:01:05.009
everyone should become a software developer, right?

24
00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:07.006
Not necessarily.

25
00:01:07.006 --> 00:01:09.008
It's not a great match for everyone

26
00:01:09.008 --> 00:01:12.008
and you don't want to invest a lot of time and resources

27
00:01:12.008 --> 00:01:16.005
into a career that isn't the right fit for you.

28
00:01:16.005 --> 00:01:19.005
So how do you know if a career in software development

29
00:01:19.005 --> 00:01:21.005
is right for you?

30
00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:24.008
Personally, I stumbled upon it by accident.

31
00:01:24.008 --> 00:01:27.003
I was always interested in technology

32
00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:30.005
but never had a real productive use for it.

33
00:01:30.005 --> 00:01:34.000
Then I took a computer programming course at my high school

34
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
where I wrote my first line of code,

35
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
which I'll never forget.

36
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.004
It immediately sparked my curiosity.

37
00:01:41.004 --> 00:01:43.003
And I started to envision myself

38
00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:45.006
building more complex applications

39
00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:48.004
that would make a difference in the world.

40
00:01:48.004 --> 00:01:49.005
At that moment

41
00:01:49.005 --> 00:01:52.009
I just knew it was what I wanted to do with my life

42
00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.000
and I had the desire to learn more.

43
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.003
That's how my journey started.

44
00:01:58.003 --> 00:02:01.004
So let's create that moment for you.

45
00:02:01.004 --> 00:02:03.009
In your web browser, navigate to Replit

46
00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.002
using the URL you see below.

47
00:02:07.002 --> 00:02:11.001
Replit is an online tool for creating small code snippets.

48
00:02:11.001 --> 00:02:14.004
And you can see I've already added a bit of JavaScript

49
00:02:14.004 --> 00:02:15.009
in the editor.

50
00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:19.004
So go ahead and type out this code,

51
00:02:19.004 --> 00:02:23.008
then execute it by hitting the green Run button,

52
00:02:23.008 --> 00:02:27.006
then over here in this black box known as the console

53
00:02:27.006 --> 00:02:29.004
it will ask for your name.

54
00:02:29.004 --> 00:02:31.008
So type it in and hit enter.

55
00:02:31.008 --> 00:02:34.003
See what happens.

56
00:02:34.003 --> 00:02:39.000
Congratulations, you just executed your first line of code.

57
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.005
Now after this video, take 15 minutes

58
00:02:42.005 --> 00:02:45.002
and run some experiments with the code.

59
00:02:45.002 --> 00:02:47.008
Read it, try to change the question

60
00:02:47.008 --> 00:02:51.003
or make it ask for your last name along with your first name

61
00:02:51.003 --> 00:02:53.004
and print it as well.

62
00:02:53.004 --> 00:02:55.006
Don't worry about getting it right.

63
00:02:55.006 --> 00:02:57.007
It's okay if something doesn't work

64
00:02:57.007 --> 00:03:01.006
and don't be afraid to use Google for some help.

65
00:03:01.006 --> 00:03:04.008
Once you've done that, just stop watching this course

66
00:03:04.008 --> 00:03:07.004
and go about the rest of your day.

67
00:03:07.004 --> 00:03:11.008
Then tomorrow set aside some time to do some reflection

68
00:03:11.008 --> 00:03:16.003
ask yourself if you're still curious about that experience.

69
00:03:16.003 --> 00:03:17.009
Did it get you excited?

70
00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:21.006
Was it in the back of your mind for the rest of the day?

71
00:03:21.006 --> 00:03:26.007
Maybe it was difficult, but were you drawn to the challenge?

72
00:03:26.007 --> 00:03:28.009
If you just have to know more

73
00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:32.000
and you're excited to create something more advanced,

74
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.006
come back to this course

75
00:03:33.006 --> 00:03:37.000
and I'll show you where to begin a career in code.
