00:00:00.002 --> 00:00:02.004
- If your goal is to advance

2
00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:04.006
to higher level technical positions,

3
00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:08.009
like senior developer, team lead, or software architect,

4
00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:11.009
there are some essential technical skills and knowledge

5
00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:16.003
you should begin to develop early on in your career.

6
00:00:16.003 --> 00:00:18.002
Building your knowledge of these areas

7
00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:21.002
will prepare you to lead the design and delivery

8
00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:24.000
of entire systems that solve the complex

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
type of problems you'll face in these roles.

10
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.005
So let's talk through some of these,

11
00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:33.002
starting with the practices that teams use

12
00:00:33.002 --> 00:00:36.002
to develop and deliver software.

13
00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:39.000
As a team lead, one of your responsibilities

14
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.005
will be building efficient software developer processes

15
00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:44.008
that allow your team to deliver changes

16
00:00:44.008 --> 00:00:48.003
to your software product at a steady pace.

17
00:00:48.003 --> 00:00:52.008
That starts with establishing and continuously improving

18
00:00:52.008 --> 00:00:56.006
upon a development methodology that your team uses

19
00:00:56.006 --> 00:01:00.001
to collaborate and complete its work.

20
00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:03.008
Today, most teams have structured their development efforts

21
00:01:03.008 --> 00:01:07.007
around agile frameworks, and have adopted the philosophies

22
00:01:07.007 --> 00:01:10.002
and practices behind DevOps

23
00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:13.006
to ship and operate their software.

24
00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:16.004
DevOps principles recommend that you automate

25
00:01:16.004 --> 00:01:20.001
as much as your software delivery process as possible.

26
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:22.000
This is achieved through the practices

27
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.004
of continuous integration and continuous delivery.

28
00:01:26.004 --> 00:01:28.008
There are many tools and platforms

29
00:01:28.008 --> 00:01:32.008
that can be combined together to form a CI/CD pipeline,

30
00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:35.001
which can consistently repeat the steps

31
00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:39.006
necessary to build, test, and deploy your software.

32
00:01:39.006 --> 00:01:43.001
Understanding the end-to-end delivery process

33
00:01:43.001 --> 00:01:46.004
for delivering software will allow you to configure

34
00:01:46.004 --> 00:01:49.000
pipelines for new system components

35
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.001
and resolve issues that might appear in existing pipelines.

36
00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:55.006
That way, your team can always maintain

37
00:01:55.006 --> 00:01:58.000
a steady flow of work.

38
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.008
So that brings us to some other types of platforms

39
00:02:01.008 --> 00:02:03.009
that are used to run your software

40
00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.003
and handle specialized concerns

41
00:02:06.003 --> 00:02:11.008
like data exchange, security, scaling, and resiliency.

42
00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:14.005
To build modern information systems,

43
00:02:14.005 --> 00:02:18.002
you'll need to understand when to use these platforms

44
00:02:18.002 --> 00:02:20.008
and how they fit into the architecture

45
00:02:20.008 --> 00:02:23.006
of a well designed system.

46
00:02:23.006 --> 00:02:25.005
When designing any system,

47
00:02:25.005 --> 00:02:29.007
it's essential to understand the end-to-end flow of data,

48
00:02:29.007 --> 00:02:32.003
which may involve many platforms

49
00:02:32.003 --> 00:02:38.000
like API gateways, distributed caches, or event streams.

50
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.008
As data flows through these components,

51
00:02:40.008 --> 00:02:44.007
you'll need to ensure that it's exchanged securely

52
00:02:44.007 --> 00:02:47.000
and that user facing components are accessible

53
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
only to authorized end users.

54
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.002
To establish these secure connections,

55
00:02:53.002 --> 00:02:56.005
you'll need to understand how security platforms,

56
00:02:56.005 --> 00:03:00.004
like identity management servers, fit into the picture,

57
00:03:00.004 --> 00:03:04.001
and the advanced security schemes they provide,

58
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:07.006
like OAuth 2.0 and token-based security.

59
00:03:07.006 --> 00:03:11.002
You won't need to code out these security capabilities,

60
00:03:11.002 --> 00:03:13.007
and believe me, you don't want to.

61
00:03:13.007 --> 00:03:16.005
But you'll need to learn how to integrate with

62
00:03:16.005 --> 00:03:21.007
or configure the security services these platforms provide.

63
00:03:21.007 --> 00:03:24.006
Container-based technologies are another set

64
00:03:24.006 --> 00:03:28.009
of popular platforms that have emerged over the past decade.

65
00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:33.002
They've changed how we run and operate software.

66
00:03:33.002 --> 00:03:37.005
This is a very deep space, but if you can grasp the basics

67
00:03:37.005 --> 00:03:41.008
of how to run an application or services within a container

68
00:03:41.008 --> 00:03:45.000
on a container orchestrator like Kubernetes,

69
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
your app will benefit from the scalability, portability,

70
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.004
and resiliency that's delivered by this approach.

71
00:03:53.004 --> 00:03:56.000
Packaging applications in containers

72
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.003
also makes them easier to transition to the cloud,

73
00:03:59.003 --> 00:04:02.001
where you'll find other services that can be used

74
00:04:02.001 --> 00:04:05.000
to architect modern applications.

75
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.004
Many organizations turn to cloud platforms

76
00:04:08.004 --> 00:04:11.009
to run their systems on elastic infrastructure

77
00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:14.006
that provision within seconds.

78
00:04:14.006 --> 00:04:17.001
There's also a host of different platforms

79
00:04:17.001 --> 00:04:19.004
offered as a service that you can use

80
00:04:19.004 --> 00:04:22.005
to architect your application.

81
00:04:22.005 --> 00:04:24.004
Speaking of architecture,

82
00:04:24.004 --> 00:04:27.006
it's another important area to study.

83
00:04:27.006 --> 00:04:31.000
Architectures are common structures or patterns

84
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.003
for how the different components in a system are laid out.

85
00:04:35.003 --> 00:04:38.002
These are some common architectures and patterns

86
00:04:38.002 --> 00:04:42.001
that are frequently used to design modern systems.

87
00:04:42.001 --> 00:04:44.004
I won't go into the details of each one,

88
00:04:44.004 --> 00:04:47.000
but you'll benefit from having a high level knowledge

89
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.004
of each of them.

90
00:04:48.004 --> 00:04:52.002
Don't be intimidated by the sheer number of technologies

91
00:04:52.002 --> 00:04:54.009
and concepts that I've presented for you to learn

92
00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:57.001
to advance your career.

93
00:04:57.001 --> 00:05:00.004
Software engineers spend years and decades

94
00:05:00.004 --> 00:05:02.006
learning about these technologies.

95
00:05:02.006 --> 00:05:06.004
So it's not something you need to learn overnight.

96
00:05:06.004 --> 00:05:09.002
Prioritize the areas that are most relevant

97
00:05:09.002 --> 00:05:13.008
for your current role, and that your company uses the most.

98
00:05:13.008 --> 00:05:17.007
At the same time, continue to develop your coding skills.

99
00:05:17.007 --> 00:05:19.004
Then if you have spare time,

100
00:05:19.004 --> 00:05:21.008
interweave the topics that are less relevant

101
00:05:21.008 --> 00:05:24.007
to your situation into your studies.

102
00:05:24.007 --> 00:05:26.006
If you start early,

103
00:05:26.006 --> 00:05:29.009
you'll slowly build out your knowledge of each area,

104
00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:32.002
and be positioned for opportunities

105
00:05:32.002 --> 00:05:36.000
to advance your career as they arise.
