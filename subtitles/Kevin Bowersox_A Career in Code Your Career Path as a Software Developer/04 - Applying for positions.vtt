00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.004
- Once you've prepared your resume,

2
00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:05.000
it's time to start applying to positions

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.004
that match your criteria.

4
00:00:07.004 --> 00:00:10.008
When you apply to a position at larger companies,

5
00:00:10.008 --> 00:00:12.007
your resume will join a pool

6
00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:15.003
of all the other applicants' resumes

7
00:00:15.003 --> 00:00:18.002
in the employer's applicant tracking system,

8
00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:21.008
which helps automate the hiring process.

9
00:00:21.008 --> 00:00:24.000
For the most attractive positions,

10
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.002
there can be hundreds of applicants,

11
00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:30.003
so the applicant tracking system uses keyword matching

12
00:00:30.003 --> 00:00:33.006
and other algorithms to filter down the pool

13
00:00:33.006 --> 00:00:37.008
to what it believes are the most qualified candidates.

14
00:00:37.008 --> 00:00:41.007
It's important to build your resume and application

15
00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:43.008
in a way that gives you the best chances

16
00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:47.009
of making its way past this first automated screen,

17
00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:50.005
so that way, your resume will be reviewed

18
00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:53.000
by a human recruiter.

19
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.004
There are three things you should keep in mind

20
00:00:55.004 --> 00:00:57.006
that will increase your odds of advancing

21
00:00:57.006 --> 00:01:00.003
past this initial screen.

22
00:01:00.003 --> 00:01:03.000
First, make sure you've tailored your resume

23
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.003
to highlight your qualifications

24
00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:09.005
which match those listed in the job description.

25
00:01:09.005 --> 00:01:11.006
The wording in the job description

26
00:01:11.006 --> 00:01:13.007
is the best insight you have

27
00:01:13.007 --> 00:01:18.005
into the criteria being used to screen your submission.

28
00:01:18.005 --> 00:01:21.006
Second, make sure your resume is optimized

29
00:01:21.006 --> 00:01:23.008
to be read by a computer.

30
00:01:23.008 --> 00:01:25.009
You'll want to stick to standard fonts

31
00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.007
and file formats, like DOCX or PDF.

32
00:01:29.007 --> 00:01:32.004
In some cases, employers will specify

33
00:01:32.004 --> 00:01:36.002
a preferred file format, so in those situations,

34
00:01:36.002 --> 00:01:39.006
you'll want to stick with what they suggest.

35
00:01:39.006 --> 00:01:43.007
Avoiding complex table layouts, columns, and graphics

36
00:01:43.007 --> 00:01:46.006
will help ensure there are no technical problems

37
00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:51.004
when the applicant tracking system scans your resume.

38
00:01:51.004 --> 00:01:54.002
Some application systems will require you

39
00:01:54.002 --> 00:01:57.004
to complete forms that collect your work experience,

40
00:01:57.004 --> 00:02:01.007
education, and skills, which might seem a little redundant

41
00:02:01.007 --> 00:02:05.003
since this information should be in your resume.

42
00:02:05.003 --> 00:02:08.001
To make it easier to complete these forms,

43
00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:11.000
I recommend storing the contents of your resume

44
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.009
in a plain text format

45
00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:17.004
that you can easily copy and paste the information from.

46
00:02:17.004 --> 00:02:19.004
Pay close attention to systems

47
00:02:19.004 --> 00:02:21.007
that automatically parse your resume

48
00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:25.002
and attempt to auto complete these forms.

49
00:02:25.002 --> 00:02:28.006
If the transcription of your resume's information

50
00:02:28.006 --> 00:02:32.002
is way out of sync, it can be an early indicator

51
00:02:32.002 --> 00:02:35.000
that there may be problems when your resume

52
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.007
is automatically screened or reviewed by a recruiter.

53
00:02:39.007 --> 00:02:42.000
If you're able to identify the recruiter

54
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.005
from the job posting,

55
00:02:43.005 --> 00:02:46.005
you can send a short note expressing your interest

56
00:02:46.005 --> 00:02:49.003
and excitement about the position.

57
00:02:49.003 --> 00:02:51.004
This can help you stand out later

58
00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:54.003
when the recruiter is reviewing the applications

59
00:02:54.003 --> 00:02:57.008
that advance through the initial screen.

60
00:02:57.008 --> 00:03:00.005
Applying to positions can be time consuming

61
00:03:00.005 --> 00:03:03.004
and you'll need to balance it with your learning plan

62
00:03:03.004 --> 00:03:06.001
and other responsibilities.

63
00:03:06.001 --> 00:03:08.003
So when you're at this stage,

64
00:03:08.003 --> 00:03:11.003
you'll want to schedule a dedicated block of time

65
00:03:11.003 --> 00:03:15.004
for submitting applications and establish a realistic goal

66
00:03:15.004 --> 00:03:19.002
for the number you plan to submit each week.

67
00:03:19.002 --> 00:03:22.006
This will help you pace yourself, avoid burnout,

68
00:03:22.006 --> 00:03:24.008
and allow you to cast a wide net

69
00:03:24.008 --> 00:03:28.005
that increases your odds of getting an interview.

70
00:03:28.005 --> 00:03:31.001
To make the process more enjoyable,

71
00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:33.008
do a bit of daydreaming with each submission

72
00:03:33.008 --> 00:03:37.003
about what it might be like if you got it.

73
00:03:37.003 --> 00:03:40.002
Be prepared to handle a little rejection,

74
00:03:40.002 --> 00:03:43.006
because not every submission will be successful.

75
00:03:43.006 --> 00:03:45.005
It's just part of the process

76
00:03:45.005 --> 00:03:49.001
and you can't get discouraged over each submission.

77
00:03:49.001 --> 00:03:51.008
When you finally land that right position,

78
00:03:51.008 --> 00:03:54.007
you may even be grateful that you were passed over

79
00:03:54.007 --> 00:03:58.000
for some of the earlier ones that you applied to.
