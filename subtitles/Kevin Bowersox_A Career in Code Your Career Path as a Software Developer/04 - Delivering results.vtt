00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.000
- Leaders are accountable

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.003
for making their software development teams successful

3
00:00:05.003 --> 00:00:08.006
in delivering results for their business.

4
00:00:08.006 --> 00:00:11.006
When the business brings a new idea or challenge

5
00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:12.007
to your team,

6
00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:15.007
there are several steps you can take as a leader

7
00:00:15.007 --> 00:00:18.008
to set your team up for success.

8
00:00:18.008 --> 00:00:21.007
If you haven't worked with a business partner before,

9
00:00:21.007 --> 00:00:23.001
it's important to start out

10
00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:26.006
with what I call onboarding the customer.

11
00:00:26.006 --> 00:00:28.000
It's a set of activities

12
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.001
you'll complete with the business partner

13
00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:33.000
to determine how you'll collaborate on the product

14
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.005
your team is developing.

15
00:00:35.005 --> 00:00:36.009
To kick things off,

16
00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:40.000
you'll want to educate them on key agile concepts

17
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.007
like iterative development, the backlog, sprints,

18
00:00:43.007 --> 00:00:46.002
and a minimal viable product.

19
00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:49.006
Then, explain their role in the agile ceremonies

20
00:00:49.006 --> 00:00:52.007
where you'll need their participation.

21
00:00:52.007 --> 00:00:55.000
During this time, you'll want to agree upon

22
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.007
how you'll work together and gain commitments

23
00:00:57.007 --> 00:01:00.004
that key business partners will be available

24
00:01:00.004 --> 00:01:04.001
for conversations regarding their product.

25
00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:06.007
This helps ensure your team has access

26
00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:09.005
to the right people who can provide feedback

27
00:01:09.005 --> 00:01:13.008
that prevents your team from building the wrong product.

28
00:01:13.008 --> 00:01:16.003
Once you've obtained these commitments,

29
00:01:16.003 --> 00:01:18.005
you'll need to begin working closely

30
00:01:18.005 --> 00:01:20.001
with your business partner,

31
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:22.003
to develop a firm understanding

32
00:01:22.003 --> 00:01:24.004
of what they'd like to achieve

33
00:01:24.004 --> 00:01:28.003
and the results they're looking to produce.

34
00:01:28.003 --> 00:01:30.002
In these early stages,

35
00:01:30.002 --> 00:01:33.007
it's important to include key members from your team,

36
00:01:33.007 --> 00:01:37.002
so they can hear these conversations firsthand

37
00:01:37.002 --> 00:01:40.005
and begin to build the business acumen necessary

38
00:01:40.005 --> 00:01:43.002
to achieve the goal.

39
00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:45.008
As you discuss the primary capabilities

40
00:01:45.008 --> 00:01:47.009
required by the software,

41
00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.008
take notes and pay attention

42
00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:52.000
to other qualities of the system,

43
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.007
such as performance or availability requirements

44
00:01:55.007 --> 00:01:59.009
that might influence the system's architecture.

45
00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.008
Once you have a good understanding

46
00:02:01.008 --> 00:02:04.001
of what an MVP looks like,

47
00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:05.009
start to do some planning

48
00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.006
about how you'll go about delivering it with the team.

49
00:02:09.006 --> 00:02:13.001
Here, you'll want to create drafts of a rough schedule,

50
00:02:13.001 --> 00:02:16.005
a product roadmap, an architecture document,

51
00:02:16.005 --> 00:02:21.001
and a list of the potential technologies in the stack.

52
00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:22.007
You'll want to work with the team

53
00:02:22.007 --> 00:02:25.007
to evaluate and select the best technologies

54
00:02:25.007 --> 00:02:27.009
for the solution.

55
00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:31.002
Technology selection is very important.

56
00:02:31.002 --> 00:02:34.001
So, you might want to invest a few cycles

57
00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:39.004
in building small prototypes before you land on a stack.

58
00:02:39.004 --> 00:02:41.005
Next, you'll want to evaluate

59
00:02:41.005 --> 00:02:46.008
whether the team has the capability and capacity to deliver.

60
00:02:46.008 --> 00:02:49.003
If you're missing a key skillset

61
00:02:49.003 --> 00:02:52.002
or the team is swamped with other work,

62
00:02:52.002 --> 00:02:56.001
you might need to appeal for more resources.

63
00:02:56.001 --> 00:02:57.008
Nothing is more important

64
00:02:57.008 --> 00:03:01.004
than selecting the right individual to join your team.

65
00:03:01.004 --> 00:03:03.005
So, if you need to hire,

66
00:03:03.005 --> 00:03:08.005
carefully evaluate candidates when making your selection.

67
00:03:08.005 --> 00:03:10.008
Once you have a preliminary plan,

68
00:03:10.008 --> 00:03:13.002
you'll want to share it with your business partners

69
00:03:13.002 --> 00:03:17.004
to set their expectations and get their feedback.

70
00:03:17.004 --> 00:03:20.009
Be careful not to over promise and to highlight risk

71
00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:24.002
that could cause the plan to change.

72
00:03:24.002 --> 00:03:26.001
When leading your first project,

73
00:03:26.001 --> 00:03:29.001
you'll want to closely monitor the situation

74
00:03:29.001 --> 00:03:32.001
as your team works to deliver the product,

75
00:03:32.001 --> 00:03:35.006
but be careful not to micromanage.

76
00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:36.007
Along the way,

77
00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:39.000
there's bound to be a few setbacks.

78
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.003
And, with each sprint,

79
00:03:40.003 --> 00:03:43.003
you'll receive feedback from your business partners,

80
00:03:43.003 --> 00:03:46.009
which might change the products direction.

81
00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:49.000
Evaluate these situations,

82
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.005
and if necessary, pivot, to adjust your approach.

83
00:03:53.005 --> 00:03:56.002
Always keep your business partners in the loop

84
00:03:56.002 --> 00:04:00.000
on these course corrections and the team's progress,

85
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.003
because once you earn their trust,

86
00:04:02.003 --> 00:04:04.000
it's like having a superpower

87
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.003
that will benefit you for the lifetime of your relationship.

88
00:04:08.003 --> 00:04:10.008
Getting your first win as a new leader

89
00:04:10.008 --> 00:04:13.006
is always a challenging and, sometimes,

90
00:04:13.006 --> 00:04:15.007
a nerve wracking experience,

91
00:04:15.007 --> 00:04:19.001
but these tips should help get you there.

92
00:04:19.001 --> 00:04:21.004
After you deliver that first product,

93
00:04:21.004 --> 00:04:22.007
it gets easier,

94
00:04:22.007 --> 00:04:25.006
because you'll have collected your own set of tips,

95
00:04:25.006 --> 00:04:28.001
know the key areas to focus on,

96
00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:32.000
and have the confidence from your past success.
