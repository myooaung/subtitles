00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:04.002
- Before you begin to apply to software developer positions,

2
00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:07.007
you should set aside some time over the course of a few days

3
00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:11.008
to determine what you're looking for in your career.

4
00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:14.003
One of the first decisions you'll need to make

5
00:00:14.003 --> 00:00:16.007
is whether or not you're willing to relocate

6
00:00:16.007 --> 00:00:19.000
for the right position.

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.005
More and more companies are embracing remote work.

8
00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:25.006
However, there are still many excellent positions

9
00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:28.008
that might require you to relocate.

10
00:00:28.008 --> 00:00:30.007
Once you've made this decision,

11
00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:33.006
you can start to narrow down your job search

12
00:00:33.006 --> 00:00:36.009
to the locations where you'd like to live.

13
00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:38.005
Next, you'll want to consider

14
00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:42.000
the type of experience that's right for you.

15
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.008
Maybe you're looking for a fast-paced startup

16
00:00:44.008 --> 00:00:47.001
where you'll get to try multiple roles

17
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:49.009
and have a variety of tasks,

18
00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:53.008
or you might enjoy the structure of an established company

19
00:00:53.008 --> 00:00:56.005
where you can specialize and focus deeply

20
00:00:56.005 --> 00:00:59.007
on solving a particular problem.

21
00:00:59.007 --> 00:01:03.000
Each type of company has their pros and cons.

22
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.009
Startups are exciting,

23
00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:08.008
but you may sacrifice some job stability.

24
00:01:08.008 --> 00:01:11.006
Working in a larger corporation can provide you

25
00:01:11.006 --> 00:01:15.007
with more opportunities to switch teams and projects,

26
00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:18.007
but there are often more policies and regulations

27
00:01:18.007 --> 00:01:21.005
the company has to follow.

28
00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:23.005
After you have a general idea

29
00:01:23.005 --> 00:01:26.003
about the type of company you're looking for,

30
00:01:26.003 --> 00:01:28.001
you can narrow down your search

31
00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:31.006
if there's a specific industry you want to work in.

32
00:01:31.006 --> 00:01:34.004
So if finance really interests you,

33
00:01:34.004 --> 00:01:35.007
maybe you'll start your search

34
00:01:35.007 --> 00:01:38.003
by looking for software development positions

35
00:01:38.003 --> 00:01:42.000
at large banks or a smaller FinTech company

36
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.005
if you want to work for a startup.

37
00:01:44.005 --> 00:01:47.007
Just be aware, the more criteria you add,

38
00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:50.009
the fewer opportunities that you'll find.

39
00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.006
So let's just walk through an example.

40
00:01:53.006 --> 00:01:57.002
Let's say I'm looking for the benefits of a larger company,

41
00:01:57.002 --> 00:01:59.005
I'm willing to relocate anywhere,

42
00:01:59.005 --> 00:02:03.005
and I've always wanted to work in the aerospace industry.

43
00:02:03.005 --> 00:02:06.003
That's our job search criteria.

44
00:02:06.003 --> 00:02:09.004
I might start by looking up the largest corporations

45
00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:13.006
in the aerospace industry on the Fortune 500 website,

46
00:02:13.006 --> 00:02:18.002
just to get a sense of the larger companies in the industry.

47
00:02:18.002 --> 00:02:21.003
Okay, it looks like Lockheed Martin, Boeing,

48
00:02:21.003 --> 00:02:24.007
and Raytheon are larger corporations in this industry

49
00:02:24.007 --> 00:02:27.003
at the time of this recording.

50
00:02:27.003 --> 00:02:30.004
Let's go over to the jobs section on LinkedIn

51
00:02:30.004 --> 00:02:34.009
and see what positions are open for these companies.

52
00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:37.005
I'm looking for a software development position

53
00:02:37.005 --> 00:02:40.001
and I have a bit of experience with Java,

54
00:02:40.001 --> 00:02:44.007
so I'll throw those keywords into the search.

55
00:02:44.007 --> 00:02:47.000
Now I'm going to limit the search

56
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.006
to these specific companies to see what's available.

57
00:02:50.006 --> 00:02:54.000
So first I'll enter Boeing, then Raytheon,

58
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.006
and then finally I'll enter Lockheed Martin.

59
00:02:57.006 --> 00:03:00.004
Okay, let's see what's available.

60
00:03:00.004 --> 00:03:02.004
It looks like Boeing is hiring

61
00:03:02.004 --> 00:03:07.006
for quite a few developer positions, and this one is nearby.

62
00:03:07.006 --> 00:03:10.006
Let's review this position to get a better understanding

63
00:03:10.006 --> 00:03:14.006
of what the responsibilities are, what skills are required,

64
00:03:14.006 --> 00:03:18.007
and what the company is looking for in a candidate.

65
00:03:18.007 --> 00:03:21.002
During this research, also take a look

66
00:03:21.002 --> 00:03:23.008
at the company's website to get a sense

67
00:03:23.008 --> 00:03:25.008
for what the work-life balance is

68
00:03:25.008 --> 00:03:28.002
and an understanding of their culture,

69
00:03:28.002 --> 00:03:30.000
to determine if it aligns with

70
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.008
what you're looking for in a position.

71
00:03:32.008 --> 00:03:35.009
You can also search for blogs of developers

72
00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:38.002
at the company that you can follow

73
00:03:38.002 --> 00:03:40.009
to get a sense of what the company is working on

74
00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:45.005
and maybe even establish a relationship at the company.

75
00:03:45.005 --> 00:03:47.009
When you find a position at a company

76
00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:49.009
that seems like a good fit,

77
00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:53.006
make sure you save the link to the job advertisement.

78
00:03:53.006 --> 00:03:57.005
At this point, we're just collecting potential opportunities

79
00:03:57.005 --> 00:03:59.007
and learning what companies are looking for

80
00:03:59.007 --> 00:04:03.008
in a job candidate, which will be helpful information later

81
00:04:03.008 --> 00:04:06.003
when you build out your resume.

82
00:04:06.003 --> 00:04:09.002
You don't want to place all of your chances for employment

83
00:04:09.002 --> 00:04:12.007
with one company, so you'll repeat this process

84
00:04:12.007 --> 00:04:15.002
for different companies as you establish

85
00:04:15.002 --> 00:04:19.004
and scope your search for a software development position.

86
00:04:19.004 --> 00:04:21.009
With each pass, you will get a better sense

87
00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:25.006
of different positions, companies, and industries

88
00:04:25.006 --> 00:04:30.000
as your list of potential opportunities gets larger.
