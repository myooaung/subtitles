00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.001
- An effective resume is concise.

2
00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:05.002
However, it's packed with information

3
00:00:05.002 --> 00:00:08.008
that spotlights your skills, experience, and achievements

4
00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:11.002
in a way that draws the recruiter's attention

5
00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:14.004
and gets you into an interview.

6
00:00:14.004 --> 00:00:16.004
Here are some tips that will help you write

7
00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:20.004
your first resume for a software development position.

8
00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:22.008
I recommend using a top-down approach

9
00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:25.000
when constructing your resume,

10
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.008
starting with its major sections and their layout,

11
00:00:28.008 --> 00:00:31.004
almost like you were designing a webpage.

12
00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:35.005
I typically include sections that list my experience,

13
00:00:35.005 --> 00:00:41.003
skills, education, certifications, and personal information.

14
00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:43.007
Here's a layout that you might use

15
00:00:43.007 --> 00:00:45.007
to organize these sections,

16
00:00:45.007 --> 00:00:48.001
which places the sections a recruiter will be

17
00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:51.009
most interested in towards the top.

18
00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:53.006
It starts with the bold header

19
00:00:53.006 --> 00:00:55.004
and then lists your work experience,

20
00:00:55.004 --> 00:01:00.001
followed by your education in the body of the document.

21
00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:03.009
Then in the sidebar, it adds sections for your skills,

22
00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:07.008
certifications, and contact information.

23
00:01:07.008 --> 00:01:11.001
If necessary, you can rearrange these sections

24
00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:13.004
to play to your strengths.

25
00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:17.003
For example, if your work experience is very limited,

26
00:01:17.003 --> 00:01:21.005
you might place the education section towards the top.

27
00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:23.006
Or if you don't have any certifications,

28
00:01:23.006 --> 00:01:26.005
you'd remove that section.

29
00:01:26.005 --> 00:01:29.004
Once you have the layout established,

30
00:01:29.004 --> 00:01:32.009
you can start to build out the contents of each section

31
00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.001
which should be concise, neatly organized,

32
00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:38.002
and packed with condensed information

33
00:01:38.002 --> 00:01:40.007
about your achievements.

34
00:01:40.007 --> 00:01:43.009
Here is an example of some content you might use

35
00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.003
in the work experience section.

36
00:01:46.003 --> 00:01:48.007
I won't read through each of these bullets

37
00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:52.005
but you'll notice how much information is compacted

38
00:01:52.005 --> 00:01:54.006
into each one.

39
00:01:54.006 --> 00:01:57.009
Each bullet gives a synopsis of what you did,

40
00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.000
the technologies you used to do it,

41
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.002
and a quick quantitative summary of the results.

42
00:02:04.002 --> 00:02:06.002
You'll want to use this pattern

43
00:02:06.002 --> 00:02:08.001
when crafting any bullet point

44
00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:13.006
for your resume to keep it concise, clear, and impactful.

45
00:02:13.006 --> 00:02:15.000
Write what you achieved,

46
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.001
the tools and techniques you used to do it,

47
00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:20.003
and then quantify the results,

48
00:02:20.003 --> 00:02:23.005
all using the fewest amount of words possible.

49
00:02:23.005 --> 00:02:26.009
It doesn't need to follow perfect grammar rules

50
00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:29.009
but it should communicate clearly.

51
00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:31.001
I've spent up to an hour

52
00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:34.002
just getting one bullet point perfect.

53
00:02:34.002 --> 00:02:39.004
When writing your resume, follow these three best practices.

54
00:02:39.004 --> 00:02:42.006
First, make sure you proofread it for mistakes

55
00:02:42.006 --> 00:02:44.004
multiple times.

56
00:02:44.004 --> 00:02:47.006
If possible, have someone else review it.

57
00:02:47.006 --> 00:02:50.002
You'll be using the document throughout your career

58
00:02:50.002 --> 00:02:53.005
so you want to make it the highest quality possible.

59
00:02:53.005 --> 00:02:56.006
Also, don't list anything on your resume

60
00:02:56.006 --> 00:02:59.008
that you can't speak to in an interview.

61
00:02:59.008 --> 00:03:02.008
If an interview assesses you on a technology

62
00:03:02.008 --> 00:03:04.000
listed on your resume,

63
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.001
and you're clearly not able to speak to it,

64
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:10.004
your chances of getting the position are slim.

65
00:03:10.004 --> 00:03:12.001
I've seen it happen.

66
00:03:12.001 --> 00:03:16.008
Finally, every pixel of your resume is valuable real estate

67
00:03:16.008 --> 00:03:19.001
and you have to treat it that way.

68
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:20.007
Especially the first page

69
00:03:20.007 --> 00:03:23.007
if you have a lot of job experience to list.

70
00:03:23.007 --> 00:03:27.003
You need to strategize about how to fill those pixels

71
00:03:27.003 --> 00:03:30.004
with the best content that will get you noticed

72
00:03:30.004 --> 00:03:33.004
by a recruiter and into an interview.

73
00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:37.000
Once you've built the first version of your resume,

74
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.009
it's only the beginning.

75
00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:41.002
For each position you apply to,

76
00:03:41.002 --> 00:03:42.008
you'll want to tailor it

77
00:03:42.008 --> 00:03:45.007
as much as possible to the position.

78
00:03:45.007 --> 00:03:49.007
If you're submitting resumes and not getting interviews,

79
00:03:49.007 --> 00:03:51.009
you'll want to go back to the drawing board

80
00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:55.004
and revisit your resume, starting with a clean slate.

81
00:03:55.004 --> 00:03:57.008
It can take a little trial and error

82
00:03:57.008 --> 00:04:01.009
to find the right layout and content that gets you noticed.

83
00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:05.007
And here's my final tip: set aside time each quarter

84
00:04:05.007 --> 00:04:08.009
to update your resume with what you've achieved.

85
00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:12.003
It's a great way to reflect, review your achievements,

86
00:04:12.003 --> 00:04:15.000
and it will keep your resume current.
