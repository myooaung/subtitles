00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.006
- In your first position as a software developer,

2
00:00:03.006 --> 00:00:05.004
you'll encounter some differences

3
00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:07.003
between how the workplace operates

4
00:00:07.003 --> 00:00:10.007
and what you experienced in the classroom setting

5
00:00:10.007 --> 00:00:13.009
where you developed your technical skills.

6
00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.005
These differences create a bit of a learning curve

7
00:00:16.005 --> 00:00:18.001
for software developers

8
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:21.002
entering their first work environment.

9
00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:24.005
The first major difference is how you access the tools

10
00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:28.003
and resources necessary to do your work.

11
00:00:28.003 --> 00:00:29.008
In your learning environment,

12
00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:32.004
you were able to freely install different tools

13
00:00:32.004 --> 00:00:34.004
on your personal workstation

14
00:00:34.004 --> 00:00:36.007
and establish access to resources

15
00:00:36.007 --> 00:00:40.007
like code repositories on GitHub.

16
00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:44.002
Most corporate environments will enforce security policies

17
00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:46.007
that limit the permissions on your workstation

18
00:00:46.007 --> 00:00:50.005
and that restrict your access to only the resources

19
00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:52.006
required for your position.

20
00:00:52.006 --> 00:00:55.007
It's known as least privilege.

21
00:00:55.007 --> 00:00:58.008
This means you'll need to submit requests for approval

22
00:00:58.008 --> 00:01:03.000
to install different tools or to access the code

23
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.003
or documentation for your project.

24
00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:07.007
Nobody likes to wait,

25
00:01:07.007 --> 00:01:11.004
but organizations are serious about security.

26
00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:14.004
So, quickly learn where to obtain the resources

27
00:01:14.004 --> 00:01:16.002
you need to perform your work

28
00:01:16.002 --> 00:01:20.000
and how the approvals are granted.

29
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
How you contribute source code to your team's project

30
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.009
will also look a bit different.

31
00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.004
Teams normally establish a workflow

32
00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:30.002
that prevents commits directly against

33
00:01:30.002 --> 00:01:32.006
a source code repository.

34
00:01:32.006 --> 00:01:35.000
You'll need to learn this workflow,

35
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.006
which will likely involve submitting poll requests

36
00:01:37.006 --> 00:01:40.001
against a shared branch of the code,

37
00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:42.006
which will then be subjected to a code review

38
00:01:42.006 --> 00:01:45.006
by a peer prior to being merged.

39
00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:47.009
Don't take a code review personally.

40
00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.006
It's a best practice

41
00:01:49.006 --> 00:01:52.004
that will give you the opportunity to collaborate with

42
00:01:52.004 --> 00:01:55.008
and learn from the other members of your team.

43
00:01:55.008 --> 00:01:57.008
On advanced teams,

44
00:01:57.008 --> 00:02:00.004
automated builds will be used to compile,

45
00:02:00.004 --> 00:02:03.000
test and verify your source code

46
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.002
once it's merged into a shared branch in the repository.

47
00:02:07.002 --> 00:02:08.006
While learning to code,

48
00:02:08.006 --> 00:02:10.007
it's likely that you were not writing tests

49
00:02:10.007 --> 00:02:12.009
for your small, personal projects.

50
00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:15.002
So, you'll need to become familiar

51
00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:16.007
with the testing frameworks

52
00:02:16.007 --> 00:02:19.009
for the language used in your workplace.

53
00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:22.004
If the automated test do not pass

54
00:02:22.004 --> 00:02:25.006
or your code doesn't meet the quality standards

55
00:02:25.006 --> 00:02:27.005
during the automated build,

56
00:02:27.005 --> 00:02:29.006
you'll need to revisit your source code

57
00:02:29.006 --> 00:02:31.007
before it's released.

58
00:02:31.007 --> 00:02:35.000
One way to avoid this is to run the test locally

59
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.009
on your machine before committing your source code

60
00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:41.003
to the shared repository to be released.

61
00:02:41.003 --> 00:02:44.008
That's another area where the workplace is different.

62
00:02:44.008 --> 00:02:46.001
In the workplace,

63
00:02:46.001 --> 00:02:48.000
your code changes will be promoted

64
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.004
through multiple environments.

65
00:02:50.004 --> 00:02:52.000
Normally, the first release

66
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.004
is to the development environment,

67
00:02:54.004 --> 00:02:57.006
which is like a test lab for the development team

68
00:02:57.006 --> 00:03:01.000
to try and experiment with new ideas.

69
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
If everything looks good in development,

70
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.006
the changes are promoted to a user acceptance testing,

71
00:03:07.006 --> 00:03:09.004
or staging environment,

72
00:03:09.004 --> 00:03:13.008
where business users verify the changes to the system.

73
00:03:13.008 --> 00:03:17.002
Once those changes are approved for release,

74
00:03:17.002 --> 00:03:19.006
they will be shipped to the production environment

75
00:03:19.006 --> 00:03:21.002
where the live product runs

76
00:03:21.002 --> 00:03:24.006
and actual users work in the system.

77
00:03:24.006 --> 00:03:27.002
This is typically done through automation

78
00:03:27.002 --> 00:03:29.007
or manually by a senior developer.

79
00:03:29.007 --> 00:03:31.002
As a best practice,

80
00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:34.000
most companies will restrict access

81
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.003
to this environment to prevent any mishaps

82
00:03:36.003 --> 00:03:39.008
that could cause an outage or data corruption.

83
00:03:39.008 --> 00:03:42.002
If you find yourself in a company

84
00:03:42.002 --> 00:03:45.002
that does grant production access to developers,

85
00:03:45.002 --> 00:03:48.007
always be incredibly careful in this environment

86
00:03:48.007 --> 00:03:51.004
and work within an experienced developer

87
00:03:51.004 --> 00:03:55.001
until you're comfortable operating independently.

88
00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:57.002
I can't emphasize this enough.

89
00:03:57.002 --> 00:03:58.006
Be careful here.

90
00:03:58.006 --> 00:04:00.002
A major mistake in production

91
00:04:00.002 --> 00:04:04.003
can unfortunately lead to your dismissal.

92
00:04:04.003 --> 00:04:06.004
Being aware of these differences

93
00:04:06.004 --> 00:04:09.004
between the work environment and the classroom,

94
00:04:09.004 --> 00:04:12.006
helps you know what to expect in your first position

95
00:04:12.006 --> 00:04:14.005
and can help you guard against

96
00:04:14.005 --> 00:04:19.000
making any major mistakes as you gain more experience.
