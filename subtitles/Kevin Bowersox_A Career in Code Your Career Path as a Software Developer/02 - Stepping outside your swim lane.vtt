00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:01.008
- One of the best parts

2
00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:04.000
about being a software developer

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.002
is that you'll frequently get the opportunity

4
00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:09.006
to step outside your formal job description.

5
00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:13.001
These experiences can help grow your technical,

6
00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:15.009
communication and leadership skills

7
00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:19.008
by exposing you to new areas and new people.

8
00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:22.008
So, let's talk out some common situations

9
00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:24.005
that might create the opportunity

10
00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:28.009
for you to step up and stand out.

11
00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.002
In every team and organization,

12
00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:34.005
there will be some churn where people leave their team

13
00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:36.002
for a new position.

14
00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:38.009
It can take a while to backfill a position.

15
00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:42.006
So, until someone new is brought on board,

16
00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:45.004
this period can be an opportunity for you

17
00:00:45.004 --> 00:00:47.007
to fill a need for your team

18
00:00:47.007 --> 00:00:50.003
and to test drive a different role

19
00:00:50.003 --> 00:00:53.002
where you'll gain additional experience.

20
00:00:53.002 --> 00:00:55.004
So, let's say that Jane,

21
00:00:55.004 --> 00:00:58.006
who always took the lead on data modeling,

22
00:00:58.006 --> 00:01:01.006
gets promoted to a new position.

23
00:01:01.006 --> 00:01:03.004
You might approach your team lead

24
00:01:03.004 --> 00:01:06.004
about stepping up to lead the database design

25
00:01:06.004 --> 00:01:09.003
that Jane was working on for that new service

26
00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:11.000
your team is building.

27
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.009
Just make sure you're confident

28
00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.008
you can take on and complete what you propose.

29
00:01:16.008 --> 00:01:19.003
If you can explain to your team lead

30
00:01:19.003 --> 00:01:22.002
a bit about your plan to take on the extra work

31
00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:24.000
and have a strong track record,

32
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.005
they'll probably appreciate your offer

33
00:01:26.005 --> 00:01:29.009
to solve part of their new staffing problem.

34
00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.001
If you do well with the new task,

35
00:01:32.001 --> 00:01:36.000
you might even find that it becomes a part of your new role.

36
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.007
Another situation where you can step outside your swim lane,

37
00:01:39.007 --> 00:01:42.004
is when nobody is familiar with a new technology

38
00:01:42.004 --> 00:01:44.005
the team needs to leverage.

39
00:01:44.005 --> 00:01:48.003
Let's say your team needs to work with a new Azure service,

40
00:01:48.003 --> 00:01:51.000
but nobody's even heard of it before.

41
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.003
Do a quick round of research on the service

42
00:01:54.003 --> 00:01:57.000
to see if you're comfortable taking on the work.

43
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.003
And if so, offer to take the lead,

44
00:02:00.003 --> 00:02:03.001
In these situations, it can also be good

45
00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:05.006
to if a teammate is willing to partner with you

46
00:02:05.006 --> 00:02:07.006
on solving the problem,

47
00:02:07.006 --> 00:02:09.005
That way, you can divide the work

48
00:02:09.005 --> 00:02:11.008
and have two individuals on the team

49
00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:14.000
familiar with the solution.

50
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.007
In my opinion, these are the best situations to step up

51
00:02:18.007 --> 00:02:20.004
because you'll learn new skills

52
00:02:20.004 --> 00:02:23.003
while solving a major problem for your team.

53
00:02:23.003 --> 00:02:25.001
It's a win-win.

54
00:02:25.001 --> 00:02:26.009
A similar scenario

55
00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:30.003
is when nobody wants to complete a particular task.

56
00:02:30.003 --> 00:02:33.007
Often these are the less glamorous tasks

57
00:02:33.007 --> 00:02:37.003
that might be tedious and a bit mundane.

58
00:02:37.003 --> 00:02:39.008
Sometimes your team members might even think

59
00:02:39.008 --> 00:02:41.004
the work is beneath them,

60
00:02:41.004 --> 00:02:44.008
which is never a great way to approach it.

61
00:02:44.008 --> 00:02:49.001
While you don't want to take on every task of this nature,

62
00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:51.009
your leadership will appreciate your willingness

63
00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:56.000
to step up to the plate when nobody else will.

64
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.008
Great software developers are always looking

65
00:02:58.008 --> 00:03:00.005
for new things to explore,

66
00:03:00.005 --> 00:03:04.001
so they can grow and advance to the next level.

67
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:08.000
If you take the initiative to help your team in a pinch,

68
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.009
you'll grow tremendously in the process

69
00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:13.001
and get to work with new individuals

70
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:15.003
across your organization,

71
00:03:15.003 --> 00:03:19.000
which positions you for the next step in your career.

72
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.006
So, always keep on the lookout for these opportunities

73
00:03:22.006 --> 00:03:24.009
because they're career accelerators

74
00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:29.000
that build your skills, resume, and reputation.
