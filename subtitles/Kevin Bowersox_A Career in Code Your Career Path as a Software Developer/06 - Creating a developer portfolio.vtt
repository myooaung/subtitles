00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.009
- While progressing through your learning goals,

2
00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:04.006
you'll start to build a collection

3
00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:06.005
of notes, examples, and projects

4
00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:10.000
as you explore each new technology.

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.008
Throughout my career,

6
00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:14.001
I found it helpful to save these artifacts

7
00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:17.000
as part of my developer notebook.

8
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.004
It's my own specialized knowledge base

9
00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:21.006
where I write down key concepts

10
00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:24.006
in my own words and store the code examples

11
00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:27.002
I've used to explore them.

12
00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:30.003
A developer notebook is a great way to capture

13
00:00:30.003 --> 00:00:33.004
that mental map of concepts and resources we talked

14
00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:37.001
about earlier in the course, and you'll thank yourself

15
00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:40.004
as you leverage it throughout your career.

16
00:00:40.004 --> 00:00:43.008
There are two parts to my developer notebook.

17
00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:45.002
First are the code examples

18
00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:48.006
in projects that I store on GitHub.

19
00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:51.007
GitHub is a free source code management system

20
00:00:51.007 --> 00:00:54.008
that is widely used by developers.

21
00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:56.009
I store these code examples

22
00:00:56.009 --> 00:01:01.002
in private repositories that only I can access.

23
00:01:01.002 --> 00:01:03.004
That way, they're not publicly visible,

24
00:01:03.004 --> 00:01:07.002
but I have them to expand upon and reference.

25
00:01:07.002 --> 00:01:11.000
Then, I also maintain my own private Confluence site

26
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.009
to store all of my notes

27
00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.009
as I learn and work through new concepts.

28
00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:17.005
Within these notes,

29
00:01:17.005 --> 00:01:21.002
I often link back to the code examples in GitHub.

30
00:01:21.002 --> 00:01:23.007
You can use any tool here.

31
00:01:23.007 --> 00:01:26.002
Something like a private SharePoint site

32
00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:28.008
or OneNote might work best for you.

33
00:01:28.008 --> 00:01:30.000
Just make sure

34
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.004
that whatever tool you choose provides a feature

35
00:01:32.004 --> 00:01:34.001
that allows you to organize

36
00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:37.002
and search the information you collect,

37
00:01:37.002 --> 00:01:39.007
and that you'll own it forever.

38
00:01:39.007 --> 00:01:42.005
You can see those were a little messy,

39
00:01:42.005 --> 00:01:45.006
but they're just for me to reference and work with.

40
00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:48.002
From the projects in your notebook,

41
00:01:48.002 --> 00:01:49.006
you'll want to select a few

42
00:01:49.006 --> 00:01:52.008
that you can use to publicly showcase your work

43
00:01:52.008 --> 00:01:55.004
and demonstrate your technical skills

44
00:01:55.004 --> 00:01:59.005
with potential employers in a developer portfolio.

45
00:01:59.005 --> 00:02:01.009
Just remember that everything you share

46
00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.000
through your portfolio should be nicely packaged

47
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.008
and be of semi-professional quality,

48
00:02:07.008 --> 00:02:11.007
because it might be reviewed by a potential employer.

49
00:02:11.007 --> 00:02:14.008
So you need to put a little bit of extra work

50
00:02:14.008 --> 00:02:17.003
into the projects that you choose to spotlight

51
00:02:17.003 --> 00:02:20.000
in your portfolio.

52
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.006
A great way to share these projects

53
00:02:21.006 --> 00:02:25.002
is through a personal blog that gathers them together

54
00:02:25.002 --> 00:02:27.002
within a portfolio section.

55
00:02:27.002 --> 00:02:31.006
That's why I recommend making your own small blog

56
00:02:31.006 --> 00:02:34.001
as one of your first projects.

57
00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:36.009
Inside of the blog's portfolio section,

58
00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:41.007
you can list each project and a small description about it.

59
00:02:41.007 --> 00:02:43.006
Then for each project,

60
00:02:43.006 --> 00:02:46.002
you can include a link to its source code,

61
00:02:46.002 --> 00:02:48.002
which is publicly shared on GitHub,

62
00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:52.009
and a link to the actual project if it's web based.

63
00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:55.003
As you build out the projects

64
00:02:55.003 --> 00:02:58.004
for your portfolio, you can take it a step further

65
00:02:58.004 --> 00:03:01.002
and author small articles for your blog

66
00:03:01.002 --> 00:03:04.009
that capture and demonstrate what you learned.

67
00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:07.003
If you take this approach, you'll amass

68
00:03:07.003 --> 00:03:10.008
a wonderful portfolio throughout your career

69
00:03:10.008 --> 00:03:13.001
that features examples of your work explained

70
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:16.004
with articles that showcase your expertise

71
00:03:16.004 --> 00:03:19.002
on different technical topics.

72
00:03:19.002 --> 00:03:23.002
Having this portfolio can be a differentiator

73
00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:25.006
when you start applying for positions,

74
00:03:25.006 --> 00:03:27.006
especially the first one,

75
00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:30.004
because it demonstrates some experience at a point

76
00:03:30.004 --> 00:03:34.003
when you might not have an extensive work history.

77
00:03:34.003 --> 00:03:37.005
So, get started on your portfolio early.

78
00:03:37.005 --> 00:03:40.004
It's a great way to reuse those projects you create

79
00:03:40.004 --> 00:03:41.003
while learning

80
00:03:41.003 --> 00:03:45.000
to code that will make you stand out with employers.
