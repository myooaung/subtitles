00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.001
- Software development is a deep space

2
00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:06.002
that can get complicated really quickly.

3
00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:07.009
Especially when starting out,

4
00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.003
it's easy to get off track and feel discouraged,

5
00:00:11.003 --> 00:00:14.004
like you're not making any progress.

6
00:00:14.004 --> 00:00:17.009
Having a detailed learning plan will help you avoid that

7
00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:22.000
and keep you on the right track to achieve your goals.

8
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.004
A good plan defines and schedules each step

9
00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:26.004
in your progression

10
00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:29.006
towards completing one of your short-term goals,

11
00:00:29.006 --> 00:00:33.000
almost like a teacher's lesson plan.

12
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.003
To build a plan,

13
00:00:34.003 --> 00:00:38.007
start out by assessing what resources you have available.

14
00:00:38.007 --> 00:00:42.002
The most important of those resources is time.

15
00:00:42.002 --> 00:00:46.004
So, you'll first need to determine how many hours each week

16
00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:49.008
that you can devote to learning how to code.

17
00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:54.007
Initially, I'd recommend carving out between 10 and 15 hours

18
00:00:54.007 --> 00:00:59.002
which gives you 1 1/2 to two hours each day for learning.

19
00:00:59.002 --> 00:01:02.005
But it has to fit your schedule.

20
00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:04.006
Make sure it's a realistic estimate

21
00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:07.003
that accounts for other commitments in your life

22
00:01:07.003 --> 00:01:10.001
like school or work.

23
00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:13.007
Next, you'll want to take a look at what you already know

24
00:01:13.007 --> 00:01:18.008
and what resources you can use to support your learning.

25
00:01:18.008 --> 00:01:21.001
If you've studied a technology before,

26
00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:23.004
decide whether you need to visit it

27
00:01:23.004 --> 00:01:27.006
or if your current knowledge of the topic is sufficient.

28
00:01:27.006 --> 00:01:31.005
That doesn't mean you have to have every detail memorized.

29
00:01:31.005 --> 00:01:34.007
It's more like if you had to work with it again,

30
00:01:34.007 --> 00:01:37.004
would you understand the major concepts

31
00:01:37.004 --> 00:01:41.005
and be able to quickly find other information you might need

32
00:01:41.005 --> 00:01:43.005
to complete your work?

33
00:01:43.005 --> 00:01:47.004
That last point is really important to understand.

34
00:01:47.004 --> 00:01:50.007
So, I'll let you in on a little secret.

35
00:01:50.007 --> 00:01:54.000
I've built many systems for large enterprises

36
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.001
and taught over 20 technology courses,

37
00:01:57.001 --> 00:01:59.008
and I've never once memorized

38
00:01:59.008 --> 00:02:03.005
every last bit of a particular technology.

39
00:02:03.005 --> 00:02:05.006
In fact, I don't want to

40
00:02:05.006 --> 00:02:09.002
because technology changes all the time.

41
00:02:09.002 --> 00:02:11.009
I'm still a very effective technologist

42
00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.008
and here's how.

43
00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:15.005
I've built an understanding

44
00:02:15.005 --> 00:02:18.002
of what certain technologies are used for

45
00:02:18.002 --> 00:02:21.001
and the key concepts for working with them,

46
00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:25.001
many of which apply across multiple technologies.

47
00:02:25.001 --> 00:02:26.007
Then in my mind,

48
00:02:26.007 --> 00:02:29.006
I've created a map of those technologies

49
00:02:29.006 --> 00:02:31.006
and the resources I can use

50
00:02:31.006 --> 00:02:36.005
to get the specific details I need when I need them.

51
00:02:36.005 --> 00:02:41.002
That's why a development plan is so important at this point.

52
00:02:41.002 --> 00:02:44.004
It's helping you understand those key concepts

53
00:02:44.004 --> 00:02:47.009
and build that map of resources you'll go to

54
00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:51.002
when you need the finer details.

55
00:02:51.002 --> 00:02:54.000
There are a lot of learning materials available

56
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.009
to help you build that map

57
00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:59.006
and understand those key technical concepts.

58
00:02:59.006 --> 00:03:02.007
But the two most important factors to consider

59
00:03:02.007 --> 00:03:08.001
are your learning style and the quality of the materials.

60
00:03:08.001 --> 00:03:11.006
You need to find resources that speak to you.

61
00:03:11.006 --> 00:03:15.000
So if you're primarily a hands-on learner,

62
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.003
you'll want to try labs or an online course

63
00:03:18.003 --> 00:03:20.009
with lots of step-by-step instructions

64
00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:23.005
that you can follow along with.

65
00:03:23.005 --> 00:03:25.001
If you're more visual,

66
00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:27.005
try to find a course or a book

67
00:03:27.005 --> 00:03:32.004
that uses lots of diagrams to explain different concepts.

68
00:03:32.004 --> 00:03:34.000
Whatever you choose,

69
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.008
don't waste your time with something that isn't working.

70
00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:40.009
Everyone might think a certain and course is great.

71
00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:43.007
But if it doesn't resonate with you,

72
00:03:43.007 --> 00:03:47.005
it's better for you to find something that does.

73
00:03:47.005 --> 00:03:50.001
Once you've assessed your resources,

74
00:03:50.001 --> 00:03:51.006
you can build out a schedule

75
00:03:51.006 --> 00:03:54.005
that identifies the specific steps you'll take

76
00:03:54.005 --> 00:03:56.002
to learn a new topic,

77
00:03:56.002 --> 00:03:57.007
when you'll take them,

78
00:03:57.007 --> 00:04:00.007
and the resources you'll use.

79
00:04:00.007 --> 00:04:02.002
When building the schedule,

80
00:04:02.002 --> 00:04:05.008
it helps to divide your time into three categories:

81
00:04:05.008 --> 00:04:10.001
research, practice and application.

82
00:04:10.001 --> 00:04:13.008
Allocate about 20% of your time to research.

83
00:04:13.008 --> 00:04:16.006
Things like reading a book or watching courses

84
00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:18.009
that explain the major concepts

85
00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:21.007
or skills you'll need to know.

86
00:04:21.007 --> 00:04:24.006
Then spend about 30% of your time

87
00:04:24.006 --> 00:04:27.004
just practicing those new skills.

88
00:04:27.004 --> 00:04:29.004
It's kind of like running drills

89
00:04:29.004 --> 00:04:31.009
when you're training for a sport.

90
00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:36.004
The idea is to practice and repeat what you've researched

91
00:04:36.004 --> 00:04:38.008
by writing small snippets of code

92
00:04:38.008 --> 00:04:41.003
that experiment with the different aspects

93
00:04:41.003 --> 00:04:44.009
of a new technology that you're learning.

94
00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:47.009
Dedicate the remaining 50% of your time

95
00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:50.008
towards building out a working project.

96
00:04:50.008 --> 00:04:54.004
Something practical that you can show to others.

97
00:04:54.004 --> 00:04:56.006
This gives you a safe learning environment

98
00:04:56.006 --> 00:05:00.002
where you'll exercise and apply what you've learned.

99
00:05:00.002 --> 00:05:02.009
So, here's what you might come up with for a plan

100
00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:05.006
to learn the basics of HTML.

101
00:05:05.006 --> 00:05:09.004
Notice how it carves out a routine time with learning goals,

102
00:05:09.004 --> 00:05:13.004
specific resources and activities.

103
00:05:13.004 --> 00:05:16.006
Once you've built your goals and a development plan,

104
00:05:16.006 --> 00:05:19.000
you can reuse the same framework

105
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.006
every time you learn a new technology.

106
00:05:21.006 --> 00:05:25.008
It's your own custom process that works for you.

107
00:05:25.008 --> 00:05:29.008
The key is to trust your process and stick with it.

108
00:05:29.008 --> 00:05:32.007
It can be frustrating to learn a new language.

109
00:05:32.007 --> 00:05:34.005
But just keep in mind

110
00:05:34.005 --> 00:05:38.000
that it's part of the journey when learning new skills.
