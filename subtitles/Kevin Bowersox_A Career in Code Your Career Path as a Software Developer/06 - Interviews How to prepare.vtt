00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:02.003
- Preparation for an interview

2
00:00:02.003 --> 00:00:05.001
begins the moment you decide to pursue a career

3
00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:07.005
in software development.

4
00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:09.006
That's because during an interview,

5
00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:11.007
you're going to highlight your past achievements

6
00:00:11.007 --> 00:00:14.007
and demonstrate the knowledge you've accumulated

7
00:00:14.007 --> 00:00:17.004
since you started on this journey.

8
00:00:17.004 --> 00:00:19.006
That body of work is preparation

9
00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:22.005
that will continue through your career.

10
00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:25.003
However, once an interview is scheduled,

11
00:00:25.003 --> 00:00:27.001
your preparation shifts

12
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:30.001
to focus on how you can best present your achievements

13
00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:33.004
and towards brushing up on your technical skills,

14
00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:35.006
so they're sharp for the interview.

15
00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:37.003
Let's talk through a few tips

16
00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:40.000
that will help you get prepared.

17
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.003
Your first goal in an interview

18
00:00:42.003 --> 00:00:44.004
should be to get comfortable.

19
00:00:44.004 --> 00:00:47.005
Everyone's a little nervous going into an interview

20
00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:49.002
but once you're comfortable,

21
00:00:49.002 --> 00:00:53.001
that nervous energy turns into excitement.

22
00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:57.000
So, make sure you arrive a little early, use the restroom,

23
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.005
and have a minute to take a few deep breaths

24
00:00:59.005 --> 00:01:02.000
before you meet with the interviewer.

25
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.003
Then, start your interview with a smile,

26
00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:07.002
greet your interviewer by name,

27
00:01:07.002 --> 00:01:10.006
and then share a positive thought about your day.

28
00:01:10.006 --> 00:01:14.007
This introduces some small talk before the actual questions,

29
00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:17.000
which can help you settle any nerves

30
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.003
and get you even more comfortable

31
00:01:18.003 --> 00:01:21.008
before facing the questions.

32
00:01:21.008 --> 00:01:24.008
You'll also want to be prepared to answer common questions

33
00:01:24.008 --> 00:01:27.008
that are used to kick off the interview.

34
00:01:27.008 --> 00:01:30.004
Questions like, "Tell me about yourself."

35
00:01:30.004 --> 00:01:32.000
"Why do you want to work here?"

36
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and "What makes you qualified for this position?"

37
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.007
shouldn't come as a surprise to you.

38
00:01:36.007 --> 00:01:39.007
And if you're prepared, you'll be even more comfortable

39
00:01:39.007 --> 00:01:43.007
moving into the behavioral or technical questions.

40
00:01:43.007 --> 00:01:46.009
The key to preparing for behavioral questions

41
00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.003
is to master the art of storytelling.

42
00:01:50.003 --> 00:01:52.006
Now, of course, these need to be stories

43
00:01:52.006 --> 00:01:56.002
based on your actual experiences.

44
00:01:56.002 --> 00:01:59.009
To start out, make a list of situations from your past

45
00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.001
that showcase major achievements you're proud of,

46
00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:06.001
areas where you excelled, had to solve a problem,

47
00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:09.001
or learned an important lesson.

48
00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:11.008
These are your stories for the interview,

49
00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:14.006
so you'll want to make them a blend of situations

50
00:02:14.006 --> 00:02:17.003
that highlight your technical abilities

51
00:02:17.003 --> 00:02:20.001
and your personality.

52
00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:22.006
Then for each story, fill in details

53
00:02:22.006 --> 00:02:25.005
that describe the situation you faced,

54
00:02:25.005 --> 00:02:27.007
the task you needed to complete,

55
00:02:27.007 --> 00:02:31.003
the actions you took, and the results.

56
00:02:31.003 --> 00:02:34.007
This is commonly referred to as the STAR method,

57
00:02:34.007 --> 00:02:36.003
which is a structured approach

58
00:02:36.003 --> 00:02:39.007
to answering behavioral interview questions.

59
00:02:39.007 --> 00:02:42.000
For more technical stories,

60
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.003
jot down some of the tools and languages that you used

61
00:02:45.003 --> 00:02:49.006
and do some research to brush up on each technology.

62
00:02:49.006 --> 00:02:51.006
Try to focus on the technologies

63
00:02:51.006 --> 00:02:54.000
listed in the job description

64
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.005
and do a round of research on common interview questions

65
00:02:57.005 --> 00:02:59.008
that pertain to them.

66
00:02:59.008 --> 00:03:02.008
Once you've filled in the details for each story,

67
00:03:02.008 --> 00:03:05.003
you'll want to review the company's mission statement

68
00:03:05.003 --> 00:03:08.000
to determine what's important to them.

69
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.008
Let's say they value teamwork, technical excellence,

70
00:03:11.008 --> 00:03:14.004
innovation, and problem-solving.

71
00:03:14.004 --> 00:03:16.006
These are likely to be focus points

72
00:03:16.006 --> 00:03:18.009
for the interview questions.

73
00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:20.002
So, you'll want to plan out

74
00:03:20.002 --> 00:03:24.007
what aspects of your stories relate to these areas.

75
00:03:24.007 --> 00:03:25.007
The best way to do this

76
00:03:25.007 --> 00:03:28.005
is to create a matrix of your stories

77
00:03:28.005 --> 00:03:30.008
and these potential questions.

78
00:03:30.008 --> 00:03:33.003
Then within the matrix, add small reminders

79
00:03:33.003 --> 00:03:37.001
of what you want to spotlight for each question.

80
00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:39.002
After you've developed your stories

81
00:03:39.002 --> 00:03:41.007
and mapped them to common interview questions,

82
00:03:41.007 --> 00:03:44.007
you'll want to verbally practice them.

83
00:03:44.007 --> 00:03:46.005
You can do this on your own

84
00:03:46.005 --> 00:03:50.009
or enlist the help of a friend to do some mock interviewing.

85
00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:54.000
The more you verbally practice your stories,

86
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.007
the more comfortable you'll be

87
00:03:55.007 --> 00:03:59.001
telling them in the interview, which will lead to success

88
00:03:59.001 --> 00:04:02.003
with behavioral interview questions.

89
00:04:02.003 --> 00:04:04.004
For problem-based questions

90
00:04:04.004 --> 00:04:07.003
that require you to write code or whiteboard,

91
00:04:07.003 --> 00:04:10.004
the best strategy is to get plenty of hands-on practice

92
00:04:10.004 --> 00:04:12.007
before your interview.

93
00:04:12.007 --> 00:04:15.005
For coding assessments, you should complete

94
00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:18.000
as many practice questions as possible

95
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.002
on sites like LeetCode or HackerRank

96
00:04:21.002 --> 00:04:22.009
to build your familiarity

97
00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:26.001
with common data structures and algorithms.

98
00:04:26.001 --> 00:04:28.001
An even better approach

99
00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:32.000
is to complete coding challenge courses on LinkedIn Learning

100
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.004
where you'll get a detailed explanation

101
00:04:34.004 --> 00:04:39.002
from the instructor on how to solve a particular problem.

102
00:04:39.002 --> 00:04:41.004
When practicing for these problems,

103
00:04:41.004 --> 00:04:44.001
you'll want to speak through your approach out loud,

104
00:04:44.001 --> 00:04:46.009
which will benefit you when you need to speak through them

105
00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:49.000
in the interview.

106
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.005
During the actual interview,

107
00:04:50.005 --> 00:04:53.009
always listen carefully to the initial problem,

108
00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:56.000
ask questions to clarify it,

109
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.008
and pay attention to tips from the interviewer

110
00:04:58.008 --> 00:05:03.000
that can keep you moving in the right direction.

111
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Take time to speak through or draw out your solution

112
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
before you begin to write code

113
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.007
or pseudocode for the problem.

114
00:05:10.007 --> 00:05:13.008
This helps demonstrate your problem-solving skills

115
00:05:13.008 --> 00:05:16.003
and can identify problems with your approach

116
00:05:16.003 --> 00:05:18.004
before you begin.

117
00:05:18.004 --> 00:05:20.007
You'll also want to be prepared

118
00:05:20.007 --> 00:05:23.003
to ask questions about the position

119
00:05:23.003 --> 00:05:25.005
and what you'll be working on.

120
00:05:25.005 --> 00:05:28.006
If you can identify the product you'll be working on

121
00:05:28.006 --> 00:05:32.005
from the job description, do a round of research on it

122
00:05:32.005 --> 00:05:35.003
and come prepared with some thoughtful questions

123
00:05:35.003 --> 00:05:38.009
about how it works or how it's built.

124
00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:40.006
If you really want a position,

125
00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:44.001
make sure you put in the time and do your preparation.

126
00:05:44.001 --> 00:05:48.007
It pays off and second chances are rare.

127
00:05:48.007 --> 00:05:50.001
No matter what the outcome,

128
00:05:50.001 --> 00:05:52.005
you'll be able to hold your head high,

129
00:05:52.005 --> 00:05:55.000
knowing that you put your best foot forward.
