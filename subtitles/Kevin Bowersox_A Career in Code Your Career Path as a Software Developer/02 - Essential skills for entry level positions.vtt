00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:02.002
- While it's hard to predict exactly

2
00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:04.003
what an employer might be looking

3
00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:06.005
for in an entry level candidate,

4
00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:09.000
there are a few common technical skills

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
that appear most frequently in job postings.

6
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.008
Having awareness of these skills will allow you

7
00:00:15.008 --> 00:00:19.001
to reinforce them so that you can feel confident

8
00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:22.001
placing them on your resume and speaking

9
00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:23.009
to them in an interview.

10
00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:26.001
So let's talk through a few

11
00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:30.003
of these essential skills for entry level developers.

12
00:00:30.003 --> 00:00:32.009
First, most companies will want to see

13
00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.005
that you have experience

14
00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:37.004
with at least one popular programming language.

15
00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:39.006
So make sure you're familiar with one

16
00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:43.008
of the programming languages we discussed earlier.

17
00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:44.006
On top of that,

18
00:00:44.006 --> 00:00:48.000
you'll be expected to understand different data structures

19
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.002
and algorithms that would typically be covered

20
00:00:51.002 --> 00:00:53.004
in a computer science degree.

21
00:00:53.004 --> 00:00:54.008
Here, you'll want to focus

22
00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:57.009
on the most commonly used data structures,

23
00:00:57.009 --> 00:01:05.002
like arrays, link lists, stacks, queues, maps, and trees.

24
00:01:05.002 --> 00:01:06.002
And for algorithms,

25
00:01:06.002 --> 00:01:09.007
I would recommend knowing at least two sorting algorithms,

26
00:01:09.007 --> 00:01:12.004
probably merge sort and quicksort,

27
00:01:12.004 --> 00:01:14.007
along with a binary search algorithm

28
00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:16.009
for a binary search tree.

29
00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.001
You might also be expected to know one

30
00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:21.005
or more programming styles.

31
00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:25.004
The most common is object oriented programming,

32
00:01:25.004 --> 00:01:30.002
which uses objects to model and solve problems.

33
00:01:30.002 --> 00:01:33.000
If you're also familiar with functional programming,

34
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
that will be to your advantage.

35
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.004
It's a style of programming that focuses less

36
00:01:37.004 --> 00:01:39.009
on defining a sequence of statements

37
00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.002
and more on declaring functions

38
00:01:42.002 --> 00:01:45.008
that are applied to a set of values.

39
00:01:45.008 --> 00:01:48.009
Companies will also expect you to be familiar

40
00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.005
with the tools used to write and store source code.

41
00:01:52.005 --> 00:01:54.004
So make sure you're comfortable

42
00:01:54.004 --> 00:01:58.005
with using an integrated development environment, or IDE,

43
00:01:58.005 --> 00:02:01.000
like Visual Studio, VS Code,

44
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.002
or Eclipse.

45
00:02:03.002 --> 00:02:04.000
When it comes

46
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.001
to source control,

47
00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:08.000
Git is pretty much the defacto standard across

48
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.009
the industry for teams collaborating

49
00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.001
on the source code for a project.

50
00:02:13.001 --> 00:02:16.006
So make sure it's a tool in your toolbox.

51
00:02:16.006 --> 00:02:20.001
Those are really the core of what companies look

52
00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:24.007
for, but there are some skills that can make you stand out.

53
00:02:24.007 --> 00:02:26.006
One of those is the knowledge

54
00:02:26.006 --> 00:02:30.007
of a framework for one of the popular programming languages.

55
00:02:30.007 --> 00:02:33.002
A framework has prebuilt libraries

56
00:02:33.002 --> 00:02:35.002
and components that you can work

57
00:02:35.002 --> 00:02:37.009
with to solve common programming problems,

58
00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:40.009
like handling web requests and storing data

59
00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:42.008
in a database.

60
00:02:42.008 --> 00:02:44.003
For C# developers,

61
00:02:44.003 --> 00:02:45.006
that's .NET,

62
00:02:45.006 --> 00:02:48.009
and for Java, it's the Spring Framework.

63
00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:52.000
Working with databases is another skill

64
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.008
that companies value.

65
00:02:53.008 --> 00:02:55.005
So you'll want to have an understanding

66
00:02:55.005 --> 00:02:57.009
of how relational databases work

67
00:02:57.009 --> 00:03:00.007
and how to query them using SQL,

68
00:03:00.007 --> 00:03:02.007
the structured query language.

69
00:03:02.007 --> 00:03:05.007
If you're familiar with document databases

70
00:03:05.007 --> 00:03:07.003
like MongoDB,

71
00:03:07.003 --> 00:03:10.009
that's also going to be to your advantage.

72
00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:12.001
When it comes

73
00:03:12.001 --> 00:03:14.002
to what you should know as a developer,

74
00:03:14.002 --> 00:03:16.009
we've dialed it up a notch in this lesson,

75
00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:19.009
and you might feel little overwhelmed.

76
00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:22.000
It comes with being a developer.

77
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.005
You'll be expected to learn new technologies

78
00:03:24.005 --> 00:03:26.003
as they come along,

79
00:03:26.003 --> 00:03:29.002
and it will be a consistent part of your career.

80
00:03:29.002 --> 00:03:33.005
That's why it's important to be in it for the right reasons.

81
00:03:33.005 --> 00:03:36.000
For those that are passionate about technology,

82
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.001
their curiosity is a natural part of their progression,

83
00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:43.000
and they're excited to learn new skills.
