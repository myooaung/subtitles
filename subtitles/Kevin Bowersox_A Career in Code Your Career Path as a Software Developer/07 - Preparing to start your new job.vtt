00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.003
- Nothing feels better than receiving a job offer

2
00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:06.002
for that new position you've always wanted.

3
00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:08.002
It's an exciting time in your career

4
00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:10.006
that should be celebrated.

5
00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:12.005
Before beginning your new adventure,

6
00:00:12.005 --> 00:00:14.006
there will be an onboarding period

7
00:00:14.006 --> 00:00:16.006
where you'll submit documentation

8
00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:19.007
and finalize the agreement with your new employer

9
00:00:19.007 --> 00:00:22.008
and then give a notice to your old employer.

10
00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:25.007
This period can typically take about a month,

11
00:00:25.007 --> 00:00:28.005
so it provides an excellent opportunity

12
00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:32.007
to ramp up and prepare for your new position.

13
00:00:32.007 --> 00:00:34.005
During the interview process

14
00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:37.005
or through conversations with your new manager,

15
00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:41.008
you'll often uncover a few gaps within your current skills

16
00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:44.008
and what's needed for the position.

17
00:00:44.008 --> 00:00:48.003
This is normal, especially when job descriptions contain

18
00:00:48.003 --> 00:00:51.007
a long list of preferred skills.

19
00:00:51.007 --> 00:00:55.001
That's why it's important to ask questions about the tools

20
00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:57.002
and technologies you'll be using

21
00:00:57.002 --> 00:00:59.005
during the interview process.

22
00:00:59.005 --> 00:01:02.009
It shows your interest, opens up the conversation

23
00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:05.000
and gathers information you'll need

24
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.002
to prepare for your new position.

25
00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:10.004
Once you've collected this information,

26
00:01:10.004 --> 00:01:11.008
develop a learning plan,

27
00:01:11.008 --> 00:01:14.001
like we discussed in earlier lessons,

28
00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:18.005
to work on building up these skills before your start date.

29
00:01:18.005 --> 00:01:21.000
It will allow you to contribute more quickly

30
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.002
in your new position

31
00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:25.002
and help overcome a bit of the imposter syndrome

32
00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:29.005
that everyone experiences when starting a new role.

33
00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:31.004
If you know what team and product

34
00:01:31.004 --> 00:01:33.007
you'll be working on at the company,

35
00:01:33.007 --> 00:01:36.001
spend time reviewing any information

36
00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:38.005
that's publicly available about it

37
00:01:38.005 --> 00:01:43.003
or ask your manager if they can share this information.

38
00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:46.003
This will get you familiar with the product's key features

39
00:01:46.003 --> 00:01:48.001
and can build some common ground

40
00:01:48.001 --> 00:01:52.001
for initial conversations with your teammates.

41
00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:56.000
During this time, it's also important to rejuvenate.

42
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.004
Take some time for yourself

43
00:01:57.004 --> 00:02:00.000
to clear your mind and de-stress

44
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.004
so you can start your new position well rested.

45
00:02:04.004 --> 00:02:06.008
The work that goes into landing a position

46
00:02:06.008 --> 00:02:09.008
and waiting on the results can be intense,

47
00:02:09.008 --> 00:02:13.007
so it's important to inject some downtime for recovery

48
00:02:13.007 --> 00:02:15.004
so that you'll be at your best

49
00:02:15.004 --> 00:02:18.000
the first day in your new role.
