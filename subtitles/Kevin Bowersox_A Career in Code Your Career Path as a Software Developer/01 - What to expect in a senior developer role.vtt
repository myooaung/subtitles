00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.005
- After about a year on the job,

2
00:00:02.005 --> 00:00:05.000
you'll have gained quite a bit of experience,

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
completed a few projects,

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.007
and will be starting to think about how to advance

5
00:00:09.007 --> 00:00:12.001
as a software developer.

6
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:16.001
The title or level of the next position you might advance to

7
00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:19.002
will vary depending upon the company you work at

8
00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:22.003
and how they define the career ladder.

9
00:00:22.003 --> 00:00:24.000
You'll want to do some research

10
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.009
or have a conversation with your supervisor

11
00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:29.001
to better understand the next role

12
00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:33.003
in your career progression and its responsibilities.

13
00:00:33.003 --> 00:00:36.003
It might be something like Software Developer Two

14
00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:39.002
or Senior Software Engineer.

15
00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:43.008
At that next level, you can typically expect three things.

16
00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:47.001
First, you'll have more responsibility.

17
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:50.004
You'll be expected to provide new members of your team

18
00:00:50.004 --> 00:00:53.004
with the same type of support that was provided to you

19
00:00:53.004 --> 00:00:55.004
when you first started out,

20
00:00:55.004 --> 00:00:59.008
things like mentoring and help with solving problems.

21
00:00:59.008 --> 00:01:01.000
At the same time,

22
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.003
you'll be expected to solve more complicated problems

23
00:01:04.003 --> 00:01:06.003
in your new role.

24
00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:08.008
Your team will now depend upon you

25
00:01:08.008 --> 00:01:10.009
to provide well-engineered solutions

26
00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:15.001
to some of the more difficult situations they face.

27
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:18.006
Part of advancing means that you'll work more independently

28
00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:20.006
on your assigned tasks

29
00:01:20.006 --> 00:01:22.008
because now you'll be expected

30
00:01:22.008 --> 00:01:25.007
to provide more support for other team members

31
00:01:25.007 --> 00:01:28.003
and consume less of it.

32
00:01:28.003 --> 00:01:31.002
You can still ask for an assist from a teammate,

33
00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:34.008
but you'll be expected to solve unfamiliar problems

34
00:01:34.008 --> 00:01:37.007
without as much oversight.

35
00:01:37.007 --> 00:01:39.005
The best software developers

36
00:01:39.005 --> 00:01:41.009
can evaluate a problem or a goal

37
00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.000
that might be a little bit unclear

38
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.008
and produce a solution that solves the problem

39
00:01:46.008 --> 00:01:49.003
or achieves the goal.

40
00:01:49.003 --> 00:01:51.002
The ability to produce results

41
00:01:51.002 --> 00:01:53.005
when there's little direction to start with

42
00:01:53.005 --> 00:01:56.005
is a talent that will quickly get you noticed

43
00:01:56.005 --> 00:02:00.004
and build your reputation as a software developer.

44
00:02:00.004 --> 00:02:04.009
So that's what to expect at the senior developer level.

45
00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.009
Throughout the rest of this chapter,

46
00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.007
we'll discuss what you can do

47
00:02:08.007 --> 00:02:10.008
to make this transition happen,

48
00:02:10.008 --> 00:02:12.000
because it begins

49
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
well before you're officially in the position.
