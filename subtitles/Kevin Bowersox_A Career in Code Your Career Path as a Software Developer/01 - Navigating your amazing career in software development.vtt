00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.008
- A career in software development

2
00:00:02.008 --> 00:00:04.004
can be a wonderful journey

3
00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:07.004
if you know how to successfully navigate it.

4
00:00:07.004 --> 00:00:09.002
But for many who want to enter

5
00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:11.003
or advance within the field,

6
00:00:11.003 --> 00:00:13.005
it can feel overwhelming.

7
00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:16.003
Just figuring out what to focus on and learn

8
00:00:16.003 --> 00:00:18.001
at each stage of your career

9
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:19.004
can be challenging

10
00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:21.007
because the paths are endless

11
00:00:21.007 --> 00:00:24.005
and you can get lost along the way.

12
00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:27.002
Hi, I'm Kevin Bowersox.

13
00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:29.000
Over the course of my career,

14
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.001
I've advanced into leadership roles at top organizations,

15
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:34.006
and during that time,

16
00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:37.005
I've been involved with hiring many developers

17
00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:38.008
at all levels.

18
00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:43.004
So I know what it's like to be on both to this career path.

19
00:00:43.004 --> 00:00:45.009
Now, I'm going to share the strategies,

20
00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:49.006
I've learned that will help you land that first position

21
00:00:49.006 --> 00:00:52.005
and develop the skills you'll need to transition

22
00:00:52.005 --> 00:00:54.009
into more senior roles.

23
00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:58.002
Together, we'll build a playbook that guides your learning

24
00:00:58.002 --> 00:01:02.000
and career progression, as you work towards that dream job

25
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.001
you always thought was out of reach.

26
00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:08.000
So if you're ready to take control of your career

27
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.007
in software development,

28
00:01:09.007 --> 00:01:12.002

29
00:01:12.002 --> 00:01:16.000
