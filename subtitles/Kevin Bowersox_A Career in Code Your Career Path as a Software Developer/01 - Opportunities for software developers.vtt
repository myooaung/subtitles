00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.006
- Now that you've gotten a small taste

2
00:00:02.006 --> 00:00:05.000
of what it's like to develop software,

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.008
you might be curious to learn more

4
00:00:06.008 --> 00:00:10.003
about what you can do once you learn to code.

5
00:00:10.003 --> 00:00:14.003
Most software developers know a few programming languages

6
00:00:14.003 --> 00:00:17.002
which they use to write code for applications

7
00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:19.008
that people and businesses use

8
00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:22.006
to complete all sorts of tasks.

9
00:00:22.006 --> 00:00:25.008
This is why I love software development.

10
00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:29.009
There's this unlimited potential for what you can create.

11
00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:31.009
Maybe you're really into cars.

12
00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.006
Well, there's a ton of software packed into a car,

13
00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:37.005
like the navigation system,

14
00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:42.004
and now, even autopilot capabilities for self-driving cars.

15
00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:46.003
In 2019, the CEO of Volkswagen estimated

16
00:00:46.003 --> 00:00:49.002
that software will account for 90%

17
00:00:49.002 --> 00:00:52.001
of the future innovations in cars.

18
00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:54.001
That's just one industry,

19
00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:56.007
but really, anything you're interested in,

20
00:00:56.007 --> 00:00:59.008
whether it's cars, finance or fashion,

21
00:00:59.008 --> 00:01:02.006
will become more intertwined with technology

22
00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:04.007
as time goes on.

23
00:01:04.007 --> 00:01:07.001
That's what's generating the strong demand

24
00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:08.008
for software developers,

25
00:01:08.008 --> 00:01:11.001
and it creates some amazing opportunities

26
00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:13.005
for you to enter the field.

27
00:01:13.005 --> 00:01:16.007
The applications that software developers build

28
00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:19.005
come in all shapes and sizes.

29
00:01:19.005 --> 00:01:23.000
As a developer, you might find yourself building software

30
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.009
for mobile applications, games, or desktop applications.

31
00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:32.003
But most developers start off by building web applications.

32
00:01:32.003 --> 00:01:36.000
So let's focus our discussions there.

33
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.009
At a high level, most web applications

34
00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.002
break down into two layers,

35
00:01:41.002 --> 00:01:43.009
the front-end and the back-end.

36
00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.001
When we talk about the front-end of a web application,

37
00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:52.005
it's the website and the pages users see and interact with.

38
00:01:52.005 --> 00:01:55.004
So when you access a website,

39
00:01:55.004 --> 00:01:58.006
all of the elements that make up the user interface

40
00:01:58.006 --> 00:02:00.009
are part of the front-end.

41
00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.002
Front-end developers primarily use three languages

42
00:02:04.002 --> 00:02:06.005
to build the interface.

43
00:02:06.005 --> 00:02:09.008
HTML is used to create the structure of the page

44
00:02:09.008 --> 00:02:11.008
and its contents,

45
00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:16.002
CSS is then used to style and position those contents,

46
00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:21.002
and then JavaScript is used to make the page interactive.

47
00:02:21.002 --> 00:02:24.004
When the front-end needs information to display,

48
00:02:24.004 --> 00:02:27.001
or it has to perform a transaction,

49
00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:30.003
like when you click on a button to order a product,

50
00:02:30.003 --> 00:02:33.002
that's handled by the back-end code.

51
00:02:33.002 --> 00:02:36.001
It runs on a server that receives messages

52
00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:39.005
sent over a network from the front-end.

53
00:02:39.005 --> 00:02:42.007
So, for example, on LinkedIn,

54
00:02:42.007 --> 00:02:45.004
the front-end website might ask the backend

55
00:02:45.004 --> 00:02:47.009
to trace all your network connections

56
00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:50.008
so it can display them on the page.

57
00:02:50.008 --> 00:02:53.002
The back-end receives the message,

58
00:02:53.002 --> 00:02:55.008
performs the logic to query the database,

59
00:02:55.008 --> 00:03:00.007
and then returns the information it clicks to the front-end.

60
00:03:00.007 --> 00:03:04.001
Or maybe you order a product on Amazon.

61
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:07.001
The front-end sends the order to the back-end,

62
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:09.008
which then handles all the complicated logic

63
00:03:09.008 --> 00:03:13.004
of the purchase, like updating the inventory,

64
00:03:13.004 --> 00:03:17.003
billing your bank account, and arranging for shipping.

65
00:03:17.003 --> 00:03:20.002
Some developers specialize in front-end

66
00:03:20.002 --> 00:03:22.002
or back-end development,

67
00:03:22.002 --> 00:03:25.000
while others, known as full stack developers,

68
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.005
work across both areas.

69
00:03:27.005 --> 00:03:30.000
Full stack developers can write the code

70
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.001
that builds the user interface

71
00:03:32.001 --> 00:03:34.004
and all of the logic that provides it

72
00:03:34.004 --> 00:03:38.003
with data and transactional capabilities.

73
00:03:38.003 --> 00:03:40.004
You don't have to decide right now,

74
00:03:40.004 --> 00:03:41.009
but you should begin to think

75
00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:45.000
about which of these areas interest you the most,

76
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.009
because it will influence your learning goals.

77
00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:51.004
If you're very visual, you might lean towards the front-end,

78
00:03:51.004 --> 00:03:54.006
or if you like solving complicated problems,

79
00:03:54.006 --> 00:03:57.003
maybe the back-end is for you.

80
00:03:57.003 --> 00:04:01.000
Once you've gained an understanding of one of these areas,

81
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.006
it opens you up to learning the other side

82
00:04:03.006 --> 00:04:05.007
and going full stack.

83
00:04:05.007 --> 00:04:07.004
It takes more time and effort,

84
00:04:07.004 --> 00:04:09.001
but the great thing is,

85
00:04:09.001 --> 00:04:11.002
you can start with where you're comfortable

86
00:04:11.002 --> 00:04:16.000
and then expand your skillset as you gain more experience.

87
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.001
You'll have more opportunities as a full stack developer,

88
00:04:20.001 --> 00:04:24.000
plus, it's an exciting and rewarding challenge.
