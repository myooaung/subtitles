00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:03.005
- At it's core, leading a software development team

2
00:00:03.005 --> 00:00:06.005
is about building and supporting a group of people

3
00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:08.007
that deliver high quality software

4
00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:10.008
at a steady pace.

5
00:00:10.008 --> 00:00:12.004
To do that successfully,

6
00:00:12.004 --> 00:00:15.002
you'll need to focus on the team's dynamics

7
00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:20.001
and constantly improve upon them to keep the team effective.

8
00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:21.007
The best place to start

9
00:00:21.007 --> 00:00:26.000
is by building relationships with the members of your team.

10
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
That doesn't mean you need to be everyone's best friend,

11
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.008
but you need to genuinely care about and connect with them.

12
00:00:33.008 --> 00:00:36.007
Carving out some time to hold one-on-one sessions

13
00:00:36.007 --> 00:00:39.001
with each team member every few weeks

14
00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:43.003
is a great way to establish these relationships.

15
00:00:43.003 --> 00:00:44.006
In these sessions,

16
00:00:44.006 --> 00:00:46.005
steer the conversation towards

17
00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:48.004
what the individual cares about,

18
00:00:48.004 --> 00:00:51.004
what they're interested in, where they excel

19
00:00:51.004 --> 00:00:55.001
and what they're facing in their day to day work.

20
00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:58.001
You need the team to be comfortable with openly

21
00:00:58.001 --> 00:01:01.002
but professionally sharing their thoughts with you

22
00:01:01.002 --> 00:01:04.008
so that when you need to make a decision or an assignment,

23
00:01:04.008 --> 00:01:09.004
you can factor in their interests, strengths and goals.

24
00:01:09.004 --> 00:01:11.009
It can be difficult to get some individuals

25
00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.004
to open up and share their thoughts,

26
00:01:14.004 --> 00:01:17.009
but if you lead by example and create the right environment,

27
00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.007
it will happen with time.

28
00:01:20.007 --> 00:01:23.005
When it comes to teaming and the work environment,

29
00:01:23.005 --> 00:01:26.009
psychological safety is one of the greatest contributors

30
00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.002
to a team's performance.

31
00:01:29.002 --> 00:01:33.000
Psychological safety means that team members feel safe

32
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.002
taking risks and being vulnerable in front of each other.

33
00:01:37.002 --> 00:01:38.007
When we think of leaders,

34
00:01:38.007 --> 00:01:41.004
we often envision these superheroes

35
00:01:41.004 --> 00:01:44.001
that do everything perfect on the first try,

36
00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:47.000
and make all the right decisions;

37
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.001
it's just not realistic,

38
00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:52.005
and if that's the image you project to your team,

39
00:01:52.005 --> 00:01:55.003
they'll attempt to replicate it.

40
00:01:55.003 --> 00:01:57.006
That's not an ideal environment

41
00:01:57.006 --> 00:01:59.006
because team members become afraid

42
00:01:59.006 --> 00:02:02.000
to experiment with new ideas,

43
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.002
ask for help or to acknowledge problems

44
00:02:05.002 --> 00:02:08.001
that are holding the team back.

45
00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:09.002
As a leader,

46
00:02:09.002 --> 00:02:12.003
you have to set the tone for your team on this one,

47
00:02:12.003 --> 00:02:14.000
and here's where I like to use

48
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.004
the team's agile retrospective,

49
00:02:16.004 --> 00:02:18.001
which is a really great place

50
00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:21.000
to discuss team dynamics.

51
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.005
In the retrospective,

52
00:02:22.005 --> 00:02:23.005
I make it a point

53
00:02:23.005 --> 00:02:27.000
to highlight the mistakes I made during the sprint,

54
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.005
then I discuss how I'm going to course correct

55
00:02:29.005 --> 00:02:32.001
and fix the problem.

56
00:02:32.001 --> 00:02:34.009
After seeing that you're comfortable being vulnerable

57
00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:36.003
a few times,

58
00:02:36.003 --> 00:02:38.002
your team will understand,

59
00:02:38.002 --> 00:02:41.001
it's okay to be human and make mistakes.

60
00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:44.003
And some will start openly discussing areas

61
00:02:44.003 --> 00:02:46.007
where they could have done better.

62
00:02:46.007 --> 00:02:48.003
In these situations,

63
00:02:48.003 --> 00:02:51.000
you need to thank them for being open,

64
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.006
provide them with reassurance

65
00:02:52.006 --> 00:02:55.002
that next time they'll figure it out,

66
00:02:55.002 --> 00:02:56.005
and then point out something

67
00:02:56.005 --> 00:02:59.002
they did well during the sprint.

68
00:02:59.002 --> 00:03:01.009
Now, of course there are some mistakes

69
00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:03.004
that should never happen,

70
00:03:03.004 --> 00:03:05.002
and that's where you need to set

71
00:03:05.002 --> 00:03:08.004
and strictly enforce rules for your team.

72
00:03:08.004 --> 00:03:13.006
For example, hostile or abusive behavior is unacceptable

73
00:03:13.006 --> 00:03:17.006
and it needs to be made clear that it won't be tolerated.

74
00:03:17.006 --> 00:03:20.001
Then there are standards you establish

75
00:03:20.001 --> 00:03:22.005
to influence your team's practices;

76
00:03:22.005 --> 00:03:24.006
here, you should be firm,

77
00:03:24.006 --> 00:03:26.002
but there's more flexibility

78
00:03:26.002 --> 00:03:29.003
for negotiating how you go about it.

79
00:03:29.003 --> 00:03:32.003
So, these are things like writing unit tests,

80
00:03:32.003 --> 00:03:33.007
doing code reviews,

81
00:03:33.007 --> 00:03:37.006
being on time and dependable team member.

82
00:03:37.006 --> 00:03:40.007
The team needs to know what's expected of them

83
00:03:40.007 --> 00:03:42.006
in certain situations

84
00:03:42.006 --> 00:03:46.002
so they know when it's okay to take a chance on a new idea

85
00:03:46.002 --> 00:03:50.000
and when they should be more cautious.

86
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.006
Here's an example;

87
00:03:51.006 --> 00:03:54.008
I've always encouraged my teams to experiment

88
00:03:54.008 --> 00:03:55.007
and assure them,

89
00:03:55.007 --> 00:03:57.002
I'm not going to get upset

90
00:03:57.002 --> 00:04:00.009
if something breaks in a non-production environment.

91
00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:03.004
I have that conversation with the team

92
00:04:03.004 --> 00:04:06.002
so they know I value innovation

93
00:04:06.002 --> 00:04:09.003
and I'm willing to accept some mistakes to achieve it

94
00:04:09.003 --> 00:04:12.002
if they're made in the right places.

95
00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:16.000
That gives the team the space to safely experiment

96
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.002
without worrying about altering

97
00:04:18.002 --> 00:04:21.006
or even deleting something like a non-production database,

98
00:04:21.006 --> 00:04:23.006
which happens.

99
00:04:23.006 --> 00:04:27.004
These standards and expectations set the tone

100
00:04:27.004 --> 00:04:30.000
for how your team goes about its work,

101
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
and the results will show in their output,

102
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
as long as you set a clear vision.

103
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.001
A clear vision sets the direction for the team

104
00:04:39.001 --> 00:04:43.004
and builds a plan to complete the necessary work.

105
00:04:43.004 --> 00:04:46.009
To ensure your team is working towards the right target,

106
00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:49.004
it's important to communicate with team members

107
00:04:49.004 --> 00:04:53.002
about their tasks and get them the support to complete them

108
00:04:53.002 --> 00:04:55.009
when they need a little help.

109
00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:59.000
When teams have a clear understanding of their work

110
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.005
and can see how it contributes to the larger vision,

111
00:05:02.005 --> 00:05:03.008
they're more engaged

112
00:05:03.008 --> 00:05:08.001
and can offer ideas about how to improve that vision.

113
00:05:08.001 --> 00:05:11.004
It's all about removing uncertainty for your team,

114
00:05:11.004 --> 00:05:12.008
and in the long run,

115
00:05:12.008 --> 00:05:16.004
it's something you'll want to teach other team members to do

116
00:05:16.004 --> 00:05:21.002
because then your team becomes extremely effective.

117
00:05:21.002 --> 00:05:24.004
These are the elements that build a great team

118
00:05:24.004 --> 00:05:26.002
but each team is unique

119
00:05:26.002 --> 00:05:28.005
so you need to tailor each element

120
00:05:28.005 --> 00:05:32.000
to their experience level and needs.

121
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Once your team is performing,

122
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.005
challenge them to take more ownership

123
00:05:36.005 --> 00:05:38.001
and look for opportunities

124
00:05:38.001 --> 00:05:40.009
to continuously improve their approach,

125
00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:43.007
so the team can deliver even more value

126
00:05:43.007 --> 00:05:46.000
to your organization.
