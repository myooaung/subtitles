00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.003
- After you've worked towards your goals

2
00:00:02.003 --> 00:00:03.009
for about three months,

3
00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:07.001
you'll start to get a sense of whether software development

4
00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:09.009
is the right direction for you.

5
00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:10.009
At this point,

6
00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.009
I recommend doing another round of reflection.

7
00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:18.004
Here, it helps to ask yourself a few key questions.

8
00:00:18.004 --> 00:00:21.005
Are you still excited about software development?

9
00:00:21.005 --> 00:00:24.003
Have you been able to stick to your plan

10
00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:27.004
or has your interest faded?

11
00:00:27.004 --> 00:00:29.008
Have an honest conversation with yourself

12
00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:32.007
and decide whether becoming a software developer

13
00:00:32.007 --> 00:00:36.009
is still your goal and you're ready to commit to it further.

14
00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:39.006
It's okay if it's not for you,

15
00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:42.005
because it's a huge mistake to sink your time,

16
00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:45.009
effort, and money into something that isn't a fit

17
00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:50.001
when you could be investing that in something you enjoy.

18
00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:52.004
If you determine you're on the right path,

19
00:00:52.004 --> 00:00:54.005
it's time to start looking ahead

20
00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:57.003
at the approach you'll take to enter a career

21
00:00:57.003 --> 00:00:59.004
as a software developer,

22
00:00:59.004 --> 00:01:03.008
which by now should be one of your long-term goals.

23
00:01:03.008 --> 00:01:07.004
How that goal is achieved is different for everyone,

24
00:01:07.004 --> 00:01:09.002
but just like other goals

25
00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:12.002
you'll be more successful with the plan.

26
00:01:12.002 --> 00:01:14.006
There's going to be a lot more to learn,

27
00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:16.005
there always will be.

28
00:01:16.005 --> 00:01:18.008
But at this point most developers

29
00:01:18.008 --> 00:01:22.003
go in one of three directions.

30
00:01:22.003 --> 00:01:26.001
First, you have the option of continuing to teach yourself

31
00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:29.004
and really you'll be doing that throughout your career.

32
00:01:29.004 --> 00:01:33.006
But in this case, it's your only strategy.

33
00:01:33.006 --> 00:01:36.003
There are many self-taught programmers,

34
00:01:36.003 --> 00:01:38.005
but it's the most difficult approach

35
00:01:38.005 --> 00:01:42.000
and you'll need to overcome some obstacles.

36
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.003
With this strategy,

37
00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:46.002
you're placing a be that your process for learning

38
00:01:46.002 --> 00:01:50.003
is as efficient and effective as formal learning options

39
00:01:50.003 --> 00:01:53.004
like bootcamps or four year degrees.

40
00:01:53.004 --> 00:01:56.007
There are plenty of resources like online courses,

41
00:01:56.007 --> 00:02:00.005
books, and tutorials, you can use to teach yourself.

42
00:02:00.005 --> 00:02:04.007
It's a low cost way to get started as a software developer,

43
00:02:04.007 --> 00:02:08.007
but it's going to require a lot of discipline.

44
00:02:08.007 --> 00:02:10.009
The self-taught route only works

45
00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.006
if you can dedicate yourself

46
00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:15.001
to a well-structured learning plan.

47
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:17.009
So, if you have a little history with projects

48
00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:19.009
not always getting completed,

49
00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:23.003
you might want to take that into consideration.

50
00:02:23.003 --> 00:02:25.007
You'll also need to figure out your edge

51
00:02:25.007 --> 00:02:29.001
or what sets you apart from other job applicants

52
00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:32.002
that have formal academic credentials.

53
00:02:32.002 --> 00:02:34.000
That might be a certification,

54
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.008
some volunteer work,

55
00:02:35.008 --> 00:02:40.003
or contributions you make to an open source project.

56
00:02:40.003 --> 00:02:42.004
I only recommend this strategy

57
00:02:42.004 --> 00:02:45.002
if it's your only option financially,

58
00:02:45.002 --> 00:02:47.006
because it's likely to take more time

59
00:02:47.006 --> 00:02:50.001
than a formal learning approach.

60
00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:52.009
If it takes you three years to land a position

61
00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:55.005
while a bootcamp takes six months,

62
00:02:55.005 --> 00:02:59.003
you've just lost two and a half years of wages.

63
00:02:59.003 --> 00:03:02.008
Lately, coding bootcamps are a popular approach

64
00:03:02.008 --> 00:03:05.006
for those who want to directly enter the field

65
00:03:05.006 --> 00:03:07.005
or make a career transition

66
00:03:07.005 --> 00:03:11.006
without the full cost of a four year degree.

67
00:03:11.006 --> 00:03:14.008
On average, you'll go through about 16 weeks

68
00:03:14.008 --> 00:03:18.007
of intense training that focuses on the technical skills

69
00:03:18.007 --> 00:03:22.005
you'll need to enter the software development field.

70
00:03:22.005 --> 00:03:27.004
These programs normally cost between 10 and $15,000,

71
00:03:27.004 --> 00:03:31.005
which is still a significant financial investment.

72
00:03:31.005 --> 00:03:34.009
Often bootcamps will have established relationships

73
00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:36.008
with certain employers,

74
00:03:36.008 --> 00:03:41.005
this helps graduates land job interviews and positions.

75
00:03:41.005 --> 00:03:43.007
Before you enroll in a bootcamp,

76
00:03:43.007 --> 00:03:46.002
I recommend doing some thorough research

77
00:03:46.002 --> 00:03:48.002
on the integrity of the provider

78
00:03:48.002 --> 00:03:52.007
and how they network with companies in your area.

79
00:03:52.007 --> 00:03:54.007
Just like self-taught programmers,

80
00:03:54.007 --> 00:03:58.001
bootcamp graduates may have trouble landing positions

81
00:03:58.001 --> 00:04:01.009
that have hard requirement for a four year degree.

82
00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:03.009
That's because historically,

83
00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:07.004
the most common path for becoming a software developer

84
00:04:07.004 --> 00:04:09.008
is attending a four year university

85
00:04:09.008 --> 00:04:13.006
majoring in computer or information sciences.

86
00:04:13.006 --> 00:04:16.008
There are a lot of opinions on whether attending a college

87
00:04:16.008 --> 00:04:19.000
is worth taking on the debt,

88
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.008
and lately the there's been a substantial rise

89
00:04:21.008 --> 00:04:24.002
in self-taught developers.

90
00:04:24.002 --> 00:04:27.002
If you take costs out of the equation,

91
00:04:27.002 --> 00:04:29.009
attending a university for computer science

92
00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:33.003
offers some considerable advantages.

93
00:04:33.003 --> 00:04:35.003
In addition to the required courses

94
00:04:35.003 --> 00:04:37.000
for your technical degree,

95
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.008
you'll have the opportunity to schedule elective courses

96
00:04:40.008 --> 00:04:43.003
that you can curate to get the most

97
00:04:43.003 --> 00:04:45.009
from your college experience.

98
00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:47.007
You'll want to be very deliberate

99
00:04:47.007 --> 00:04:50.005
about scheduling these elective courses,

100
00:04:50.005 --> 00:04:55.004
and when possible use them to broaden your technical skills.

101
00:04:55.004 --> 00:04:59.003
For example, if you need credits in humanities,

102
00:04:59.003 --> 00:05:01.004
maybe there's a digital media class

103
00:05:01.004 --> 00:05:05.007
you might take to learn to create digital graphics.

104
00:05:05.007 --> 00:05:07.009
You'll also gain access to events

105
00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:11.006
like career fairs and seminars hosted by your university

106
00:05:11.006 --> 00:05:13.009
that can expose you to new ideas

107
00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:16.008
and develop your professional network.

108
00:05:16.008 --> 00:05:20.003
If you have the opportunity to attend a university,

109
00:05:20.003 --> 00:05:22.001
you'll never get set back

110
00:05:22.001 --> 00:05:24.008
by a degree requirement for a position.

111
00:05:24.008 --> 00:05:28.008
And in my opinion, it provides the path of least resistance

112
00:05:28.008 --> 00:05:31.007
into a software development career.

113
00:05:31.007 --> 00:05:33.006
That's just my opinion,

114
00:05:33.006 --> 00:05:37.001
it doesn't mean college is the right choice for everyone,

115
00:05:37.001 --> 00:05:40.002
that's your personal decision.

116
00:05:40.002 --> 00:05:43.007
Carefully consider and research these three options

117
00:05:43.007 --> 00:05:47.000
and make the best choice for your situation.
