00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:03.006
- Communication is important in every role,

2
00:00:03.006 --> 00:00:06.003
but in a leadership role, it's essential.

3
00:00:06.003 --> 00:00:09.007
And it's a little different because you'll be communicating

4
00:00:09.007 --> 00:00:12.004
with a wider and more diverse audience

5
00:00:12.004 --> 00:00:14.007
to get things done.

6
00:00:14.007 --> 00:00:17.003
In a single day, you may need to communicate

7
00:00:17.003 --> 00:00:20.005
with your team, partners in the business you support,

8
00:00:20.005 --> 00:00:22.000
your senior leadership,

9
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.005
and other teams that you must collaborate with.

10
00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:29.005
Each of those audiences will have different motivations,

11
00:00:29.005 --> 00:00:32.008
so you'll need to structure and frame your interactions

12
00:00:32.008 --> 00:00:37.005
with them so they're on target and at the right level.

13
00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:40.007
For example, in a work session with your team

14
00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:44.008
you might get deep into the technical details of a solution,

15
00:00:44.008 --> 00:00:47.004
but when the same solution is presented

16
00:00:47.004 --> 00:00:50.006
to senior leadership, they'll be more interested

17
00:00:50.006 --> 00:00:54.002
in its schedule, costs, and the benefits it delivers

18
00:00:54.002 --> 00:00:56.006
to the business.

19
00:00:56.006 --> 00:00:58.009
During these daily interactions,

20
00:00:58.009 --> 00:01:02.001
it's best to lean towards overcommunication

21
00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:03.007
to ensure you've conveyed

22
00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:07.005
or understood the message correctly.

23
00:01:07.005 --> 00:01:11.007
Listen intently when someone's sharing information with you.

24
00:01:11.007 --> 00:01:14.002
And if you're not clear after that,

25
00:01:14.002 --> 00:01:17.008
try to confirm the key points or agreements you reached

26
00:01:17.008 --> 00:01:21.007
by reflecting them back to them.

27
00:01:21.007 --> 00:01:23.006
In all communications,

28
00:01:23.006 --> 00:01:26.005
the primary goal is to be understood

29
00:01:26.005 --> 00:01:29.003
or to understand the other person.

30
00:01:29.003 --> 00:01:31.004
So you need to avoid the pitfall

31
00:01:31.004 --> 00:01:33.005
of attempting to impress your audience

32
00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:37.006
with overly complex jargon and grandstanding.

33
00:01:37.006 --> 00:01:40.005
If your team's work has high visibility,

34
00:01:40.005 --> 00:01:43.000
you might be asked to present information about it

35
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.009
to your organization, your department, senior leaders,

36
00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.004
or any other group that might benefit

37
00:01:49.004 --> 00:01:51.009
from an understanding of your work.

38
00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.009
So you need to be comfortable speaking in public.

39
00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.000
The trick here is preparation and practice.

40
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.004
Lots of it,

41
00:02:00.004 --> 00:02:03.004
because the more times you repeat your message,

42
00:02:03.004 --> 00:02:07.002
the more comfortably and clearly you'll deliver it.

43
00:02:07.002 --> 00:02:09.009
These are also great opportunities

44
00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.008
to share the spotlight with your team.

45
00:02:12.008 --> 00:02:15.005
By getting them involved in the presentation,

46
00:02:15.005 --> 00:02:17.005
you can highlight their contributions

47
00:02:17.005 --> 00:02:19.008
and build a sense of ownership.

48
00:02:19.008 --> 00:02:22.004
Just make sure they're comfortable

49
00:02:22.004 --> 00:02:24.005
and prepared to speak to the audience

50
00:02:24.005 --> 00:02:28.002
by working closely with them to craft a clear message

51
00:02:28.002 --> 00:02:32.002
and holding dry runs to practice the presentation.

52
00:02:32.002 --> 00:02:35.001
When presenting to senior audiences,

53
00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:38.004
run your key points past influential individuals

54
00:02:38.004 --> 00:02:41.005
in the audience that you know, ahead of time,

55
00:02:41.005 --> 00:02:46.000
they might have some insights to help clarify your message,

56
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and it helps to generate some support for it.

57
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.002
In your communications, you'll benefit tremendously

58
00:02:53.002 --> 00:02:55.003
from being able to create graphics

59
00:02:55.003 --> 00:02:59.000
that express your vision and technical ideas.

60
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.002
Having diagrams that provide different views of your system

61
00:03:03.002 --> 00:03:07.004
or that depict key milestones on your team's roadmap,

62
00:03:07.004 --> 00:03:10.005
provide a visual aid that will help others better

63
00:03:10.005 --> 00:03:12.009
understand them and allow you

64
00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:16.001
to collect more valuable feedback.

65
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:19.008
You'll often be able to reuse these materials

66
00:03:19.008 --> 00:03:22.006
with different audiences and situations.

67
00:03:22.006 --> 00:03:25.005
So it always pays to make the investment

68
00:03:25.005 --> 00:03:28.007
in visually depicting your ideas.

69
00:03:28.007 --> 00:03:31.007
The process of building these graphics will also

70
00:03:31.007 --> 00:03:35.001
help you clarify and refine your approach.

71
00:03:35.001 --> 00:03:38.005
There's a lot of options for creating nice graphics

72
00:03:38.005 --> 00:03:40.006
that convey your message.

73
00:03:40.006 --> 00:03:44.006
In my work, I primarily use PowerPoint, Visio,

74
00:03:44.006 --> 00:03:48.009
and an open source tool named InkScape.

75
00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:51.003
Each of these tools gives you the ability

76
00:03:51.003 --> 00:03:53.009
to create some pretty complex visuals

77
00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:57.008
if you learn how to use their more advanced features.

78
00:03:57.008 --> 00:04:00.005
Communication is challenging,

79
00:04:00.005 --> 00:04:03.008
messages can get misinterpreted and everyone

80
00:04:03.008 --> 00:04:07.006
has their own communication style and preference.

81
00:04:07.006 --> 00:04:11.008
The more you work to reduce these communication barriers,

82
00:04:11.008 --> 00:04:15.006
the better you'll become at transferring key information

83
00:04:15.006 --> 00:04:18.007
between different groups in your organization,

84
00:04:18.007 --> 00:04:22.000
making you a much more effective leader.
