00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:04.002
- When your resume grabs the attention of a recruiter,

2
00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:08.001
they'll connect with you to begin the interview process.

3
00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:11.002
At this point, it's normal to feel a little nervous

4
00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:14.001
and excited all at the same time.

5
00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:17.004
But if you prepare well, you can go into an interview

6
00:00:17.004 --> 00:00:21.006
with the confidence and energy to land the position.

7
00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:24.009
The key is to understand the company's process

8
00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.006
by learning what to expect at each stage

9
00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:31.007
and then preparing yourself for the situation.

10
00:00:31.007 --> 00:00:34.005
Each company's process will be unique,

11
00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:38.000
so the number of discussions you'll have, and their focus,

12
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.009
is going to be a little different each time.

13
00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:42.002
But in general,

14
00:00:42.002 --> 00:00:46.000
there's some common situations to be prepared for.

15
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.002
The first interview

16
00:00:47.002 --> 00:00:49.004
will likely be a prescreening interview

17
00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:53.002
conducted by a recruiter or the hiring manager.

18
00:00:53.002 --> 00:00:55.001
Typically, these conversations

19
00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:57.007
are meant to determine if there's a potential match

20
00:00:57.007 --> 00:01:00.008
between you, the company, and the position

21
00:01:00.008 --> 00:01:03.006
that's worth exploring further.

22
00:01:03.006 --> 00:01:04.009
During the prescreen,

23
00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:08.000
the conversation normally stays at a high level,

24
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.006
and you should expect some general questions

25
00:01:10.006 --> 00:01:14.008
that focus on your background and prior work experience.

26
00:01:14.008 --> 00:01:17.007
If the hiring manager conducts the pre-screen,

27
00:01:17.007 --> 00:01:21.005
this conversation may include some technical questions

28
00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:25.001
that assess your knowledge of different concepts.

29
00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:28.009
If you advance to the later stages of the interview process,

30
00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:30.008
there are several types of interviews

31
00:01:30.008 --> 00:01:33.000
that you might encounter.

32
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
A common one is a high-level technical interview.

33
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.003
In these interviews,

34
00:01:38.003 --> 00:01:41.002
you can expect to be asked a series of questions

35
00:01:41.002 --> 00:01:45.000
about the technologies important to the position.

36
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
It's not a coding assessment,

37
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.008
but you'll need to reason about different concepts

38
00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:53.002
and describe how you solve technical problems with them

39
00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:55.001
in the past.

40
00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:57.000
Sometimes the technical interview

41
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.004
will mix in some behavioral questions

42
00:01:59.004 --> 00:02:03.004
that assess your personality traits or fit for the company.

43
00:02:03.004 --> 00:02:06.001
You might also be asked these types of questions

44
00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:09.006
in a separate interview dedicated to the topic.

45
00:02:09.006 --> 00:02:12.003
One of the most challenging types of interviews

46
00:02:12.003 --> 00:02:15.001
is the problem-based assessment.

47
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:16.003
In these interviews,

48
00:02:16.003 --> 00:02:20.002
you're given either a coding problem or a design problem,

49
00:02:20.002 --> 00:02:23.007
and then asked to solve it on the spot, in sort of

50
00:02:23.007 --> 00:02:27.007
a paired programming session with the interviewers.

51
00:02:27.007 --> 00:02:29.008
To solve these types of problems,

52
00:02:29.008 --> 00:02:33.004
you'll need to write actual source code, pseudo code,

53
00:02:33.004 --> 00:02:35.007
or do some whiteboarding.

54
00:02:35.007 --> 00:02:38.003
When the interview is conducted remotely,

55
00:02:38.003 --> 00:02:40.006
this is commonly done via screen share

56
00:02:40.006 --> 00:02:43.002
or an online assessment tool.

57
00:02:43.002 --> 00:02:44.009
The best way to understand

58
00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:47.004
the types of interviews you should expect

59
00:02:47.004 --> 00:02:50.002
is to ask the hiring manager or the recruiter

60
00:02:50.002 --> 00:02:53.006
to explain the steps in their process.

61
00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:55.001
Some companies may even

62
00:02:55.001 --> 00:02:58.001
outline their interview process on their website

63
00:02:58.001 --> 00:03:01.007
and provide details about the topics they'll cover.

64
00:03:01.007 --> 00:03:03.006
Once you have this information,

65
00:03:03.006 --> 00:03:05.009
you'll want to start your preparation.

66
00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:08.003
So let's move on to our next lesson

67
00:03:08.003 --> 00:03:12.000
to walk through some strategies for each type of interview.
