00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.009
- Every leadership role is unique in its own way,

2
00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:06.004
but in the software development field,

3
00:00:06.004 --> 00:00:09.005
they fall into two broad categories.

4
00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:13.002
The first is what I call a player-coach role.

5
00:00:13.002 --> 00:00:16.001
This is where in addition to leading the team,

6
00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:19.007
you're also an active developer on it.

7
00:00:19.007 --> 00:00:23.006
These positions have titles like lead software developer

8
00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:26.004
or software engineering lead.

9
00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:28.006
The challenge with this type of role

10
00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:30.005
is being comfortable with delegating

11
00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:32.004
a large portion of the work

12
00:00:32.004 --> 00:00:36.008
so you can dedicate enough time to leading the team.

13
00:00:36.008 --> 00:00:39.005
You might be tempted or feel obligated

14
00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:43.006
to take on the majority of the development, but don't do it.

15
00:00:43.006 --> 00:00:45.004
It causes you to focus less

16
00:00:45.004 --> 00:00:47.008
on the coaching aspect of your position

17
00:00:47.008 --> 00:00:52.001
and prevents the team from reaching its full potential.

18
00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:54.009
When you help individuals build their skills,

19
00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:57.009
it makes the entire team more capable,

20
00:00:57.009 --> 00:01:02.008
which scales much better than doing all the work yourself.

21
00:01:02.008 --> 00:01:06.004
If your team's workload drastically increases,

22
00:01:06.004 --> 00:01:08.008
you'll be glad that you invested the time

23
00:01:08.008 --> 00:01:12.005
to develop members of your team that you can count on

24
00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:16.001
to independently lead a project.

25
00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:19.007
The second category is a pure coaching role,

26
00:01:19.007 --> 00:01:22.009
where your focus is solely on leading the team,

27
00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.006
which does all of the actual development work.

28
00:01:26.006 --> 00:01:30.005
These roles often carry titles like software manager

29
00:01:30.005 --> 00:01:34.000
or software engineering manager.

30
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.004
When promoted into this type of role,

31
00:01:36.004 --> 00:01:38.007
some high-performing developers

32
00:01:38.007 --> 00:01:41.002
find it to be a tough transition

33
00:01:41.002 --> 00:01:44.000
because it can cause a little internal conflict

34
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
for those that pride themselves on their coding abilities.

35
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.003
If you're presented with the opportunity

36
00:01:51.003 --> 00:01:53.006
to take on a leadership position,

37
00:01:53.006 --> 00:01:56.004
make sure you understand and are comfortable with

38
00:01:56.004 --> 00:02:00.003
how your new responsibilities will be allocated.

39
00:02:00.003 --> 00:02:03.006
Don't just go by the title and position description,

40
00:02:03.006 --> 00:02:06.003
because they can be misleading.

41
00:02:06.003 --> 00:02:07.005
Talk to someone

42
00:02:07.005 --> 00:02:10.006
because it could be the turning point in your career

43
00:02:10.006 --> 00:02:14.008
where you begin to diverge away from actually writing code,

44
00:02:14.008 --> 00:02:16.005
and if that's your passion,

45
00:02:16.005 --> 00:02:20.004
you'll want to carefully consider your decision.

46
00:02:20.004 --> 00:02:23.009
In roles where you will not be doing hands-on development,

47
00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:27.005
I recommend starting a personal project outside of work

48
00:02:27.005 --> 00:02:31.001
or contributing to an open source project.

49
00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:33.005
It helps maintain your technical skills

50
00:02:33.005 --> 00:02:37.009
and keeps your knowledge relevant as technology changes.

51
00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:42.003
This allows you to relate to the team as you lead it.

52
00:02:42.003 --> 00:02:45.003
No matter what situation you find yourself in,

53
00:02:45.003 --> 00:02:47.003
leading and building the team

54
00:02:47.003 --> 00:02:51.000
should always be your top priority.

55
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.001
The best leaders are comfortable with and support

56
00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:56.005
high-potential members of their team

57
00:02:56.005 --> 00:03:00.004
as they transition into leaders themselves.

58
00:03:00.004 --> 00:03:03.000
It really allows their teams to excel

59
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.007
and prevents the leader from becoming a bottleneck.

60
00:03:06.007 --> 00:03:09.001
So when your organization hands you

61
00:03:09.001 --> 00:03:11.000
a bit of formal authority,

62
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.009
I encourage you to slice it up

63
00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:15.006
and divide it among the members of your team.

64
00:03:15.006 --> 00:03:20.000
It empowers them, and you'll be amazed at how they respond.
