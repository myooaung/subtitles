00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.001
- When you're first starting out

2
00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:04.005
an internship is a great way to gain

3
00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:06.001
some real world experience

4
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:09.008
and get your foot in the door at a company.

5
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:13.001
Internships are short term work experiences

6
00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:15.004
offered by companies for individuals

7
00:00:15.004 --> 00:00:17.004
to get entry level exposure

8
00:00:17.004 --> 00:00:19.008
to a particular field.

9
00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:23.004
Often, summertime is a popular season for internships,

10
00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:26.007
because most students are on break.

11
00:00:26.007 --> 00:00:30.006
Internships come in all shapes and sizes.

12
00:00:30.006 --> 00:00:34.002
In some cases you'll be placed in an existing team

13
00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:38.000
where you'll work alongside seasoned developers.

14
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.005
Other times companies will place all of the interns

15
00:00:41.005 --> 00:00:44.008
on the same team and assign them a project.

16
00:00:44.008 --> 00:00:47.009
Or you might enter into a rotational program

17
00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:51.002
where you get to try out a few positions.

18
00:00:51.002 --> 00:00:53.004
Some internships will be paid

19
00:00:53.004 --> 00:00:55.006
while others may be unpaid.

20
00:00:55.006 --> 00:00:57.008
In both cases, there's the potential

21
00:00:57.008 --> 00:01:01.007
for an internship to lead to a job offer.

22
00:01:01.007 --> 00:01:03.009
Many colleges and universities

23
00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:06.004
will have established career programs

24
00:01:06.004 --> 00:01:09.001
that help students find internships

25
00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:13.004
which you should take advantage of if you're enrolled.

26
00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:15.005
I recommend that you start early

27
00:01:15.005 --> 00:01:18.005
and pursue an internship each year.

28
00:01:18.005 --> 00:01:20.007
It will provide you with an opportunity

29
00:01:20.007 --> 00:01:24.004
to gain real world experience in the field each summer,

30
00:01:24.004 --> 00:01:27.005
and can help you build up both your technical skills

31
00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:30.005
and your interpersonal skills.

32
00:01:30.005 --> 00:01:33.004
Having multiple internships on your resume

33
00:01:33.004 --> 00:01:36.008
will make you stand out amongst other job candidates.

34
00:01:36.008 --> 00:01:38.005
And you'll have more to talk about

35
00:01:38.005 --> 00:01:41.004
when interviewing for a position.

36
00:01:41.004 --> 00:01:43.004
This approach also helps you build

37
00:01:43.004 --> 00:01:45.009
a network of professionals in the field

38
00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.002
who might open the door

39
00:01:47.002 --> 00:01:49.008
for your first full-time position.

40
00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:53.004
Often companies limit their internship programs

41
00:01:53.004 --> 00:01:56.004
to undergrads or recent graduates.

42
00:01:56.004 --> 00:01:59.009
So if you're self taught or attending a bootcamp

43
00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.009
you may need to take a different approach

44
00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.003
to get an internship.

45
00:02:04.003 --> 00:02:05.009
You may find some internships

46
00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.003
that don't have this requirement,

47
00:02:08.003 --> 00:02:10.002
which present you with an opportunity

48
00:02:10.002 --> 00:02:12.007
to gain some experience.

49
00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:16.006
There's also some great opportunities with nonprofits

50
00:02:16.006 --> 00:02:20.003
which you might consider where you donate some of your time

51
00:02:20.003 --> 00:02:23.001
for on the job experience.

52
00:02:23.001 --> 00:02:25.001
Wherever you land, just make sure

53
00:02:25.001 --> 00:02:26.009
that it's a reputable company

54
00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:30.000
and stay on the lookout for any warning signs

55
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
that might indicate you're being taken advantage of

56
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.009
as unfortunately, this can happen.

57
00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:40.007
Internships have the potential to lead to job offers.

58
00:02:40.007 --> 00:02:44.005
In my experience, companies look to hire interns

59
00:02:44.005 --> 00:02:46.009
that demonstrate leadership potential

60
00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:49.009
and strong problem solving skills.

61
00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:52.003
So throughout your internship

62
00:02:52.003 --> 00:02:54.002
always look for opportunities

63
00:02:54.002 --> 00:02:56.000
to contribute to the team

64
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.005
or to tackle the tough problems.

65
00:02:58.005 --> 00:03:01.001
It will help you get the most from the experience

66
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:04.000
and might lead to your first job.
