00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.002
- Senior software developers are experts

2
00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:06.007
at generalizing a problem and developing a solution

3
00:00:06.007 --> 00:00:09.001
that solves a wider set of problems

4
00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:11.004
than the originally intended.

5
00:00:11.004 --> 00:00:15.001
Let me walk you through an example to show you what I mean.

6
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:18.000
Let's imagine that you received a user story

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.007
in your latest sprint that requires you to update

8
00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:23.006
the authentication mechanism in a service

9
00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:26.008
to use an encrypted token provided by the company's

10
00:00:26.008 --> 00:00:30.001
new identity management platform.

11
00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:31.008
Upon receiving the token,

12
00:00:31.008 --> 00:00:34.009
your service needs to verify its authenticity

13
00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:37.004
with the identity management platform

14
00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:40.007
and then decrypt the token to access information

15
00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:42.009
about the authenticated user,

16
00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:46.001
like their permissions within the system.

17
00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:47.007
You could just write the code

18
00:00:47.007 --> 00:00:50.002
to verify the token and decrypt it

19
00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:52.000
right within your service

20
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.004
and then check the user's permissions in that code.

21
00:00:55.004 --> 00:00:57.007
This would solve the problem.

22
00:00:57.007 --> 00:01:00.003
But then you think about the problem more broadly

23
00:01:00.003 --> 00:01:02.008
and recognize that your system consists

24
00:01:02.008 --> 00:01:06.005
of dozens of services that need to authenticate the user

25
00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:09.000
and check their system permissions.

26
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.008
So you package your code into a library

27
00:01:11.008 --> 00:01:15.002
that can be shared across all your services.

28
00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:16.001
Excellent.

29
00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:18.006
So now you have some reusability,

30
00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:21.007
but what about all the other development teams

31
00:01:21.007 --> 00:01:23.005
in your organization?

32
00:01:23.005 --> 00:01:24.005
They will need to use

33
00:01:24.005 --> 00:01:27.009
the new identity management platform as well.

34
00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.003
So after stewing it over a bit,

35
00:01:30.003 --> 00:01:33.000
you decide to abstract the parts of your code

36
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.002
that perform the permissions checks

37
00:01:35.002 --> 00:01:38.009
and pull the information specific to your system service

38
00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.008
out into a configuration file.

39
00:01:41.008 --> 00:01:45.001
Now your library can be used by other development teams

40
00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:47.009
in your organization to authenticate users

41
00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.005
and obtain information about them.

42
00:01:50.005 --> 00:01:53.006
Not only have you met your task for the sprint,

43
00:01:53.006 --> 00:01:56.004
you've solved an organization-wide problem

44
00:01:56.004 --> 00:01:58.007
and problems you'll face in the future

45
00:01:58.007 --> 00:02:02.002
when a new service needs to do the same work.

46
00:02:02.002 --> 00:02:04.009
So that's just a contrived example

47
00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.002
of how a problem can be solved at a larger scale.

48
00:02:08.002 --> 00:02:12.002
And not every problem will have such broad applicability,

49
00:02:12.002 --> 00:02:14.007
but it shows the big picture mindset

50
00:02:14.007 --> 00:02:16.008
that more senior developers apply

51
00:02:16.008 --> 00:02:19.006
when thinking about a problem.

52
00:02:19.006 --> 00:02:21.004
As you go about your work,

53
00:02:21.004 --> 00:02:24.005
keep an eye out for opportunities to solve problems

54
00:02:24.005 --> 00:02:27.002
that span multiple teams and departments

55
00:02:27.002 --> 00:02:29.006
within your organization.

56
00:02:29.006 --> 00:02:32.007
You might identify the need for common libraries,

57
00:02:32.007 --> 00:02:36.007
shared services, automation or process improvements needed

58
00:02:36.007 --> 00:02:39.002
across your organization.

59
00:02:39.002 --> 00:02:40.009
The impact you can achieve

60
00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:43.008
with a little second level thinking is amazing

61
00:02:43.008 --> 00:02:47.005
and it will of your reputation as a big picture thinker

62
00:02:47.005 --> 00:02:51.000
that's ready to tackle more advanced problems.
