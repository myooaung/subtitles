00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:02.009
- Once you've decided to explore a career

2
00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:04.006
in software development,

3
00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:06.003
it's important to establish goals

4
00:00:06.003 --> 00:00:08.009
that will guide your learning progression.

5
00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:11.000
When creating these goals,

6
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.009
I recommend using a top-down approach.

7
00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:18.000
It's best to start out by defining your long-term goals

8
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.007
then break them down into short-term goals

9
00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:23.000
that will help you accomplish them.

10
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.009
Your goal should be specific to you

11
00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.001
but let's look at some examples of long-term goals

12
00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:31.004
for when you're just starting out.

13
00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:34.007
One long-term goal for most new developers

14
00:00:34.007 --> 00:00:37.000
is to build a small website

15
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.005
using the foundational web technologies.

16
00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:42.004
It might look something like this:

17
00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:44.005
over the next six months,

18
00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:50.003
I'll build my own blog using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

19
00:00:50.003 --> 00:00:53.006
This goal is well structured because it's time-boxed

20
00:00:53.006 --> 00:00:56.007
and targets specific front-end technologies

21
00:00:56.007 --> 00:00:59.007
you'll need to learn to build the blog.

22
00:00:59.007 --> 00:01:03.001
It also specifies a clear outcome

23
00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:05.002
which is the project you'll build

24
00:01:05.002 --> 00:01:07.000
to gain hands-on experience

25
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.007
working with each web technology.

26
00:01:09.007 --> 00:01:11.007
After you build the blog,

27
00:01:11.007 --> 00:01:13.006
you can use it to showcase your skills

28
00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:15.003
with potential employers

29
00:01:15.003 --> 00:01:17.000
and can iterate upon it

30
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.002
to practice the next set of skills you'll want to learn.

31
00:01:21.002 --> 00:01:22.009
For example,

32
00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.005
maybe you'll establish another long-term goal

33
00:01:25.005 --> 00:01:29.008
to learn about Java and do some back-end development

34
00:01:29.008 --> 00:01:32.000
in the last six months of the year.

35
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.005
Once you learn the basics of Java,

36
00:01:34.005 --> 00:01:36.005
you can enhance the blog

37
00:01:36.005 --> 00:01:40.003
to store and retrieve its post from a database.

38
00:01:40.003 --> 00:01:43.006
Or if you want to learn a JavaScript framework,

39
00:01:43.006 --> 00:01:45.006
you can update the front-end

40
00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:48.008
to use something like Angular or React.

41
00:01:48.008 --> 00:01:51.002
Whatever your goals might be,

42
00:01:51.002 --> 00:01:53.002
make sure they have a completion date

43
00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:54.009
and one that's achievable.

44
00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.006
This lets you advance at a sustainable pace,

45
00:01:58.006 --> 00:01:59.005
and it's important

46
00:01:59.005 --> 00:02:01.006
for scheduling your development.

47
00:02:01.006 --> 00:02:05.003
When setting up long-term goals at this stage

48
00:02:05.003 --> 00:02:07.009
it's important to make them progressive.

49
00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.007
Initially, you'll want to target foundational skills.

50
00:02:11.007 --> 00:02:14.000
So for the front-end,

51
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.007
it's the web technologies,

52
00:02:15.007 --> 00:02:19.000
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

53
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.005
And for the back-end,

54
00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:24.000
you'll want to stick with popular server-side languages,

55
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.002
like Java,

56
00:02:25.002 --> 00:02:26.003
C#,

57
00:02:26.003 --> 00:02:29.004
Python, or Node.js.

58
00:02:29.004 --> 00:02:32.008
Early on, it's really important to sequence these goals

59
00:02:32.008 --> 00:02:34.005
in the right order.

60
00:02:34.005 --> 00:02:36.002
If you tried to learn a framework

61
00:02:36.002 --> 00:02:39.004
like React before the web technologies,

62
00:02:39.004 --> 00:02:41.006
you're going to end up frustrated,

63
00:02:41.006 --> 00:02:44.009
it would be like trying to learn algebra

64
00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:47.005
before you learned basic arithmetic.

65
00:02:47.005 --> 00:02:52.005
It'll be tempting to include some career goals at this point

66
00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:56.004
but I suggest keeping your initial goals learning-oriented.

67
00:02:56.004 --> 00:02:59.009
Then, after completing a few short-term goals,

68
00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:02.007
you'll have more information to decide

69
00:03:02.007 --> 00:03:04.000
if you want to invest further

70
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.008
in pursuing a career in software development.

71
00:03:07.008 --> 00:03:11.003
So let's talk about those short-term goals.

72
00:03:11.003 --> 00:03:13.009
Here's where you get a little bit more specific

73
00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:16.001
and break down what you need to do

74
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:18.003
to achieve your long-term goals.

75
00:03:18.003 --> 00:03:20.001
Let me show you how,

76
00:03:20.001 --> 00:03:23.003
by breaking down one of the example long-term goals

77
00:03:23.003 --> 00:03:24.007
we discussed.

78
00:03:24.007 --> 00:03:28.005
Before diving into any specific languages,

79
00:03:28.005 --> 00:03:30.003
I'd set a short-term goal

80
00:03:30.003 --> 00:03:33.007
to just learn the purpose of each web technology

81
00:03:33.007 --> 00:03:36.006
and how they work to build a webpage.

82
00:03:36.006 --> 00:03:40.005
Something like learn how web technologies interact

83
00:03:40.005 --> 00:03:42.001
to form a webpage.

84
00:03:42.001 --> 00:03:45.007
Then I would recommend moving on to HTML

85
00:03:45.007 --> 00:03:47.007
because both CSS and JavaScript

86
00:03:47.007 --> 00:03:51.002
rely upon it being present in the browser,

87
00:03:51.002 --> 00:03:54.001
which you would learn from the first goal.

88
00:03:54.001 --> 00:03:56.008
So let's tie this one together.

89
00:03:56.008 --> 00:04:01.001
We'll say that we want to learn about HTML tags

90
00:04:01.001 --> 00:04:04.003
and how they're structured to build the basic web pages

91
00:04:04.003 --> 00:04:06.003
in my blog.

92
00:04:06.003 --> 00:04:09.004
After you learn the basics of HTML,

93
00:04:09.004 --> 00:04:12.003
you'll probably want to style those web pages.

94
00:04:12.003 --> 00:04:15.000
So let's create another short-term goal

95
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.008
to learn how to use CSS roles

96
00:04:17.008 --> 00:04:21.004
to style and lay out the pages in the blog.

97
00:04:21.004 --> 00:04:22.008
Then you might move on

98
00:04:22.008 --> 00:04:24.002
to learn how JavaScript

99
00:04:24.002 --> 00:04:27.003
can make your page a bit more dynamic.

100
00:04:27.003 --> 00:04:30.001
This will be a little more difficult to learn

101
00:04:30.001 --> 00:04:33.000
since it's a full-blown programming language,

102
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.007
so let's chunk this out into a few separate goals.

103
00:04:36.007 --> 00:04:39.007
First, I would aim to learn some basics

104
00:04:39.007 --> 00:04:41.006
of a programming language,

105
00:04:41.006 --> 00:04:42.009
and then apply those

106
00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:46.003
to create some small JavaScript programs.

107
00:04:46.003 --> 00:04:49.001
Once you're comfortable with the basics,

108
00:04:49.001 --> 00:04:50.007
you can apply that knowledge

109
00:04:50.007 --> 00:04:53.007
to learning how to work with HTML elements

110
00:04:53.007 --> 00:04:57.004
in the browser with JavaScript web APIs.

111
00:04:57.004 --> 00:05:01.000
You'll want to support that goal with some project work,

112
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.002
something like adding a filtering capability

113
00:05:04.002 --> 00:05:08.001
to your blog that allows users to search for posts.

114
00:05:08.001 --> 00:05:11.009
Now that we've established a long-term goal

115
00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:13.001
and broke it down

116
00:05:13.001 --> 00:05:16.003
into some progressively sequenced short-term goals,

117
00:05:16.003 --> 00:05:20.001
we can turn this into an actionable learning plan

118
00:05:20.001 --> 00:05:24.000
which is where we'll pick up in the next lesson.
