00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:03.005
- Delivering software is a multi-team sport

2
00:00:03.005 --> 00:00:06.009
that requires collaboration amongst the individuals

3
00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:12.002
on a team and across different teams in an organization.

4
00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:14.002
When working in a larger company,

5
00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:17.006
figuring out exactly where you fit in that picture

6
00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:20.007
and how to work within it can be challenging.

7
00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:24.006
So let's talk a bit about teams, organizations,

8
00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:26.009
and how they work.

9
00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:30.001
The goal of most software development teams is to build

10
00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:33.002
or maintain products that are used internally

11
00:00:33.002 --> 00:00:34.008
by their organization

12
00:00:34.008 --> 00:00:38.003
or provided for use by their customers.

13
00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:39.007
To achieve that goal,

14
00:00:39.007 --> 00:00:43.002
the members of a team must be a able to communicate well,

15
00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:45.009
collaborate effectively, and trust each other

16
00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:48.004
as they go about their work.

17
00:00:48.004 --> 00:00:51.007
Half that occurs will be different for each team.

18
00:00:51.007 --> 00:00:55.002
However, many teams adopt an approach that is based

19
00:00:55.002 --> 00:00:58.003
on agile values and frameworks.

20
00:00:58.003 --> 00:01:02.006
One of the most popular agile frameworks is scrum.

21
00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:07.001
Initially all new work items for the product are explained

22
00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:10.007
in a user story that is placed into a backlog,

23
00:01:10.007 --> 00:01:14.006
which is kind of like a to-do list for the team.

24
00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:17.007
From this backlog, the team and product owner

25
00:01:17.007 --> 00:01:20.002
pull the top priority work items

26
00:01:20.002 --> 00:01:23.000
to build the plan for each sprint.

27
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.003
A sprint is a time box period

28
00:01:25.003 --> 00:01:28.000
where the development team works on the items

29
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
they planned and agreed to with the product owner.

30
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
During the sprint,

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
the team scrum master facilitates several ceremonies

32
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.007
where the team collaborates upon the work in the sprint

33
00:01:40.007 --> 00:01:45.001
and reflects upon how to improve their agile processes.

34
00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:47.007
You'll be a member of the development team.

35
00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:52.005
So each sprint, items will be assigned to you to work on.

36
00:01:52.005 --> 00:01:53.008
While completing them,

37
00:01:53.008 --> 00:01:57.001
you'll collaborate with other developers on the team,

38
00:01:57.001 --> 00:02:00.002
the scrum master and the product owner.

39
00:02:00.002 --> 00:02:03.002
The typical roles in the scrum framework.

40
00:02:03.002 --> 00:02:07.004
So that's your immediate team, but to deliver your product

41
00:02:07.004 --> 00:02:09.004
you'll likely need to collaborate

42
00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:12.002
with other teams in the organization

43
00:02:12.002 --> 00:02:15.007
which can be a little tricky when you're new.

44
00:02:15.007 --> 00:02:17.003
As a software developer,

45
00:02:17.003 --> 00:02:19.009
I've collaborated with almost every type

46
00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:23.002
of team you can imagine to get the job done.

47
00:02:23.002 --> 00:02:26.009
Other development teams, platform teams, security teams,

48
00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:31.003
legal teams, executive teams, lots of great teams.

49
00:02:31.003 --> 00:02:33.007
I cannot predict who you'll be working with

50
00:02:33.007 --> 00:02:36.002
or how your organization is structured,

51
00:02:36.002 --> 00:02:38.002
but I can give you some tips for working

52
00:02:38.002 --> 00:02:41.002
effectively across your organization.

53
00:02:41.002 --> 00:02:42.000
To start out,

54
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.003
you'll want to get familiar with your company's

55
00:02:44.003 --> 00:02:47.003
organizational structure so that you know

56
00:02:47.003 --> 00:02:49.006
where different teams fall within it

57
00:02:49.006 --> 00:02:52.007
and where to go to get things done.

58
00:02:52.007 --> 00:02:55.001
As soon as you know that something is required

59
00:02:55.001 --> 00:02:57.008
from another team and have a decent understanding

60
00:02:57.008 --> 00:03:00.005
of what's needed, it's best to reach out to them.

61
00:03:00.005 --> 00:03:02.000
Don't wait.

62
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.008
Just because an item is your top priority,

63
00:03:04.008 --> 00:03:07.004
it doesn't mean it's their top priority.

64
00:03:07.004 --> 00:03:10.008
So you want to give them visibility of your item quickly

65
00:03:10.008 --> 00:03:14.002
and get it prioritized in their work queue.

66
00:03:14.002 --> 00:03:15.002
To do this,

67
00:03:15.002 --> 00:03:17.003
you'll need to understand how the team

68
00:03:17.003 --> 00:03:19.007
receives requests for new work.

69
00:03:19.007 --> 00:03:23.001
It could be as simple and as quick as a chat message

70
00:03:23.001 --> 00:03:25.001
or you might need to submit a ticket

71
00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:28.000
through a more formal process.

72
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.001
Once you begin to collaborate with the other team,

73
00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:33.006
it helps to keep the interactions positive

74
00:03:33.006 --> 00:03:36.009
by sharing your appreciation for their work.

75
00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:39.006
It's always exciting to meet and interact

76
00:03:39.006 --> 00:03:41.002
with smart new people.

77
00:03:41.002 --> 00:03:44.009
So make sure you dedicate time in your new position

78
00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:46.005
to building the relationships

79
00:03:46.005 --> 00:03:49.001
that will make you and your team successful

80
00:03:49.001 --> 00:03:51.000
over the long term.
