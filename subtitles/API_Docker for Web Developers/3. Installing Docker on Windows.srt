1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,640
Now let's switch over to the Windows side.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,470
Recall earlier that I mentioned that there's a few options for Windows

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,140
depending on what version of the operating system you have.

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,780
If you're on Windows 7 or 8 or even Windows 10 Home,

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,530
then you're going to have to go with Docker Toolbox

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,440
because you won't have access to Hyper‑V.

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,810
If you're on Windows 10 Pro or higher, then you will have Hyper‑V accessibility,

8
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,900
and therefore you could install the preferred version,

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,240
which would be Docker Desktop.

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,720
Now I'm going to walk you through how to get started with both,

11
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,660
but we're going to focus on Docker Desktop in the install

12
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,540
and throughout this course overall.

13
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,970
So the first thing to talk about is Docker Toolbox.

14
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:44,830
And as you can see on the web page here,

15
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:49,090
this is the legacy desktop solution if you don't have Hyper‑V available.

16
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,740
This will run VirtualBox instead.

17
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,140
And the good news is you can still run images and containers and

18
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,690
do all these commands we're going to learn.

19
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,440
It's just a older way to do it, but it definitely works.

20
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:06,090
Now you can go to docker.com/docker‑toolbox. And from here

21
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,540
down at the bottom, you can install it for Windows, and then

22
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,440
they have some instructions.

23
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,570
Now I'm not going to be running that one here,

24
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,330
but I'll let you if you need that. Go to this link,

25
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:17,410
get it installed.

26
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,740
If you need any help with that,

27
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:23,840
refer to the install instructions that they provide.

28
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,920
Now for Docker Desktop, it's going to look identical to what you saw on Mac.

29
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,940
We can scroll on down. We can click Download for Windows.

30
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:39,340
Once this executable comes down, we can simply run through the install routine.

31
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,900
All right, so now that's done.

32
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,940
Let's go ahead and open the file.

33
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:47,540
I'll go ahead and approve doing that.

34
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,090
And now this is going to start a download routine that will

35
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,210
get everything we need. Now in my case,

36
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,440
I already have this installed on this machine.

37
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,800
So it's going to be really fast,

38
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,240
as you see here. It says existing installation is up

39
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,640
to date, and I'll just close that.

40
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,720
But for you, you're going to have to run through it.

41
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,570
It'll take a little bit of time to get it going, of course.

42
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:12,240
Now from there, we can then go run Docker.

43
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,470
So if we come on down to the Start menu, we can type docker, and

44
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:22,060
there's Docker Desktop. Now what'll happen is this will go down in our

45
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,000
tray in kind of the right‑hand corner here.

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,540
So let me go ahead and go to that.

47
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,160
And you can see that our whale is currently starting up, and we now have a

48
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,180
message that says Docker is starting. Let me click that again, and then

49
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:39,240
we'll just wait a little bit for this to get going.

50
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,540
All right, so now that's done.

51
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,950
We can do much like we did on Mac I can right‑click.

52
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,280
Instead of Preferences,

53
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,340
I can come up to Settings. And the settings are going to look

54
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,160
pretty identical to what you see on the Mac side.

55
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,170
There's a few differences here and there,

56
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:55,750
but it's very,

57
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,950
very similar now. So we can start once we log in, automatically check for

58
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:06,190
updates. We can even expose some TCP ports here and do even more if you

59
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:11,410
have Windows subsystem for Linux going. We can come down to resources, set

60
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:17,080
our CPUs, our memory, our swap, and image size. Turn on volume sharing.

61
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,610
Notice that I have C drive exposed here. And again, we'll talk more about

62
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:24,380
what a volume is and why you'd use it with containers a little bit later in

63
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,740
the course.

64
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,840
If you deal with proxies, you can configure that.

65
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,140
And then just some general networking here.

66
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:35,770
Now Docker Engine, this again is something we normally don't have to touch.

67
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:39,310
Same with command line, more experimental in this case.

68
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:42,110
And then I've already talked about there's this other tool called Kubernetes,

69
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:46,440
which you can also enable here if you'd like to.

70
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,820
Now if we cancel out of this, we'll get to the dashboard again.

71
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,760
And this time,

72
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:56,000
notice I have quite a bit going. They're all stopped, but I have quite a

73
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,430
lot going here you'll see. So I could actually start to just clean these

74
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,580
up if I wanted. We could start deleting these,

75
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,740
but I'll go ahead and leave these.

76
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:07,040
But it's very much like what you saw with Mac.

77
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,350
I can actually come on in and start my containers,

78
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:15,340
stop them, delete them, and do more, get to the logs and other things we saw.

79
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,170
So as an example,

80
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:21,250
we could click on maybe this ASP.NET PostgreSQL Docker one, and

81
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,340
notice it's exited. But I could start that back up.

82
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,940
Then we could get to the logs and do all kinds of fun stuff there.

83
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,740
So there's a lot of great stuff you can do with this dashboard.

84
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,840
And although we're going to focus on the core Docker commands,

85
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,000
knowing about this is nice.

86
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,250
I don't use it every day,

87
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,940
but every now and then it's just easier to come into here to do certain things.

88
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:50,000
So that's how easy it is to get either Docker Toolbox or Docker Desktop going on Windows.
