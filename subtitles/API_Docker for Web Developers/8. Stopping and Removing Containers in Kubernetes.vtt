00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.440
Now that you've seen how to get containers up and running on Kubernetes,

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.470
let's take a look at a final command on how to stop and remove containers

3
00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.540
that might be inside of Kubernetes pods.

4
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.340
Now, earlier, you saw me used the kubectl command to delete,

5
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.140
and we deleted a specific item and that particular item was a deployment.

6
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.440
Now that led to everything that the deployment created being deleted as well.

7
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:28.610
Well,

8
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.050
in cases where we have multiple Docker Compose services that have been

9
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.840
converted into deployments and services for Kubernetes, we can use the same

10
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.140
type of command, but we can use the folderName.

11
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.680
So instead of kubectl delete deployment and then the name of

12
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.170
the deployment, we can actually say hey,

13
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.580
here's a folder, go ahead and run everything in there and undo it, delete

14
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.840
it, and that makes it very easy to clean up everything.

15
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.890
So let's take a look at how we can do that with the existing

16
00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.440
app that we got running in Kubernetes.

17
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.740
So coming back to the console earlier where we did the port forward command,

18
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.120
we can go ahead and stop that, but doing that, of course,

19
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.440
just keeps everything running.

20
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.540
We're just not forwarding that port any longer.

21
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.350
So if we do a kubectl and we get the pods, we're going to see all the pods.

22
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.890
Now, I could delete each individual pod,

23
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.140
of course,

24
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.330
but because we already have all the manifest definitions for

25
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.440
the deployments and the services defined,

26
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.580
we could go ahead and do a delete command that simply

27
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.740
points to this folder as you saw.

28
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.690
So we can do a kubectl delete and then we'll give it

29
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.740
the path to the Kubernetes folder.

30
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.960
Now doing this is going to go ahead and run everything that

31
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.110
you see in this folder off to the left, but kind of in reverse,

32
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.240
if you will.

33
00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.540
So, in essence, when we first ran this and we applied these different files,

34
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.340
we were creating the future, if you will.

35
00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.540
Now we're kind of reversing time.

36
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.810
We're going back to what we originally had. So we'll give it a sec,

37
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.530
and now I'll come in and do a kubectl on the pods and you'll notice

38
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.390
there are still a few there, some are gone,

39
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.840
but they're terminating you'll see in the status there.

40
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.940
Now if we come in and get the services,

41
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.140
everything is gone at this point, except for the cluster IP for Kubernetes.

42
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.970
All the different services we started earlier have been cleaned up.

43
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.440
Now let's go back finally to our pods and let's see where we're at here

44
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.840
and there we go. Now everything has been cleaned up.

45
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.330
So by using the kubectl delete command with a ‑f switch, that

46
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.770
provides a really easy way to get our containers not only

47
00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.640
stopped, but completely removed.

48
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.540
And then, of course, we also saw earlier how ‑f could be used with the apply,

49
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.480
and that makes it very easy to apply deployments or services and

50
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.640
get our containers up and running and talking.

51
00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.930
So that provides an example of some of the different kubectl

52
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.160
commands and I hope that gets you started.

53
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.000
There is a lot more we could talk about,

54
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.440
of course,

55
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.620
with Kubernetes, but the goal of this particular module was

56
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:14.000
to move from Docker Compose to Kubernetes, and we've now got that process going.
