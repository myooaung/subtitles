00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.440
Now that we have Docker installed,

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.040
we can start working with the different command line tools that it provides.

3
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.350
Before we do that, though,

4
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.270
I want to talk about an additional tool that's

5
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.650
available called Docker Kitematic.

6
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.260
And although we're not going to be using it throughout the course,

7
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.100
it's a great way to visually see what are images and what are

8
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.430
containers, and you can even pull down images and start up

9
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.360
containers right there on your machine very,

10
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.640
very easily.

11
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.040
Let's take a quick look at what it offers.

12
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.660
So Docker Kitematic is a GUI tool that makes it really

13
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.540
easy to work with images and containers.

14
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.220
And as I mentioned,

15
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.170
we're going to be using command line for everything

16
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.320
throughout the rest of the course, but I like Kitematic

17
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.760
simply because if you're new to Docker,

18
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.610
really haven't played with images or containers, or at this

19
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.360
point don't even really know what those are,

20
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.960
so we'll be providing more details as we move along, then this will provide

21
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.400
a really easy way to get started. Now, it allows you to visually search on

22
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.240
something called Docker Hub for these images,

23
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.010
and the image can then be downloaded to your machine,

24
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.240
and then you can create, run, and manage containers using this GUI.

25
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.320
So just with a few clicks of the button,

26
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.640
you can actually issue commands behind the scenes that we'll be

27
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.620
learning about later that you would normally have to do on the command

28
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.840
line, but Kitematic kind of hides that from us.

29
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.170
So if somebody wanted to play around with images and containers and

30
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.760
doesn't know the cmdlet at all or really doesn't use it,

31
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.840
Kitematic would certainly be an option, but I think even if

32
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.620
you are going to be using command line,

33
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:44.000
then it's nice to know about at least and interesting to explore. So let's go ahead and take a look at Docker Kitematic in action.
