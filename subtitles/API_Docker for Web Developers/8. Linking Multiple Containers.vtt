As you've walked through the different samples in this module,

2
00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.630
you might have wondered,

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.870
do I really have to type so many commands to link up

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.520
multiple containers to each other? Obviously,

5
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.570
if you only have two or so containers,

6
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.620
it's not that big of a deal, but as you start adding more and more and more,

7
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.890
it starts to convolute things and definitely make it a little

8
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.600
bit more challenging to get those containers up and running and

9
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.040
all connected and communicating.

10
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.940
So the good news is there is an easier way.

11
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.150
If you do have the scenario where you have a web server and a database

12
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.410
and a caching server and more, then in the next module,

13
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.890
we're going to learn how we can apply all the different topics we've talked

14
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.560
about here and put those into something called Docker Compose.

15
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.750
And as you could see by their logo for Docker Compose,

16
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.410
it's good at juggling and really managing multiple

17
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.640
containers in a way that's really, really easy to work with.

18
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.990
And so the good news is while you might use some of the

19
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.220
commands that I showed throughout this module just to get up

20
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.230
one or two containers for sure, if you have requirements that say,

21
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.220
hey, we have, you know,

22
00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.030
four or five containers maybe, or maybe even more, then it is

23
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.270
a lot easier to use this other tool that's part of the Docker

24
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.920
Toolbox called Docker Compose.

25
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:29.000
And so we're going to be covering that in the next module, something for you to look forward to.
