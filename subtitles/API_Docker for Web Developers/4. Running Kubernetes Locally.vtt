00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.330
Getting Kubernetes up and running locally is actually

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.940
a fairly straightforward process, and there's multiple options you can choose.

3
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.200
One option is called minikube.

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.030
Now this does require some setup work,

5
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.430
and you'd need to run off to the GitHub site shown here and

6
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.340
follow those directions to get it up and running.

7
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.430
Now the other option is what I'm going to be demonstrating,

8
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.440
and that is Docker Desktop, formerly called Docker Community Edition.

9
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.700
Now Docker Desktop has Kubernetes support built in out of the box.

10
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.720
So it's going to be as simple as checking a checkbox,

11
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.860
which I'll show you in a moment,

12
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.040
and you can have Kubernetes up and running on your machine.

13
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.630
Either of these options would work,

14
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.240
and if you have the luxury of being able to run Docker Desktop,

15
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.440
that'll certainly be the easiest one.

16
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.740
But minikube might option if you need to go that route.

17
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.160
So now that we've talked about that,

18
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.670
let me jump over to the Mac side and then the Windows side,

19
00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.540
and I'll show you how easy it is to enable Kubernetes support in Docker Desktop.

20
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.340
So on Mac, you can come up to the Docker whale icon,

21
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:09.040
and you'll see that I already have Docker Desktop and Kubernetes running.

22
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.840
But if I go to Preferences, this is where you can enable it.

23
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.740
So along the top tabs, you'll see Kubernetes.

24
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.000
And all you need to do is come on in and check the checkbox,

25
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.540
Enable Kubernetes, and then hit the Apply button.

26
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.720
Now I'm also going to show that there are some options available if you

27
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.780
want to just use a Docker Compose file with Kubernetes.

28
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.810
And to simplify that, you can check this checkbox,

29
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.240
and I'll talk more about that in an upcoming section of this module.

30
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.740
Now on the Windows side, we can come down into the tray,

31
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.440
find our Docker icon, and then rightâ€‘click and go to Settings.

32
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.540
Now just like on the Mac, you're going to have a Kubernetes option.

33
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.440
You'll notice it's definitely a different arrangement, but we can click on that.

34
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.190
And the same thing goes here.

35
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.520
We can check Enable Kubernetes and then hit Apply.

36
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.440
And then, if you'd like to use Docker Compose files to run Kubernetes as well,

37
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.890
then to enable that option, check the checkbox here and hit Apply.

38
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.520
Once you enable Kubernetes,

39
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.550
it does take a little bit of time for it to fire up the first time,

40
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.240
but then you can just leave it up as you're doing your development.

41
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:23.000
And now what we're going to do is talk about different options for getting from Docker Compose into Kubernetes.
