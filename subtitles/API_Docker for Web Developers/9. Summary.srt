Throughout this module,

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:07,800
we've taken a look at how we can move from Docker Compose to Kubernetes and saw

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,630
how Kubernetes provides a robust solution for deployments,

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:15,840
scaling, and overall management of our containers.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,260
By using some of the constructs built into Kubernetes,

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,440
we can provide a way to move to the desired state,

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,710
and we could do that using YAML or even JSON files to represent

8
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,210
that desired state and that's done through our deployment

9
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,840
services and other options available.

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,150
We also talked about how nodes and pods play a

11
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,640
really central role in Kubernetes.

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,540
Now nodes were the VMS,

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:44,140
whereas pods act as a way to group one or more containers together.

14
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,500
We looked at a container running in a pod and saw how we can

15
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,760
even do port forwarding to get to that,

16
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,340
at least while we're on our local machine for testing purposes.

17
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,040
And we looked at several different kubectl commands that could be used to

18
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,240
do things such as run a particular container in a pod,

19
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,310
apply different deployment services and other options available,

20
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:10,820
delete, and much more. So while Kubernetes is a very big topic and I would

21
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,000
highly encourage you to check out some of the other courses on it on

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,290
Pluralsight to get the full breadth of what it offers, I hope this modules

23
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:25,000
provided a nice starting point for you to get you started moving from Docker Compose to Kubernetes.
