00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,050
In this module,

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:04,320
we learned about different options for getting Docker

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,040
running on different operating systems.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,490
We started off by talking about a legacy version

5
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:11,880
that's available called Docker Toolbox,

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,540
and that would be one you might choose if you're on Windows

7
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,530
7 or 8 or even on Windows 10 Home Edition because that

8
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,600
won't have support for Hyperâ€‘V.

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,340
Therefore, you're going to have to go with VirtualBox.

10
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:28,340
Now if you do have Windows 10 Pro or higher or you're on a Mac,

11
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,830
then it's highly recommended, you run Docker Desktop.

12
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:32,760
If you're on Linux,

13
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,200
you can install the Docker engine that I mentioned to paint on

14
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,140
the version of Linux that you're running.

15
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,770
Docker Desktop, as we saw though,

16
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,240
gives you not only direct integration with Docker,

17
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,200
but also a dashboard.

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,120
You can customize different preferences and settings.

19
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,660
So you can set, for instance,

20
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:56,880
the CPUs that are going to be used, memory, swap, size of the virtual machine,

21
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,340
all that type of information.

22
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,840
Not only is it very easy to get going,

23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,580
but it also makes it very easy to interact with. And so

24
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,220
we'll be focusing on Docker Desktop a lot as we move

25
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,940
throughout the rest of the course.

26
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,990
We also took a look at Docker Kitematic,

27
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,140
and although I personally don't use it on realâ€‘life projects,

28
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,690
it does provide a really,

29
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,640
really nice starting point if you're brand new to Docker.

30
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,890
Maybe you've seen nothing about it.

31
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,190
This is the first time you've learned about images and containers,

32
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,930
and you just want to get something going quickly and easily,

33
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:32,960
then you could use Docker Kitematic to do that.

34
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,660
And as you saw,

35
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:38,010
it provides a nice visual way to integrate with downloading the image

36
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:41,290
from Docker Hub and actually running the container,

37
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:45,340
seeing what ports are being used on that container, and more.

38
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,150
So now that we've talked about how to get Docker and the

39
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,940
various tools going on our systems,

40
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:56,000
let's go ahead and move on and dive a little bit deeper into more Docker features.
