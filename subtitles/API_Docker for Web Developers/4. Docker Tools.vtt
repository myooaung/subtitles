00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.340
Before we can get started using Docker, we need to install some Docker tools.

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.960
Now the tools that you install are going to depend on your operating system,

3
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.830
so I'm going to talk through some different options here.

4
00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.380
We'll talk through a legacy option and then a more modern option, and that way,

5
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.470
regardless of what operating system you're on,

6
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.040
you should build to get Docker going.

7
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.640
The first one that we're going to talk about is called Docker Toolbox.

8
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.200
This is a legacy option that at this point is really only for

9
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.410
Windows 7 or 8, or if you don't have Windows 10 Pro,

10
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.940
you just have Windows 10 Home, then you possibly might use it there as well.

11
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.040
Now this provides all the image and container tools though that you would need.

12
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.520
So while it's an older legacy option at this point and it's been

13
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.330
deprecated, it does provide the key tools that you need.

14
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.040
So if you are are on one of these operating systems,

15
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.120
then you could at least get it working.

16
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.270
The way it works is it uses a virtual machine

17
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.540
called VirtualBox to run a Linux VM,

18
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.710
and then the Docker commands that we're going to learn

19
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.800
about are going to execute against this Linux VM that's

20
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.240
going to be running in VirtualBox.

21
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.840
So what do you get with Docker Toolbox?

22
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.520
Well, the first thing you're going to get is the Docker client.

23
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.880
This is going to be really important so that you can communicate with

24
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.820
containers and images and all these different technologies in Docker

25
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.740
that we're going to be talking about.

26
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.530
You're also going to get a tool called Docker Machine, and this will

27
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.750
let you hook up to the virtual machine. Docker Compose we'll have a

28
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.950
whole module on later in the course,

29
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.780
but this provides an orchestration mechanism for bringing up many

30
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.390
containers, 1, 2, 10, or 50 if you wanted, on your machine. And then

31
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.640
another tool is called Docker Kitematic.

32
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.250
This is more of a GUI tool,

33
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.890
and it's not one we're going to spend a lot of time on in this course,

34
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.540
but I will do a quick demo and give you the basics of how it works.

35
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.300
And then finally,

36
00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.240
I mentioned that this is all running in a virtual machine called VirtualBox.

37
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.480
And this is something that actually can stand on its own.

38
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.540
You don't have to have Docker for VirtualBox, but that's what

39
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.640
they use kind of out of the box to run this.

40
00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.040
Now what if you're not on Windows 7 or 8 though? What would you run?

41
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.220
Well, in that case,

42
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.720
you're going to run Docker Desktop. So this is going to be

43
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.840
for Windows 10 Pro or higher or Mac.

44
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.570
So if you're on one of those, you'll definitely want to pick Docker Desktop.

45
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.490
It's much more modern, it's updated frequently,

46
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.040
and it's going to have all these tools at your disposal.

47
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.680
So this also provides image and container tools, but behind the scenes,

48
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.760
it actually uses Hyper‑V on Windows.

49
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.740
That's why you need Windows 10 Pro in this case.

50
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.040
Or if you're on Mac,

51
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.460
it uses HyperKit to run these Linux VMs. So that functionality right

52
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.490
there will be one of the deciding factors on which one you'll be able

53
00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.030
to choose, Docker Toolbox or Docker Desktop.

54
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.040
If you're on Windows and don't have access to Hyper‑V,

55
00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.780
then you're going to have to choose Docker Toolbox.

56
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.440
Whereas if you're on Windows 10 Pro or Mac,

57
00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.240
then you're going to want to go with Docker Desktop.

58
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.950
So as mentioned, this works on Windows or Mac. Now on Linux,

59
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.430
you can run something called Docker Engine,

60
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.470
and it really depends on the flavor of Linux.

61
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.350
There's multiple options if you go to the docs that you can learn about.

62
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.550
But you can also run the Docker Engine there, but it's not the full Docker

63
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.340
Desktop like you'll have on Windows or on Mac.

64
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.840
So what do you get with Docker Desktop?

65
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.540
Well, you're going to get a Docker client again,

66
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.510
Docker Compose,

67
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.300
which is this orchestration mechanism for bringing up and

68
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.010
managing multiple containers, and then you also have access to

69
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.530
this GUI tool called Docker Kitematic.

70
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.580
Now it's not installed by default,

71
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.140
but it will run as long as you have Docker Desktop installed.

72
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.640
So to wrap up our discussion of the different tools,

73
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.440
let's do a quick comparison side by side.

74
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.160
So if you're on Windows 7 or 8,

75
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.240
you're going to have to choose Docker Toolbox. That will install VirtualBox, and

76
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.020
it's going to use a tool called Docker Machine to allow you to connect from your

77
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.040
command line into the running virtual machine.

78
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.440
If you're on Windows 10 Pro or higher or you're on Mac,

79
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.060
then you're going to be using Docker Desktop, and this is the modern version

80
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.520
of Docker. And this uses Hyper‑V if you're on Windows,

81
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.040
that's why you need the Pro version of Windows 10 or higher,

82
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.680
and it uses HyperKit on Mac. Now on Linux, although

83
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.780
you don't install Docker Desktop,

84
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.170
you can install Docker Engine and Docker Compose separately. So it's

85
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.660
possible to get these same types of tools but you're not going to have

86
00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.080
some of the other functionality that I'll be showing you here that you

87
00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.740
would have on Windows or Mac.

88
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:50.000
So that's a quick summary of the different tools that are available. Let's now switch our focus to Docker in action.
