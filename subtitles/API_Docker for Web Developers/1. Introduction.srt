1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,460
Up to this point in the course,

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,560
you've learned about images and containers and even seeing how you can

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:09,340
orchestra multiple containers using Docker Compose.

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,880
And that works great while you're on your development machine, but what do

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,040
you do when you're ready to move to another environment?

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,150
Well, that's we're going to look at in this module.

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,400
So we're going to look at movie from Docker Compose

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,740
to something called Kubernetes.

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,140
Specifically, we're going to cover the following topics.

10
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,610
We're going to talk about how Docker Compose is great for

11
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,780
some things, but not so great for others, and we'll talk

12
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,840
about what's missing there.

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,500
I'll introduce you to Kubernetes and give you some

14
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,240
fundamentals on the basics of what it is.

15
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,290
We'll then talk about how we can convert from a Docker Compose file to some

16
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,940
files that Kubernetes can use to run your containers.

17
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,910
We'll then look at commands you can use in Kubernetes to

18
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,060
actually get your containers up and running and also how you

19
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:59,000
can stop and remove those containers. So let's go ahead and get started.
