00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.004
- Spring Data JPA is a game-changing framework

2
00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:08.000
where we get better functionality while writing less code.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.003
To use Spring Data JPA for a JPA entity,

4
00:00:11.003 --> 00:00:14.001
we declare a Java interface class

5
00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:16.006
that extends from CrudRepository,

6
00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:19.007
where T is the domain type the repository manages,

7
00:00:19.007 --> 00:00:22.004
and ID is the type of the ID of

8
00:00:22.004 --> 00:00:25.001
the entity the repository manages.

9
00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:28.001
So for a Tour we declare a TourRepository

10
00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:30.004
that extends from CrudRepository,

11
00:00:30.004 --> 00:00:32.009
then Spring Data JPA automatically provides

12
00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.009
the methods to create, read, update, and delete Tours.

13
00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:38.005
These are the provided methods

14
00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:42.001
to create or update a Tour in the database.

15
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:46.009
These are the methods to delete Tours from the database.

16
00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:48.009
And finally we have various methods

17
00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:52.002
to look up Tours in the database.

18
00:00:52.002 --> 00:00:54.000
For the TourPackage entity,

19
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.002
we see a TourPackageRepository

20
00:00:56.002 --> 00:00:58.005
that extends from CrudRepository.

21
00:00:58.005 --> 00:01:01.009
In this case the ID of the TourPackage is a string,

22
00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:04.004
so these are the default methods to create,

23
00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:07.007
read, and update, and delete a TourPackage.

24
00:01:07.007 --> 00:01:10.000
So let's actually implement these repositories

25
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.005
in our project.

26
00:01:11.005 --> 00:01:27.003
So we're in our code now and I'm going to create a new package.

27
00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:37.004
We're going to call the package repo, short for repository.

28
00:01:37.004 --> 00:01:39.005
We'll have an interface

29
00:01:39.005 --> 00:01:48.008
and we're going to call it TourRepository.

30
00:01:48.008 --> 00:01:57.004
We're going to extend it from CrudRepository.

31
00:01:57.004 --> 00:02:01.005
And the first parameter will be Tour.

32
00:02:01.005 --> 00:02:06.001
And the second parameter will be Integer.

33
00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:11.008
Because the type of the ID of the Tour is an integer.

34
00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:41.001
Now let's create the TourPackageRepository interface.

35
00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:45.008
The first parameter is TourPackage.

36
00:02:45.008 --> 00:02:50.000
And the second parameter is String.

37
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Because that's the type of the ID of a TourPackage.
