00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.003
- [Mary Ellen] So now that we're done, what's next?

2
00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:07.000
I would encourage you to dig deeper into Spring Data

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.007
by watching my course, Spring: Spring Data 2,

4
00:00:10.007 --> 00:00:12.008
especially the querying chapter.

5
00:00:12.008 --> 00:00:15.007
And if you are up to a challenge, my course

6
00:00:15.007 --> 00:00:17.008
Extending, Securing, and Dockerizing

7
00:00:17.008 --> 00:00:19.007
Spring Boot Microservices

8
00:00:19.007 --> 00:00:22.004
is really a part two to this course.

9
00:00:22.004 --> 00:00:26.000
There, we elevate the Explore Cali JPA application

10
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.009
into a production-ready microservice.

11
00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:30.009
I love learner feedback.

12
00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:35.001
You can reach out to me via my website MaryEllenTeaches.Me

13
00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:39.004
as well as my GitHub organization called MaryEllenTeaches.

14
00:00:39.004 --> 00:00:42.005
I can also be found on LinkedIn and Twitter.

15
00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:44.008
Please tell me what you think of this course,

16
00:00:44.008 --> 00:00:47.005
as well as what you would like to learn next.

17
00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:50.003
I hope you enjoyed taking this learning journey with me

18
00:00:50.003 --> 00:00:51.008
and that it helps you succeed

19
00:00:51.008 --> 00:00:54.000
in your Spring application development.

20
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Thanks for watching and keep on coding.
