00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:01.009
- [Instructor] So let's create

2
00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:05.005
our first Spring Boot project with Spring Initializer.

3
00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:10.004
First, we open a browser and navigate to start.spring.io.

4
00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:13.003
We're going to select a Maven Project.

5
00:00:13.003 --> 00:00:16.004
You can choose Gradle if you are more comfortable with it,

6
00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:19.004
but in this tutorial, we will use Maven.

7
00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:22.001
Use the latest version of Spring Boot,

8
00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:28.004
and the group will be called calm.example.ec.

9
00:00:28.004 --> 00:00:30.007
And for Explore California,

10
00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:39.001
the artifact will be explorecali.

11
00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:45.009
Let's click options, and for description,

12
00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:50.008
we'll put Explore California Microservice.

13
00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:56.005
And the package name will be just com.example.ec.

14
00:00:56.005 --> 00:00:58.006
We're going to keep it a Jar file,

15
00:00:58.006 --> 00:01:03.000
and for this we're going to use Java13.

16
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.003
I'll show you later if you want to change the Java version,

17
00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:09.002
but this is what's showing right now on Spring Initializer,

18
00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:10.008
which are the latest and greatest.

19
00:01:10.008 --> 00:01:14.000
This UI changes from time to time,

20
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
so they may have different options later,

21
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.002
but this is what's being built for our exercise files.

22
00:01:20.002 --> 00:01:23.005
And next we want to choose the dependencies we want to use.

23
00:01:23.005 --> 00:01:28.006
So choose Menu, and then we're going to go to

24
00:01:28.006 --> 00:01:31.006
Web and choose Spring Web.

25
00:01:31.006 --> 00:01:35.000
And we're also going to choose Rest Repositories.

26
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.004
And then down in SQL, we're going to choose Spring Data JPA,

27
00:01:40.004 --> 00:01:47.005
and then we want H2 in memory Database.

28
00:01:47.005 --> 00:01:54.009
Finally, click the Generate Project button.

29
00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.005
Now Spring Initializer will generate the zip file.

30
00:01:58.005 --> 00:02:02.008
The decompress files are in the exercise file chapter 1-2,

31
00:02:02.008 --> 00:02:06.009
and I already have imported it into my IDE IntelliJ

32
00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.006
as a Maven project.

33
00:02:08.006 --> 00:02:12.004
So here's the project imported into IntelliJ

34
00:02:12.004 --> 00:02:16.001
as a new project from existing sources.

35
00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:19.006
So let's see what Spring Initializer created for us.

36
00:02:19.006 --> 00:02:21.009
You have a directory structure.

37
00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:24.009
Let's expand this over here.

38
00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:26.009
And in that directory structure we see

39
00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:31.003
there's a source folder, a Maven pom.xml files,

40
00:02:31.003 --> 00:02:35.000
configuration files, some Maven helper files,

41
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.005
and in the source main Java,

42
00:02:38.005 --> 00:02:42.003
there is a com.example.ec package,

43
00:02:42.003 --> 00:02:47.002
and inside that is an ExplorecaliApplication Java class.

44
00:02:47.002 --> 00:02:51.009
So let's look at the pom file.

45
00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:55.005
Inside the pom there is the Spring Boot starter parent,

46
00:02:55.005 --> 00:02:59.001
and all of the dependencies that we selected

47
00:02:59.001 --> 00:03:02.003
on the Initializer page is also in this file.

48
00:03:02.003 --> 00:03:10.001
So we see JPA, Rest, Web, and H2.

49
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:11.009
And we see the Spring Boot version.

50
00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:15.004
The Java version you can change here if necessary.

51
00:03:15.004 --> 00:03:18.000
If you wanted to change it to a different version,

52
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.006
you have to check to see if it works

53
00:03:20.006 --> 00:03:23.004
with the Spring Boot version you're using.

54
00:03:23.004 --> 00:03:24.009
But that's where you select it,

55
00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:28.000
and your own IDE may have special settings

56
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.005
for actually compiling in the IDE for your version.

57
00:03:33.005 --> 00:03:39.006
Now let's look at ExplorecaliApplication.java file

58
00:03:39.006 --> 00:03:44.002
is not a very large file but two things jump out at us.

59
00:03:44.002 --> 00:03:47.000
This Java class has a main method

60
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.003
and there is an @SpringBootApplication annotation.

61
00:03:51.003 --> 00:03:53.007
If you've been writing Java web applications

62
00:03:53.007 --> 00:03:55.008
for years, it's probably been a long time

63
00:03:55.008 --> 00:03:59.001
since you have written a class with a main method.

64
00:03:59.001 --> 00:04:01.006
This is a major paradigm shift.

65
00:04:01.006 --> 00:04:03.007
We get the main control back.

66
00:04:03.007 --> 00:04:05.002
We are no longer writing code

67
00:04:05.002 --> 00:04:07.004
that has to be packaged into a war

68
00:04:07.004 --> 00:04:10.008
and then deployed on a web or application server.

69
00:04:10.008 --> 00:04:15.005
The web server is deployed in our application.

70
00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:18.001
Adding @SpringBootApplication annotation

71
00:04:18.001 --> 00:04:20.001
to this class with the main method

72
00:04:20.001 --> 00:04:23.002
tells Java and Spring Boot that this is where

73
00:04:23.002 --> 00:04:25.001
our microservice starts.

74
00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:27.003
Command line parameters or special start up

75
00:04:27.003 --> 00:04:29.001
logic resides here.

76
00:04:29.001 --> 00:04:31.000
With this one pom file, and the one Java source file,

77
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.009
we can now build and run a project

78
00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:38.000
as a Spring Boot Application.
