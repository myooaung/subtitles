00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.009
- [Narrator] Now we are able to implement

2
00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:06.006
HTTP PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.

3
00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:09.002
So we're back in our TourRatingController

4
00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:10.008
and I have another helper method

5
00:00:10.008 --> 00:00:16.002
and it's on line 91 and this will verify a tour rating

6
00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:19.008
given a tourId and a customerId.

7
00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:24.001
It checks the unique tour rating for that tour

8
00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:25.007
and if it's not there it will throw

9
00:00:25.007 --> 00:00:28.002
a NoSuchElementException.

10
00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:31.006
If there is it will return that rating.

11
00:00:31.006 --> 00:00:33.004
So now I'm going to put in the body

12
00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:37.000
for the PUT and PATCH methods.

13
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:46.002
I'm just going to paste that in.

14
00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:50.000
So here is our update with Put.

15
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.009
It'll return a RatingDto on line 84.

16
00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:59.002
So we have a tourId and a Rating Dto passed in

17
00:00:59.002 --> 00:01:01.003
and so the semantics with PUT

18
00:01:01.003 --> 00:01:05.000
is that all the attributes are updated.

19
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.002
The semantics of PATCH is to only update

20
00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:12.001
some methods of the entity.

21
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:14.005
The methods are similar but we need to respect

22
00:01:14.005 --> 00:01:17.008
the intent of the API.

23
00:01:17.008 --> 00:01:21.009
So on 85 I call the method verifyTourRating

24
00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.008
and so I use the tourId passed in on the URL

25
00:01:25.008 --> 00:01:29.006
and then from the RatingsDto I get the customerId.

26
00:01:29.006 --> 00:01:33.009
If that returns a rating I'll get it,

27
00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.005
otherwise an exception will be thrown.

28
00:01:36.005 --> 00:01:40.001
So then we set both the score and the comment attributes

29
00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:42.009
which are the two writeable attributes

30
00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.006
in the DTO that we can use

31
00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:49.004
and then we save it to the repository.

32
00:01:49.004 --> 00:01:54.006
So let's add our annotations.

33
00:01:54.006 --> 00:02:01.000
PutMapping and it's the same URL as the main class

34
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and then we have to have the PathVariable.

35
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.008
And then for the RatingDto that's to be passed in

36
00:02:17.008 --> 00:02:22.004
we need to say this is a RequestBody

37
00:02:22.004 --> 00:02:33.001
and then we want the Validator to run as well.

38
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:36.001
So next is update with Patch.

39
00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:38.006
So here we have to check if the attribute

40
00:02:38.006 --> 00:02:40.005
of the RatingDto is not,

41
00:02:40.005 --> 00:02:43.005
now we're going to use it and save it to the database.

42
00:02:43.005 --> 00:02:47.002
If it is now we won't check it.

43
00:02:47.002 --> 00:02:50.008
So if RatingDTO dot score is not equal to null

44
00:02:50.008 --> 00:02:54.003
then we're going to actually set it on our rating.

45
00:02:54.003 --> 00:02:58.000
If the comments not null then set it in the comment

46
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.005
and then save it to the repository.

47
00:03:01.005 --> 00:03:11.008
And similarly we'll tab PatchMapping.

48
00:03:11.008 --> 00:03:22.005
PathVariable tourId.

49
00:03:22.005 --> 00:03:25.003
And then we want to have RequestBody

50
00:03:25.003 --> 00:03:32.006
and at Validated for that payload.

51
00:03:32.006 --> 00:03:36.005
Now let's implement Delete.

52
00:03:36.005 --> 00:03:48.003
So we'll have public void delete

53
00:03:48.003 --> 00:03:55.006
and we also need to have the customerId.

54
00:03:55.006 --> 00:04:00.005
So we'll say TourRating and we need

55
00:04:00.005 --> 00:04:13.002
to say verifyTourRating.

56
00:04:13.002 --> 00:04:24.007
And then we will delete it.

57
00:04:24.007 --> 00:04:32.000
So our mapping is DeleteMapping.

58
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.005
Our path

59
00:04:35.005 --> 00:04:39.009
is slash customer

60
00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:43.002
customerId.

61
00:04:43.002 --> 00:04:48.001
So it's a pending slash customerId to the URL.

62
00:04:48.001 --> 00:04:52.007
We'll copy the PathVariable for tourId.

63
00:04:52.007 --> 00:05:04.002
And we need to do the same thing but with customerId.

64
00:05:04.002 --> 00:05:08.008
Okay let's give it a go!

65
00:05:08.008 --> 00:05:16.004
Run the application.

66
00:05:16.004 --> 00:05:22.005
And it's running so let's create a tour

67
00:05:22.005 --> 00:05:25.005
with our method POST that we've had before.

68
00:05:25.005 --> 00:05:28.008
This person liked it a lot.

69
00:05:28.008 --> 00:05:32.000
And it was created.

70
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.001
So let's say they said, "Oh no I wanted to change

71
00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:39.000
it to three instead of five you know

72
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.005
it really was just okay."

73
00:05:41.005 --> 00:05:45.008
Let's say it was bad and they set the score to three.

74
00:05:45.008 --> 00:05:49.004
And now that would be PUT

75
00:05:49.004 --> 00:05:55.001
because we want both of these values to be set.

76
00:05:55.001 --> 00:06:00.001
And it was PUT.

77
00:06:00.001 --> 00:06:05.005
And then let's do a PATCH

78
00:06:05.005 --> 00:06:08.003
because maybe they say, "Oh I said it was bad

79
00:06:08.003 --> 00:06:10.000
but I really want to change the score,

80
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:18.006
not from three but we want to set it to one."

81
00:06:18.006 --> 00:06:24.004
And it's been changed so let's actually verify it.

82
00:06:24.004 --> 00:06:26.004
And so that's our most recent value.

83
00:06:26.004 --> 00:06:28.005
It was bad and the score was one

84
00:06:28.005 --> 00:06:31.001
and then the user said, "Ah forget it.

85
00:06:31.001 --> 00:06:34.002
I don't even want to have a rating in here anymore."

86
00:06:34.002 --> 00:06:37.006
So we can do DELETE the rating.

87
00:06:37.006 --> 00:06:45.009
And now we have to have customerId on there which was two.

88
00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:48.009
And it was deleted.

89
00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:51.004
Let's verify it.

90
00:06:51.004 --> 00:06:54.000
And there's no more ratings for that tour.
