00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:03.009
- And finally, we're going to see the last files that are

2
00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:06.002
needed to stand up this microservice

3
00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:08.008
and configure some APIs.

4
00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:10.006
And then we're actually going to hit the changes

5
00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:12.002
made to the APIs.

6
00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:13.009
Let's look at explorer Cali application,

7
00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:19.000
see what had to be changed there.

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.003
So were scrolling down, a lot of the main parts

9
00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:23.003
didn't change to create all Tour packages.

10
00:00:23.003 --> 00:00:26.001
That's the same but now when we create Tours,

11
00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:29.006
I have my helper method "tourFormFile" at the bottom here

12
00:00:29.006 --> 00:00:33.001
has changed significantly where it's not having to site

13
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:36.002
all those different attributes but it just,

14
00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:39.005
finally what the result of mapping a record

15
00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:42.004
in the Jason file into a "tourFromFile",

16
00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:46.007
we get on line 76 we get back the string for

17
00:00:46.007 --> 00:00:49.009
the title of the Tour, the package name of the Tour

18
00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:51.002
and then the list of details,

19
00:00:51.002 --> 00:00:55.003
is just a map of string to string.

20
00:00:55.003 --> 00:00:58.004
So when we read the "TourForm" file we stream them

21
00:00:58.004 --> 00:01:00.007
and then we want to create Tours so,

22
00:01:00.007 --> 00:01:02.008
we invoke the Tour service as we did before

23
00:01:02.008 --> 00:01:06.000
but now we have a lot less parameters to pass in.

24
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
In the "TourRatingController" this is mainly the ripple

25
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.007
effects of things that have made, changed in the system.

26
00:01:12.007 --> 00:01:15.006
Mainly the Tour ID is now a string

27
00:01:15.006 --> 00:01:19.001
and Tour rating, doesn't have a Tour rating PK

28
00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:21.005
and we're no longer using rating DTO,

29
00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:26.003
we're actually going to directly use Tour rating

30
00:01:26.003 --> 00:01:31.007
as uh, an object to pass back and forth.

31
00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:35.003
So this is mainly changes when we create,

32
00:01:35.003 --> 00:01:37.005
we're not using an internet Tour ID,

33
00:01:37.005 --> 00:01:40.001
it's a string Tour ID and a Tour rating.

34
00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:43.008
We're also not getting the result of verified Tour back

35
00:01:43.008 --> 00:01:45.004
and we'll see how that's changed,

36
00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:48.003
because we don't need the Tour to create a Tour rating.

37
00:01:48.003 --> 00:01:51.006
We just need to know that this ID that's being passed in

38
00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:55.000
on line 45 is correct.

39
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
If it's not correct, you won't even get to line 48

40
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.002
because an exception will be thrown.

41
00:02:01.002 --> 00:02:03.007
Same this now we're using a string,

42
00:02:03.007 --> 00:02:05.007
instead of a internet Tour ID

43
00:02:05.007 --> 00:02:09.000
and this is what's nice, so we're no longer having to

44
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.006
transform a rating DTO from a Tour rating.

45
00:02:14.006 --> 00:02:17.003
We can just actually call on,

46
00:02:17.003 --> 00:02:20.001
"TourRatingRepository.findByTourID"

47
00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:23.005
and this will return the correct page we want.

48
00:02:23.005 --> 00:02:27.000
Here, another example of parameters have changed,

49
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.009
both on the method get average,

50
00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:33.000
as well as invoking on line 74.

51
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.003
Tour by ID instead of PK Tour ID.

52
00:02:39.003 --> 00:02:41.007
In our "updateWithPut" its the same thing,

53
00:02:41.007 --> 00:02:46.001
parameter types have changed.

54
00:02:46.001 --> 00:02:49.002
On patch mapping, "updateWithPatch",

55
00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:53.000
the same thing is just uh, Tour is no longer a number

56
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.006
and we're using Tour rating instead of rating DTO

57
00:02:56.006 --> 00:03:04.000
and on delete mapping, we're using a Tour ID string.

58
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.002
I just want to check on the "verifyTourRating".

59
00:03:07.002 --> 00:03:10.008
It's mostly the same except for we're invoking

60
00:03:10.008 --> 00:03:14.009
a different repository method and in "verifyTour",

61
00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:19.009
we're just checking that the Tour exists

62
00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:21.001
and then throwing in exception,

63
00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:24.006
we're not actually pulling back the whole Tour.

64
00:03:24.006 --> 00:03:26.002
And then we got to delete some code,

65
00:03:26.002 --> 00:03:28.008
we got to delete rating DTO.

66
00:03:28.008 --> 00:03:31.001
So I had the application already running

67
00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:36.001
and we're going to go to Postman to see the APIs.

68
00:03:36.001 --> 00:03:39.001
So first of all the very simple local host 8080,

69
00:03:39.001 --> 00:03:42.009
get of Tours and it returns Tours back in,

70
00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:45.005
the scheme of the Jason in a little different,

71
00:03:45.005 --> 00:03:48.007
so now we have a title, "tourPackageCode"

72
00:03:48.007 --> 00:03:51.007
and "tourPackageName" called out

73
00:03:51.007 --> 00:03:56.002
and then we details which lists all those contents

74
00:03:56.002 --> 00:04:02.002
that where in the Jason file.

75
00:04:02.002 --> 00:04:05.000
You see that repeated.

76
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.005
Next, we're going to create a Tour rating

77
00:04:09.005 --> 00:04:11.004
but before that we need a Tour ID.

78
00:04:11.004 --> 00:04:13.001
Did you notice that the ID's are,

79
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:15.006
uh it's a string now, it's very long.

80
00:04:15.006 --> 00:04:19.000
It's not just 1, 2, 3, 4, all the way to 30.

81
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.004
We're going to copy that and paste it in here.

82
00:04:24.004 --> 00:04:28.005
Yes, I know I grabbed the quote and I erased it.

83
00:04:28.005 --> 00:04:33.001
Now I'm going to create a Tour rating.

84
00:04:33.001 --> 00:04:41.008
I sent that as it's created, let's actually get it back.

85
00:04:41.008 --> 00:04:45.006
There's our Tour rating back that we created,

86
00:04:45.006 --> 00:04:48.006
and finally let's look at this method uh,

87
00:04:48.006 --> 00:04:51.008
search method "findSummaryByTourPackageCode".

88
00:04:51.008 --> 00:04:55.000
Where we're passing in the California Code.

89
00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.007
So this is the method for only getting specific fields back.

90
00:05:00.007 --> 00:05:03.005
We got the "title", we got the "tourPackageCode",

91
00:05:03.005 --> 00:05:07.001
"tourPackageName", so that kind of is our summery,

92
00:05:07.001 --> 00:05:10.000
but the details are null.
