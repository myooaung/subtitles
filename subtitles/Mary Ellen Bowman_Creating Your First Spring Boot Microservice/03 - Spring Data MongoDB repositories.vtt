00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.006
- [Narrator] Okay and now we are going to

2
00:00:03.006 --> 00:00:04.009
look at the differences in

3
00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.004
the repo and service folder by migrating to

4
00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:10.006
Spring Data MongoDB.

5
00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:12.006
In our repo folder we have changes in

6
00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:14.001
the tour rating repository and

7
00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:16.002
the tour repository and you'll notice

8
00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:18.006
that there was no changes made to the

9
00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:20.003
tour package repository.

10
00:00:20.003 --> 00:00:21.002
Here it is right here.

11
00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:24.009
And we're still extending from Crud repository.

12
00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.000
Our parameters are the same,

13
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.007
and our searches are the same.

14
00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:31.005
It's just, Spring Data knows that

15
00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:34.001
it's a different repository but we're

16
00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:37.006
going to deal with it in the same way.

17
00:00:37.006 --> 00:00:42.004
And now, we're going to look at the tour repository.

18
00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:44.009
So, the main difference here,

19
00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:46.002
well, there's two main differences.

20
00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:51.007
One is because the string is an ID, not integer.

21
00:00:51.007 --> 00:00:55.003
So, that's going to change where we do delete by ID,

22
00:00:55.003 --> 00:00:58.006
we're overriding that.

23
00:00:58.006 --> 00:01:01.008
That now has to be a string.

24
00:01:01.008 --> 00:01:06.006
And, we have this new method which I name

25
00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:09.007
find summary by tour package code.

26
00:01:09.007 --> 00:01:11.007
And this is going to be the new search endpoint

27
00:01:11.007 --> 00:01:14.008
and I use the at query annotation

28
00:01:14.008 --> 00:01:19.008
and I'm passing it a special Mongo specific query here.

29
00:01:19.008 --> 00:01:21.005
So, what it's going to do is, I'm going to

30
00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:24.004
and the value field it uses the language to

31
00:01:24.004 --> 00:01:26.007
interact with Mongo.

32
00:01:26.007 --> 00:01:30.000
Look up tour package code, where we're passing

33
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.009
in the code value, and only return these fields.

34
00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.007
We see this on line 33.

35
00:01:35.007 --> 00:01:40.001
ID, title, tour package code, and tour package name.

36
00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:43.008
And then just like in find by tour package code,

37
00:01:43.008 --> 00:01:45.006
we're passing in a pageable, and it's going

38
00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:48.004
to return a page of tours.

39
00:01:48.004 --> 00:01:52.004
Next, we have tour rating repository changes.

40
00:01:52.004 --> 00:01:56.005
The parameters on the Crud repository for tour rating,

41
00:01:56.005 --> 00:02:01.003
and tour rating PK are now tour rating and string.

42
00:02:01.003 --> 00:02:05.006
And now because the string of the tour ID,

43
00:02:05.006 --> 00:02:07.004
instead of integer, we have to change this

44
00:02:07.004 --> 00:02:12.007
find by tour ID, instead of find by PK tour ID on line 27.

45
00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:15.001
And the parameters for this method,

46
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:18.003
find by PK tour ID and PK customer ID

47
00:02:18.003 --> 00:02:23.001
have changed to find by tour ID and customer ID.

48
00:02:23.001 --> 00:02:26.000
And then, down here on line 44,

49
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
find by PK tour ID changes to

50
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.001
find by tour ID and we pass in the string tour ID.

51
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:36.003
Now let's look at the services that we invoke here.

52
00:02:36.003 --> 00:02:37.009
Git is saying that there's a difference in

53
00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:41.009
tour package services, but really the contents are identical

54
00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:43.004
and that's because some changes were made,

55
00:02:43.004 --> 00:02:45.003
but it was reverted back because we didn't really

56
00:02:45.003 --> 00:02:47.002
need to make a change there.

57
00:02:47.002 --> 00:02:52.002
And then on tour service,

58
00:02:52.002 --> 00:02:54.000
we are changing our

59
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.009
method create tour to no longer

60
00:02:56.009 --> 00:03:00.002
pass in all of these parameters.

61
00:03:00.002 --> 00:03:02.003
We're now calling them out individually.

62
00:03:02.003 --> 00:03:05.003
Instead we see on line 36 here,

63
00:03:05.003 --> 00:03:06.005
that we're going to create a tour

64
00:03:06.005 --> 00:03:10.003
and we're passing in a title, a tour package name,

65
00:03:10.003 --> 00:03:13.008
and a map of the details.

66
00:03:13.008 --> 00:03:15.006
So, this is the information that we're getting

67
00:03:15.006 --> 00:03:18.006
from the JSON file.

68
00:03:18.006 --> 00:03:20.005
It's passed in to create a tour.

69
00:03:20.005 --> 00:03:22.005
Just like before we verify that

70
00:03:22.005 --> 00:03:24.009
the tour package exists with that name.

71
00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:28.005
If it's not found, we return an exception,

72
00:03:28.005 --> 00:03:32.001
and then we actually call, on line 39,

73
00:03:32.001 --> 00:03:34.002
the tour repository dot save,

74
00:03:34.002 --> 00:03:37.000
and construct a new tour.

75
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.002
So that's all the changes we need

76
00:03:38.002 --> 00:03:40.000
for the repository and service layers.
