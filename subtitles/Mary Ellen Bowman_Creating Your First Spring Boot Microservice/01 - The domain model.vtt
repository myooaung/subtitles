00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
- [Instructor] Now we are ready to start implementing

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.006
the solution for the Explore California RESTful web service.

3
00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:09.008
The first step is to create the domain model

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:16.009
from the explorecalifornia.org/tours page.

5
00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:21.004
The primary entities are tour packages and tours.

6
00:00:21.004 --> 00:00:23.006
A tour package is a collection of tours

7
00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:25.005
sharing a certain theme.

8
00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:32.007
Let's look at a tour package called Backpack Cal.

9
00:00:32.007 --> 00:00:36.007
Backpack Cal is associated with five tours,

10
00:00:36.007 --> 00:00:41.005
Big Sur Retreat, Channel Island Excursion,

11
00:00:41.005 --> 00:00:44.002
Death Valley Survivor's Trek,

12
00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:46.007
In the Steps of John Muir,

13
00:00:46.007 --> 00:00:50.005
and the Mount Whitney Climbers Tour.

14
00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:52.000
After examining the fields,

15
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.006
I've defined the following classes,

16
00:00:54.006 --> 00:01:00.002
tour, tour package, region, and difficulty.

17
00:01:00.002 --> 00:01:01.009
Here is a class diagram,

18
00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:06.007
which will show you the attributes and the classes

19
00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:08.008
and how they relate to each other.

20
00:01:08.008 --> 00:01:11.002
The central artifact is a tour.

21
00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:13.006
A tour has a title, a description,

22
00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:16.003
which is a short explanation, a blurb,

23
00:01:16.003 --> 00:01:21.002
which is a longer explanation, a price, a duration,

24
00:01:21.002 --> 00:01:23.007
comma separated bullet points,

25
00:01:23.007 --> 00:01:27.005
and key words used for searching tours.

26
00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:31.004
We see that a tour also has a region and a difficulty.

27
00:01:31.004 --> 00:01:34.000
Region is modeled as an enumerated type

28
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.004
where the possible values are Northern California,

29
00:01:37.004 --> 00:01:40.008
Central Coast, Southern California, and Varies.

30
00:01:40.008 --> 00:01:44.001
Difficulty is modeled as an enumeration as well

31
00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:46.004
where the possible values are

32
00:01:46.004 --> 00:01:49.005
easy, medium, difficult, and varies.

33
00:01:49.005 --> 00:01:52.003
Tour is associated with one tour package,

34
00:01:52.003 --> 00:01:54.004
but a tour package is associated

35
00:01:54.004 --> 00:01:57.000
with several possible tours.
