00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:04.007
- [Narrator] The exercise files are built with Java JDK,

2
00:00:04.007 --> 00:00:08.000
version 13.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.003
And I use IntelliJ, but any Maven-aware IDE will do.

4
00:00:15.003 --> 00:00:18.008
You can clone the files locally or view them in your browser

5
00:00:18.008 --> 00:00:21.009
with my github repository.

6
00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.008
The 'ReadMe'

7
00:00:24.008 --> 00:00:27.008
shows you how each branch in the repo

8
00:00:27.008 --> 00:00:33.000
corresponds to a chapter video Maven project.

9
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.002
You can also download them from the site

10
00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:36.008
with a zip file.

11
00:00:36.008 --> 00:00:37.009
And if you expand the zip file,

12
00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:40.005
you have the exercise files on your desktop,

13
00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:47.003
the folders are divided into chapter number,

14
00:00:47.003 --> 00:00:49.005
and video number,

15
00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:52.000
and sometimes a begin and an end,

16
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and each one has a Maven project bundled inside it.
