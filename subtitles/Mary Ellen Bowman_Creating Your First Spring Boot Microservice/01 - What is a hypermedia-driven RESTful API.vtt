00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:02.009
- [Instructor] In this chapter we will learn

2
00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:04.009
about Spring Data REST,

3
00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:06.005
which is a service for creating

4
00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:09.006
hypermedia driven RESTful APIs.

5
00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:12.008
What is a hypermedia driven RESTful API?

6
00:00:12.008 --> 00:00:14.004
According to Roy Fielding,

7
00:00:14.004 --> 00:00:17.007
who first published the REST API specification,

8
00:00:17.007 --> 00:00:21.006
an API is not truly RESTful unless it follows

9
00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:23.004
a uniform interface.

10
00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:26.002
One of his constraints for a uniform interface

11
00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:30.001
is followed when hypermedia as an engine

12
00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:34.002
of application state, or HATEOAS, is employed.

13
00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:36.006
A RESTful API should do more than expose

14
00:00:36.006 --> 00:00:39.009
resource endpoints over HTTP.

15
00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:43.000
It should also expose the API's documentation

16
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.004
and automatically provide navigation between resources.

17
00:00:47.004 --> 00:00:51.002
Hypermedia driven APIs accomplish just that.

18
00:00:51.002 --> 00:00:53.007
The implementers of Spring Data REST agreed

19
00:00:53.007 --> 00:00:56.000
and that's why Spring Data REST APIs are

20
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.004
hypermedia driven out of the box.

21
00:00:58.004 --> 00:01:00.009
No extra configuration is needed.

22
00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:04.000
In fact, you've already seen it in action.

23
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.005
Remember back in Chapter One

24
00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:09.006
when we tested to see if a microservice

25
00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:11.004
was running properly?

26
00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:16.004
We invoked localhost:8080 and it generated the JSON packet.

27
00:01:16.004 --> 00:01:20.001
This is an example of that out of the box support.

28
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:23.008
Localhost:8080/profile is an active link

29
00:01:23.008 --> 00:01:27.005
to the documentation the API exposes by the microservice.

30
00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:29.005
Spring Data REST employs

31
00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:32.008
the hypermedia application language, or HAL, standard

32
00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:35.007
to associate resource objects to one another.

33
00:01:35.007 --> 00:01:37.007
Later in this chapter we will describe

34
00:01:37.007 --> 00:01:40.004
how hypermedia is used to associate resources

35
00:01:40.004 --> 00:01:43.005
to each other, but first let's start creating APIs

36
00:01:43.005 --> 00:01:47.000
to expose the Explore California Tours and Tour Packages.
