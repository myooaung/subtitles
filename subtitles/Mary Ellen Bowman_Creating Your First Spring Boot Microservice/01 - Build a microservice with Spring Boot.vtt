00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
- [Mary] Would you like to venture into the world of

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.009
Spring Boot Microservices, but don't know where to start?

3
00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:09.005
Boiling down the vast number of Spring projects

4
00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:13.008
can be truly daunting, but it's easier than you think.

5
00:00:13.008 --> 00:00:17.000
Together we will build a RESTful Spring Boot Microservice

6
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
with JPA, by leveraging Spring Data, and Spring Web Modules.

7
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.003
Each chapter builds on each other,

8
00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:27.002
including different modules along the way.

9
00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:29.003
Then, once we have a working solution,

10
00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:31.002
we will migrate the microservice

11
00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:33.006
to a MongoDB data source.

12
00:00:33.006 --> 00:00:35.006
But every solution needs a problem,

13
00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:37.009
and every problem has a stakeholder.

14
00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:40.006
Our stakeholder is an imaginary tour operator

15
00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:42.008
called Explore California.

16
00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:45.004
They need a new back end with RESTful APIs

17
00:00:45.004 --> 00:00:48.002
to expose their library of tours.

18
00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:50.005
To accomplish this, I'll assume that

19
00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:54.005
you're not new to Java, Spring dependency injection,

20
00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:56.007
or relational databases.

21
00:00:56.007 --> 00:00:59.004
It's also helpful to have a general understanding

22
00:00:59.004 --> 00:01:01.005
of web request processing.

23
00:01:01.005 --> 00:01:03.007
Hi, I'm Mary Ellen Bowman.

24
00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:06.003
I'm a senior Spring Boot API developer

25
00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:09.002
and I will take you through this learning journey.

26
00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:12.000
We've got plenty to do, so let's get to work.
