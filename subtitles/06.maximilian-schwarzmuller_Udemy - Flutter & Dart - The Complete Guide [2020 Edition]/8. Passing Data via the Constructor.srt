1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:08,420
Now of course it would be nice if we had some information in that CategoryMealsScreen, which is coming

2
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:14,900
up, about which category was loaded so that in here, we can actually display the right recipes for that

3
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:15,550
category.

4
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:23,720
So we would want to get that information about which category the user visited in that or on that page.

5
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:25,960
For that

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,790
in here, we can add a property,

7
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:40,140
category ID maybe which should be a string and another final property, category title

8
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,290
and of course, you can give these any names you want.

9
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,800
Then let's add a constructor by repeating the class name as you learned it

10
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:52,320
and there, let's assign values to this category ID and the category title.

11
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:59,480
So now when we create the category meal screen, we need to forward that information to that created screen.

12
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,450
So in category item thankfully, we can get that information.

13
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:10,260
We have the title already and the ID is also something we can expect there by simply adding it as another

14
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,270
argument here

15
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,920
we want to have in the constructor and another property we manage here and now in the place where

16
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,100
we create our category items,

17
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:24,630
so in the categories screen we simply have to forward that ID and thankfully, that is available here

18
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:25,650
in our catData,

19
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:33,400
so it's no problem to forward that. So now we have that in category item and there, we create that category

20
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,040
meals screen which now wants that ID and title.

21
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:41,910
Well since we have it here in the category item widget, it's no problem to forward it,

22
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:47,590
we can simply forward ID and title like this because since the select category method runs inside

23
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:54,400
of a single category item, we only have one clearly defined ID and title inside of this widget.

24
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:00,790
So now in the CategoryMealsScreen, we can use that and for example instead of showing the recipes here,

25
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:08,800
we could output the category title here which seems more appropriate. So if we save that and we go back

26
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:16,590
and I click on Italian, now we see Italian here in the appBar instead of just the recipes and if I go

27
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,430
to a different category, we see that different categories name here.

28
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:28,420
So that is how we can pass data into a new page if we load it like this, by using navigator push.

29
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:34,400
Now since I'm saying it like this, it already sounds like there also is a different way of loading pages,

30
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:34,930
right?

31
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,480
Let's have a look at that way too.
