00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:08.180
Now which editor will I use then? I will use Visual Studio Code (VS Code)!
1

2
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.800
You can get it from code.visualstudio.com.
2

3
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.910
It's a free IDE which also has an extension that provides awesome Flutter support.
3

4
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.290
You can download it from that page and it will automatically give you the right version for your operating
4

5
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.490
system and you can simply walk through the installer.
5

6
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:27.830
It's pretty straightforward.
6

7
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.330
Nothing special about it.
7

8
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.500
Simply install the IDE on your machine.
8

9
00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:40.210
Now once it did install it in your favorite location, you can start it and in the IDE, you can then click
9

10
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:47.680
"Open Folder" or choose the "Open" option from the "File" menu in the top left corner and simply choose that
10

11
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.660
"first_app" folder you created.
11

12
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.560
Now this is your Flutter app.
12

13
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:58.510
And in order to be able to work with that really well, we should add a so-called extension.
13

14
00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.360
So a plugin we can add to that IDE to add extra functionalities.
14

15
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:10.930
You can install extensions by clicking on this icon on the left or selecting "View" => "Extensions" in the
15

16
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:17.420
menu at the top and there simply search for "Flutter". Install that extension you find here.
16

17
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.290
It's the official Flutter extension and it will also install the "Dart" extension together with it because
17

18
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.050
that will be a dependency.
18

19
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.420
And once it is installed you just need to restart the IDE to have that installed.
19

20
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.860
Now I will use one extra extension for the course - and that's the "Material Icon" theme. That is not (!) related
20

21
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.300
to Flutter development, 
21

22
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.820
I just like the Icon look I get with it,
22

23
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.320
it's totally optional - 
23

24
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.540
I just want to show it here so that you don't wonder why my icons look different than the default
24

25
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.460
icons.
25

26
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:57.690
Once you install that - if you want it - you again can reload the IDE. And, with that, we can finally make a
26

27
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.050
change to our Flutter code after I activate the new theme.
27

28
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.440
You can see your Flutter code in the "lib" folder of the project you opened.
28

29
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:09.690
And they're in "main.dart"
29

30
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.000
file, you see the code which is responsible for the app which is currently running on the emulator
30

31
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:16.820
there.
31

32
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:26.060
Search the "_incrementCounter" method and in setState: Change
32

33
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.890
"_counter++" to "_counter =_counter + 2".
33

34
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.220
This should ensure that we actually increase the counter by two every time we hit the "plus" - not by one anymore.
34

35
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:46.770
With that change made: Go back to the command prompt and make sure that the "flutter run" process is still
35

36
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.480
running - don't quit it!
36

37
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.800
You could quit it with "CTRL + C" (or by typing "quit").
37

38
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:57.330
But as long as you are developing, you should keep it running because then you can hit "r" with that process
38

39
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:03.870
running to hot reload your app, which means the changes you added are pushed into the app without the
39

40
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.760
need for it to rebuild.
40

41
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:13.140
Now sometimes, this fails. Then you can press "SHIFT-R" to do a full reload and a full rebuild. And you
41

42
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.090
can quit that process with "CTRL + C" if you are done with development for the day.
42

43
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:27.300
So I pressed "r" and if I go back to my emulator here, you can see that I can now increment by two instead
43

44
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.000
of one. And this is our first little change.
44

45
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.730
We will do much more of course but this is our Windows setup finished! It was quite a lot of work but now
45

46
00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.800
we are prepared to continue and dive much deeper into Flutter of course.
