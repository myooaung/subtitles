00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.890
So we've got quite a lot of folders and files here. Now

2
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:12.550
a lot of the files you see here are only there for configuration and a lot of the folders here also

3
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.090
don't need to be touched by you

4
00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.170
but let me explain what each folder and file does.

5
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.420
Let's go from top to bottom,

6
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.730
the idea folder here holds some configuration for Android Studio.

7
00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.860
It doesn't really matter for us here because we're not working with Android Studio and you don't need

8
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.770
to change anything in here.

9
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.320
Vscode is a folder you might not have,

10
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.120
I have it here because I added some extra configuration for this project,

11
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.160
I set the zoom level so that you can see my code and anything you do configure for your vscode,

12
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.650
your Visual Studio Code project here would end up in such a config file and you don't need that if

13
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.130
you don't have any special development options here.

14
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.140
The Android folder is super important,

15
00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.900
it holds a complete Android project as you could also create it without Flutter.

16
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:02.800
This is is in the end

17
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:10.780
the project which the Flutter SDK will use to kind of merge with your Flutter code you could say, so

18
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.180
when your Flutter code gets compiled to native code, it will basically get injected into this Android

19
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.710
project you could say

20
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.890
and that is the Android project which later will be built into a real Android app or later actually

21
00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.330
is the wrong word, which already got built into this Android app we're seeing here.

22
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.520
So this is in the end of normal Android project with your compiled Flutter code and you don't need to change

23
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.460
anything in here or very rarely and I will mention when you do need to change anything here. For the

24
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.410
most part, for the most time,

25
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.140
this is a passive folder which will be used by Flutter and therefore it's super important but not a

26
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.570
folder you work on. The build folder is also very important, in the end,

27
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.960
this holds the output of your Flutter application,

28
00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:04.120
in this case here also some Android or Java files and this folder is generated and managed by the Flutter

29
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.080
SDK.

30
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.470
You shouldn't change anything in there, that will all be done automatically by the Flutter SDK when you

31
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.910
are developing or when you are building your app for deployment, which we will do at the end of the course

32
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:23.780
and therefore this is also a passive folder. So thus far, no folder in which we would work.

33
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.670
It's the same for the iOS folder,

34
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.720
we had the Android folder with a full Android project, which is important for building an Android project,

35
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.570
both for development and for production and the iOS folder is simply the same for

36
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:44.260
iOS projects. Now on Windows, you won't have that folder because on Windows unfortunately, you can't

37
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.150
build iOS applications,

38
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:53.830
that's not allowed by Apple. On MacOS, you will have it and this holds a normal Xcode project, Xcode

39
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.800
is the development environment of MacOS, for iOS apps and just as with the Android folder,

40
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.310
this is a folder where you really won't work in too much.

41
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.650
There are some occasions where we will do some work in here but I will mention when this is the case,

42
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:15.220
for the most part this is a passive folder which gets kind of merged with your Flutter code in the end

43
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:22.510
and which will all be managed by the Flutter SDK to get iOS applications, both for development and

44
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:30.160
testing as well as for the real application in the end which you deploy. The lib folder is now the important

45
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:37.690
folder for us, lib stands for library and that is the folder where we will do 99% of our work.

46
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:44.320
It is the folder where we will add all our Dart files, Dart is the programming language Flutter uses

47
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.800
to write the code for our Flutter application.

48
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.370
So this is the folder where we will add files and where we will write code in,

49
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.640
this is a super important folder for us. The test folder is a folder which won't be too important for

50
00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.340
us here,

51
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.900
it allows us to write tests for our application, automated tests,

52
00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.230
so basically code that runs our code and tests it for certain things,

53
00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:15.140
certainly important once you're a bit of a more advanced Dart and Flutter developer but not important

54
00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:21.690
for us right now and therefore, we can safely ignore this. gitignore is a folder that helps you when you're

55
00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:25.940
using git which is a source code management tool,

56
00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.070
it allows you to create snapshots of your code, save them and you can go back to them at a later point

57
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.510
of time

58
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:39.380
if you messed up something or if you wanna change something. It is not a tool you have to use but often

59
00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.260
during development, git can be really useful

60
00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:48.920
and after this lecture, you find a short text lecture on git. Using it is totally optional but if you

61
00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.870
want to use it, if that sounds interesting to you, that lecture will help you get started with it and then

62
00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.720
you can use it if you want to use it.

63
00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:03.920
The metadata file is not really a file we will work on, it will be managed automatically by Flutter

64
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:10.670
and in the end, the Flutter tool simply saves some information in here which it needs to build

65
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.010
our application correctly

66
00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.330
and so on.

67
00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.720
The same is true for the .packages file,

68
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.170
it's not a file we'll do any work in,

69
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.900
this is generated automatically by the Flutter SDK and in the end,

70
00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.920
this also just manages some internal dependencies,

71
00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.330
some packages

72
00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.860
this project needs and it is fully managed automatically,

73
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:35.320
you should not delete it but you also shouldn't work in it. This file here,

74
00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.760
this .iml

75
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:41.740
file which has your project name as a name is also file where we will not work in,

76
00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:47.550
it's also managed automatically by the Flutter SDK to again manage some internal dependencies and some

77
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.290
settings for this project

78
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:55.940
you could say and it's not a file which we'll change. Now the pubspec.lock file is also not a file

79
00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:01.440
we'll work in and it becomes clearer once we understand the pubspec.yaml file which is a file in

80
00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.980
which we will work.

81
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.620
This is a file that allows you to mostly manage these dependencies of your project.

82
00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.090
Now what does this mean?

83
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.950
This means that here, you can configure which other third-party packages

84
00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.220
your project might be using.

85
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:24.720
You can also configure some other things in here, like for example fonts you want to use or images you

86
00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.880
want to use in your application and we'll use all these features, we'll work with third-party packages

87
00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:36.060
and we'll use fonts and images and therefore I will show you how to work with this file and how to change

88
00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.790
it to include new fonts or new images,

89
00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.850
I will show you all of that step-by-step.

90
00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:49.110
Basically what you have here is code written in yaml which is a certain format for structuring text

91
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:54.480
files, where you use indentation to express how code works together

92
00:06:54.570 --> 00:07:01.350
and here for example, we're right now specifying with which Dart version this works, which version

93
00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:07.200
or application it should have, also which third-party packages we might be using, like here the Cupertino

94
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:13.160
icons which allows us to use certain iOS styled icons in the application and

95
00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:16.740
we'll add other third-party packages throughout this course here.

96
00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:26.010
So this is basically a config file that allows us to configure how our application works or which external

97
00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:29.900
dependencies it has, for the moment we don't need to change anything here.

98
00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:35.970
The pubspec.lock file in the end is a file that is generated automatically based on your

99
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.380
.yaml file here

100
00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:44.880
and this simply holds more details then about all the dependencies you have and it is required by Flutter

101
00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:47.630
but it's not a file you will work, in the end

102
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:49.830
as I said, it will be generated automatically,

103
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:51.800
we will only work in the yaml file.

104
00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:57.900
Well and the README file is an automatically generated README file which we can ignore, it holds some

105
00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:01.170
information about our project and you could change this here

106
00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:06.450
if you were sharing your project with other developers and you want to give them some information. So

107
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:11.520
that was a thorough walkthrough through all the folders and files, the core takeaway is that we will work in

108
00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:17.730
the lib folder and sometimes with that pubspec.yaml file and we can basically ignore all other files

109
00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:18.420
and folders.
