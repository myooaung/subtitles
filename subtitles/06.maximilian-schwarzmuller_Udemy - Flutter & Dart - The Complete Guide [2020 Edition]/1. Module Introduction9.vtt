00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:08.140
In this module, we'll stick to the same application we worked on in the last course section, in the course

2
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.450
section about state management.

3
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:16.530
In this section, we'll of course build up on all of that but we'll have a look at how we can improve

4
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:23.940
our user interaction and also how we can handle user input in a better way than we did it before in

5
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:24.930
this course,

6
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.390
in this application we built in the last module, we're not doing it in any way. In detail,

7
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.320
that means that we'll have a look at how to show dialogs or snack bars which are basically info popups

8
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:45.120
to give the user more information, to give the user additional options on how to interact with the

9
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.130
application

10
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.080
and in general, improve the user experience.

11
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:55.320
In addition to these dialogs and snack bars, we'll also work on fetching user input though and we'll

12
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.150
fetch that with the help of text fields and forms.

13
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.980
Now you will learn what exactly a form is in Flutter and what the difference to normal text fields

14
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.840
is and you will also learn how to then validate user input,

15
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.040
how to manage the focus of the user, so how to manage into which input field the user may input data

16
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.030
and so on and all of that, we'll have a detailed look at all of that in this section to ensure that in

17
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.250
this app and of course in any app you're building, you can really interact with the user in the best possible

18
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.070
way. For that,

19
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.900
here's the application we worked on and of course here we already have some places where we interact

20
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:37.770
with the user.

21
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.910
We allow the user to filter here,

22
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:47.370
we allow the user to switch favorites and for example, add items to the cart but adding items to the cart

23
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.680
is already a first thing where we can start and improve that.

24
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:56.580
We don't really get a feedback here when we press the cart button especially for an item which is already

25
00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.790
part of the cart and hence the badge doesn't update,

26
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.130
we don't really see that this was successful.

27
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.270
It would be nice to show a little info popup which doesn't interrupt the user flow,

28
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.860
so not a dialog where the user has to confirm something but a little info popup at the bottom of the

29
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.050
screen that confirms to a user,

30
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.210
yes we added something to the cart, that would be something nice.

31
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:27.710
In addition, in the cart you could say that when you delete an item here, maybe you don't want to delete

32
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.610
it automatically when the swipe continues but you want to ask the user if he's sure about that.

33
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.970
Now obviously, there is no clear right or wrong approach on how to do that, whether you want to ask or

34
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.010
not but I want to show you how you could ask at least.

35
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.310
So these are the things I'll start with and later we'll then also add another page here to which you

36
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.070
can go from our side drawer where we can manage our own products and that means where we can add, edit and

37
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.810
delete products and that will then of course involve fetching the user input through text fields.

38
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.120
But let's start with the info popup and the dialog.
