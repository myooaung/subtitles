00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:08.270
The first place where I want to tap into my provided orders object is in the cart screen of course

2
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:17.830
when we do press that order now button, this here. In onPressed, I want to use my orders and call add

3
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.140
order.

4
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:28.500
So I will need to get my orders class here because I'll need to provide it here

5
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.010
and I want to provide it

6
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:39.300
down there in onPressed with providers of orders and of course, pass context as an argument and it's

7
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:47.820
not providers but just provider. I can call add order and now pass my data to the order and the data I need

8
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:55.030
to pass here is the content of my cart and the total. It's pretty easy to do because we've got access

9
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.020
to the cart here and we can get both pieces of information from the cart.

10
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:09.010
So here, I pass cart.items and then simply values here to list to convert the cart item objects

11
00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.650
into a list of cart item objects instead of passing the whole map,

12
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.200
so I'm just passing a list of my concrete cart item objects and for the total,

13
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:25.710
we got cart.totalAmount, right? So that's in the end what I pass here as a total for the order.

14
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.170
Important,

15
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.830
I don't want to listen to that orders provider because here I'm not interested in changes in my orders,

16
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:41.880
I only want to dispatch an action. So I'll set listen to false here, to not listen to changes in my orders.

17
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.980
And now with that, we're dispatching this,

18
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.010
I also want to clear my cart here and I can do this on my cart,

19
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:57.170
the cart variable here is coming from this listener and there, I want to call clear and now of course

20
00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.560
here, up there, I am listening to my cart

21
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.310
and that's important because clear will now actually clear all elements from the cart and then call

22
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.370
notifyListeners

23
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.750
and that is of course something which should be reflected in a cart screen.

24
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:19.280
So it's good that I'm listening to changes in cart here but not to changes in orders. Let's give that

25
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.650
a try,

26
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:30.160
do a full refresh here maybe and then let's add a couple of items to the cart here and let's click order

27
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.630
now and you see, this clears the cart, we get no confirmation about our order that was placed,

28
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.550
so that's probably something we should add

29
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.900
and of course, we can't view our orders.

30
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.730
So that's the missing piece, that we now also need an orders page which allows us to see our orders.
