1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,240
So let's dive into Flutter

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,060
and for that, we'll dive into the basics.

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:12,020
There are a lot of basics to cover and hence this will be a long module.

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,930
I strongly recommend that you watch it in pieces, that you code along and also have a look at all the

5
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:23,930
attached resources, the cheat sheets and documentation I provide, the text lectures I have in between

6
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:27,060
which allow you to dive deeper into certain concepts

7
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:33,620
I might have walked over too fast because I tried to find the right speed that suits both newcomers and

8
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:38,330
a bit more experienced programmers. So take advantage of all these resources

9
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:43,820
and of course don't be intimidated by the length of this, by the end of this module, we will have covered

10
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:47,940
a lot of the core basics you need to build amazing Flutter apps.

11
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,260
So what exactly can be found in this section then?

12
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:56,870
We'll have a look at how a Flutter app actually starts and works and what's really happening there,

13
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:03,860
how a Flutter app brings something on the screen. We'll work with widgets and we'll build custom widgets

14
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:08,190
because that is also a core part of building Flutter applications.

15
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:14,770
You will learn how to react to user events, namely to button presses when a user taps a button.

16
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:20,990
We'll learn that there are two major different kinds of widgets, stateless and stateful widgets and

17
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:26,810
you will learn what the differences are and when to use which widget. In addition, we'll cover a lot of

18
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,160
Dart fundamentals

19
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:33,890
and I will teach Dart along the way because I believe it's way more interesting to learn it whilst

20
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:41,090
building stuff than to learn it upfront and only start building stuff after an hour or two. We'll learn

21
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,160
all of that here on a concrete Flutter app,

22
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:48,800
arguably not the most beautiful one, we'll build way more beautiful applications later throughout the course

23
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,560
but that simply is the case because here I want to focus on a lot of functionality and features and

24
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,890
behind the scenes stuff and not so much on the layouting and styling stuff which we'll also have a

25
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,510
look at throughout this course though,

26
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:07,790
no worries, so we will build way more beautiful applications throughout the course. We'll write a lot

27
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,180
of code across multiple files,

28
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:17,630
we'll build our own widgets and you will learn a lot about passing data around, managing data, styling

29
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:21,660
to a certain extent and core Dart and Flutter features.

30
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,610
So let's dive in.
