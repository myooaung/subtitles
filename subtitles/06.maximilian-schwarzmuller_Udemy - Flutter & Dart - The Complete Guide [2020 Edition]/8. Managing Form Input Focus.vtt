00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.670
Let's add a second input here to the edit product screen

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.720
and for that, I'll copy the existing input, the title input here, the next input let's say is there to

3
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.530
enter a price.

4
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:20.100
Now of course, that already means that we should configure one extra thing here. On the first input, it's

5
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.880
nice and it's good that we get the default text style soft keyboard which helps us with entering

6
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.160
normal text, here however, we'll enter a number.

7
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.790
So one thing we should do here which we already did earlier in this course too, I want to change that

8
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.410
type of keyboard I show

9
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:45.360
and this can be done by setting the keyboard type argument here and set that to TextInputType.

10
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.450
because text input type is a class with a couple of static properties, dot

11
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:58.810
and now here I think number makes a lot of sense because users should be able to enter a number here.

12
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.600
I want to keep that text input

13
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.580
action of next here because I still want to be able to go to the next input

14
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.130
after we confirm this, we don't have a next input yet but we'll add one soon

15
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.080
and with that change, we also see the price input and if we tap on it, we get the number keyboard which

16
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.450
is of course quite nice.

17
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.690
Now it would be nice to have that transition from title to price when we click the next button here

18
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.560
on the soft keyboard in the title input

19
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.490
and that's something we have to manage manually and we do that with the help of a so-called focus node.

20
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.400
In our edit product screen, in the state object there,

21
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.980
you can add a new final property, _priceFocusNode and you can name this however you want

22
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:54.600
of course and you create it with a value of focus node. Focus node is a class built into Flutter, we

23
00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.620
instantiate it here and we store that focus node in the price focus node key here, in that property.

24
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:08.370
Now it's pretty normal when working with forms in Flutter that you do a bit of managing behind the

25
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:12.870
scenes, for example to manage which input is focused.

26
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:19.350
That's normal overhead you have when building forms because forms are relatively complex and thankfully

27
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.970
as you will see, the form widget here already takes away some of the complexity you would otherwise

28
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.330
have.

29
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.370
So why do we create a focus node now?

30
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.370
Because that focus node now can be assigned to a text input widget,

31
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.290
so to a text field widget, like this price widget here.

32
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.720
So there, we can add focus node does argument and point at the price focus node property which stores

33
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.310
the focus node for this. How can we use that focus node?

34
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.610
Well on the first element, on the first text input here, where you want to go to the second input when

35
00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:05.050
this next button is pressed, you can listen to onFieldSubmitted. This will fire whenever this button

36
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:12.150
here is pressed, whenever this button in the bottom right corner here is pressed. There you get the value

37
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.670
that was entered in the field, I'm not interested in that though, so I'll add an underscore here to signal that

38
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:18.850
I'm not interested

39
00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:26.640
but now we can use that focus node to move the focus from the first, from that title input to the second,

40
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:33.330
to the price input. For that we use another class named focus scope which is also built into Flutter

41
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:40.560
and made available with material.dart import and focus scope works a bit like theme and media query.

42
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:48.420
You use of context to connect it to the page so to say, to let it know where it is and then you have

43
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.940
a request focus method and request focus now takes a focus node.

44
00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:00.900
So here we pass the price focus node and with that, we tell Flutter that when this first input is submitted,

45
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:07.770
so when this next button is pressed in the soft keyboard, we actually want to focus the element with

46
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:14.090
the price focus node and we assign that price focus node to the second text form field here. Hence

47
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:20.820
now if we save that and I press the next button here whilst the focus is on the title, you see it automatically

48
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.280
moves to the price and that's of course a nice user experience because it allows the user to enter something,

49
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:32.460
simply hit next and automatically go to the next input without the user having to manually tap into

50
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.060
that input.
