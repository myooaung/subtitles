00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:08.830
Of course when you're working with Flutter or when you're building mobile apps for mobile devices, you

2
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:14.800
often want to tap into certain native device features, so certain features that you can use because

3
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.860
your program, your app is running on a native device, features that might not be available when you're

4
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:27.340
building a web app that runs on desktop browsers as well for example. I'm talking about things like using

5
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:33.880
the device camera, storing data on the device in cases where you don't want or can't use a web storage

6
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.840
or where you want to store some data on the device

7
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.280
in addition to storing it in the web and of course, I'm also talking about things like adding maps or

8
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.460
working with the user location.

9
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.770
Therefore in this section, I'll explain to you how you generally tap into these native device features,

10
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.230
how Flutter enables you to use these native device features and then we'll have a look at some of the

11
00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.300
most common things you typically do with the native device.

12
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.080
We'll have a look at how to take pictures with the camera,

13
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:11.680
we'll explore how you may store files and data on the device, so not on a web server but on the device

14
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:18.580
and we'll also have a look at how to integrate Google Maps and how to work with the user location in

15
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:25.450
your app and for all of that, we'll again build yet another example application which utilizes all these

16
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.310
features

17
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.530
and we'll have a look at how all of that works and how you might use these features in your next applications.
