00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:08.170
Now that was the snack bar, the other dialog I wanted to add is here in the cart when we dismiss an

2
00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.380
item, right now

3
00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.820
once we swipe, it's simply gone,

4
00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:17.800
we don't get asked whether we're sure if we want to remove that. Now of course that might be the approach

5
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.520
you want to follow,

6
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.530
maybe you don't want to ask a user because you're pretty confident that if someone swipes here which

7
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:28.900
of course also takes some effort, he really is ure that this should be removed and that's totally fine

8
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.910
but also for this tutorial sake, I of course want to show you how you could show a dialog here.

9
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.150
It's our cart item,

10
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.460
the cart_item.dart file which is dismissable here and now the goal would be to step in here on the

11
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.140
dismissable widget and prevent it from being dismissed

12
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.380
if the user doesn't confirm a dialog.

13
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:56.260
Now for that on dismissable, we can add a confirm dismiss argument which takes a function and of course

14
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.770
I'm now also working with a lot of anonymous functions,

15
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.370
you can always have named functions at which you simply point

16
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:10.060
and here in this anonymous function, we get, as we can see here, the dismiss direction which was chosen

17
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.700
and we have to return a future. You remember that's that object which eventually will return a result

18
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:22.910
which eventually returns a boolean result, boolean because it eventually has to tell Flutter whether

19
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.140
we want to dismiss or not, so true or false.

20
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.630
So we get the direction here and then in here,

21
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.710
as I said, we have to return a future.

22
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:41.450
We can simply do that by returning future and then value to immediately return a value like true which

23
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.600
is wrapped into a future and that fulfills this condition of having to return a future here

24
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.260
but that's of course not the idea.

25
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.950
Well let's start with the dialog and then worry about the future, so we can show a dialog simply

26
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.460
with the help of show dialog.

27
00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:03.460
Now unlike the snack bar, for this we need no scaffold because this is not attached to a page

28
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:11.510
so to say, a dialog can be shown anywhere, so it's just show dialog here and show dialog now requires

29
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:19.670
a context argument because you still need to give it a context so that it knows to which widget to

30
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:20.470
attach itself

31
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.870
so to say. So here we have to pass in context to make sure that you have one available in the place

32
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.510
where you call show dialog,

33
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.110
so context here on the right side of the colon refers to the context we're getting here in the build

34
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.010
method and

35
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.770
we have to pass this with the context argument to show dialog.

36
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:46.340
Now besides the context, show dialog then also typically takes a builder and that builder here gives

37
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:53.330
you its own context as all the builders do, in Flutter typically, they give you their own context for

38
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.710
the widget they're about to build

39
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.260
and what do you return here typically should be a dialog widget.

40
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:07.390
Now if you enter dialog here, you see you have various dialogs, you have a base class which you

41
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.030
typically don't use but then you have an about dialog and most importantly, an alert dialog which

42
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.590
is the dialog you'll probably use most often. The alert

43
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:23.320
dialog is able to take a title and title here is a widget, typically of course a text widget

44
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.880
but as so often, it could also be a row with an icon and a text next to each other for example

45
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.150
and here, I'll just say are you sure as the title for this dialog

46
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.640
and besides the title, you then typically

47
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:43.270
also have a content and a content also is a widget here and here, I'll just have more text,

48
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:50.400
do you want to remove the item from the cart,

49
00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.470
something meaningful which informs the user about what you want from him.

50
00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.630
Well and after the content, there are other things you can configure, like the background color, the

51
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:05.330
padding around the content, the drop shadow and so on, so feel free to play around with all of that but

52
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.790
I want to add some actions here,

53
00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:17.230
basically two actions and actions typically here are flat buttons as you also learned in the tooltip and

54
00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:25.640
the first flat button will have a child where I say in my text widget no and then in onPressed, we should

55
00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:32.270
do something that makes sure that we don't continue here with dismissing this item and the other flat

56
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.980
button here

57
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.330
has child text of

58
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.330
yes

59
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:43.300
where are we of course should do something that does go ahead with dismissing the item. So that's the

60
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.560
dialog set up now

61
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:51.190
but remember that in here, in confirmDismiss, this function actually has to return a future and not

62
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.240
just call show dialog.

63
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.100
Now show dialog actually does return a future though,

64
00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.470
that's the good thing

65
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:07.250
and this future will be called whenever the dialog is closed. So actually, we can return the result

66
00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:13.400
of show dialog here because again, show dialog returns a future, so we return a future now but it should

67
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.160
be a future that in the end yields true or false 

68
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:24.870
and that's the missing piece but here in onPressed, we can control what the future resolves to by calling

69
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:30.780
and that's also something the tooltip tells us, by calling navigator pop. So the future resolves to a value

70
00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.940
that was passed navigator pop.

71
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.210
So here in onPressed, we just have to call navigator of context

72
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.680
or actually here,

73
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.720
we can use the ctx, the context

74
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:52.620
the builder gives us, pop. This will close the dialog and now here, we can also forward a value, that's

75
00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:53.050
optional

76
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:58.380
but here we want to do that because we want to yield a value with our future in the end. If the user chose

77
00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:04.650
no, we don't want to dismiss, so we don't want to confirm the dismissal, so we want to return false

78
00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:11.760
here. In the yes button of course, the opposite is the case, here of ctx,

79
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:17.820
we want to pop with a value of true because here, we want to go ahead and dismiss this.

80
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:26.420
And now with that if we save that, if you add an item to the cart and you now swipe here, you see it doesn't

81
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:32.510
get dismissed entirely instead I get asked here and if I choose no, it comes back and it's not dismissed

82
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.210
because of that change and because of popping with false.

83
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:41.330
If I however answer with yes, it goes ahead and clears that and it's really gone,

84
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:47.270
the total updated and it's gone here if we go back to the cart. So this shows you two things,

85
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:53.280
how to confirm the dismissal of the dismissable widget and how to show dialogs

86
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:58.550
and of course, you can show dialogs in other situations too, doesn't have to be to confirm a dismissal,

87
00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:04.160
can be in any scenario where you want to confirm something or warn the user

88
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.940
or simply show some extra information to the user. With show dialog,

89
00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.670
that's really easy as you can tell.
