1
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:09,200
Thus far in this course and in the apps we built in this course, we only covered this scenario that

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:15,320
we have essentially one page in our application and of course in most applications, you actually have

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:21,560
more than one page or screen as it's also called. You might have a user profile page, a page with all

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,520
products,

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,210
then when you tap on a product, you see the details for that product

6
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:33,920
on a separate screen and you can navigate between these screens with the back button, by swiping back

7
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:40,010
or maybe you have some tabs at the bottom or a drawer which you can open with a hamburger icon in your

8
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,370
top navigation bar

9
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,530
and that's exactly what we'll have a look at in this section. In detail,

10
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:51,680
we'll have a look at what navigation and screens are, what these terms mean and what they mean in Flutter

11
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,560
apps and how you can add navigation to the Flutter apps.

12
00:00:55,610 --> 00:01:01,670
We will learn about pushing and popping pages and what this means and how it works in Flutter.

13
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:07,850
We'll have a look at adding tabs and drawers to add an application, so that you have different ways of

14
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:10,640
switching between different areas of your app.

15
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:17,270
And last but not least, a super important topic of course, you will also learn how to pass data between

16
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:24,260
your screens, so how you may for example pass the data about a selected item into the detailed screen

17
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,450
that opened up for that icon.

18
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:32,780
These are all things we'll have a look at in this module now. Throughout this module, we'll build this

19
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,180
application here,

20
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:41,600
this application where we can browse meals by category, mark them as favorites if we like them, set

21
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:49,940
filters where we can decide which kind of meals we want to include, so that I now for example only include

22
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,460
vegetarian meals like this one,

23
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:58,700
gone is the toast and the burger and we can of course also use tabs here to then for example see our

24
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,910
favorites.

25
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:06,080
Now as you can already tell, you learned a lot about navigating around, going back and forth, using tabs

26
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:11,540
and using the side drawer and even many things which you don't see here on first look

27
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:17,420
and as a side effect in this module, you also learned how to build a beautiful application with many new

28
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,020
cool features and widgets which we haven't used thus far in the course.
