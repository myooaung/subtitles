00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:06.110
For the chart height, we don't need to calculate that, it shouldn't be 30%,

2
00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.540
it should be 1 and therefore of course

3
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.510
we don't have to multiply this with 1, just to be really clear about what's happening,

4
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:14.630
I'm doing this here.

5
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.340
It should be 1 because we only see either the chart or the list.

6
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.870
So if we are here in chart mode, we want to take almost all the height,

7
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.800
actually as you can tell, since the switch also takes up some space now, it's not really what we want

8
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.520
to do here,

9
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.380
probably want to go with .7 or something like this,

10
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.710
yes this looks better.

11
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.320
You could of course also calculate or give the chart switch here a height so that you again have

12
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.650
heights that add up to 1

13
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.840
but this here should also be fine.

14
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.320
So now the chart is fixed but now let's also work on the image here. For that,

15
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.930
let's go back to our transaction list which is where we display that image in the end

16
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.210
and there the problem of course is that I have a fixed height on that image container and as you learned,

17
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.770
fixed heights are kind of bad because you can run into exactly the problems we have here. Now obviously,

18
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:18.270
our transaction list here is wrapped in a container which has a clearly calculated height, 70%.

19
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.170
So just as we did it on the chart bar, we should take that height

20
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.240
we assigned to the container into account with the help of a LayoutBuilder which gives us access to

21
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.330
the constraints that apply to the surrounding container.

22
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.140
So in our transaction list, we can do the exact same thing.

23
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:40.470
I don't need to do it for my ListView because that will be scrollable anyways but we definitely

24
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:47.050
should do it here for the column where we are otherwise assigning a fixed height. So in here for that

25
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:56.120
column, let's use the LayoutBuilder which has a builder function which gets the context in case we want

26
00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.850
it but most importantly, which gives us the constraints and then inside of the LayoutBuilder, I want

27
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.590
to return my column here, like this

28
00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:15.140
and now with the help of the constraints, we can assign a height that will work, by using the height or

29
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:27.960
the max height we can use and maybe using 60% of that. Let's also add the semicolon here and

30
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:35.250
now this should restart the app and as you can see, the image is now smaller and fits on the screen.

31
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.980
So that's all good but we have a brand new problem now.

32
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.870
If we go back to portrait mode, we have that switch there too and I don't want that switch in that mode,

33
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.910
I don't want that big of a chart in that mode here,

34
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:55.390
instead that switch should only be there in landscape mode. So we need to find out whether we're in landscape

35
00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.500
mode or not.
