00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:08,660
So that's it for this module. You learned how you can add your own native code in case you know the

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:13,490
native languages or you've got certain snippets you want to execute and how you can connect it to your

3
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:20,890
Flutter app to then send messages to your native code and use the result of that in your Flutter application.

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,560
Now in most applications, you won't have to do that

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:31,520
too often because there are so many plugins and with Flutter growing strongly and already being very popular,

6
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:37,700
we not only get a base of lots of plugins that are available but there are more and more high quality

7
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:43,340
plugins coming out all the time. So chances are that when you need a certain native device feature, there

8
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,930
is a plugin that helps you work with that

9
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:50,950
but in case there is some functionality you want to implement on your own or where there is no plugin

10
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,010
or whatever it is,

11
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:55,580
this is how you could run native code from inside your Flutter app.
