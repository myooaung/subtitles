We had a thorough look at how you can tap into native device features with the help of plugins that

2
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:15.510
help you use the camera, work with Google Maps, access the device storage, work with the filesystem and

3
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:22.470
of course, there are tons of plugins, both official plugins developed by the Flutter team as well as

4
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:30.210
community plugins that allow you to do all kinds of things related to native device features and of

5
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.550
course, you also got tons of plugins that help you with totally different things as well.

6
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:41.640
Now what if you still have some use case, some scenario where you need to run some native code, where

7
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.310
you need to tap into some native device features, some native device code and there is no plugin

8
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.480
available?

9
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.080
Well the good thing with Flutter is you can actually write your own native code for Android or for iOS.

10
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.190
Now obviously for that, you have to know how to write that code but maybe you also found a code snippet on

11
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.960
Stack Overflow or some other source which is written in Swift for iOS or Objective C or Java for Android

12
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.510
and you want to connect that code snippet to your Flutter app and as you will learn in this module, it's

13
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:22.290
actually pretty easy to connect your Flutter app to any native code and fluently run that native code

14
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.610
and actually even use the result of that code in your Flutter app thereafter.

15
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.700
So let's have a look.
