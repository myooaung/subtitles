00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:09.460
Thus far in this course, we had a look at the core basics of Flutter, of widgets and of building basic

2
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.870
apps and of debugging and running them.

3
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:17.950
In this module, we'll have a closer look at the things you need to build real realistic apps

4
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:23.130
and that means we'll dive into more widgets, more widgets that are built into Flutter.

5
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.930
We'll have a look at styling widgets, at building custom widgets, at theming which allows you to set

6
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:36.910
up a global style for your application and also at adding logic to an app and how you get that combination

7
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.540
right of having a nice user interface

8
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:47.800
and of course also having your logic in code that does something when the user interacts. This is the

9
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:56.220
app we'll build in this module, our personal expenses tracker where we can add new expenses, like a couple

10
00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:04.410
of shirts here for $30.99 maybe, where we can then also choose a date on which we had

11
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.570
this expense and then this gets not only added to this list but also we have this little chart here at

12
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.320
the top which is calculated and filled dynamically to show us on the last seven days how much we spent

13
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.730
on each day of our total spendings

14
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.640
and this updates with every new transaction we added, with every transaction we remove

15
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.540
as you can see. Also we have this scrollable list here to display our transactions and the overall

16
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.640
scrollable page.

17
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.280
We have different ways of opening that new transaction mode and we have the date picker and in general,

18
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:44.730
you will learn a lot about new widgets, about wiring up your widgets with your own logic like deleting

19
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:50.300
widgets when you click here and also how to style these widgets to have the app look the way

20
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:57.420
it does look. So in detail, as already mentioned, we'll dive into many more widgets and I will show you

21
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.780
examples of how to use them and how to configure them.

22
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.720
Now since Flutter has so many widgets and so many different configuration options for each widget, it's

23
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.780
also crucial that you are able to work with the docs on your own and that you find out how to use in

24
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.590
widgets with the help of the docs

25
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.030
and that's also something I'll emphasize throughout this module.

26
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.330
In addition, you'll also find plenty of extra materials attached to various lectures of this module, so

27
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.030
always check that top left corner of your video player and see if there are downloadable resources that

28
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.650
could be interesting to you to get some extra information and some cheat sheets.

29
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.890
Now besides using widgets and configuring them, we'll have a look at theming and theming our app with

30
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.560
the help of material design which is Google's design language which we'll use in this module. You will

31
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.960
learn what theming is and how it works.

32
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:55.380
You will also learn how to add images and fonts, custom fonts to your application and you will learn

33
00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.200
how to add business logic and wire everything up there so that things happen when users press buttons

34
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.380
and that your user interface updates correctly.

35
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.630
It's a lot of content,

36
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.460
it's a long section and together with the previous two sections,

37
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:15.540
this will give you even more fundamentals and also then know how you need to build your first basic

38
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.340
real applications with Flutter.
