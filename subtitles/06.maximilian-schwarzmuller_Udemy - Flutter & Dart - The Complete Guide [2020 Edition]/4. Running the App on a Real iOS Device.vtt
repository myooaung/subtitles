So this here is now a live recording of my connected iPhone.

2
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.080
So now I want to launch the app on that iPhone

3
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:18.420
and once you connected your iPhone or your iPad to your macOS device, on that device, you should be prompted

4
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.330
whether you want to trust the connected device and you should of course choose

5
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:30.170
yes there and you should then be able to select your device here in Visual Studio Code in the bottom

6
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.500
right corner by clicking on that bar as well.

7
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.410
Now I'm actually not able to choose it here

8
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.760
and if that's the case for you as well, you can.
