1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,150
Almost there,

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:07,910
what's missing now is the orders, the orders should also belong to a user.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,340
For that, I'll just store them like the favorite status of a product,

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:18,750
I'll give them a separate node in my database so to say or I'll add separate nodes inside of that orders

5
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,610
entry in the database

6
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:32,530
or I'll add separate subnodes here under orders instead of directly storing the orders here. For this

7
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:32,980
to work,

8
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:39,660
besides the authToken in the orders class here, in the orders.dart file, we also need to get the userId

9
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,840
of course and therefore this should be provided in the constructor

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,090
and for that to work, we need to go back to the main.dart file because here, we do pass data into our

11
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:58,070
constructor and there, we should now also forward the userId. With that done, we can go back to orders,

12
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:03,080
now we have the userId available there and for example here when we fetch the orders, I expect

13
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:09,380
to get them from orders but in there now from a subfolder which actually is my userId and for that

14
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:14,390
of course when we store orders, we have to make sure we store them in such a subfolder by also adding

15
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:23,420
that here, that should already be all. With that if we save this and we go to orders, we shouldn't fetch

16
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:23,820
any

17
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:30,270
because for this user, we have no orders, we have no orders in such a subfolder. Now here,

18
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:39,640
let's log back in and I was logged out here by the way automatically because my token expired and that

19
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:46,990
therefore led to this logic in the main.dart file where we check isAuth which does some token expiration

20
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,380
date validation, led to render the AuthScreen

21
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:55,390
so that's good but now that I logged back in, let's add a couple of items to the cart here and place the

22
00:01:55,390 --> 00:02:03,150
order. Let's now go to orders and now we can see that order here because now in the orders folder, we

23
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:09,000
have a separate subfolder for that user with our own order data in there and if I delete all the other

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,290
orders which belong to no user

25
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:17,100
thanks to that new structure, we can also try logging in with a different user and we shouldn't see that

26
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:17,750
order then.

27
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:24,990
So if I do a refresh and I login with the test2@test.com user, we now actually shouldn't

28
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,820
see our order here.

29
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:36,030
So let's do a quick login here and go to the orders screen, no orders here

30
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:41,830
and yes we could show some text here which says no orders found but for now this will do.

31
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:49,550
The good thing is that now, we're scoping all the data or we're attaching all the data to users and that's

32
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,970
of course how it should be. We're making sure that every user has its own data.
