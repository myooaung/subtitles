1
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:06,050
Now let's say our code is finished and we're happy with the code,

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:11,470
now it's time to finalize our metadata so to say, let's start with Android.

3
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:18,950
There in the app folder, in the src folder, you have your AndroidManifest. In there, you set the

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:24,170
Android label for example and that's the name of the app which users see on their home screen or in

5
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:24,980
the app drawer.

6
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:29,210
So for example, I will name this great places and you can pick any name you want here,

7
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:30,550
this is what your user sees,

8
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,520
so pick a nice name here.

9
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,910
This Android name here is nothing you should change,

10
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,730
that's an internal identifier.

11
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:43,500
Now another thing you want to make sure in the AndroidManifest is that you're setting the right permissions,

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,130
I showed this throughout this course. Certain packages need certain permissions, for example when we're working

13
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:54,220
with the user location, we need to get the permission to get the user location.

14
00:00:54,230 --> 00:01:00,320
Now there's one tricky permission actually in Flutter apps, you might notice that in your app src

15
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,790
folder, in the Android folder, you also have a debug folder with another AndroidManifest file.

16
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,530
Now this is a very short file which has only one permission,

17
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:14,150
the internet permission. In the end, this file is merged with your main AndroidManifest file automatically

18
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:18,330
by Flutter whilst you are working on your app in development mode.

19
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:24,140
The Internet permission is required by Flutter to talk to your development server which is running on

20
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:24,920
your machine

21
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:25,670
and that's in the end

22
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:31,670
the setup that enables this hot reloading, hot refresh stuff that's all managed through behind the scenes

23
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,790
internet connection between your app and your machine so to say.

24
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:40,400
That's why every Flutter app needs the Internet permission during development but not necessarily in

25
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,530
production.

26
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:47,450
If your app does need internet access in production and for example this app does need it because we

27
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:50,940
have that location helper where we're sending a HTTP request,

28
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:57,170
if your app needs that, you need to copy that permission line from the AndroidManifest in the debug

29
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,900
folder into your main AndroidManifest,

30
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,020
so here, right next to the location permission,

31
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:08,600
otherwise your app will work during development but not after you published it or once you build it for

32
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,530
production,

33
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:13,860
so really make sure you're setting this up correctly.

34
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,110
You can also change your package identifier here.

35
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:22,200
The idea behind this identifier is that it's unique across the entire App Store,

36
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:28,690
that's why you typically use your own domain if you own one of your own website in a reverse way,

37
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:34,300
so for example for me since I own academind.com, I could use com.academind 

38
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,380
great_places.

39
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,990
Now if you have no domain, you can come up with one,

40
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:44,470
this doesn't have to exist but you should of course take one that probably really doesn't exist and

41
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,790
isn't owned by anyone

42
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:51,190
so that you ensure that you really have a unique identifier for your app when you then publish it to

43
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:56,960
the app stores because that's in the end the idea, have a unique identifier here.

44
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:02,530
Now if you're changing your ID here, you should change it in all the places where it's referenced, for

45
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:10,120
example also here in the debug AndroidManifest and also in your MainActivity.java file where

46
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:15,610
we're also importing from it because this will be used everywhere to tie your app together thereafter.

47
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:21,130
Another place where it's getting used is the build.gradle file in your app folder in the Android folder.

48
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:27,490
There we're also referring to that application ID and here, you should adjust it as well.

49
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:31,240
Now whilst we are in that file, let's also see what else we can set there,

50
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:36,790
for example you can set your mini SDK version or your target SDK version for this project.

51
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:44,380
Now these are some Android specifics, the mini SDK version defines the minimum Android version expressed

52
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,160
as a number which your app supports and on older versions, it won't be installable

53
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:56,110
and this target SDK version simply normally targets the latest stable Android version.

54
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:02,080
You can read more about the configuration here also in an attached link to this lecture, the default

55
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,840
settings here normally should be

56
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,870
all right.

57
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:11,250
So really just make sure you adjusted this application ID. Let's now do the same for iOS,

58
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,910
so let's go to the iOS folder and there, it's the runner folder in which we work. There in the info

59
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,240
plist file,

60
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,660
you should check that all your permissions are set up correctly

61
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:28,980
but unlike as we did it for Android, here you don't need to set a specific Internet permission, so nothing

62
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:33,430
to do regarding that and the identifier is also not set directly here

63
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:37,380
but we will set it somewhere else instead. The somewhere else is Xcode,

64
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:44,790
so let's fire up Xcode now and there simply open your iOS folder in your project folder and then

65
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,730
the runner.xcworkspace file,

66
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:51,550
SO not the Xcode project file but the xcworkspace file. Open that

67
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:56,390
and then here make sure you got your projects selected here in this project folder view

68
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,850
and then under targets, here you can set the display name, like great places which is shown on your screen

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,370
and then here you can also set up your own unique identifier which doesn't have to be the same one as

70
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,340
for Android

71
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:15,300
but the idea is the same, it's unique across the entire App Store and therefore you want to use a reverse

72
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:22,060
domain. If you own one, use that, otherwise come up with one which probably isn't owned by someone else

73
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:28,440
and then here, simply create such an identifier. One tiny difference compared to Android is that instead

74
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:34,890
of having great_places, for iOS you typically use the camel case notation here which means

75
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,560
you start with a lowercase character but then the next word inside of the word starts with a capital

76
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,250
character,

77
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:46,830
so greatPlaces with a capital P. With that, we have a unique bundle identifier here,

78
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:50,160
we have a display name and that's it for now.

79
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,720
Now let's move on to the next step.
