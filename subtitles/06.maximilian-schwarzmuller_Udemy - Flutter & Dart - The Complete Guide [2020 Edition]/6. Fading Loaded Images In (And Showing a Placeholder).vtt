00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:05.950
With all of that, I'm pretty happy regarding the auth screen,

2
00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:12.170
so let's actually login now and have a look at what we can do inside of the application because there

3
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.810
are also things we can animate,

4
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.620
for example these images.

5
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.110
It's pretty ugly how they're popping in when this gets loaded and Flutter has us covered there as well,

6
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:29.390
we can render that in a more beautiful way. We can use a placeholder image to then fade in the real image

7
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.430
once it's loaded and show the placeholder image instead

8
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:38.360
and for that, let's go to the assets folder and add an images folder there and attached to this video, you

9
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:44.840
find an image, product-placeholder.png which you can drag and drop in there. Once it's in there,

10
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.230
you need to go to your pubspec.yaml file and register this widget there.

11
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.760
So there, you should find that assets area where you have some example code already and there, point at

12
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.430
your assets/images folder or whatever you named it

13
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:08.560
and then add product-placeholder.png which is my file name. This make sure that this is 

14
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.960
available inside of the application

15
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:19.620
and now we can start using that. Now for that, let's go to the products overview

16
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:27.590
screen here and there, we are rendering our different items here in the products grid.

17
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.750
Now in the products grid of course, if we go there, we're using the products item and in the products

18
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.430
item widget, that's in the end where the image gets displayed, here with image network.

19
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:48.760
Now you need to wrap that with fade in image. Fade in image is a widget built into Flutter which does

20
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:55.510
just what it suggests, what the name suggests, it fades in your image once it's there and it allows you

21
00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.860
to define a placeholder. Placeholder takes an image provider,

22
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:07.030
so not an image widget like image network but a provider, things like network image or in our case, asset

23
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.010
image

24
00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.020
and there you have to pass in a string where you point at the image you want to use. So in our case,

25
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:20.130
that's of course assets/images/product-placeholder.png.

26
00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:27.750
Now fade in image of course also takes an image argument which is the image you actually want to render

27
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:34.290
once it's done loading that image. This also takes an image provider and here, I'll use the network

28
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.670
image provider

29
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:42.990
and of course point at product imageUrl and with that, Flutter will automate if you wait until this

30
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:49.500
has been downloaded before it then shows it and it will nicely animate it in automatically, so it has a

31
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:57.050
fade in animation baked in. With that, we can remove that image network widget here and the last thing

32
00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.940
I want to set up on the fade in image is the fit property which I set to BoxFit.cover so that

33
00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:08.300
this looks in the exact same way the network image looked before. If you save that and you reload this

34
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:15.440
shop page, the images are now there instantly because they were loaded before. Let's to a full restart

35
00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:23.450
of the application so that nothing is cached and now you see, the placeholder images and then the images

36
00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.450
are smoothly faded in once they're there and this is of course a nicer user experience because we don't

37
00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.330
have these things pop in,

38
00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.440
instead we have a nice animation.
