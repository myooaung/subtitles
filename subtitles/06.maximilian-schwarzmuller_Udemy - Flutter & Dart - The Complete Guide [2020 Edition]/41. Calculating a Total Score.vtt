00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.570
This was a pretty long module,

2
00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:12.260
I now want to wrap it up or bring it to an end by making this quiz a bit more realistic and showing

3
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.090
different results based on which answers we chose.

4
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.640
Now of course, you could now make this extremely complex,

5
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.300
I will make it relatively simple though.

6
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:29.450
What I want to do is I want to turn each answer here also into a map, by wrapping it with curly braces

7
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.250
and then we'll of course have our text or answer text or whatever you want to name it

8
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:40.640
and now that's important, you think I want to assign a score to this answer because we have kind of a

9
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.330
personality quiz here, so we can calculate an overall score of the personality of the person who takes

10
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:48.640
our quiz.

11
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.730
Now let's say and that's of course just my logic here,

12
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.760
the higher the score, the more strange or negative a person is and

13
00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.940
therefore if you for example select black as your favorite color, I'll give you a score of 10,

14
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:10.810
on the other hand here for red where then red is our text,

15
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:19.150
we might go with a score of let's say 6 or 5 because red is more positive than black in my world at

16
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.420
least. Now green is even more positive because green is the color of hope

17
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.250
and of course, feel free to assign your own scores to fit your own personal judgment of these colors

18
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.750
but I'll gave green a color of three

19
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.100
and white is of course the color of innocence,

20
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:44.960
so here for white, I'll actually give that a score of let's say 1.

21
00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.510
So with that, these are my answers,

22
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:52.420
they're now all maps, not just text, they've got a text key but then they also got scores.

23
00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.780
Now of course, we can do the same here for our animals and I will now fast forward here,

24
00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.960
of course feel free to assign your own scores or take the ones you find attached, attached you basically

25
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.940
find that questions list

26
00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:14.870
now with all my finished scores assigned and we can then proceed with that. So with the finished

27
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.230
list here,

28
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:23.930
now of course when I pass down my questions here into the quiz, inside of the quiz widget where I build

29
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:31.280
these answer widgets, the answer I'm forwarding here is no longer just a string, that is incorrect instead

30
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.490
each answer I'm looking at is of course itself

31
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:43.450
now a map, so we should change this, a map where we have a string key and then objects, various values

32
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:52.990
because we have in our answers, we have both text and we have numbers. So therefore here when I map, answer

33
00:02:53.020 --> 00:03:01.620
now is also a map with various values and therefore here I'm of course interested in my text, in the

34
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:11.190
answer text which I know will be a string but I will also need the score to calculate a total score

35
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.450
of course and for that here to answerQuestion,

36
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:22.050
so to that function which we have in the main.dart file, this _answerQuestion function here,

37
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.200
we actually need to get the score of the answer which was chosen.

38
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.670
So I expect a score here as an argument and this should be an integer, to calculate a total score.

39
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:40.330
Hence we should also add a total score, _totalScore here, a total score property in our overall

40
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:48.940
class and then here in answerQuestion, I want to increase or add to the total score the score that we

41
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:49.720
chose.

42
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:56.060
So total score should be equal to total score plus score By the way

43
00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.060
if you have a setup like this, there also is a shortcut in Dart, instead of using equal old value plus

44
00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.740
some new value,

45
00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:09.590
you can also have plus equal and this will add this value to the old value before it then saves it back

46
00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:10.960
into that variable.

47
00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.730
So we add our score to the total score

48
00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:20.720
now in answerQuestion but now we have to make sure that in the quiz.dart file here where we forward

49
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:28.580
answerQuestion to an answer, we actually make sure that we call answer questions with the chosen score

50
00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.610
and at the moment where we only point a reference, a pointer at that function,

51
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.910
we're not doing that because with just a pointer,

52
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:43.310
we're not saying anything about the arguments that this function takes when it is called and by default,

53
00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:49.430
Flutter will call it without any arguments because we must not forget that our function here is bound

54
00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.990
to onPressed and onPressed takes a function without arguments.

55
00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:01.640
So what do we do? In quiz.dart where I build my answer widgets, where I forward that pointer at answer

56
00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:09.260
question, instead of forwarding this, I can forward an anonymous function and here I use this one line

57
00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.850
arrow function syntax which I also showed you earlier.

58
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:19.220
Now by doing this, I create a function on the fly and to the answer widget, I automatically only pass

59
00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.760
the address to that function.

60
00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:26.420
So that function is created on the fly, stored in memory and instead of storing it in a variable which

61
00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.900
then holds the address which I could use here, I automatically get back the address,

62
00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.030
so I do get the address here and I forward that address to answer.

63
00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:41.160
Now the thing is therefore my answer widget still gets a function which takes no arguments right,

64
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.720
that is an empty list and that then does something.

65
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:52.220
Now here however on the right side of the arrow here, I'm in the function body of that anonymous function.

66
00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:58.600
So here, I no longer want to just use the address, here I instead want to call answerQuestion

67
00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:59.480
Why?

68
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:05.960
Because this is now not executed when Dart parses this, there it will only create this anonymous function

69
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.240
and store it in memory

70
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:13.790
but this is now executed when onPressed is triggered, right because it's an anonymous function where

71
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:18.880
I forward the address to answer, the address is then bound to the button here,

72
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:25.610
so when a button is pressed, this address is used to then execute this anonymous function. So this function

73
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.740
body here is only triggered when the button is pressed.

74
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.380
Therefore when it is pressed, I do want to call answerQuestion

75
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:40.640
and now since I call it here, I do have access to my answer map here, to my answer object and therefore

76
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:46.820
also to the score because every answer through which I'm looping here or through which I'm going here, every

77
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:55.270
answer is just a map with a text and a score and now I can access that score here. So I can now forward

78
00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:03.220
answer score here to answerQuestion and I know that this will be an integer and therefore, answer

79
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:06.630
question here will receive my integer score,

80
00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:07.480
here it is.

81
00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:10.050
I hope this flow is clear,

82
00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:16.000
it's really just about passing function references around and here we're creating such a function and

83
00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:23.260
therefore also such a function reference on the fly. It only gets executed when the button is pressed though,

84
00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:31.000
so when it is pressed I of course want to execute this function in here. So with that, I can forward the score

85
00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:32.400
to my answer

86
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:37.230
question function here in main and I do increment the total score now.

87
00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:44.470
I now want to forward that total score to the result widget so that I can show different results there.
