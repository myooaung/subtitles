1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:07,680
The next step is that you ensure that your third-party APIs and services are configured correctly.

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,660
So if you're using something like Firebase, make sure your security rules are set up correctly there

3
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,520
or when working with Google APIs like we're doing it here,

4
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:23,320
you can search for the Google Cloud Platform console or just the Google Cloud console and then log into

5
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:29,220
there with your Google account and then under credentials here, you will see the API keys your app use.

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:34,880
So this is the API key we are using here in the location helper for example.

7
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,750
Now I will delete this key here once I'm done recording, so you won't be able to use this one but for

8
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,400
your own key, you can,

9
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,400
you don't have to but you can restrict it,

10
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:48,300
for example you could restricted to only work on Android apps if you wanted to and then you'll find

11
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,600
out which instructions you should follow here on the right.

12
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:56,670
You can also restrict your API in different ways and whilst you might not need to do that, you should

13
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:57,800
at least be aware of that,

14
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:02,640
read through that and see if you want to change something there, if you want to change the APIs for

15
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,230
which this key can be used

16
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,110
or if you want to restrict it in any other way.

17
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,800
And whichever third-party service you are using,

18
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:16,890
make sure you're using it such that it's secure and your users can only do what you want them to do.
