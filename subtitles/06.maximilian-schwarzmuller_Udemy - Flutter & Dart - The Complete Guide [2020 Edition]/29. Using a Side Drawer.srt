1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:08,940
We need a drawer to switch between our orders screen and our products screen here, our ProductsOverviewScreen

2
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,170
and I want to use the same drawer in both widgets and

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,850
therefore I'll add a new widget which I'll name app_drawer

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,360
but of course you can name this however you want. In there,

5
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:29,700
I'll have a stateless widget, app drawer and as always, import material.dart.

6
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,030
Now it's totally up to you how you build that drawer,

7
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,780
it typically should use to drawer widget though with which Flutter ships because that gives you the

8
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,280
general look and the background, the overlay effect and so on,

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,050
so that is something you should use

10
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,840
but what you have in there, that's totally up to you.

11
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:52,770
Now here I'll add a column with a couple of children, a couple of child widgets and one thing I will add

12
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,440
here which we haven't done before and therefore it's absolutely no problem if you didn't do that,

13
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,150
there is no way you could have known that,

14
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,720
I will add an appBar in here.

15
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,970
You could also build your own complex container as we did in the navigation section

16
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:15,790
but to save some time, I'll add an appBar in here with a title where I say hello friend, whatever you

17
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:21,030
want and important, I'll add automaticallyImplyLeading and set it to false.

18
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:26,510
What this does is simply means it will never add a back button here because that wouldn't work in here

19
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,220
and therefore, it should never display one,

20
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:35,610
even if it thinks that you can go back, it shouldn't show one. So that's the topmost widget in my column here,

21
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,980
below that I'll add a divider,

22
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:47,160
this nice little horizontal line and then add a ListTile which is an entry in that drawer. The first list

23
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:53,720
tile will get a leading element or a leading widget which is an icon widget with an

24
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,410
icon of the shop

25
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:01,340
icon here because it should lead us back to our ProductsOverview page.

26
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:06,410
So here, I'll add a title of shop because that is indeed where we will go.

27
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,410
Now on tapping this, I want to use my navigator

28
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:25,330
and indeed go back to the root route which is just slash if you remember, pushReplacementNamed is correct

29
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:25,810
then.

30
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:32,540
So I just want to go back to the root route to MyHomePage so to say. Now I'll repeat that pattern of

31
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:37,820
having a divider and a ListTile and the second ListTile here actually gets a payment

32
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:46,070
icon because that should take me to my orders. So there, I'll say orders and that will go to

33
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:49,360
a new name which we have to add to the orders screen.

34
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:57,440
So on the orders screen there, we can add a static const routeName which could be just /orders for

35
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,080
example, as always this name is totally up to you

36
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,540
but now assigning this name here in the orders screen allows us to use it here when we push to it

37
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:09,950
and of course for that, we have to register it here in the main.dart file too.

38
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:18,710
So let's start with registering this, let's import that screen from the screens folder, the orders screen

39
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:26,800
and now in the routes table, in our main.dart file there, we can use the OrdersScreen.routeName as the key

40
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:37,590
and then here, we'll build that orders screen, like this and we can also now use it in the drawer.

41
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,410
So in the drawer

42
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:46,940
indeed, I now want to import from the screens folder my orders screen, so that I can use its routeName

43
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,270
here.

44
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:55,200
So when I want to push to it, here I use OrdersScreen.routeName.

45
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,070
So this is it,

46
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,680
this is what I want to add to the drawer for now,

47
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,360
yours very likely looks totally different but that's fine too of course

48
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,560
and now let's use the drawer,

49
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:10,440
that's the interesting part of course in the ProductsOverviewScreen and the orders screen. In the

50
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:17,790
ProductsOverviewScreen, here we have the appBar and below the appBar, before the body maybe but the

51
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,630
order doesn't matter here,

52
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:26,100
I add my order and I refer to my AppDrawer which is that new widget I worked on, which you have to import

53
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,120
here therefore.

54
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,670
Now my IDE added it but not in the way I want it.

55
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,940
So let me use a relative path there,

56
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,190
go to the widgets folder and import app drawer

57
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:40,200
and with that imported, we got it here.

58
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,550
Let's do the same in the orders screen, there

59
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:49,410
on the orders screen, I also want to add the drawer here

60
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:57,780
and for that, add an import to this newly added widget, the app_drawer.dart file here in the order screen

61
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:04,030
so that we can render it here. With that, if we do a full refresh, we see that drawer

62
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:09,440
icon here and we can go to orders, we can go back to the shop. And if I

63
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:18,010
now add items here to the cart and I click order now, if I then go to my orders, indeed here I see information

64
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,070
about that order.

65
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,780
We can now also expand this but this doesn't work yet,

66
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:28,600
so this is the next piece of functionality I want to add of course and I also want to add some slashes

67
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,870
here in the date,

68
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:39,610
let me actually do that first real quick, in the order item here, add slashes, like this and you can also

69
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,550
switch month and day if that's more convenient to you of course.
