00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:08.480
We spent a lot of time on our text inputs, on these transactions and for the moment, I'm quite happy with

2
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.850
the result.

3
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.480
Now as a next step, I want to make sure that this text input area

4
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:20.660
here however is not always visible but instead as we also planned it at the beginning of the section,

5
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.200
it is shown when we press a button, a button that's added here in our action bar and a button here at

6
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.780
the bottom,

7
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.010
a so-called floating action button.

8
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.490
And for that, we first of all need these buttons,

9
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.270
so let's learn how to add buttons in the app bar or buttons on the overall page

10
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:46.330
with the help of that floating action button feature. Let's start with the app bar. Here in main.dart,

11
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.670
which is where I do render that app bar, on the app bar,

12
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.570
you can add an actions argument and that takes a list of widgets.

13
00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.770
Now theoretically of course, you can add any widget in here, text or whatever you want.

14
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:07.030
Typically however, you add buttons here though or most typically, you add icon buttons.

15
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.550
We haven't used that before,

16
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:15.480
we worked with a RaisedButton and we worked with the FlatButton but there also is an IconButton

17
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.890
and the IconButton does what the names suggests, it renders a button that only holds an icon.

18
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.050
For that, we need to set the icon argument here and the icon argument takes,

19
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.260
let's have a look,

20
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:36.100
it takes a widget but actually it wants an icon widget. Icon is another widget built into Flutter, so icon is

21
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.040
coming from Flutter and it gives us a widget that in the end renders an icon

22
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.060
and it takes one positional argument,

23
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.530
the icon data,

24
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.180
so basically some information on which icon to show

25
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.880
and there we can use icons which is a class provided by Flutter

26
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.440
that gives us access to all the typical material icons.

27
00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.030
So here, you can go through that list and conveniently here, you see a preview of the icon

28
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.340
that's getting rendered

29
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.200
and here I'll use the add icon which is simply a plus.

30
00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:12.940
Now on that icon here, you could also configure other things, like the color of the icon or the size

31
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.330
but I'm happy with the default and on the IconButton,

32
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.860
you can also configure other things,

33
00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.730
most importantly you need to provide onPressed, just as you do it on other buttons as well.

34
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.490
For the moment I'll set it to an empty anonymous function so that the button isn't disabled but at the

35
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.020
moment of course, it also won't do anything useful. Here

36
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.180
now we see that button and you can of course remove the debug banner here with the help of the Dart

37
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.960
dev tools

38
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.760
as you learned it in the debugging section if it's annoying to you. I hope you can see the button here though,

39
00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:49.720
this is the button which when we press it should bring up a little modal, a bottom sheet here sliding

40
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.750
in from the bottom which holds this text input area. And it's not just this button,

41
00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.550
I also want to have that floating action button. We add this also with the help of the scaffold, there

42
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.110
besides app bar and body,

43
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.510
you can also add

44
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.700
the floating action button argument. By the way, you don't have to add that below the body,

45
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.820
it doesn't matter in which order you provide these named arguments. Floating action button wants a widget

46
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:22.960
as a child

47
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:30.490
and typically that is a floating action button which is a button optimized to be used as a floating

48
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:31.480
action button.

49
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:32.910
You could use any button though

50
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.180
but I will go with the floating action button

51
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:42.030
and here I will also provide my icon, an icon widget by using icons add.

52
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.750
So the icon widget here is a normal widget and therefore can be used as a child in the floating action

53
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:47.370
button

54
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.010
and then here, onPressed. For the moment, I'll not do anything.

55
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.460
If we now go back,

56
00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.350
we have that floating action button here in the bottom right corner.

57
00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.060
You can also change the position of that floating action button here with another argument you pass to

58
00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.110
scaffold,

59
00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:09.800
you can add the floating action button location argument and set this to floating action button location.

60
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:17.120
and then you have a couple of options like center float for example, if you save this, it now floats

61
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:20.020
in the bottom center which is really nice.

62
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.560
So now we have this button here as well,

63
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.120
we have the button up here,

64
00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.340
let's next make sure that when we press these buttons, they bring up that sheet which in the end

65
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.680
can hold that user input area here.
