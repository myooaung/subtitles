1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:07,830
Now let's start with the responsiveness and for that, if we have a look at this application,

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,200
I would say on phones, this looks and feels pretty good.

3
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:20,670
We have the overall scrollability here on our general page and we can scroll this ListView here which is

4
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,340
also nice.

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,200
Now we face a problem

6
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:31,650
however as soon as we rotate this. In landscape mode, the general look and feel might be okay, though

7
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:36,810
you could argue that maybe we can shrink the width of this chart a little bit,

8
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:43,170
maybe it doesn't need to stretch the full width of our device here and we certainly face a problem with

9
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,010
the list down there.

10
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:52,890
I can kind of scroll the list here but if I scroll the overall page which I can also do, then I actually

11
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:58,920
can scroll the list but I have a hard time getting to my chart, I actually can't scroll up anymore because

12
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,070
my list occupies the full page and that by the way stems from our setting here in the transaction list

13
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:09,830
where I give that container with the list a fixed height. This fixed height,

14
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:17,190
if you remember, was fine tuned to work really well on portrait mode and therefore here on portrait mode,

15
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:22,620
we have no problem with it because this container with the list kind of fits nicely at the bottom of

16
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:29,310
our overall height of the screen and therefore we can scroll both the list and the general page. If we

17
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,570
go into landscape mode,

18
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:37,320
that changes because now the container with the list still has a height of 450 which is too high,

19
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:44,280
it stretches below the boundaries or outside of the boundaries of our device because we have

20
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:51,060
less height available in landscape mode and therefore, since this container has a fixed height and this

21
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:57,570
transaction list is in the end just part of our overall column which has a SingeChildScrollView,

22
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,490
we can scroll our general page to bring that 450 high container into view

23
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:08,940
but as soon as this container is inside of the view, we can scroll the list items in there because in

24
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:15,840
our transaction list container, we have a ListView which is always scrollable but then we have no

25
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,570
handle to scroll the overall page because wherever we're clicking, we're just inside of the ListView,

26
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:24,960
we're scrolling the ListView and that's of course bad.

27
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:31,500
Now here a solution would be to restrict the general height of this container and calculate it dynamically

28
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:37,860
based on the size of the device we're running on and then we could also get rid of that overall

29
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:44,500
SingleChildScrollView because we could always size our chart and our transaction list such that they split

30
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:49,650
the available height and never need to be scrollable because neither the chart nor the list extends

31
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,620
out of our page view,

32
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:57,930
instead only the list itself then scrollable inside of that space we reserved for it. In case that's

33
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,460
not entirely clear what I mean,

34
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,920
we'll implement this in the next lectures.
