00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:08.350
In this module, we had a thorough look at authentication. You learned how to send login and sign up requests

2
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.340
and how authentication in general works with that token and so on.

3
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.540
You learned how to manage that token and managing that token also involved

4
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:23.260
that you find a way to pass that AuthData onto other providers which the provider package makes really

5
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.820
simple with the ProxyProvider approach here.

6
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:33.220
We use that not only to get the token which you then need to attach to your requests to get access but

7
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:39.730
we also use that to forward the userId, to filter by userId or to for example, store our favorites

8
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.780
by userId.

9
00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:48.070
In addition, we had a thorough look at managing the session of our user, the lifetime of our user with

10
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:54.100
auto logout and our timer in there and also of course, with our auto login which tries to log the user in.

11
00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.670
In the main.dart file, we made sure that we show different screens based on the authentication status

12
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.410
and with that, you hopefully got a collection of tools that help you build the user experience you want

13
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.350
to build in your next app.

14
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:13.570
Now one important note here at the end, if you plan on using Firebase, you can simplify a lot of that

15
00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.300
by using the official Firebase SDK for Flutter, that will do all of the heavy lifting of managing the

16
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.780
token and so on behind the scenes.

17
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.680
I didn't do that here because obviously you might be building an app that doesn't use Firebase and I

18
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.010
still want to teach you something useful in that case,

19
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.630
so here's the full behind the scenes flow as you could implement it with any back-end.
