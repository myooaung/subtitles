00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:01.320
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:09.000
Another two important functions that you always need to use in case you aren't using any other technique

3
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.050
are the minuscule escape.

4
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.480
Real escapes create a string and the female entities.

5
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.010
So what are these functions?

6
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.600
These functions will and should be used in case you are inserting.

7
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.840
In case you are inserting.

8
00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.570
Data into databases before inserting data into database.

9
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.140
This function that I'm going to talk about that I'm going to show you shortly will kind of sanitize

10
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.770
your data.

11
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.210
It's going to clean your data.

12
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.900
So this function is very important.

13
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:50.510
I'm going to your show you this function is called my is I real skip string.

14
00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.350
So this function is very important in case you are inserting data.

15
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.350
The second very important function that you need to use is called HD Email.

16
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.150
It's called HD email entities.

17
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:11.700
And this function should be used whenever you are displaying displaying data.

18
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.380
So whether you are displaying data from the user or displaying data that you got from the database,

19
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:25.450
you need to use either the special characters or the the HD email entities.

20
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:31.810
So the special the female special characters and the HD mail entities are basically the same, except

21
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:38.920
for only one difference, which is the the HD entities will convert all applicable characters to HD

22
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:46.140
male entities, whereas the HD male special characters will convert only the special characters to HD

23
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.930
male entities.

24
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:57.220
So HD this is, I would say is stronger than stronger than the HD special characters because it converts

25
00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.670
all applicable characters to female.

26
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.380
So you can use one of them, but I would recommend using the entities.

27
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.510
So let me show you examples on where you should use these two functions.

28
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:15.760
So the my is ill real skip string should be used whenever you are inserting something into the database.

29
00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:24.730
For example, maybe here you are waiting for something that the user is going to give you in order for

30
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.860
you to insert into the database, for example.

31
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.740
Maybe you want to update the their email.

32
00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:36.460
So before updating their email, they would, they would first type you their new email, for example,

33
00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.090
admin at example, nbc.com or whatever email.

34
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.090
Let me say here, mark at example that count, for example.

35
00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:53.700
And once they submit that email, that new email, you need to pass that email into the my scale reels

36
00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.250
keep stream and I'm going to be showing you an example later.

37
00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.840
But this is where you should use the real skip string.

38
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:08.050
The other function, which is HD email entities, is used whenever you are getting something from the

39
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.530
database.

40
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.860
For example, if you want to display something from the database or something that the user has recently

41
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:22.990
submitted, you need to use the HD HD email, special characters or the HD email entities.

42
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.230
So one of them, just one function.

43
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.280
Let me show you this function now.

44
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.420
So this function is going to you let me first refresh.

45
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:38.140
Allow me try to type your one and then each one and then I'm going to say hello.

46
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:47.860
So as you can see, I have submitted here a HD melkote and if you click on find, this guide will be

47
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:48.730
displayed as is.

48
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:56.830
It's not going to be interpreted as HD email because this function, the the email entities will not

49
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.410
allow users to use HD email.

50
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:10.080
It's going to convert any, any, any characters, any UN unknown characters to text, to plain text

51
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.380
instead of it interpreting this good as HD email.

52
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:21.820
And by the way, you can use these parameters are optional.

53
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:29.400
So you can use if you are confused about these optional optional parameters, you can use this one,

54
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:37.990
this function with only one mandatory character mandatory parameter, which is the the text that the

55
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.120
user will submit.

56
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.320
And then you can use this.

57
00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.840
So let me refresh let me show you another example which is using a script.

58
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.790
So if you if the user tries to inject any JavaScript into your system.

59
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:53.190
Yeah.

60
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:59.880
And if you click on find here, as you can see, it's going to convert that script into a simple text.

61
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.810
So this function is super important and you should use it.

62
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.730
You should always use this function to actually email entities or email special characters whenever

63
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.370
you are displaying something to users.
