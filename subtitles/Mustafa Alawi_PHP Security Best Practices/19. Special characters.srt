00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:01,720
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:12,010
So now I'm going to be showing you how to protect yourself against the the cross-site scripting attack

3
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:16,030
and how to protect your application from being attacked that way.

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:24,340
So the easiest way the easiest way is to use a function called HD Email, a special character.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,080
The solution is to use.

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,310
The easiest solution is to solution.

7
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:41,180
Is to use a special function in it, in each be called the email.

8
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,650
Special.

9
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:46,460
Character.

10
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:54,850
So this function is going to check whether the code that has been inserted into your into your website

11
00:00:54,850 --> 00:01:05,290
is a simple text or or if it contains special characters such as scripts, scripts or simple email code

12
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:11,410
or whatever or any other code that is not recognized as a simple text.

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:17,950
So this function is super powerful when it comes to preventing the excess attacks.

14
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:22,330
So let me use this function and show you the difference.

15
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:32,980
So here before before echoing this, if you say here, if you say HD mail, special, special cars,

16
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:40,840
special characters, and then if you passed the code that has been inserted into this function and then

17
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,020
if you click on file and in stable now.

18
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,220
So now let's test.

19
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,710
Now, if I test me here, try to inject a JavaScript code.

20
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,170
So first, I'm going to remove this completely.

21
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:58,360
I'm going to remove this and I'm going to refresh my website and I'm going to type here a JavaScript

22
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:58,630
code.

23
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:03,310
So here I'm going to say a script and I'm going to try to inject a script here.

24
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,590
I'm going to say here.

25
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:13,210
Saying Alert like before, I'm going to get hurt and then I'm going to say black cat.

26
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:17,860
Now if I click on find, guess what?

27
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,560
The card will be displayed as a text.

28
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,620
It's not going to be executed as a JavaScript cut.

29
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,430
Why?

30
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:34,000
Because this function now, this function, this function recognized that this code is a script.

31
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,650
This code is not a simple text.

32
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:42,760
So it converted that code into a script and it stopped that card from being executed.

33
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:45,460
So the code will will just be a simple text.

34
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:51,160
It's not going to be executed as a as a female code or JavaScript cut.

35
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,960
Let me show you another example.

36
00:02:53,200 --> 00:03:00,910
So here, if I say etch one, if I say it's one like before, and if I say hat, if I say here hat,

37
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,690
and if I click on find, guess what?

38
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:09,280
The code will be displayed as as just as a text.

39
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,610
It's not going to be displayed as a female code because again, this function took care of this and

40
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:25,000
recognized that this code is not a simple code and this code could hurt our application that could cause

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,270
any kind of damage to our application.

42
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:38,740
So this, this was just a simple and easy and fast way to, um, to prevent excess attacks.

43
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:42,430
And it's super powerful because it's easy, it's fast.

44
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,790
You can use it immediately.

45
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,640
You don't have to have a lot of knowledge.

46
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,000
You just need to read what this function does.

47
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,600
Of course you need to be you need to read about this function.

48
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:57,360
So this function converts a special character to its name HD HTML entity.

49
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:04,180
So in other words, if you don't understand what this means, it just converts any thing that is not

50
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:11,050
recognizable as a text to entities to to text it, just going to display that as a text rather than

51
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,560
displaying the actual email.

52
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:20,110
So this is a super powerful solution to the Axis attacks.
