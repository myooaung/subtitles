00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:02.040
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.250
Now, what I'm going to talk about is that I'm going to talk about one of the worst attacks that could

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.780
happen to your website, which is the cross-site scripting, also known as excess attacks.

4
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.120
So what is this type of attack?

5
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:28.440
This type of attack happens when a hacker injects an external go to your website or to the output of

6
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.310
your website.

7
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.400
So it might sound easy, but it's a little complicated.

8
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.280
Complicated.

9
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:46.980
So the user with the the hacker would first study your website and try to find some problems in your

10
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:55.950
code or tries to mess around with your website in order to find a way to inject a code into your website

11
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.380
or into the output of your website.

12
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.310
But this is going to hurt your users.

13
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:10.020
So the the hacker would normally inject a code and that good would which would hurt other users who

14
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.070
use your website.

15
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.980
So for example let me here show you what could the user what could the hacker do.

16
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.310
So a hacker could inject some code.

17
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:27.090
So, for example, suppose that you have a year, this is your website and you have a year, say a form

18
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.990
year and you have a year about.

19
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.010
So this is about an.

20
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:34.400
This is a button.

21
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.000
And this is a form.

22
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.020
So here a hacker is.

23
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.630
Here, let me explain this.

24
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:43.130
So a hacker.

25
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.130
A hacker would.

26
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:58.140
Inject a code instead of instead of typing something to to insert something, something into your your

27
00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.700
database or your website.

28
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.170
A hacker would inject a code.

29
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.300
So that could be, for example, JavaScript.

30
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.740
It could be JavaScript.

31
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.450
It could be any code.

32
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:10.200
It could be.

33
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:18.660
I usually Java script is the one that is usually used for these types of attack.

34
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:30.600
So a hacker would inject a JavaScript code and whenever another person say that here you have some person

35
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.820
here user.

36
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.110
Normal user.

37
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:45.720
This is a normal user and this is a normal user and this is another normal user.

38
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.270
So we have here three users.

39
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:56.590
So these users would use your application with just without any problems.

40
00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.460
They would just head on over to your website and use your application.

41
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:09.360
However, the card that has been injected by the hacker record that has been injected by this hacker.

42
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.160
Exists in your website.

43
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.180
It exists somewhere in your website or in your database.

44
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:26.370
Therefore, when these users when these users attempt you to use your website, they the this card would

45
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:39.660
be displayed to them or would be injected into their browsers some way, and they will get hurt by this.

46
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.180
That code could simply steal their credentials.

47
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.490
It could steal their.

48
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:48.750
Maybe their.

49
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.470
Their emails.

50
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:58.130
It could steal their emails, it could steal cookies, which is very common.

51
00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:04.910
They say this type of attack is very common, is is associated with cookies.

52
00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:13.160
Many hackers do this in order to get cookies which contain which usually contain important information.

53
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.230
Also sessions it could get sessions from.

54
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:19.770
From you.

55
00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:25.620
It could get any type of important, let's say, important or sensitive.

56
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:29.070
And for.

57
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.660
So this is called cross-site scripting.

58
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.570
It's a way of injecting according to your website.

59
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:48.480
And that could will either be stored somewhere in your in in the website itself or in your database.

60
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:54.720
And whenever somebody comes over to your website and uses your website, that could would hurt them.
