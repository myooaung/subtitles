00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:01.800
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.800
Now it's time to clear the database.

3
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:11.610
And in order to get the database, the first step is that you need to make sure that your your Apache

4
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:18.510
Web server, as well as your MySchool database, both running, make sure that they are up and running,

5
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.110
and then you need to hand it over to the browser and then you need to type localhost for a slash dashboard.

6
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:34.020
And this is going to take you to the to the Apache Web server and you will be able to create a database

7
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.790
after you go to this address, localhost four slash dashboard, you can click on BHP, my admin, and

8
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.100
here you can create a database.

9
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.120
Let's create a database.

10
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:52.620
In order to create a database you need to click on New here on the left upper side of the website.

11
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.450
So here I'm going to click on New and this is going to allow you to type the name of the database.

12
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.090
So here I'm going to type the name of a database.

13
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.280
I'm going to name it BHP project.

14
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:13.230
So here I'm going to say BHP underscore project and then I'm going to click on Create after you click

15
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.530
on Key.

16
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.860
Yet you will find that on the left side a database has been created and it's name is BHP Underscore

17
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:20.340
Project.

18
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.480
So make sure that it has been created and if you click on it it will adjust your display.

19
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.000
No tables found in this database because there are no tables, but the database has been created.
