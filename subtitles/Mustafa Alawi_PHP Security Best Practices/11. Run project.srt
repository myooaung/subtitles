00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:01,740
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:07,410
In order to run our project, you need to open up the terminal that comes with the visual circuit.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,190
So if you click on View and then Terminal, this is going to open up a built in.

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,110
As you can see, this is a building where you can run your comments.

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,650
And then in this same hall, you need to type the following command.

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:30,210
You need to type B three and then minus S capital S, and then you need to type local hosts.

7
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,720
And then colon 8000.

8
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:36,230
Or any port you want.

9
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:43,180
Usually we use 8 hours if you can use 80, 80 or 5000 or 8000 or any port you want.

10
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:47,060
But usually reports that we use is 8000.

11
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:53,030
And then once you are done, you need to hit enter and make sure that this command is correct.

12
00:00:53,030 --> 00:01:03,500
BHP minus is localhost calling 8000 and if that is is successful, it's going to say here development

13
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,880
server and this server started, it's going to say that the server is started.

14
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:13,670
You can now copy this, see what else you can copy this your and let me show you that you can copy this.

15
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,500
You are ale and then you can head on over to the browser.

16
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:25,630
And in the browser just type localhost colon 8000 or just base that the URL and then hit enter.

17
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:32,800
And as you can see, what you are going to get is that you are going to get this navigation bar and

18
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,880
this page has been returned because this is the code that we have in the index left BGP.

19
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:43,810
So this is how it works and this is how you can run your BHP good.
