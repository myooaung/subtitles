1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,360
So once Zoom is installed, you will find it among your applications.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:11,580
So if I click on this manager, it will open it for me and it might ask you for your PC or Mac password

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,910
and then I'll go to manage servers.

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,240
And first of all, you need to run the Apache Web server.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,020
Click on Start and we wait until here.

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:22,920
It says Running.

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:34,720
And once here it says Running, you can start your MySchool database, click on check it or click on

8
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,160
it and then click on Start.

9
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:52,080
Once a year, it says running, you'll be able to work with the Apache Web server and you are my skill

10
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:52,500
database.

11
00:00:53,010 --> 00:01:00,360
And by the way, if it forcefully goes back to stopped either the Apache Web server or the MySchool

12
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,200
database, then you might need to restart your PC or your Mac.

13
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:09,300
Once these two are running, go to welcome again here.

14
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:16,590
Head on over to go to application and click on it and it will open the localhost and this.

15
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:23,820
And here in the localhost you can check information about your PHP installation and your database as

16
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,060
well.

17
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,850
So if I go to BHP, my admin.

18
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:35,230
Well up in BHP, my admin where I can manage my databases and tables and do operations on their.

19
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:42,500
And by the way, whenever you are working, just keep the Apache Web server up and running.

20
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:48,890
And also the MySchool database running all the time, because otherwise you won't be able to work with

21
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:52,880
the database and insert data and get data and all of that good stuff.
