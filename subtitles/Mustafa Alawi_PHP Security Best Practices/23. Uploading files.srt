00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:01,960
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:08,170
When it comes to security, one of the most important topics is uploading files.

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:09,070
Why?

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:10,840
Uploading files is important.

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:17,590
It's important because it works as a path between you and users.

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:27,360
Users can reach your back end, so to speak, using you, using files by uploading files.

7
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:35,050
If you have the if you have if you if you allow or accept uploading files for some reason, for some

8
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:42,010
functionality or feature in your website, then you are opening the door for users to upload stuff to

9
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,650
your to your back end.

10
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:52,000
And some users, unfortunately and hackers, unfortunately, could use this to attack your website and

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,750
web application.

12
00:00:53,290 --> 00:01:01,800
So whenever you are, you are developing a uploading feature you need to take into account.

13
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:05,290
You need to take the security seriously into account.

14
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:13,700
And there are many ways in which the in which hackers could use the uploading feature in your website

15
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:20,420
or Web application to harm your your software or Web application.

16
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,360
So let me explain what hackers could do.

17
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:28,310
So suppose that you have here a Web application.

18
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,850
Suppose that this is a Web application and you have your uploading feature that allows users to upload

19
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,060
images, for example, or files.

20
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,540
So this is a button and this is the form.

21
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:48,980
And the hacker could come over to your website or not just a hacker, any user.

22
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:58,370
Let's assume that it's a hacker could just come over to your website and use your website, but instead

23
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:03,620
of uploading what you want them to upload, maybe you are again.

24
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,650
Maybe you are accepting images.

25
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,890
For example, maybe you have a social media

26
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,750
website and you are accepting images.

27
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:23,360
But that hacker, instead of uploading an image, that hacker could upload a script or a a harmful software

28
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:30,590
that could cause bad things to your back end or your website or even your database.

29
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:38,390
Or they could even upload things that are super big and that is is going to take a lot of space.

30
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:44,960
And maybe your, your website, your or your database has a specific limit you cannot accept.

31
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,870
You are.

32
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,150
File sizes.

33
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:59,010
Therefore, it's important to take security into account when it comes to uploading files and uploading

34
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,240
harmful softwares.

35
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:09,840
And Files has been there for quite a long time, and still many web developers and many, many people

36
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:16,740
who have own websites and web applications suffer from this because they don't know how to protect their

37
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,860
application against these types of attacks.

38
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:27,540
And unfortunately, Hacker might not necessarily harm your application.

39
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:33,060
Again, the hacker could upload something and then maybe another user.

40
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,820
Another user is using.

41
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:44,160
Let's say a good user is using your website and that hacker uploaded maybe a harmful, harmful, harmful

42
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,110
software or file.

43
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,690
And that user unfortunately downloaded that file.

44
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:59,790
So maybe that user comes over to your website and maybe you are allowing users to download files in

45
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,270
your your website and that user downloaded that file.

46
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:11,070
And unfortunately, that user's P.C. was destroyed because of that piece of software.

47
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:17,640
So this is why it's important to take security into account when it comes to uploading files.

48
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:24,450
And they're going to be showing you how to limit the types of files that you accept so that hackers

49
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,220
cannot apply to any type of file.

50
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:33,810
And also, I'm going to teach you how to limit the size because because you wouldn't want to allow users

51
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:37,320
to upload any type, any size, any file size.

52
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,460
You need to add a limit.

53
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:45,060
You need to be very restrictive because otherwise many bad users would use this against you.

54
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:51,750
So when it comes to uploading again, when it comes to uploading files, you have to be you have to

55
00:04:51,750 --> 00:05:00,060
add restrictions and barriers in order to block in order to add a wall like this so that hackers cannot

56
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:10,260
break into your system and cause so many detrimental things to your Web application.
