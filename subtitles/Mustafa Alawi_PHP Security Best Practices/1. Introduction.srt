Hi and welcome to this course.

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:11,960
First of all, did you know that your B2B web applications and websites are susceptible to so many attacks

3
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:13,130
from hackers?

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:20,720
Well, if you don't know now, you know, there are so many ways by which hackers could attack your

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:29,330
Web applications and your websites and cause so many problems to your websites that are built using

6
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:29,810
the HP.

7
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:34,940
And in this course, I'm going to be teaching you the most important techniques you need in order to

8
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,570
protect your application from these attacks.

9
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:48,050
There are so many ways that hackers use in order to attack a web application or a website that's built

10
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,280
using B2B.

11
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:57,560
And many B2B developers and and programmers think that the problem is with the language itself.

12
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,480
They think that B2B is the problem.

13
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,370
And this is absolutely wrong.

14
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,280
This is not right at all.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,620
The problem is not with the language.

16
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,620
The problem is with their code.

17
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:16,820
The problem is that they don't they didn't learn the best practices and they didn't learn how to protect

18
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,340
their websites and their web applications.

19
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,170
And just to name a few problems that you could face.

20
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:32,240
And just to name a few attacks that hackers could use to attack your your Web application or your website.

21
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,430
We have the injection.

22
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,620
We have the session and cookie hijacking.

23
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,770
We have the stealing passwords.

24
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:45,580
We have the reforms that we could inject many things into your forums.

25
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:52,940
They are so many things by which hackers could attack and cause so many problems to your application.

26
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:58,820
And in this course, I'm going to teach you the best practices that you need to follow in order to protect

27
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:02,180
your application against and from these attacks.

28
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:08,330
For example, I'm going to teach you how to create a log in system that is going to take into account

29
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:18,530
all necessary measures in order to protect it, to protect it completely against these attacks.

30
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:25,700
Also, I'm going to teach you how to protect any form you have in your application.

31
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,230
Against injections.

32
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,300
Against injections.

33
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:38,120
Whether you have a simple website or a big website, you will learn how to protect how to protect it

34
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,530
against these vs attacks.

35
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:45,530
And then I'm going to also I'm going to also teach you how to protect your database itself from these

36
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:54,470
attacks and how to make sure that the data that are being displayed through users will not harm users.

37
00:02:54,770 --> 00:03:03,740
So the the problem that the attackers could could do to you could extend to hurt your users, users

38
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,970
who use your applications.

39
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,700
And they're going to teach you how to protect your users from these attacks so that hackers will not

40
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:19,280
be able to harm users who use your website or websites and your projects and web applications that are

41
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,340
built using P2P.

42
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,720
So by the end of this course, you will have learned the most important techniques that you need to

43
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,480
take into account whenever you are working with BHP.

44
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:38,960
And you will have learned the most common attacks that hackers use all the time to cause harm to so

45
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:44,900
many projects and websites and web applications that are built in B2B.

46
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,920
And most importantly, you will have a lot of fun in this course.
