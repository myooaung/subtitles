1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,430
So what tools do you need for this course?

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:12,170
Well, for this course you need, first of all, you need a reliable I.D. or text editor.

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:19,610
And my recommendation is that you install visual Visual Studio code where you can install it from code,

4
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:21,200
that Visual Studio icon.

5
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:26,870
You can head on over to that link or that Visual Studio that come and then install it for Mac.

6
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:32,480
It's going to say here, download for Mac and you can just click on this and install it as if you are

7
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,650
installing any MAC program on your MAC.

8
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:43,070
If you are using Windows, you can select it from here and it's going to say here download for Windows

9
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,690
by default or you can click here.

10
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:51,890
If it doesn't say that and you can select your windows here, you can select windows and download the

11
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:57,500
version from here and you can also install and you should also install it as if you are installing a

12
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,060
program on your windows.

13
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,860
So this is the first thing.

14
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:09,500
And if you already have a reliable text editor or it is that you feel comfortable going with, then

15
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,750
you don't need to install visual record.

16
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,270
But if you don't, I recommend using Radio City.

17
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,640
So this is the first thing that you need.

18
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,370
The second thing that you need is that you need to install Zap.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,760
Zap is going to is going to allow you to install B2B in order to use B2B for this course.

20
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:36,410
And you can install it from Apache friends that or you can hear about your friends network and they

21
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:45,320
will be showing you how to completely install Zap on Mac and also on Windows in the next tutorials.
