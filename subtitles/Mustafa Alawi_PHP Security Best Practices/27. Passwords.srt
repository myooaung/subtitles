00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,260
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:09,300
There are so many ways in which hackers could reach your database and they could steal your database

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:15,810
completely or part of your database, depending upon your level of security that you have implemented.

4
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:23,610
So the more secure your database is, the more secure your web application is, the harder for them

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:31,920
to get or steal data from your database or from from your web application.

6
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,870
And one of the most sensitive information is the passwords.

7
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,410
Passwords are very, very important.

8
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:45,810
And as a developer, it's your responsibility to secure passwords.

9
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:56,220
And in order to secure passwords, storing passwords is very, very important because you cannot store

10
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,120
many developers.

11
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,110
Let me explain this.

12
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:05,790
Many people developers think that whenever a user whenever let's say that this is a user, whenever

13
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:13,840
a user gives an account, suppose that you have he suppose that you have a web application and here

14
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,380
you have a registration system.

15
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,170
This is a registration registration system.

16
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:27,270
Many developers think that when a user comes over to their application and registers, they think that

17
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:27,830
that's it.

18
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,320
They only need all they need to do is to get their password.

19
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,090
Get the password.

20
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,980
This is the password.

21
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:41,370
Password and probably probably email, email and password.

22
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:48,030
And just to store that email and password, store that email and password in a database.

23
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,130
In a database.

24
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,930
Suppose that this is a database.

25
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,410
They think that that's it and unfortunately, that's not it.

26
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,760
You cannot store passwords, passwords, especially passwords like this.

27
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,380
You cannot just throw all passwords in the database.

28
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:20,160
And I think that they are secured and nobody will be able to get a hold, so to speak, of these passwords.

29
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:30,180
Hackers can easily access your database if you if you don't have if you didn't implement security measures

30
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:39,300
that you needed and if you did not increase security measures to a level that would prevent them from

31
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,100
accessing your database.

32
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:47,130
So what hackers could do is that they could get hold of your database.

33
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,320
They could steal information from your database.

34
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,910
Suppose that this is a hacker.

35
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:52,850
Hacker.

36
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,570
A hacker could steal your database or part of the database.

37
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,780
And that part could contain passwords.

38
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:02,030
It could contain passwords of users.

39
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:09,710
Therefore, you need to kind of encrypt these passwords.

40
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:18,320
If you encrypt these passwords, even if a hacker if a hacker steals these passwords, that hacker will

41
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:23,060
not be able to do anything with these passwords because they are encrypted.

42
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:28,490
So one of the most important measures that you think you need to take.

43
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,650
Is to encrypt passwords.

44
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:43,450
And the good news is that there are so many functions that provide encryption and they have different

45
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:44,800
levels of security.

46
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,590
But the good news is that there are so many of them.

47
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,660
So you can use one of these functions.

48
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:59,740
And trust me, if you use one of these functions, the the any hacker that steals passwords from your

49
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:07,030
database will not will not will probably not be able to work on kind of on encrypt passwords.

50
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:17,860
The, the algorithms using are used for, uh, for encrypting passwords are so complicated and hackers

51
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:22,000
will not be able to encrypt passwords.

52
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,450
Of course, again, there are different levels of encryption.

53
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,860
Some functions don't don't encrypt passwords

54
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,940
securely, I should say.

55
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:41,860
But there are functions that are so strong and would encrypt your your passwords in a way that hackers

56
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,410
will not be able to do anything with these passwords.

57
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:50,560
And it would be very difficult, even if they try to encrypt these passwords, it would be very difficult

58
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,670
for them to do so.

59
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:58,570
So a great solution when it comes to passwords is to encrypt passwords.

60
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:05,170
This is one of the most important things that many developers, unfortunately, many B2B developers

61
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,420
and many developers in general don't do.

62
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,010
They just store.

63
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,280
They just store password.

64
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:20,160
You're supposed that this is the email field in your database and this is the password field here pass

65
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:21,140
word.

66
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:27,380
They just store the email and password as as they are.

67
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,510
So here at a store, for example, example.

68
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:42,180
At example dot com and they saw the MLB password, for example, the password is one, two, three,

69
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:42,900
four, five.

70
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:46,260
They store them in the past in the database like this.

71
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,600
They saw them in the database like this.

72
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:54,810
And I'm going to be showing you an example of what many developers do and what and how you can encrypt

73
00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:01,950
passwords and secure your passwords so that hackers will not be able to do anything with these passwords.

74
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:06,300
Even if they steal these passwords, they want to be able to encrypt these passwords.

75
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,870
So it's a terrible practice to store passwords as like this, like text like this.

76
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,250
You need to encrypt passwords.

77
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:19,380
And I'm going to be showing you a great example of how you can encrypt passwords.
