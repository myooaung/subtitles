00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:01.500
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.990
Now I'm going to do is that I'm going to check the size of the image or the size of the file that they

3
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.020
that the user is trying to upload.

4
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.110
It's very important to check the size because you wouldn't want users to upload images that have or

5
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:23.640
files that have a very and extraordinarily huge size.

6
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.290
So here this script is going to check file size.

7
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.500
So in order to check the file size, we need to get the file, which is which has the name of picture

8
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.730
here, as you can see picture.

9
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.050
And then we need to get its size and then we need to compare it with a value.

10
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.780
So in, in, in BHP, one megabyte is 1000.

11
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.630
So this is one megabyte.

12
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.460
5000 is five megabytes.

13
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.720
So this is five megabytes.

14
00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:02.100
So if the file if the file is greater than five megabyte, I'm going to say sorry, your file is too

15
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.490
large.

16
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.410
So my, my my limit is five megabytes per file.

17
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:15.510
So you can add this piece of code in order to block users from uploading files that are greater than

18
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.410
five megabytes.

19
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.550
Or you can specify your your the size that you want.

20
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.550
And where the question now is, where should you add this?

21
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.890
Good.

22
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:32.340
Well, you need to copy this code and add it after you have verified the right type of file.

23
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.470
So the type of file goes first.

24
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:43.350
And then if the file if the file is is one of these has one of these extensions, then we can here check

25
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.710
this out.

26
00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.090
So here we can base that good.

27
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:57.870
So if the file has if the file if the file has one of these if the file is greater than five megabytes,

28
00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:04.180
then we need to stop else else we can upload.

29
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.570
So I'm going to copy this piece of code and then I'm going to sit here and I'm going to walk you through

30
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.540
the code one more time because the code is getting complicated.

31
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:20.100
So first, before we do anything, we need to specify the the types and then we need to check whether

32
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.500
the file has one of these extensions.

33
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.710
If the file in our case in this example, it's an image.

34
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.580
It should be an image.

35
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.520
If the file is not an image, then we need to stop.

36
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.400
If the file is in need that image, then we need to check the size of that image.

37
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.890
If the size of that image is too large, in our case here, I'm going to say, let's say one megabyte

38
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.660
or let's say even.

39
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.420
Let me say one megabyte.

40
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.170
Let me see here.

41
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.860
One megabyte.

42
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.930
Because in my my file, I think as do megabytes.

43
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:51.770
I want to check.

44
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.630
I want to test with this.

45
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.580
And if the file is is greater than one megabyte, then we need to say sorry.

46
00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.750
Your files do a lot.

47
00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.570
If the file is smaller than one megabyte, then we can upload that file.

48
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.120
So let me now click on file and Vince Cable.

49
00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.460
Help me head on over to the browser to test.

50
00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.230
Now, let me refresh.

51
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.490
Let me let me select the file one more time.

52
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.590
Remember this file, Minister?

53
00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.900
Look at this file and then I'm going to click on Submit.

54
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.720
And the file has been uploaded successfully because the file I think is smaller than one megabytes.

55
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.810
So let me here reduce the size further.

56
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.730
I'm going to say I'm going to say 1000, which I think one bytes.

57
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.650
Or I think one kilobyte.

58
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.460
I'm not sure.

59
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.530
I think it's one kilobyte.

60
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:41.100
Let me.

61
00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.190
I think it's one kilobyte.

62
00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.740
I'm not sure.

63
00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.020
Let me check one more time here.

64
00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.810
If I if I try to upload the file, as you can see, it says here.

65
00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:56.570
Sorry, your file is too large because here my limit is too small.

66
00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:03.290
But if I increase my limit to one megabyte, it is going to accept that file and the file will be uploaded

67
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:04.280
to file.

68
00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.360
Now will be uploaded.

69
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.710
As you can see, the file will be uploaded here.

70
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.110
It says file uploaded successfully.

71
00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:20.900
So this is a logic that that will first check the file extension and then it is also going to check

72
00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:21.800
the file size.

73
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.840
So these these two things are very, very important.

74
00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.350
Checking the file extension or the file or this type of file is very important.

75
00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.300
You shouldn't allow users to upload any type of file they want.

76
00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:42.740
You should allow users to upload files that are you want them to upload.

77
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.260
For example, if you accept images, then you should allow users users to upload only images.

78
00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.910
If you allow users to upload PDF, then you should allow users to upload media.

79
00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.450
All you need to do is to replace this.

80
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.760
So these extensions with the extensions that you want.

81
00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.470
The second thing that you need to check is the size.

82
00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:02.660
The size is very important.

83
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:10.250
And you always need to to prevent users from uploading files that are too large and too large depends

84
00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.330
upon your application.

85
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:17.360
Some applications might maybe you a project that allows users to upload one gigabyte.

86
00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:24.500
And this case you can say here, 1 million and this is going to accept one.

87
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:34.720
110, I think 1010 million, which is going to accept you allow users to upload one gigabyte.

88
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:41.590
And and it depends again to large depends upon your website your your or your web application.

89
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.160
Same with applications except only small sizes.

90
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.230
Other websites and with applications accept larger sizes.
