00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:01,820
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:06,500
Now, what I'm going to do is that I'm going to create a table for the sake of explanation.

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,940
So I have here this code, this ill code.

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:15,500
I'm going to copy it and then I'm going to paste it in the scale you need to use to select your database.

5
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:21,050
And then you need to click on scale and then you need to paste this code.

6
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:28,100
This code is going to generate a is going to create a database table called users.

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:35,390
And it's this table is going to have a user ID, user name, email and password, and it's going to

8
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:36,470
fail that user.

9
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:43,760
It's going to fill that table with a few users with like I think five users.

10
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,600
And this is the, this is the command.

11
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:54,740
And by the way, you can give that manually using BGP, my admin, but using this method it's going

12
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,550
to be easier.

13
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:00,890
So I'm going to provide this to you so that you can you can create this as well.

14
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:08,900
Or you can pause the video right now and type this command so you can pause the video and start from

15
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,230
here.

16
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:11,570
And then you need to type this.

17
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,340
And then you need to tie this.

18
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,670
And then you need to type this.

19
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,340
And finally, you need to type this.

20
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:27,830
But I'm going to provide this code to you, so don't worry about this.

21
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,950
And then once you are done, click on Go.

22
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,770
And this is going to create a table and insert a few users.

23
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:41,240
And if you click now on the database, if you click on it, you will find that we have a table here

24
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,860
called users and it has these users one, two, three, four, five.

25
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:52,040
And each user has ID, user, name, email and password.

26
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:54,320
And again, you can keep it.

27
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,470
If you don't want to create the table using a scale, you can create a table by clicking on the database.

28
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:09,650
And here just click on Adjust Your Type, the name of the table and specify the number of columns and

29
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,340
then click on Go.

30
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,860
But this is going to take a little bit more time because you need to do everything manually.

31
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,600
You need to type the name of the database.

32
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,760
You need to specify the columns.

33
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,310
And I recommend using a serial.
