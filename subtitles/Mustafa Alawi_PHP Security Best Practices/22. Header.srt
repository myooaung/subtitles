Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:09,510
One of the best ways to protect your pages against excesses attacks is to use the header and specifying

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,010
the x axis as protection to one and then want a block.

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:24,060
So what this does is that this good is going to try to find if there is a cross site attack against

5
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,930
your against that specific page, and it's going to block that if it happens.

6
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:34,860
So it's a good practice to add this line of code at the top of a page where where it's where you think

7
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,560
it's vulnerable to these types of attacks.

8
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,740
However, it's not going to happen.

9
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,150
It's going to it's not going to block every excess attack.

10
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:50,940
So if this can be used just in combination with other methods that I have shown you.

11
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,750
So you shouldn't rely on only one method.

12
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:00,080
So you cannot just rely on one method and and ignore other methods.

13
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:07,110
You need to take every single method as a and use it in combination with other methods.

14
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,450
You shouldn't rely on one method.

15
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,400
And unfortunately, many developers rely on one method and ignore other methods.

16
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,510
And this is not correct.

17
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:24,930
You should always use all available methods that you have in order to block any kind of attack you have.

18
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:32,940
And this method is a good method that you can add again, you can add to your security tools, so to

19
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,360
speak.
