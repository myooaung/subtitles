1
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:02,350
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,670
Now it's time to work on connecting with the database.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:13,270
So in order to connect to the database, you need to edit over to localhost for a dashboard and make

4
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:17,390
sure that you are about your web server as well as your database are up and running.

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:23,110
You need to make sure that your app is is up and running your skill as well as an Apache web server.

6
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,710
And then you need to click on BHP, my admin.

7
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:33,470
And then you need to click on user accounts and you will find so many here accounts.

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:42,710
So the one that I'm going to be using is the root, root one 1 to 7 .0.0.1 or the root localhost.

9
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,630
You can use either of them.

10
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,960
So let's use this, for example, root localhost.

11
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,220
So the user name is root, the hostname is localhost.

12
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,520
The password is no, there is no password and the global privileges is all privileges.

13
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,400
So I will be able to use it on the database.

14
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,580
So let's now use these credentials.

15
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,010
So I'm going to hand it over to the project.

16
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:11,930
And in the project I'm going to create a new file called Called Your.

17
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,100
Called Lamy.

18
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:16,160
Keith, and you will file.

19
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:19,640
Gone.

20
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:24,070
Nation that.

21
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:28,820
BHP or config, you can name it even config that BHP.

22
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,770
You can name it connection or config can name it this or this.

23
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:34,910
There is no problem.

24
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:39,540
And then name here say BHP.

25
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,850
I'm going to say BHP, then I'm going to close the beach.

26
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:54,020
B And then what we need to do is that we need to say my ask you l I underscore, connect, underscore,

27
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:54,860
connect.

28
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,140
And then we need to pass four parameters.

29
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:04,830
So the first parameter is the first parameter is going to be the host name.

30
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,380
So the host name is localhost.

31
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:11,130
So I'm going to say your local host.

32
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,450
The second parameter is going to be the.

33
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,600
The second parameter is going to be the username.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,500
So I'm going to say here comma and then root because the username.

35
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:30,170
The username is this username that I chose to use and then the password.

36
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,560
The third parameter is the password and the password is nothing.

37
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:40,370
So I'm going to say comma and then empty court sequence where with nothing I'm not going to type anything

38
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:40,770
inside it.

39
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,550
The last parameter is the name of the database.

40
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,530
So what is the name of the database?

41
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:46,130
Remember?

42
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,840
If you go back, you'll find that I have named my database P2P underscore project.

43
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:56,030
So I'm going to say here comma and then BHP underscore project.

44
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:06,690
And then I'm going to say a year or die and then I'm going to type an error message.

45
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,750
And then I'm going to say problem?

46
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:20,450
Connecting to details and then semicolon.

47
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,650
So let me explain what this is going to do.

48
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,310
I'm going to store this in a variable.

49
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:32,430
I'm going to say you're going to store this in a variable called con.

50
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,830
Double in is going to be equal to this.

51
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,020
So let me explain what this is going to do.

52
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:42,640
So what this is going to do is that this is going to attempt to connect to the database.

53
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:48,380
So here, Michael, I underscore connect is going to try to connect to the database using these credentials.

54
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:56,070
It's going to try to connect to the b b underscore project database using the localhost and root this

55
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,650
password, which is nothing to the database, to this database.

56
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:04,930
And if the connection is successful, then this is going to return success and everything is going to

57
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:05,770
be fine.

58
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,630
Else or die.

59
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:13,980
If we for some reason, if we couldn't connect to the database, then this is going to return from linking.

60
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,780
Connecting to the to the database.

61
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,610
So this is what

62
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,210
what this is going to do.

63
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:30,520
This is going to either connect or fail to connect to the database.

64
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,890
And if it fails, it's going to a problem connecting connecting to a database.

65
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,490
Otherwise, it's going to tell us that connection was successful.

66
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,610
Finally, you need to click on file and then save all.
