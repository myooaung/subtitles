1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,630
So in order to add but B2B to your environment variable, first of all, let's check if B2B exists or

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:06,930
not.

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:12,510
I'm going to open this e-mail and then I'm going to type B minus B and as you can see, it says here,

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,010
B2B is not recognized.

5
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:18,540
So let's first of all get the path of B2B.

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:23,850
And in order to get the path of B2B, I'm going to open my local desk.

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:29,250
And then in the local desk we have jump up and jump and then up in B2B.

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,790
And as you can see, this is the location of B2B.

9
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,050
I'm going to get that location.

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,760
I'm going to copy that location.

11
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:36,630
Copy it.

12
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,700
And then I'm going to open the I'm going to open the properties of the computer and then I'm going to

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,060
open the environment variables from the advanced settings.

14
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:49,430
And then I'm going to add, I'm going to scroll and then I'm going to add B2B to the path.

15
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:57,990
I'm going to click the path and then click edit and then just add here, just add semicolon and then

16
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:04,380
paste paste record that you got, which is C and then and then B2B, I think like, okay.

17
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,100
And then okay.

18
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,630
And this is going to add B2B to your environment variable or path.

19
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:16,500
Now let me open up this in the one more time and then in this end I'm going to type beach B minus B,

20
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:23,250
now beach B exists as you can see here, it's displaying the beach B version.

21
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,260
So A beach B now exists.

22
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,070
So this is how you can add B2B to your path.

23
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:33,450
And it's very important to add to added to your path in order to be able to work with it.
