00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:01,560
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:09,180
Now I'm going to talk about the most common type of attack that could hurt your application.

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:16,860
And and we need to protect our applications against that attack, which is a skill injection.

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:26,340
This type of injection or attack is super harmful to your application, and it could destroy your application

5
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:34,440
completely if you don't protect your application against it, because it's probably the easiest way

6
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:40,500
to hurt somebody or a developer's application because it's popular.

7
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,390
It's easy to use for hackers.

8
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,030
It's easy to to to do it.

9
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:54,300
Hackers can come up with some clever ways to attack your your your database and destroy your database

10
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,070
or cause any kind of harm to your database.

11
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,740
First, we need to know what is Google injection?

12
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:10,920
So is IL injection is a way of injecting bad commands into your application that goes to your database

13
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:19,860
and could either delete or get data or do some kind of party to your database.

14
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:28,140
And hackers could in inject a commands that could delete things, important things from your database

15
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:34,590
or could delete your database completely so you will lose everything you've got you have in your database.

16
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:43,290
Or they could get important data from your database and use it against you to harm you.

17
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:52,920
So there are also other ways to do harm developers do harm applications and cause detrimental effects

18
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,140
on your database.

19
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:57,960
But these are the most common ones.

20
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:03,150
So let me explain what good hackers do to your database.

21
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,100
First, imagine that you have a database.

22
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,650
Usually databases look like this like a.

23
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,760
Cylinder like this.

24
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,800
So imagine that this is your database.

25
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:26,910
So this is your maybe here type data based here data base.

26
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,320
So this is your database.

27
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:34,180
Imagine that this is your database and.

28
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,550
Lamy removed this.

29
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,490
And imagine that there is a hacker here.

30
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,850
This is a hacker.

31
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,750
So a hacker is over there.

32
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:57,600
So the hacker, what a hacker could do to harm your application is that they could inject bad ill commands

33
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,320
to your database.

34
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,780
But how could they do this?

35
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,680
They could do this by using your own application.

36
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,720
So you might have a website.

37
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,850
So suppose that you have a website here.

38
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,140
I'm going to here draw a website.

39
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,810
Suppose that this is your website.

40
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,780
So this is your website.

41
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:27,500
Web site or Web application or whatever kind of application you have that has connection to the database.

42
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,660
So your application has connection to the database.

43
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:37,880
And the only way for hackers to get to your database is the easiest way is to use your website because

44
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,760
your website obviously has connection to a database.

45
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,700
So they use your application as a normal user.

46
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:51,500
And then instead of using your application or website, ethically, they inject a skew ill commands.

47
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,180
So they inject.

48
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,460
Askew ill comments so we know that commands

49
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:03,530
the major four commands are select.

50
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,330
Select Insert.

51
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,240
And update and delete that.

52
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:13,950
So these.

53
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:18,470
These are the most important for coal mines.

54
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:26,390
And also there are drop for tables and there are also other commands, but these are the most common

55
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:26,810
commands.

56
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:32,750
So they they could use select to select data selected.

57
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:39,020
They could get important information from a specific table or from from the complete database.

58
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:49,400
They could insert a piece of code that could hurt your database when you when when you get the data

59
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,880
from from the database to your website, they could answer something.

60
00:04:53,300 --> 00:05:00,590
When you when somebody uses your application, they will get that bad code so they could harm other

61
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:01,010
users.

62
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:10,340
The, the, the, their, their intention might not just to harm you, but steal other people's credentials

63
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,420
and passwords.

64
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:17,000
They could also alter your your database fields by using the update.

65
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:23,570
They could delete data as they told you, and they could drop tables so they could delete a complete

66
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,250
table from your from your database.

67
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,070
So this what a hacker could do.

68
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:31,130
And there are also other so many other things that they could do.

69
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:37,670
But these are the most common harms that they could do to your your database.

70
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:44,990
And I'm going to be showing you examples of how they they could do this and how which is important to

71
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:50,750
us as developers, is how to protect your application against these attacks.

72
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:55,730
And then I'm going to give you practical solutions to these attacks.
