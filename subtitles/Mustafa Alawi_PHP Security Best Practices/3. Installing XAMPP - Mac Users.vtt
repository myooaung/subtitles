Archie friends that you will be able to install.

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:12.060
Example where you can install BHP and the Apache server and also my own database and you can download

3
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.900
the application depending upon your operating system.

4
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:22.080
So I'm going to click here on a click here for other versions and choose your.

5
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.270
Operating system.

6
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.460
And I'm going to choose them for Mac.

7
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.890
And the vision is going to be 7.2.

8
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.200
So this one, I'm going to download this one.

9
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.640
Click on Download.

10
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.850
And once it's finished, you can now open the installer.

11
00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.660
And the process is very, very simple and straightforward.

12
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.590
For all operating systems.

13
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.780
You can just click on a few next's and it will install them for you.

14
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.260
So if you are using Mac, then you can follow along.

15
00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.310
If you are using another operating system, then the process is very, very similar and self-explanatory

16
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.810
and it might ask you for your PC or Mac password.

17
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:14.550
So you need to type it and it will open a wizard where you can just click on a few next and it will

18
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:15.570
install them for you.

19
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.810
So here, once here it opens this wizard.

20
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:26.400
Click on next and then make sure you check these two and click on next.

21
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.150
And then here it says that it will be installed them will be installed inside applications exam folder.

22
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:39.450
Click on next and you can check or uncheck this if you wish to learn more about the.

23
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.480
And then finally just click on next and it will start downloading.

24
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.170
Finally, once it's finished, you will find that ZAP has been installed in your applications.

25
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.940
So as you can see here, I have some and these are all of the files.

26
00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.830
In order to use PHP Version seven, you need to head on over to your terminal and make sure that you

27
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.850
are using BHP version seven.

28
00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:18.940
So here I'm going to type.

29
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.970
BHP.

30
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.500
And then version, hyphen, version or V.

31
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.660
And here it says 7.2.

32
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:36.240
And if it doesn't say here BHP 7.2, then you need to make sure that you add the do add them to your

33
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.430
path and in order to do so, adjust up in your bash profile.

34
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.020
And Inside Bash profile.

35
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.860
Make sure to add these two lines at the end of the file.

36
00:02:52.310 --> 00:03:03.290
Path equals do slash applications, slash exam all capital letters and then slash zoom files, slash

37
00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:10.010
mean and then colon and then dollar sign path and then export that path.

38
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:20.030
So these two lines are very important in case your Mac is using the free version other than 7.2.

39
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:26.030
So make sure you add these two lines in your got bash profile and then save.

40
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.230
Make sure that you save.

41
00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.930
After that, click on Save.

42
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.890
And of course, you need to close the terminal and open a new terminal.

43
00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.980
And make sure that you are now using BHP version.

44
00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.940
Save it.
