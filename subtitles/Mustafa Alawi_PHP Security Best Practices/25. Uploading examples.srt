00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:01,710
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:09,750
So now let's test this flooding feature and let me show you what's going to happen when I try to upload

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:10,260
a file.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:18,450
That's not an image, because as we have shown you here, the script, I have made this script to allow

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:23,640
only images, files that don't have these extensions.

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,390
And these are the four most common extensions for images.

7
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:28,680
Yes.

8
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,150
Being G, G, big and JPEG.

9
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,550
So let me now test this.

10
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:42,570
So I'm going to click on Choose File and this can see I have here two files.

11
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,140
The first file is obviously an image because here, as you can see, the extension is big.

12
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,820
The second file is female.

13
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,550
So let's try to upload the female file.

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,150
I'm going to click on the female file and see what's going to happen.

15
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,440
So I'm going to select the female file and then I'm going to click on Submit.

16
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,410
So if I click on segment, guess what?

17
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,540
I'm going to get this message here.

18
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,920
It says, This is not an image, this is not an image.

19
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:15,060
So the execution of uploading this image has been stopped.

20
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,030
It has been blocked by my script.

21
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,970
So here, as you can see, this code has been executed.

22
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,380
This is not an image and nothing else will be done after this.

23
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,600
This is going to stop uploading the file because this is not an image.

24
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,730
Let's now try to upload an image.

25
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,090
So here, let me click on to this file one more time.

26
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,790
And now let me select the image.

27
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,300
I'm going to select the image and then I'm going to click on Submit.

28
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,250
And as you can see here immediately, here is this file, upload it successfully.

29
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:52,020
So let's verify whether the file has been uploaded or not.

30
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:59,820
So in my in my directory here in my folder uploads, as you can see, this is the image and if I open

31
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,800
it, this is the image that I uploaded.

32
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,680
So it has been uploaded successfully and it means that the script is working and the script is going

33
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,870
to allow only these extensions.

34
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:15,450
And you can, by the way, you can remove maybe you want to upload, maybe you want to allow users to

35
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:23,700
upload images, but you accept only being in this case, you can remove the VEGF, you can also remove

36
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,000
the JPG and you can also remove the jpg.

37
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:36,240
So here this array is going to allow users to upload only being you and you can use this script for

38
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:36,690
your.

39
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:48,120
Uh, for your project or in any of your projects to do to allow users to upload a specific type of file.

40
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,280
It could be an image, it could be an email file, it could be a PDF.

41
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,220
It doesn't matter.

42
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,930
You have control over what type of file that the user can upload.

43
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,380
And this is very, very important when it comes to security.
