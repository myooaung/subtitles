00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.350
So now what we what we need to do is that we need to keep the project folder.

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:12.210
So on the desktop, I have created a year a folder called B2B Project and now I'm going to open it in

3
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.270
visual record here, just drag and drop it.

4
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.630
And now it's opened in Visual Studio code.

5
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.310
And then what I'm going to do is that I'm going to create the first file I'm going to click on here,

6
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.220
this this icon, and then I'm going to name the first file index that BHP.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.800
So this is the first file and this is the BHP first file.

8
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.450
Let me here add some good to it.

9
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.690
So I'm going to add here some good to it.

10
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.850
And here, this is the first file.

11
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.350
And here goes our codes.
