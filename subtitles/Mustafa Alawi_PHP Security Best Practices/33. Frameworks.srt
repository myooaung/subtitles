00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:01,280
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:08,000
So what are the other measures that you should take in order to protect your application and websites

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:12,080
against any potential attack?

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,590
Well, one of the best ways is to use B2B frameworks.

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,710
And why would they recommend using frameworks?

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,960
Well, there are many reasons for this.

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,080
And I by the way, I wouldn't recommend using all frameworks.

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,370
I'm going to be showing you examples of great frameworks.

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:35,180
But first, let me explain why you should be using B2B frameworks and when to use frameworks.

10
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:40,640
The reason why I recommend some frameworks is because the code has already been created.

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,880
First, could the project the mean it mean code.

12
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:52,340
Let's say you got the main code and the essential code is already created.

13
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:53,960
Is there?

14
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,130
It's there.

15
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,450
You don't have to recreate the code.

16
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:04,040
Second, many frameworks take security into account.

17
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,660
Security.

18
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:07,970
Is.

19
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,160
They can.

20
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:13,460
Gear up.

21
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:21,170
And of course, with many with different, it depends upon the framework and the security measures that

22
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:21,950
they have taken.

23
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:32,310
So basic security measures have been taken care of by so many frameworks such as SQL injection access,

24
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,160
S attacks, excision, hijacking.

25
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:42,920
So many things are taken care of by many framework, by many PDB frameworks.

26
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:52,670
The third reason why I recommend using frameworks is because it would it would allow you to follow.

27
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,850
Follow specific.

28
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,670
Specific.

29
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:13,320
Procedure or procedures when it comes to developing so you don't have to your team, if you are working

30
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:20,940
with a team, don't have to work or create a code that is different from one another.

31
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:30,690
They will be forced to follow a specific techniques and a specific a specific pattern usually.

32
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:38,220
In many B2B frameworks, the M, the C, the MVC design architecture.

33
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:47,400
MVC is used and the MVC is going to make your code very organized and easy to debug whenever you have

34
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,180
bugs and whenever you want to add an extra layer of security.

35
00:02:51,630 --> 00:03:00,420
MVC, which is which stands for Model View Controller, is going to take care of this because you will

36
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,840
be forced to follow a specific design pattern.

37
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:16,630
Also by using frameworks the logic system usually many frameworks provide a pre created a pre developed

38
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,440
logging system.

39
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:24,910
So the logging system has already been created and it's very, very secure in many frameworks.

40
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,090
So you don't have to create a logging system from scratch.

41
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:37,360
The logging system in many B2B frameworks is mainly from what many frameworks provide their logging

42
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:47,110
system, and usually the logging system is very secure and it will hash passwords properly without without

43
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:50,530
the need to hash passwords and encrypt passwords.

44
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:57,870
So this is one of the reasons why I recommend using frameworks, but what are framework works that I

45
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:58,480
recommend?

46
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,930
The first framework that I recommend is Laravel.

47
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,840
Why would they recommend using a Laravel?

48
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:16,840
Lara Lavell Lavell is a great framework and it takes care of security, and security is probably number

49
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,100
one priority and security is their priority.

50
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:25,120
Whenever you are trying to create a forum, they will force you to use.

51
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:33,280
The CSR is going to protect against excesses and also they have a great logging system.

52
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:42,280
The, the, the design act architecture that is used to develop Laravel is the MVC.

53
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,790
So this is why I recommend using Laravel and you don't have to reinvent the wheel.

54
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:54,220
And by the way, if you are passionate about developer and want to learn Laravel I have created so many

55
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:59,230
courses about Laravel and how to create so many different applications using Laravel, how to create

56
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:03,910
e-commerce website after a car dealership website.

57
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:07,720
How to create a chatroom using Laravel.

58
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:13,390
So many applications I have created courses around where you can take.

59
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,570
So this is the first framework that they do come in.

60
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,600
Another framework that I recommend is symphony.

61
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,250
Symphony.

62
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:29,840
Symphony is another agreed framework that I recommend using.

63
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:40,580
It also has so many amazing features that you can use and and you will not be you will not you will

64
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:44,590
not need to reinvent the wheel because many things are taken care of.

65
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,100
And also security is is a priority in a symphony framework.

66
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,310
So a symphony is also a great framework that you can use.

67
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:58,330
There are also other frameworks such as cake, BHP cake.

68
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:05,410
BHP is also a good framework that I'd recommend if you don't want to use Laravel or Symphony, but in

69
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:09,400
in some cases you might want to use your own BHP code.

70
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,540
In this case I wouldn't say you should use a framework.

71
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:20,350
In this case I would say you just use your code, but you need to follow the techniques that they have

72
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:25,510
taught you in this course and you need to always be up to date when it comes to security and you need

73
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:33,160
to take security seriously because if you are creating your own code, you are the you are responsible

74
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,800
for everything.

75
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:34,750
If you.

76
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,600
Again, if you create.

77
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,480
You were on guard then.

78
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,050
Take.

79
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,160
Please take.

80
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,130
Security seriously.

81
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:58,100
Because you are responsible for your good and you should take security seriously and avoid these in

82
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,210
order to avoid these attacks.

83
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,630
So again, if you want to use your own card, that's fine.

84
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,650
There is no problem with this.

85
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:11,810
In fact, some of my projects, some of my beach projects, I didn't I did not use any of the frameworks.

86
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:19,100
I created the codes from scratch because because they wanted to create my own code for for for many,

87
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:19,880
many reasons.

88
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:27,890
However, in some projects I use Laravel a lot because it it takes care of many things and I don't have

89
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:28,880
to reinvent the wheel.

90
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:33,590
But some customers still want to create their own B2B code.

91
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:40,040
And you as a developer, you might want to create a script, a B2B script or a B2B project from scratch

92
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,590
because of many, many reasons.

93
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:47,000
There are many reasons why you would want to create your own B2B good.

94
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:51,470
But either way, you should take security seriously.

95
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:58,550
Even even if you are using a framework such as Laravel, you need to double check security and you need

96
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:03,350
to follow best practices in order to avoid any attacks.
