00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.650
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:07.500
So I have created a very simple form that accepts uploading files.

3
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.780
Allow me show you the code that I created.

4
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.010
So this form has only one input or actually two inputs.

5
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.410
The first input is a file that accepts and that accepts files.

6
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:27.360
The second input is a button that allows users to click on the button to submit or upload actually that

7
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:27.810
file.

8
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.920
And here, here the method is passed.

9
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.930
And here I also have the ink type multipart form data.

10
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:37.930
This is very important.

11
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:45.760
Whenever you have a an input that allows users to to upload a file, you need to have this attribute

12
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.380
set, which is the ink type.

13
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.600
Finally, the action in the action is the file that's going to handle uploading the image, which is

14
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.560
the same file.

15
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.210
So if it's the same, finally, just need to pass here for a slash.

16
00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:04.270
The second thing that I created is that I created here a folder called uploads and this uploads folder

17
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:09.580
is going to store any file we allow users to upload.

18
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.570
And I gather this to explain and show you how the process works.

19
00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.840
Now let's get to the most important part.

20
00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.270
So the most important part here is this good?

21
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:26.230
This code is very important because this code is going to handle uploading the image or files here.

22
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.060
First we have the target directory.

23
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.610
So the target there actually is uploads for us.

24
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:31.810
What does this mean?

25
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:40.900
This means that this directory is going to store whatever file user is uploading.

26
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.300
So whenever a user uploads a file, I'm going to store it in a folder called uploads, which is here.

27
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.110
It must be here.

28
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.970
If you see your uploads, it must be here and you need to here to say uploads for a.

29
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:53.440
Second.

30
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.110
I have a boolean variable called upload.

31
00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.460
Okay.

32
00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.470
Which is going to be one or zero one.

33
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.250
It means that the file has been uploaded successfully.

34
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.850
Zero.

35
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.380
It means that it hasn't met.

36
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.770
Upload it.

37
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.710
So initially it's going to be zero and then I'm going to change this to one after the file has been

38
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.610
uploaded.

39
00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.410
Now we need to work on the logic, which is very important.

40
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.650
First, we need to check whether the post is by submit is a set or not.

41
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.280
The Post submit is basically this input, which is the button.

42
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:34.570
If the button has been clicked, then we can move on and upload the image next after the user clicks

43
00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.480
on this submit button.

44
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.360
What we want to do is, is that we need to get this get the name of the image.

45
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.250
So in order to give the name of the image, we need to use the base name function and then we need to

46
00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.060
pass files.

47
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:59.500
Picture picture refers to this name to the, to the, to the name of the impact that uploads the image,

48
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.760
the file.

49
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.860
In our case, it's going to be an image.

50
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:10.150
And then the second, the second problem, the second parameter here is name because they want to give

51
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.750
the name and then I'm appending that to the directory.

52
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.670
So it's going to be this is going to be the directory was upload.

53
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:27.520
Remember it actually was upload and then slash and then the file name and then the the extension.

54
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.540
So the extension in our case, it's going to be an image.

55
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:36.700
It could be a pig, for example, or PNG, an image extension.

56
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.060
Next, we want to hear we want to check the file extension.

57
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.920
This is very, very important.

58
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.490
This is a way to check the the file extension.

59
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:56.680
But but I'm going to be using this this function instead of this linear remove this for now.

60
00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.010
I don't need actually, I don't need this.

61
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.780
Let me call this out.

62
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.940
I'm going to call me this out.

63
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.670
And then when I explain how to get the extension here so here in order to get the extension, this is

64
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:10.180
going to get.

65
00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.940
File extension.

66
00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.250
So in order to get the file extension, you need to use a function called path info.

67
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.800
And then the first the first parameter is the file name.

68
00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:24.950
So what is the file name?

69
00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:32.390
Remember, the file name is can be can be fetched from the files picture.

70
00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:33.920
This is going to return the file name.

71
00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:41.990
And then the second parameter is a a constant called path input underscore extension.

72
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:49.820
And then I'm going to store it in the variable and then we can check whether this extension exists or

73
00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:50.060
not.

74
00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.720
So I have created here an array that has these extensions.

75
00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:02.840
This array has four extensions, VEGF or give me a P in G GAAP and GAAP.

76
00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.030
So these are the only files that the user will allow will be allowed to upload.

77
00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:14.120
So if user let me out of here a comment if user plots.

78
00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:23.010
File that has an ex tension.

79
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.820
Other than these.

80
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:35.400
Other than these, then we will not.

81
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.010
Allow it.

82
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:44.400
So these are the only extensions that we are going to allow.

83
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:50.940
And here I have here a simple statement that checks whether the extension exists in this array or not.

84
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:57.000
If it exists, then I'm going to say here, if it doesn't exist, I'm going to say here, not an image.

85
00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:58.230
I'm going to say here.

86
00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.140
This is not an image.

87
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.960
And you should here say applied.

88
00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:14.790
Remember the of what okay is zero because here we will not apply the the image or the file else if the

89
00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.060
if if the extension exists, it means that this is an image.

90
00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.930
And here we can move that image to the.

91
00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.120
We can move the.

92
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:31.710
We can move the image to the target file, which is this which is the target directory and the file

93
00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.390
name attached to it.

94
00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.730
And finally, we can here display a success message file uploaded successfully.

95
00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:49.830
And we also need here we also need to use a we need to change the upload key valuable to one because

96
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.920
at this point the file has been uploaded successfully.

97
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.090
So this is a great script that's going to check the type of the file.

98
00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.050
This is very important.

99
00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:05.520
Whenever you are up, whenever you are developing, developing and uploading the feature in your website

100
00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:11.010
or web application, you need to check the file extension before accepting that file.
