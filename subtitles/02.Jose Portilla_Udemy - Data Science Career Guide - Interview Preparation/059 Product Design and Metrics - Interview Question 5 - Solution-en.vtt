00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.210

Welcome everyone see the solutions for interview questions 5 and the product design and metrics category.



2

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.670

So this is actually a real question being asked at Facebook to test your business sense and this were



3

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.140

a car company produces all the cars for a country.



4

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.600

We have two different types of cars X and Y.



5

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.270

And what's important to note here is that half the population drives corrects and the other half drives



6

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:26.920

car Y.



7

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.800

So that's an important note to take is that they're basically perfectly split.



8

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:37.920

Do we have these two potential technologies and one of them increases 50 mpg to 75 mpg for Car X.



9

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.820

The other one increases car Y from 10 mpg to 11 miles per gallon.



10

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.250

And we're being asked which technology should be implemented to save the most gasoline for the country.



11

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.550

So this is actually a really interesting problem because unlike most the other general product analysis



12

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.930

questions we just discussed this one actually has a correct answer.



13

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.390

So let's go ahead and work through it mathematically.



14

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.840

So first off let's go ahead and assume that the average commute distance for a car is the.



15

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.470

So no matter what type of car you're driving.



16

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.590

On average the average person is driving the number of miles.



17

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:20.250

So then if we wanted to find the total amount of gasoline used what we could do is say the total amount



18

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.160

of gas used is equal to the average distance divided by miles per gallon.



19

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.730

So if you divide those units out you end up getting total gas used.



20

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.730

So now that we have this fraction metric for total gas use Let's go ahead and compare what each policy



21

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:41.460

would do for the total amount of gas used and we'll try to find this in terms of the change in the amount



22

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.360

of gas used.



23

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.270

So here we have both policies A and B.



24

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.930

And we're going to calculate the total gas used change.



25

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.860

So we're going to take the original total gas used and then subtract the new gas used.



26

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.510

So we have the Divide by 50.



27

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.300

That's the original miles per gallon for that first car.



28

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.620

Subtract the new policy change of the over seventy five.



29

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.310

And that means the total gas used change is going to be over 150.



30

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.400

If we implement policy be the total gas change there is going to be the divided by 110.



31

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.860

So again we're just calculating the total gas used and the change in it for each policy.



32

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.750

And that is what happens here we have done over 150 for Policy A which is going to be always a smaller



33

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.020

number than over 110 because the denominator is larger.



34

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.610

And we know these here are equal to each other because we define that as being the average commute distance



35

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:34.330

for a car.



36

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.270

So since we know that for any average commute distance d over 150 will always be smaller than D over



37

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.160

110.



38

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:48.490

Then we know that policy be d over 110 is going to result in the biggest gas change or savings.



39

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.770

So that actually means Policy B is the correct choice.



40

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:58.670

Again more to test your mathematical sense in business and metrics because it's very easy to intuitively



41

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.010

think oh well 50 to 75 that's a larger jump.



42

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.950

So that will be actually be better.



43

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.840

But if you calculate this out mathematically and you can even plug in some numbers here for average



44

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.390

commute distance of the and you also see the results numerically in that fashion.



45

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:19.280

But on any case regardless of how much the commute distances the over 150 is always going to be a smaller



46

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.510

number than the over 110.



47

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.360

So policy results in the biggest gas change or savings.



48

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.940

OK thanks everyone.



49

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.890

I'll see you at the next lecture.
