00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:09,700
Want the machine learning interview question number seven.

2
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:15,260
So for this question just describe how the support vector machine or SVM algorithm works in a general

3
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:20,450
sense and hopefully you're able to draw some sort of diagram to help explain the concept of support

4
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:21,940
vector machines.

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,090
We'll see you at the solutions.
