Welcome to interview a question of her for her work and if they do a rescue I'll So that's going to



2

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.720

be a little different than the previous questions.



3

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.310

Now we're actually going to consider tables and we're going to want you to write a query.



4

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:21.580

So consider the two tables below we have a table called employees and a table called managers.



5

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.420

Let's first look at the Employees table.



6

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.560

We have three columns.



7

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.420

The first is an ID column just the numeric ID.



8

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.630

The second one is the name column both first and last name are there and then we have a managed by column



9

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.600

and we can see here that the managed by column has an ID number that's reflected to the primary key



10

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.450

of the manager's ID column.



11

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:47.330

So basically what that means is if you're an employee such as Mark Smith and you're managed by number



12

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:54.550

one then you can use the manager's table to realize that number one you're being managed by Zach Allen.



13

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:01.330

Hopefully that makes sense as far as how that foreign key managed by its link to the primary ID of managers.



14

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.010

So you can basically connect the employees to their managers.



15

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.890

And the question Is writes a query that retrieves all employees that are managed by Sandy.



16

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.650

Kim All right.



17

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.280

Best of luck and I will see you at the next lecture when we go over the solution.
