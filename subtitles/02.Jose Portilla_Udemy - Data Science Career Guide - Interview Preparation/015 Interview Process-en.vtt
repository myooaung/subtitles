00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.690

Welcome back everyone to this lecture on the interview process.



2

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:15.350

Let's go through what you can expect during the interview process sometimes known as the interview pipeline.



3

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.510

Keep in mind many companies will have their own unique approach to interviewing candidates for a science



4

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.700

position and they may differ from this generalization.



5

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.360

The generalization going to present here is more leaning towards tech companies in the Bay Area and



6

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.080

California or tech companies in larger cities such as Seattle Portland OR New York City.



7

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.960

But in general when you're applying for a scientist position you can expect something to go a little



8

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:39.750

bit like this.



9

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.440

But again many companies will have their own unique approach.



10

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.150

OK so what is the actual process look like will go in described as a brief overview and will dive into



11

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.170

each of these for little more detail.



12

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.020

So the first thought starts of some sort of connection that is you get your resume to the company then



13

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.090

it goes through a recruiter screening.



14

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.500

So not only do they screen your resume but eventually you're going to get contacted by a recruiter and



15

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.110

they will screen you for the position.



16

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.640

Then it goes to a technical screening so someone a little more technical background is going to screen



17

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.670

you to check if you are a good candidate or not.



18

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.910

Then it goes to a take home task.



19

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.690

This is not always a step but it often is for tech companies in the data science field.



20

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.020

And then it moves on to an onsite interview.



21

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.380

OK.



22

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.150

Each of these individual steps has multiple parts sources cost them in just a little more detail.



23

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.090

We'll start off with the connection.



24

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.640

So this occurs sometime after you apply.



25

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.370

And basically it's getting your resume in front of someone so that they decide hey I'm going to reach



26

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.360

out to this person and contact them.



27

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:47.630

So we discuss the actual application process in more detail later on in the landing interviews lecture.



28

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.140

But we're going to assume as far as this press concern you were somehow able to connect to the company



29

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.090

maybe through your network maybe you just open up their job Web site and sent in your resume that way.



30

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.980

So once you have the connection and the internal recruiter decides hey I'm going to reach out to this



31

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.680

person that you have the recruiters screening the recruiter screening is typically a phone call or it's



32

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.460

also sometimes a web video call something like Google hangout or Skype.



33

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.510

And what the recruiter is going to do is they're going to start off usually giving you details about



34

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.110

the company and the position.



35

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.970

And keep in mind this is just as much for them as it is for you.



36

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.080

So here you can decide whether or not the actual position is a good fit for you.



37

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.940

Oftentimes the actual position of what the recruiter knows is going to be a little different than what



38

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.310

was actually posted on the job postings is a really good time for you to ask questions and get familiar



39

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.030

in the side.



40

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.110

Hayes is actually a position I would want to fill.



41

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.370

Once you learn about the company and the position and the recruiter gives you kind of the screening.



42

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.670

They're also going to ask you questions about your experience check if you're a good culture fit for



43

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:49.780

the company.



44

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.170

Typically it's almost always non-technical.



45

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.070

It's just to decide is this person going to be a good fit based off their experience.



46

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.630

And are they a good culture fit after you've gone through the recruiter screening.



47

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.960

Often what is next is a technical screening and the technical screening is going to be often a phone



48

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.180

call or a web video call of a more technical member of the team who you may be working with in the future



49

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.070

if you actually accept the position or even maybe your possible future manager although it's usually



50

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.530

just someone technical at the same level of the position and they're going to be asking technical questions



51

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.600

on a wide variety of topics.



52

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.010

Often there is like probability questions and there are statistics questions coding questions.



53

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.050

It often depends on what the actual position that you are applying to described.



54

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.280

And it also gives you a chance to find out a little bit more about the technical aspects of the job.



55

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.770

So if you do get a chance to have a phone call or a web video conference call with someone after the



56

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.810

technical screening they'll usually open up the floor to any questions you may have about the position



57

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.030

and what the technical aspects of it are.



58

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.230

You should note however more and more often this is actually becoming an automated process.



59

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:04.060

So the technical screening if the recruiter says you're OK they will send you a link to a technical



60

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.000

screening hosted on some sort of web site and you'll answer the questions given some sort of time limit



61

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.260

so maybe you'll have like five questions in 30 minutes they have to do.



62

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.870

And this whole process may actually be automated instead of you conversing with someone so keep that



63

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:24.820

in mind some companies do do this through some sort of automated fashion after that often there's also



64

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.150

a take home task.



65

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.480

Now not every company is going to have this that and sometimes they kind of combine this step with the



66

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.190

technical screenings instead of you having technical screening where you talk to someone the technical



67

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.890

screening will be the take home task itself.



68

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:44.650

So you're often given a data set that you need to either do some sort of freeform analysis so they give



69

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.070

you a data set and they ask you Well what would you do this data.



70

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.700

What kind of insights can you give us.



71

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.410

Or they ask you to actually create a model that solves a particular task so maybe they give you a bunch



72

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:59.370

of sales data and they ask you to forecast sales into the future 2 quarters or something of that nature.



73

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.440

Again it really depends on the company here.



74

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:07.300

But take home tasks are in data scientist positions a lot more common than other software engineering



75

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.870

roles.



76

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.800

So let's say you passed a recruiters screening you pass the technical screening you did the take home



77

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:14.400

test.



78

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.050

Then it comes time for an onsite interview.



79

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.010

And this is actually the most intensive part of the process.



80

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.540

And the one that even though you've exhausted a ton of energy by this point you still got to bring your



81

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.270

A-game when it comes to the onsite interview.



82

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.370

Some companies have multiple onsite especially for really technical roles.



83

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.820

Have you come more than once.



84

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.830

But usually the cases that you come in and it's actually several meetings lined up back to back something



85

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.080

you should be aware of that it's going to take a lot of stamina to go through these meetings so at the



86

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.220

beginning you have a lot of energy but then interview number four comes around and each interview is



87

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.410

like half an hour long.



88

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.330

You've already been there for two hours and you start to get a little tired.



89

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.940

So when they ask you for things like Would you like something to drink or water.



90

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.150

You should probably accept that because we're going to be talking a lot.



91

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.210

So you can talk with multiple team members both technical and non-technical.



92

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.960

And again this kind of depends.



93

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.820

Per the company but the onsite interview kind of an intense process.



94

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.480

You may have to do some whiteboarding as far as answering questions but this also give you a really



95

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.610

great chance to really get a feel for what that position is going to be like who you are going to be



96

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.390

working with what the company looks like etc..



97

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.890

So we discuss specific parts of the general pipeline later on in this course such as how to actually



98

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:28.950

get the connection how to land the interview.



99

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.680

OK.



100

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.930

I hope that was helpful to you at the next lecture.
