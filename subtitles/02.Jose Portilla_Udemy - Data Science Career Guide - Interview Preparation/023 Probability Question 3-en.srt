Welcome to interview question number three for probability theory.

2
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:16,190
So this is pretty similar to the previous question except this time it is what is the probability of

3
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,400
rolling at least one in four with two dice.

4
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:23,310
So instead of thinking of some now we're just thinking of the actual numbers on the dice.

5
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:24,490
So I give you two dice.

6
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:25,960
You go ahead and roll them.

7
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:30,800
What's the probability that at least one of those dice is going to have the number four on it.

8
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:31,900
OK.

9
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,950
Best of luck at the solutions.
