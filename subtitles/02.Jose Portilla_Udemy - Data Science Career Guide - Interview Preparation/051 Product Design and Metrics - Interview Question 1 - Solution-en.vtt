00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.240

Welcome everyone to the solution lecture for the first interview question and the product design and



2

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.540

metrics category.



3

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:18.430

So this was the question asking about just the launch of messenger as a standalone app from Facebook.



4

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.020

It used to be a really common question.



5

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.240

Back in the day when this had just occurred.



6

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.570

Now it's been quite a while almost seven years now.



7

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.600

So let's go ahead and just talk in general about how you attract the performance of this new application



8

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.810

or what metrics you would use.



9

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.360

And hopefully these are these are general enough that you could go ahead and apply these to not just



10

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.030

this messenger application but any application.



11

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.050

And as a quick note there's lots of different possible answers.



12

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.350

Don't take this as the 100 percent correct solution.



13

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.040

This is more of an example answer.



14

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.860

Let's get started by thinking about some key metrics.



15

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.710

So there's daily active users and monthly active users.



16

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.030

And you'll often see the acronyms and Meiyu for these.



17

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.500

So make sure you're familiar with those.



18

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.390

Those are really important metrics for most technology companies to have user bases and daily monthly



19

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.480

active users.



20

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:13.700

In this case we can compare the before and after of daily active users and monthly active users to compare



21

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.420

if users have moved on to the new messenger application and how that's actually affected changes in



22

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.270

the original Facebook application.



23

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.660

So typically you're always going to want to have this metric and use it as a comparison from before



24

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:27.960

and after changes occur.



25

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.580

Another really common metric especially for mobile applications is total time spent especially that



26

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.200

mobile application depends on advertisement for its revenue.



27

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.310

So this allows you to compare total engagement before and after the launch of that standalone messenger



28

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:50.310

app so time spent on the application daily active users monthly active users.



29

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.570

Those are all really common metrics you can use for really any sort of application or web site analysis.



30

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.250

So let's go ahead now and focus on metrics that are a little more specific to the situation at hand



31

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.550

with the messenger application itself.



32

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.850

So some metrics we want to consider are the actual number of messages being sent before and after the



33

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:10.740

change.



34

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.570

So that is something that's related specifically to the messenger application.



35

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.120

And we can actually check here our users more engaged with sending more messages or are they less engaged



36

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.580

is sending less messages after it's a standalone application.



37

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.560

We can also check for response time to messages received.



38

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.930

Maybe we can compare and check if users are responding to messages they receive faster because they



39

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.770

have the standalone applications it's always on on their phone and they don't really need to log on



40

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.300

to Facebook anymore.



41

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.560

So keep in mind increased metrics can also sometimes be deceiving.



42

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.310

It may be the case that users are actually more annoyed by the application.



43

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.710

And for some convoluted reason that's causing them to increase their number of messages being sent.



44

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.840

Maybe they're having a hard time getting messages through.



45

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.610

So they have to keep trying sending messages over and over again.



46

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.650

So that could also be an issue.



47

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.170

So keep in mind that increase in metrics are not always positive things.



48

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.880

So your interviewer may ask you a follow up questions on say what could be some battery reasons that



49

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.740

these metrics are increasing.



50

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.660

So some questions that may arise are is it possible more time is being spent on the app because it's



51

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:19.860

harder to use.



52

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.990

Could this possibly affect advertising revenue changes in how as a previous facebook app affected by



53

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:30.590

the change maybe some users really only using the messenger portion of the Facebook app and now they've



54

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.540

basically kind of died or killed the Facebook app on their phone and now they're only using a messenger



55

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.060

which maybe is not something Facebook wants they want maybe a balance between both applications.



56

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:46.980

So always things to keep in mind that the wider idea of wider picture of these kind of big changes in



57

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:54.140

a company's applications so feel free to share other thoughts on this and the Q&amp;A forums are lots of



58

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.400

right answers here.



59

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.100

I would recommend you practice for a friend.



60

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.760

In fact these are just discussions that are fun to have with a friend who's into technology companies.



61

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.440

Choose another major application.



62

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.500

Discuss how you would measure its success.



63

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.940

Maybe discuss changes you've seen in other applications on your phone maybe use snap chat or Uber or



64

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.240

any other of these popular applications.



65

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.730

Go ahead discuss them how you would measure their success what metrics you would use etc..



66

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.000

Again no 100 percent correct answers here.



67

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.610

More of a discussion of ideas.



68

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.190

Thanks and I'll see at the next lecture.
