00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.150

Finally to wrap up this section of the course.



2

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:13.410

Let's go ahead and address a really common question of students which is how do I know that I'm ready



3

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.310

to apply to jobs in the data science career field so my opinion.



4

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.560

There are a few key skills that you should really have down before beginning your application process



5

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.830

and it boils down to three key skills.



6

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.520

So let's go ahead and discuss those.



7

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:37.490

The three critical skills that you should have before applying to any sort of real data scientist position



8

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.250

are working knowledge of programming knowledge of probability and statistics and then general knowledge



9

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:44.550

of machine learning.



10

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.650

Let's go ahead and tackle each of these bullet points in this case and a little more detail what we



11

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.900

mean by having working knowledge or general knowledge.



12

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.660

The first bullet point of working knowledge of programming.



13

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.080

So what does that actually mean.



14

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.230

Well you should have working knowledge of a particular programming language and I would recommend something



15

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.600

like our or Python for data science positions but it could also be something like Java or C plus plus



16

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.020

depending on what the position actually demands or calls for.



17

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.060

But the main question then on this particular bullet point that students have is well what do you mean



18

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.940

by working knowledge.



19

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:25.440

What I would say working knowledge is is the ability to basically handle any basic task by yourself.



20

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:32.610

Given enough time so it's an example of that would be maybe you're given the task of scrape the data



21

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.170

off this particular web page using a programming language.



22

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.010

Now that doesn't mean that you should be able to do that instantaneously because maybe you've never



23

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.460

done web scrapin before.



24

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.990

But if you have a working knowledge of that particular program over the course of a day or even a few



25

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.200

days you should be able to come up with a solution for web scraping by looking up things on the internet



26

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.850

looking at documentation and then creating a simple script to scrape the Web site of some sort of data.



27

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.460

So I think that's a really good test if you know basically in your heart that oh I would be able to



28

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.130

figure out script needed to scrape this web page even if I haven't done it before I know I have the



29

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.540

capability to do it.



30

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.900

Maybe over a few days.



31

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.990

Then you clearly have working knowledge of programming working knowledge of programming isn't just being



32

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.250

able to do a for loop or really trivial questions like fizz buzz.



33

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.240

Working Knowledge is actually applying programming to a particular problem.



34

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:38.310

So solving some sort of non-trivial task ok next bullet point here is knowledge of probability and statistics.



35

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.050

This one's a little harder to nail down as far as what is knowledge actually mean because if a student



36

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.200

asks How do I know I know enough probability and statistics.



37

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.770

It's a bit of a rabbit hole depending on how far you want to go into the math part of data science.



38

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.550

I think a really good test of if you understand enough about probability and statistics are actually



39

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.650

the practice interview questions in this very course.



40

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.840

So you can go through the question of this course the probability practice questions the statistics



41

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.800

practice questions and check out the resources link there as well.



42

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.450

And if were able to do the majority of those questions then you'll understand that you know enough about



43

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.740

probability and statistics to begin applying for data science positions.



44

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.480

And then finally general knowledge of machine learning.



45

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.170

So it is general knowledge a machine learning actually mean well it means that if I gave you a popular



46

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.610

machine learning algorithm you would be able to describe how it works.



47

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.740

So if I asked you what how does random forest work or how does linear regression work.



48

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.320

You would be able to describe it in pretty good detail how it works.



49

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.720

That doesn't mean you need to be an absolute expert in every single variation of a particular algorithm



50

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.130

but you should definitely know the basics that we discussed in the machine learning knowledge lecturer.



51

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.800

Again depending on the position you may not need as deep knowledge in certain areas.



52

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.690

Maybe if you're applying for business intelligence position or a business analyst position you really



53

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.080

won't need to know that much about machine learning depending on the company.



54

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.250

And then maybe if you're applying for a machine learning engineer position then you're really going



55

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.610

to have to know about machine learning and statistics and programming.



56

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:10.270

OK.



57

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.280

So again a lot of this depends on the position and the company.



58

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.100

So keep that in mind.



59

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:18.040

OK.



60

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.520

So overall a really great way to tell if you're ready for typical data science position interviews actually



61

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.440

practicing the questions in this course.



62

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:31.010

A lot of the questions in this course come from real recruiters at real Silicon Valley tech companies.



63

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.750

Are real questions asked in real data science interviews.



64

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.550

So you know what to expect and you would know whether or not you're really ready for this kind of higher



65

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.940

level data scientist interview positions.



66

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.630

Up next we're going to be describing that data science interview process in the next section of the



67

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.490

course and afterwards it's all just practice questions and solutions so you can test whether or not



68

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:51.540

you're prepared.



69

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.390

Thanks everyone and I will see at the next section of the course.
