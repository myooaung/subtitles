00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.990

OK welcome back in this lecture one of the US negotiating offers.



2

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.120

So you did all the hard work of creating your resume applying for jobs you've gone through the entire



3

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.790

interview pipeline and you've gotten the offers in the ideal situation you're going to have a few competing



4

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:22.520

offers.



5

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:28.800

Let's go ahead and discuss how to handle this last the very crucial part of the job search process.



6

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.650

So a couple of key things you should be aware of and the first thing to be aware of is that compensation



7

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:42.000

is not just salary compensation it's going to be your salary your bonuses equity stock.



8

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.190

And there's also benefits like your 401k health insurance.



9

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.780

Some of these things are a little more common in the U.S. than in an international market where maybe



10

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.750

health insurance provided by the state or furrowing hasn't really exist.



11

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.250

But the sort of benefits you should be aware of them as your total compensation package.



12

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.430

So don't just look at salary by itself.



13

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:07.400

Keep in mind the entire package of compensation when you're negotiating for your offer.



14

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.590

Now as far as some individual components of that compensation or concern for salary to decide whether



15

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.480

or not you're getting a fair shake on salary or good offer on salary there's lots of really good tools



16

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.630

out there online that allow you to compare salaries for people in similar positions.



17

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.520

A glass door is a really good Web site not just for reviews of companies but they also have self-reported



18

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.200

anonymous salaries there so you can take a look at the actual company you're applying to and seeing



19

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.160

if people have posted their salary onto glass door.



20

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.590

Keep in mind Glassdoor is self-reported.



21

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.310

There's a really great Web site called H1-B data info.



22

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.410

And this Web site is actually the exact salary people are getting paid.



23

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:54.260

So what happens at least in the United States is if a foreign worker ends up getting a job that could



24

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.860

have gone to a American citizen.



25

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.510

The company is legally required to post and inform the public of the salary.



26

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.410

So you can actually figure out the exact salary certain people are getting paid for for positions in



27

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.280

the United States.



28

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.380

So you can go to H1-B data info and that's going to give you a really clear idea of what the actual



29

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.720

real salaries people are getting paid for.



30

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.060

Keep in mind it is going to be a little skewed based off the sampling they are sometimes really high



31

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.090

salaries because they're specifically reaching out to kind of international populations to bring really



32

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.220

skilled workers to the United States.



33

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.260

And again a lot of this advice here is kind of really us heavy.



34

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.350

So I apologize if some of these resources aren't as useful to you from an international perspective.



35

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.930

OK.



36

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.440

So officials be aware of is that salaries vary by geographical location.



37

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.680

We should also keep in mind of cost of living for certain areas so San Francisco salaries tend to be



38

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.410

much much higher than salaries in other locations.



39

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.050

But that's also because the cost of living there is so much greater should also keep in mind like I



40

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.390

mentioned before salary isn't the only aspect of compensation.



41

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.290

So when it comes to things like stock and equity in a company for startups and smaller companies compensation



42

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.810

it may rely more heavily on stock equity and stock and equity in general.



43

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.650

It's actually really complex and it varies drastically between companies.



44

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.990

And I would really advice you that if you're getting an offer where stock is or equity in the company



45

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:30.990

is a major part of your compensation maybe you're getting some heavy really reduced salary and it's



46

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:36.840

being made up for an equity you should seek the advice of someone who's a legal expert in equity because



47

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.130

it can be really complex.



48

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:44.220

Equity can be diluted as more people come on and you can definitely check out the resource links that



49

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:50.280

are available to you where there's a lot of great entrepreneurs and VC advisors who have written in



50

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.770

great detail some of the complexities and issues to watch out for when it comes to equity.



51

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:56.890

But again definitely take your time.



52

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:04.910

As far as considering any offer where stock an equity is a major part of the compensation package so



53

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.200

as you just mentioned you can check other resources in the lecture for detailed writeups on equity and



54

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.010

you should definitely seek the advice of a legal professional if that's a major part of your compensation.



55

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.770

Now there are other important considerations and research has shown that job satisfaction is actually



56

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:25.720

most directly connected to who your manager is your day to day activities your growth potential and



57

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:31.420

your environment how much you're actually being paid is not going to directly link to your happiness



58

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.790

and this may be a little more philosophical than you actually were expecting.



59

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.570

But keep in mind that actual research has shown that job satisfaction.



60

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.130

You're definitely going to want to keep in mind day to day activities and who your manager is and hopefully



61

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.600

your onsite interview gave you a good idea of what that would look like.



62

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.400

OK.



63

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.970

So let's actually discuss then negotiating offers.



64

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:00.300

Now that we have a clear understanding of compensation most companies in this space are going to expect



65

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:06.150

negotiation unless otherwise explicitly stated there are some companies that will explicitly state that



66

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.760

they do not negotiate salaries.



67

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.590

They just offer you the best they can.



68

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.620

And in that case you know you can't really negotiate much salary rise or compensation wise.



69

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:20.070

However most companies base that do not explicitly state that do expect some sort of negotiation to



70

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.970

occur.



71

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.050

So what you do not want to do is accept the offer right away.



72

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:30.330

Were you going to want to do is ask for a little time a really good tactic is if you have a significant



73

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:36.030

other tell a recruiter I would need to talk to my significant other discuss the compensation in that



74

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.610

way just to buy yourself a little more time to sleep on it.



75

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.820

Do the comparisons do the research etc..



76

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.390

And most companies are willing to go somewhere between 10 to 15 percent higher than their initial offer



77

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.180

and keep in mind that salary is not the only negotiation chip you have on the table.



78

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.110

Everything is open for negotiation.



79

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:59.000

You can negotiate things like more vacation time negotiate things like relocation expenses etc..



80

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.460

So what can you actually negotiate.



81

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.280

Well there are the obvious ones like say that salary an equity stock cetera.



82

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:13.510

But as I just mentioned vacation relocation expenses performance review schedules so maybe you negotiate



83

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:18.010

that your next performance review for a raise is going to occur at an accelerated rate.



84

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.010

So you get it maybe in six months instead of a whole year etc..



85

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.620

Main advice here is you should try to negotiate it for estrogen.



86

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:31.970

You never know what's negotiable unless you ask and pretty much everything to some degree can be negotiated.



87

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.910

Things keep in mind during this whole process.



88

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.790

Always be really friendly be very polite for the interviewer member it's a conversation not a debate



89

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:45.970

not an argument and you should always be reiterating your excitement and what you can bring to the company.



90

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:51.260

Make yourself very valuable to them make it clear that there is a lot that you can bring to the table



91

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.260

and always be friendly and polite during this whole process.



92

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.780

OK.



93

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:57.890

I hope that was helpful.



94

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.220

Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next section of the course.
