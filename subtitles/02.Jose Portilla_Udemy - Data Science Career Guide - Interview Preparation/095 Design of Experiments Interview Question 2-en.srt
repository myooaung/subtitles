Welcome to interview question number two for design of experiments.

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:15,500
So the question is how can you know if a sample is biased and what different kind of biases should you

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,360
be aware of when using any particular sample.

4
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,220
All right.

5
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:24,540
We'll discuss different biases and how you can determine if a sample is biased in the solution or lecture.

6
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,440
Coming up next.
