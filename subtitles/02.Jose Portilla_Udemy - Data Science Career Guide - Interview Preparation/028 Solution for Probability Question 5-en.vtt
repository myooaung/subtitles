Welcome everyone to the solution for a probability question number five.



2

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.680

So for this question it was the probability of seeing a car on the highway in 30 minutes is 0.9 5.



3

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.070

What is the probability of seeing a car on the highway in 10 minutes.



4

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.590

And in order to solve this question you need to assume a constant default probability.



5

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.930

So let's go ahead and explain a little more of how you could get the solution for this.



6

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:34.060

So let's go ahead and see the probability of seeing no car in 10 minutes is going to be peak.



7

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.520

So again relabeling the probability of p as the probability of seeing no car in 10 minutes.



8

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.810

Therefore the probability of seeing no car in 20 minutes is just p times P or P squared and the probability



9

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:53.670

of seeing no car in 30 minutes is going to be t p p times P which is P to the power of three or P-Q.



10

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.570

So we know that the probability of seeing at least one car in 30 minutes is going to be equal to one



11

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.090

minus the probability of seeing no current 30 minutes which is one minus P-Q.



12

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.460

So we know that equation is equal to 0.9 5.



13

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.280

And if we solve for P then we get p is equal to 0.37.



14

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.400

And now that we know the value of P we can plug it back in to solve for the probability of seeing a



15

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.730

single car in 10 minutes which is going to be to one of my espie or 0.6 three probability of seeing



16

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.270

a car in 10 minutes.



17

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:29.050

So this is a little tricky because you do have to assume there's some sort of default probability in



18

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.720

this time span.



19

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.920

Realistically that's not how you would actually approach this question because realistically you won't



20

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.430

have a default constant probability in real life but for the sake of this interview problem you should



21

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.620

have been hinted at that you had a default probability.



22

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:50.140

Sometimes this interview question is asked without that particular statement that there is a default



23

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.640

constant probability.



24

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.320

So if you ever have a question go ahead and make sure that you ask your interviewer.



25

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.760

What assumptions can I make here or do you go ahead and make the assumption that there's a constant



26

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.310

default probability and then you ask them if it's OK to make that assumption.



27

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.040

Because sometimes I've seen this interview a question asked in situations where they do not explicitly



28

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.520

tell you to assume the default probability.



29

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.910

You'll have to make that assumption on your own and explain it to the interviewer.



30

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.470

But once you've done that you can see here that mathematically it's actually pretty easy.



31

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.200

You just have to remember that the one minus P is going to be equal to the probability of seeing the



32

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.720

car where p then is probability of not seeing the car.



33

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.600

All right.



34

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:28.630

Hope that was helpful.



35

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:29.590

I'll see at the next lecture.
