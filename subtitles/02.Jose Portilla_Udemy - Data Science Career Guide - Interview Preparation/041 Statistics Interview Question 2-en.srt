00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:10,280
Welcome to question them to for the statistics interview.

2
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:11,790
The question is the following.

3
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:17,950
A new quantum messaging system has a probability of 0.8 of success and any attempt to send the message

4
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:18,730
through.

5
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:23,410
So using this new quantum messaging system you have an 80 percent chance of success that your message

6
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,450
actually went through.

7
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:25,650
And the question is.

8
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:32,610
Calculate the probability of having seven successful messages going through out of 10 attempts.

9
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,740
And as a hint you may want to look at the binomial distribution to help you with this.

10
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,110
You can always check out the guidebook for the relevant links.

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,590
Again calculate the probability of having seven successes in 10 attempts.

12
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:50,180
Given that this messaging system has a probability of 80 percent of success in any attempt to send the

13
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,320
message through.

14
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,220
Best of luck.
