Welcome everyone to the solution for interview question and before the product design and metrics category.

2
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,690
So again same AB testing of that new algorithm.

3
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:19,010
However now the last question to be asked is since the less relevant algorithm results in higher advertising

4
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,020
revenue should it be implemented.

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:27,730
Anyways so this is a bit of an opinion question but in general you would hope that you would probably

6
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:32,350
not implement this new Algor of them and that's because the effects described here.

7
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:37,330
If we really think about them based on our previous discussions they're probably only short term effects

8
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:43,630
due to the problems with the algorithms and the outer rhythms ability to produce relevant results.

9
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:50,740
Lacking So we shouldn't sacrifice the long term potential of the site for a temporary increase in revenue

10
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:55,080
and searches and Google is probably best positioned to win in the long term.

11
00:00:55,090 --> 00:01:00,100
When has the most relevant search algorithm and even though we're producing more searches and higher

12
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:06,190
advertising revenue with these less relevant results that's more likely a short term byproduct of less

13
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:12,550
relevant results being returned than an actual long term solution for revenue growth and more searches.

14
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:18,190
So I would suggest to not implement this and I believe most interviewers would probably feel the same

15
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:22,320
way you would never want to sacrifice long term results for short term gain.

16
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,760
All right thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
