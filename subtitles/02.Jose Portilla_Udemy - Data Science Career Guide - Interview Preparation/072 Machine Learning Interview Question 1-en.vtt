Welcome to interview question number one for machine learning.



2

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.860

So there are a couple of questions here.



3

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.340

And most of them are some linear regression in general.



4

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.470

So the first question is What are the main assumptions of a linear regression model and then also what



5

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.450

are the most common types of linear regression.



6

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.890

So to put that in a little more formally as far as common types what are the most common estimation



7

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.640

techniques for linear regression OK.



8

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.520

Best of luck and we'll see you at the solutions.
