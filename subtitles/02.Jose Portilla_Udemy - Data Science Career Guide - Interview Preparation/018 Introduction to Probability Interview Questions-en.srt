Welcome everyone to the probability theory interview questions section of the course.

2
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:16,460
Let's work through some example interview questions that relate to probability theory in one way or

3
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:21,770
another and often these questions when you're being asked in an interview setting either use coins or

4
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:26,870
dice rolls to test your knowledge of some sort of key points of probability theory.

5
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:31,400
Keep in mind that these are sometimes some of the most difficult interview questions.

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:37,070
They're also often used during the technical screening phase and based on my own experiences as well

7
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:43,010
as the recruiters I've talked to here in Bay Area tech companies you'll often hear in a data scientist

8
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,590
technical screening phase.

9
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:49,550
So that's after your initial phone call but before your onsite interview some sort of probability theory

10
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,170
question.

11
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:55,100
And in my own experience when I was interviewing at Facebook and Google I've been asked questions and

12
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,100
we're actually going to see those questions later on in this course.

13
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:03,200
So let's go ahead and get some practice with basic probability theory interview questions.

14
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,250
I'll see you at the next lecture.
