00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,040
Welcome everyone to the solution for probability.

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,120
Question number seven.

3
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:14,360
So just a quick overview of the question you were given 10 coins nine of which were fair and one which

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:19,820
was biased and you were told that the biased coin has some probability p greater than 0.5 to be heads

5
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:25,460
so that it's biased in the heads more often in tails and you randomly grab one of these 10 coins.

6
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,430
Flip it three times and you get heads heads tails.

7
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:34,310
What does a probability flipped the biased coin in recall from the notes in the lecture before the interview

8
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:34,990
question.

9
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,840
You have to solve this in terms of the probability p.

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,930
There's no way to just get a straight answer from this sort of solve the sexual problem.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,060
You're going to need to use the base theorem and the Bayes Theorem.

12
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:50,890
Remember it describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might

13
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:56,920
be related to the event such as the prior knowledge that one out of these 10 coins was biased.

14
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:02,650
So let's take a look at Bayes theorem here we can see that we have the conditional probability on the

15
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:03,750
left hand side.

16
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:10,690
So the likelihood of event a given that B is true is equal to the probability of the likelihood of events

17
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,900
B given that is true of times probability of occurring divided by the probability of be occurring.

18
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:20,980
And there is an expanded alternative that you can use in case you don't know some of these probabilities

19
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:21,850
directly.

20
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,520
You can plug more in.

21
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,270
So let's go ahead and work this out.

22
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:32,110
Basically we're going to do first is fill in what we know so we're going to be the stand for bias the

23
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:38,380
probability of it being the biased coin and h h t is going to stand for the probability of flipping

24
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,600
heads heads tails.

25
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:47,490
So we know that the probability of flipping heads heads tails given that it was biased is equal to the

26
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:53,160
probability of flipping heads times probability of flipping heads those probability of flipping tails

27
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,930
each of those given that it was a biased coin and then we know that the probability of the coin being

28
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:03,270
biased given the fact the flipped heads heads tails is going to be equal to the probability of heads

29
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:09,720
tails given that it was biased times the probability of it being biased divided by the probability of

30
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,480
flipping heads heads tails.

31
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,510
So now we're going to do here is plug in all of this stuff for probability of HHC or heads heads tails

32
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,150
given in the event that it was biased.

33
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:23,810
So here we go.

34
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,710
If we plug in those probabilities then we get something that looks like this is the base theorem.

35
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:31,850
And if you need to pause the screen I would recommend that you manually plug these in yourself to make

36
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,830
sure that you fundamentally understand these probabilities here.

37
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:41,920
That basically what we did is we just use Bayes Theorem and we plug them everything that we needed for

38
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:48,180
probability of flipping heads heads tails given the bias is true OK.

39
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,510
So let's go ahead and figure this out.

40
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:55,190
So what we're going to do is start plugging in one by one some of these probabilities in terms of p

41
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,460
so that we can actually get some sort of result.

42
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:02,000
So the first two are going to do here is plug in the probability of it being biased.

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,610
We actually know that exact number.

44
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,700
It's 1 out of 10.

45
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:10,670
So the probability of picking the biased coin is 1 out of 10 because it was one out of 10 coins.

46
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:14,570
The next thing we're going to plug in here will keep the original equation on top and we'll plug into

47
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:21,280
the bottom is the probability of flipping heads heads tails given a fair coin and that's just going

48
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:27,730
to be 0.5 to the power of three then the next probability we're going to play in here is a probability

49
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:32,290
of picking the fair coin that's just 0.9 because nine out of 10 coins are fair.

50
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:38,140
And then we're also going to plug in now some other probabilities given that the flipping of heads given

51
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,690
its biased.

52
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:44,000
So we did not actually know the exact number of the probability of flipping heads.

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,740
Given you have a biased coin though we are going to find that as Pete.

54
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:53,830
So in that case we can get p times p times 1 minus P So if we look back to what we're playing into we're

55
00:03:53,830 --> 00:04:00,220
just flipping in or playing in heads heads tails for the biased coin which is P-P and then 1 minus P

56
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,230
for that tails.

57
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:07,190
And then finally we can plug in the probability of flipping heads heads tails given the biased coin.

58
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,860
And that's just going to be the same thing.

59
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,710
There are probably times probably times one minus p.

60
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:18,150
And so once you do that you can end up kind of collapse in this to try to get some more comments condense

61
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,110
terms here and you get something that looks like this piece squared times 1 minus p times are Point

62
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:29,160
1 over P squared times one minus p times 0.1 plus 0.1 1 to 5.

63
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,590
And if you want to start clean this up more and more.

64
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,160
But this is the basic idea of what you had to do at some point your interviewer here is probably going

65
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,340
to stop you and say that that's enough.

66
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:42,550
You have an understanding the main key things to remember for this particular interview question was

67
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,810
one you had to solve it in terms of P or in terms of some probability.

68
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:50,860
In this case we chose the probability of flipping heads giving a biased coin.

69
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,730
And more importantly you had to realize that you had to use the Bayes theorem or Bayes Rule.

70
00:04:54,730 --> 00:05:00,050
So given those two things it becomes a relatively straightforward question if you are able to realize

71
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,900
is two fundamental things for solving this problem.

72
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:03,870
OK.

73
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,160
Hope you enjoyed that.

74
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,200
I'll see you at the next lecture.
