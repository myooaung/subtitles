00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:09,590
Welcome back everyone in this lecture we're going to discuss software engineering knowledge and we should

2
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:15,970
be aware of so coding and programming are going to be a major part of your day to day activities as

3
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,000
a data scientist and in a lot of data science rules.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,610
So let's go ahead and discuss what you may encounter during an interview so during an interview depending

5
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:30,360
on what kind of company it is you may be asked questions on algorithms and data structures.

6
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:36,080
Now algorithm and data structure questions are typically associated with something as a general software

7
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:41,180
engineer role and there's already lost courses and books that discuss the best way to prepare for those

8
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,080
interviews.

9
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,190
That's in a state of science is still relatively new for a lot of companies and they're just starting

10
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:51,970
to build out their teams a lot of times they don't interview data scientist positions as they should

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,940
based on probability statistics or machine learning or just basic coding.

12
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:00,080
Instead they treat it more almost like a general software engineer position.

13
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:05,210
As far as the interview process is concerned so be aware that depending on the company you may be asked

14
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:10,850
questions that are concerned with algorithms and data structures things that you don't typically concern

15
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:15,750
yourself with as a data scientist but you may be asked these questions in an interview anyways.

16
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,430
Then there's also questions based on Eskew and databases.

17
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:22,270
Now these are really common data science questions.

18
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,040
And if you're applying for a science position it's highly likely that you're going to be asked just

19
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,120
a general knowledge question to test whether or not you know as school or sequel.

20
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:36,740
Don't worry too much about the different syntax or flavors of sequel things like My sequel postgresql

21
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,900
sequel or Microsoft's sequel server.

22
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,430
That's not really that important.

23
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,570
What's important is that you understand the fundamentals of.

24
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:48,800
Q Well because regardless of what position you're in it's very likely that the way you interact with

25
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,820
your data warehouse is going to be through some sort of a query or structured query language.

26
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:59,860
Now again the pinning on the position if you end up dealing with a larger big data sets you may need

27
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,070
to have some knowledge about Sparc and distributed computing.

28
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,000
Spark is definitely one of the higher players here distributor computing.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,280
But then there's also languages or frameworks like Hadoop that you should be aware of as well.

30
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:18,520
Again that is really more specific to each individual job postings so just keep an awareness of that.

31
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:23,100
Then you also need to know things like data visualization products or services so maybe they're working

32
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,530
a particular service like plot Li or Tablo and they want your expertise in visualizing data using that

33
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:30,930
particular software tool.

34
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,490
That's another thing that you'll check the job posting for.

35
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,160
OK.

36
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:39,040
So again interview focus on this knowledge really depends a lot on the company and position.

37
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,240
So you'll need to be able to connect the job posting with what skills you should learn.

38
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:47,800
So now you should have a clear understanding of the various fields of knowledge that you'll need to

39
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,880
be familiar with as you venture onto your data science career.

40
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,860
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
