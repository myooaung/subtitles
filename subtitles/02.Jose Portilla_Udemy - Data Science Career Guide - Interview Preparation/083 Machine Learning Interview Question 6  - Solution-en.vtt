Welcome everyone to the solution for machine learning.



2

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.210

Question number 6.



3

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.860

So this question was given a data set of features X and labels y What assumptions are made when using



4

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.550

naive Beys methods.



5

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.420

So the naive base algorithm assumes that the features of x are conditionally independent of each other



6

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.540

for the given y.



7

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.930

So the idea that each features in the pen of each other may actually not always be true but we assume



8

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:35.770

it to be true to apply naive Abbe's and the naive assumption that each features independent of every



9

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:41.230

other feature in relation to Y is where the namesake of naive comes from because it's a naive assumption



10

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.150

to make.



11

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.540

OK you can check out the resources in the guidebook if you're interested in more details behind the



12

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.060

Navy's theorem.



13

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.060

We'll see you at the next lecture.
