00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:11,430
Welcome everyone to the coding interview questions section of the course this series of practice questions

2
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:15,050
is really going to test your knowledge on just a few popular coding questions.

3
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:20,580
There's a few key questions that are really popular for whatever reason in interview settings either

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,370
at the take home phase at the screening phase or at the onsite phase.

5
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,740
So we're going to go ahead and let you practice on those these questions and actually rely on knowledge

6
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:34,050
of statistics or machine learning but focus instead on just solving general problems with code.

7
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,760
And depending on the company's experience of hiring data scientists the interview could potentially

8
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,190
really focus heavily on these types of questions.

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,880
And what I mean by that is sometimes smaller companies they've only had experience hiring software engineers.

10
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:52,830
So what ends up happening is their interview structure isn't changed for a data science position and

11
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:57,170
so they end up interviewing you as if you're coming on for a software engineer role.

12
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,440
So the interview questions are really heavily focused on coding data structures and algorithms.

13
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:06,610
So if you start facing those type of interviews maybe or even going into certain interviews for a Data

14
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:11,550
Engineer and they really focus a lot more on coding you may want to study data structures and algorithms

15
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,960
for more preparation.

16
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,030
OK let's get started.

17
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,000
I'll see you at the next lecture.
