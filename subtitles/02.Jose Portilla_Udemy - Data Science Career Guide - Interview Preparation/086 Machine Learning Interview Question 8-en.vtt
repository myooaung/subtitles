Welcome to machine learning interview question number eight for this question we're going to ask what



2

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:17.110

is overfitting and what causes it and in what ways can you attempt to avoid overfitting.



3

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.870

So there's just a general question for machine learning in general.



4

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:22.250

So what's overfitting.



5

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.680

What are the causes and how can we avoid it.
