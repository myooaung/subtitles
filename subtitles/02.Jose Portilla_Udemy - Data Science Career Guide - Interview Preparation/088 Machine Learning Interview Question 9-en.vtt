Welcome to machine learning answer your question number nine.



2

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:09.680

So for this question.



3

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.520

Describe the differences between accuracy precision and recall.



4

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.360

These are really common metrics for classification tasks and you should make sure you understand the



5

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.600

differences between them.



6

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.450

So go ahead and describe that the differences between accuracy precision and recall We'll see what the



7

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:24.080

solutions.
