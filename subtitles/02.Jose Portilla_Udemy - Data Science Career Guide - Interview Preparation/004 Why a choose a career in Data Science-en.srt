00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,800
Welcome back everyone in this lecture.

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,660
We're going to briefly discuss why you may want to choose a career in data science.

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:18,740
Data science is a field where you can create huge impacts by leveraging some key fundamental ideas from

4
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:25,200
mathematics and coding and being able to extract key insights from data to help build a better future

5
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:29,110
is really one of the most fulfilling careers you can have.

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,860
Now often people only associate data science with large tech companies like Amazon Google or Facebook.

7
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:41,220
But almost every industry can gain a substantial advantage with data science and you'll begin to notice

8
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:49,470
that even companies like Wal-Mart or industries like pharming or dairy they all really need data scientists

9
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:51,810
to help give them the advantage.

10
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:56,760
Now there's also many positions that relate to these ideas in this field that aren't particularly called

11
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,810
data scientist and we'll discuss that later on in a lot more detail.

12
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:09,570
Now besides the cool aspects of being able to leverage data to gain key insights There's also the great

13
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,550
benefits salary wise and compensation wise that come with a data science career.

14
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:20,640
Now according to Forbes jobs requiring machine learning skills or paying an average of $140000 and that's

15
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,390
a national average for areas of higher cost of living it goes up much more than that.

16
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:31,730
Now advertised data scientist jobs pay an average of a hundred or five thousand and advertised data

17
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,780
engineering jobs pay an average of 170000.

18
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,950
So you can see here you're getting really great salary compensation.

19
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,900
Not to mention a lot of the benefits like health care or stock options that also come with these sort

20
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,130
of career paths.

21
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:51,000
Now annual demand for the fast growing new rules of data scientist data developers and data engineers

22
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:54,910
are going to reach nearly 700000 openings by 2020.

23
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:00,160
So there's also a huge demand and there's a huge job market for this career path.

24
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:07,140
And by 2020 the number of jobs for all U.S. data professionals is going to increase by 364 thousand

25
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,410
openings to 2 million 720000.

26
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,080
According to IBM.

27
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:18,790
So the top reasons for a data science career is that the work is fulfilling and interesting.

28
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:22,990
There's really interesting technical topics if you're interested in learning about machine learning

29
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:29,110
you can learn bleeding edge scientific techniques to in order to gain insights from that data.

30
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:34,690
It's also in really high demand has great pay and benefits and simply it's just awesome.

31
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:35,180
OK.

32
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:39,910
Let's go ahead and continue our discussion on data science and how it's interdisciplinary.
