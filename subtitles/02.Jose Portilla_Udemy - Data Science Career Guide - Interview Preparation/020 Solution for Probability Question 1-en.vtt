00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.440

Let's go ahead and go over the solution for the first probability interview question.



2

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.470

Just to reiterate the question you're given a fair coin and on average how many flips would you need



3

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.320

to get two of the same flip in a row.



4

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.780

Either two heads in a row or two tails in a row.



5

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:26.680

Let's start by trying to calculate P of M which is to say the probability that we get two consecutive



6

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.270

flips either heads heads or tails tails on the nth toss.



7

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.030

So just to further examine what we mean by that pre-event or that probability.



8

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.600

Let's go ahead and examine it for a specific and first and then we'll generalize it to the nth toss.



9

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.450

So if we think about what PIAA then is for unequals to that is what is the probability that out of two



10

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:52.070

tosses you're going to get heads heads or tails tails Well it's actually quite simple for such a low



11

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.560

number n For one thing we know we need a minimum of N is equal to or greater than two flips for the



12

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.670

probability in general.



13

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.470

And so for two tosses there's only four possible flips that can occur either heads heads tails tails



14

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.240

heads tails or tails heads.



15

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:11.320

So we know the answer or even for an equal to two is going to be two out of four of those flips get



16

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.950

to a sequence in a row.



17

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.110

Or in other words one half probability that if you flip a coin twice you're going to get either heads



18

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.660

heads or tails tails.



19

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.510

So now we want to do generalize this to the nth toss.



20

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.420

Not just to unequals to.



21

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.370

So again we're going to calculate given the probability that we get two consecutive flips on the nth



22

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.830

toss.



23

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:37.840

We know that flips from 1 all the way to end minus one are going to need to be in the form of either



24

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.430

heads tails heads tails etcetera or tails heads tails heads because they need to be alternating.



25

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.670

Otherwise we would've already had the two consecutive flips.



26

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.700

So now what's the probability of getting that series by itself just an alternating series up to and



27

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.510

minus one.



28

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.330

What's that actual probability Well the probability of getting an alternating series of flips for and



29

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.090

minus one tosses is equal to two over two to the power and minus one.



30

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:12.310

Because each of the series individually is 1 over 2 and minus 1 probability of occurring.



31

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:18.890

So this is because if we think about this each individual Flip has a 1 half chance of the being the



32

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.650

flip that we need to continue the alternating series.



33

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.770

So that means for and minus one tosses we need to do one half times one half times one half all the



34

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.140

way until and minus one times to calculate the probability of getting that particular alternating sequence



35

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.700

and minus one times.



36

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:41.990

So that's the result of the probability one over to the minus one because there are two possible alternating



37

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.110

sequences that is tails first or heads first.



38

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.330

We know that we can just add up these probabilities and then we get that the probability for that alternating



39

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.440

sequence is going to be to over 2 to the end minus 1.



40

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.900

So that's a probability of an alternating sequence of two and minus one.



41

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.890

And we know that that toss needs to match up to the previous toss.



42

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.430

And the odds of that happening are 1 1/2.



43

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.560

So that just means that we're going to end up getting that the probability of N or probability of getting



44

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.650

that consecutive flip on the nth toss is going to be the probability of getting alternating sequence



45

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.700

times the probability of that last flip matching the previous flip.



46

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.720

So that's two over two to the power of minus one multiplied by one half.



47

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.890

That last flip and then that's going to be equal to 1 over to the power of minus 1.



48

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.300

So one over to the end of minus one.



49

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.450

That's the answer for the probability of n.



50

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.180

So that given that we were looking for and now we can use that to actually get the expected number of



51

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.880

flips.



52

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.850

So we know the formula for an expected value is going to equal two.



53

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.560

If you have X we're looking for is going to be x 1 times probability of one occurring plus X two times



54

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.050

probability of occurring plus all the way to some X's KMP of k.



55

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:04.460

In our case we know that x is equal to and and P is equal to that probability event that we just calculated.



56

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.490

So with our values we end up getting is a geometric series that sums up to three.



57

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.910

So we end up calculating the sum from an equal to all the way to infinity and times probability of N



58

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:24.990

and then we get up getting geometric sum of and over to the end minus 1 and that sums up to 3.



59

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.020

So this does require you to remember how to sum up a geometric series.



60

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.690

So you can check out the guidebook for more information on that.



61

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.090

In case you're a little rusty on that.



62

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:39.070

But that gives you the answer of the expected number of tosses you a need in order to get two flips



63

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.660

in a row.



64

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:45.730

And hopefully intuitively that feels correct that you need to do three flips on average up getting two



65

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:46.500

in a row.



66

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.840

OK thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
