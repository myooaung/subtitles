00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.290

Welcome back everyone.



2

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:12.720

This lecture on resumes one of the very first things a potential employer is going to see about you



3

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.220

is your resume.



4

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.390

Let's go over some key points when creating a resume for data science positions.



5

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.690

You're going to want to use metrics on your resume to show what you've done.



6

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.550

So you're going to want to use phrases like increased accuracy by 30 percent and a fraud detection model



7

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:34.940

instead of just saying something like improved detection model or improved models at work using metrics



8

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.740

really alerts an employer to actual changes and improvements that you've been able to create.



9

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.470

So you want to use phrases like manage a team of three to create revenue forecasting models instead



10

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.180

of just saying something like managed a team.



11

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.260

Now there's also discussion of how much she'd customize a resume for each job position.



12

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:02.910

So I would advise you to do as much customization as possible later on when we talk about the pipeline



13

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.920

you'll realize that the actual amount of jobs you apply to is probably going to make this impossible



14

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.100

because of just the scale of customizing every single resume.



15

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.850

So instead what you should do is probably have resumes that are tailored per position focus and then



16

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.630

have your really customized resumes tailored for the top company's choice.



17

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.360

So we should end up doing is out of all the companies you're going to apply to.



18

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:34.320

Pick your top 10 or 15 that you would really like to get and do custom resumes for each of those positions.



19

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.800

Then for the rest of the applications you'll want resumes that are tailored to some sort of facet of



20

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.450

data science.



21

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.950

So maybe one resume will focus a little more in product in other resumes going to focus a little more



22

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.710

on machine learning capabilities.



23

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.250

Another resume will focus more on business aspects cetera.



24

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.220

Now keep in mind each resume should at least have some sort of mention of the company.



25

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.650

So you will have to customize a little bit but those are really easy to kind of swap in and out.



26

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.380

You should always double check your resume to make sure you're not doing accidental references for some



27

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.710

other position or some other company.



28

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.790

Now another thing that kind of goes along your resume is social proof.



29

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.880

So social proof is a really powerful way to help you land the interview and also augments your resume.



30

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.400

So you're going to want to make sure that you have an up to date LinkedIn profile.



31

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.710

That's also really important.



32

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.640

And you also want to make sure that in your LinkedIn profile you go ahead and turn your settings on



33

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.220

where you indicate that you're currently conducting a job search that lets recruiters using Linked-In



34

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.500

tools for recruitment actually.



35

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.450

Know that you are looking for a job and you'll notice that you'll begin to get a lot more linked in



36

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.130

messages that way.



37

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.370

You'll also probably want a hub page of recent projects.



38

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.870

So a really good way to attract attention is by linking back to your page where you have projects.



39

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.790

So that allows employers to see that you're still active you're still learning and that you're contributing.



40

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.120

The next thing you may want for social proof is a Kaggle profile that's basically a data science or



41

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.070

machine learning competition Web site and often on those Web sites those actual competitions may lead



42

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.460

to interviews themselves.



43

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:20.790

So it's a Web site where people either offer money or just for knowledge competitions on solving real



44

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.090

data science problems for real companies and sometimes major companies.



45

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.430

For instance Facebook have created competitions where the prize is actually an interview for their data



46

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.320

science team.



47

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.340

So having a good profile there showing that you're involved in competitions is a really good way not



48

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.550

just to have social proof but it's also a great way to practice your skills and keep your skills fresh.



49

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.390

So I would definitely recommend you check out that resource other social proof that may be useful to



50

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:51.000

you or things like having that Stack Exchange profile that is going to stack overflow helping other



51

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.490

users out by answering questions or maybe having a good core profile by also answering questions there.



52

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.260

Those are definitely not as strong as you linked in but also an important part of that social proof



53

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.260

ecosystem.



54

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.660

And then finally it's always a good idea to have either a personal blog or a Web site that you can link



55

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.330

to an employer.



56

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.450

So as far as general resume tips are concerned you'll want to keep it down to the front sight of just



57

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:15.950

one page.



58

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:21.830

Another rule of thumb that people say as far as how long it should be is one page per 10 years but the



59

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:26.720

actual amount of time that a recruiter spends at looking at a resume you'll probably just want to limit



60

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.220

it down to one page with the key highlights.



61

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.670

You also want to stick to simple formatting and you should only use acronyms that are really common.



62

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:40.700

So for example as well for a structured query language or sequel it's a good acronym to use pretty much



63

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:45.770

everyone in the space knows about it but something like Optix which is actually a clustering algorithm



64

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:51.390

might be a bad choice unless you're specifically applying to a position where you would expect the recruiters



65

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.720

to understand what that acronym stands for.



66

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:59.240

So again avoid acronyms unless they're really common ones and you'll probably only want to use common



67

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.870

file type.



68

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.760

So basically stick with PEF or Word documents for your resume.



69

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:10.190

I know sometimes certain Web sites require you to pasan a text file of your resume so you may want to



70

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:11.740

keep that handy as well.



71

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.710

Let's go ahead and explore a resume example.



72

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.330

And you can check out the resource links for direct links.



73

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.280

These examples that we're going to show for it.



74

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.330

So here we are looking at will Stanton's resume this is actually a real resume.



75

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.580

Some of the information has been anonymized.



76

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:33.080

But you can see here that there's a profile recent work experience technical skills education some honors



77

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.180

and awards and then select that presentation.



78

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.680

So let's kind of walk through this what's good what you may want to change when working on your resume



79

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:47.240

etc. So you'll definitely want to keep clear information at the very top so your contact information



80

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:52.790

your email Linked-In maybe even your page on my particular resume.



81

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.350

I usually include my hub and my link then.



82

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.720

So you want to contact information up top.



83

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.570

Keep it simple keep it clear.



84

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.230

Maybe sometimes people like to make the fonts of their name a little larger.



85

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.790

But again keep it very simple as far as styles concerned the next line.



86

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.800

Here we see a profile.



87

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.480

Now there's a lot of debates on whether or not you should have some sort of profile statement or some



88

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.420

sort of statement of purpose on your resume.



89

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.800

In my opinion those are unnecessary.



90

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:25.010

I don't think you should have a statement of purpose or some sort of profile of just two lines that



91

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.900

doesn't really add anything to your resume because if you're applying the position it's pretty clear



92

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:35.450

what your purposes but it is included in this particular resume and the resume got him the job.



93

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.570

So again kind of up to you.



94

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.260

Different recruiters are going to have different opinions on it.



95

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:45.200

In my opinion you don't need some sort of profile or purpose of statement of just two lines.



96

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.040

It's kind of just taking up space here.



97

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.600

But if he needs a little bit of filler go ahead and put it in there.



98

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.080

Up next should be your recent work experience.



99

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:58.570

And if you're still coming out out of education so maybe you just finished your undergrad and you don't



100

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:04.330

actually have work experience then just label this experience kind of save yourself there a little bit



101

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:05.380

of terminology.



102

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:12.610

And usually you're going to want to have the position some sort of description of where it was actually



103

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:12.820

at.



104

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:17.550

So maybe the company name and then clearly formatted dates that you were there.



105

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:23.140

So different experience and the description using usually just three bullet points or three sentences



106

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:26.580

of what you did each particular work experience position.



107

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:32.540

You can see here there's different examples that you're going to want to describe your technical skills.



108

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:37.810

Now technical skills this may be something you want to edit a little bit the pending on the actual company



109

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:43.780

or actual position for example if you're just going for a basic data and out analyst position things



110

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:48.400

like machine Lowney of classification or regression clustering cetera since those are pretty vague terms



111

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.670

that would be ok.



112

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:54.730

However if you're applying for a position maybe you're applying a Netflix and there's a very specific



113

00:07:55.300 --> 00:08:01.090

machine learning engineer position for recommendation systems you may want to go in a little more detail



114

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:06.370

about the actual machine learning techniques you know maybe know a specific recommender system techniques



115

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:10.740

and you want to clarify that in your resume for particular job positions.



116

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:16.860

So again it's OK to have these more generalized terms but if you're focused on a position where they're



117

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:22.690

going to be looking for clear aspects based off what the position posting said you might want to include



118

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:25.880

that here softer in programming languages you should always include that.



119

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:30.630

And I think this format is really good where you include the language and then include the libraries



120

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:33.400

kind of attach the language that you're already familiar with.



121

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:38.020

Some people like to separate these actually really like the formatting of the main language and then



122

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:42.800

here are the various libraries associated with Python that the recruiter may be looking for.



123

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:46.180

Our sequel Hadoop and then things related to do.



124

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.900

Etc. and selected coursework.



125

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:53.890

I would actually not recommend this unless you're fresh out of undergrad depending on how long you've



126

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:55.240

been out of undergrad.



127

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:59.870

You may not need to worry about some of this stuff but again it really depends of the position.



128

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:05.040

The position is clearly asking for someone with a background in statistics or math then this is great.



129

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:08.120

Add in as far as what knowledge you have available.



130

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:14.740

As far as your coursework is concerned that you have education you can see here college and get a Ph.D.



131

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:17.620

but left the program later on honors and awards.



132

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:22.150

These are great to include especially if you're just coming out of college and then select presentations.



133

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:24.540

Maybe you don't have any presentations that you given.



134

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:30.700

Then instead you have selected projects recone link to your projects other side projects that you've



135

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.260

worked on etc..



136

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:36.130

Ok so definitely check out the resources for this example resumes.



137

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:39.060

You can check it out yourself and maybe even use it as a model.



138

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:40.660

Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture.
