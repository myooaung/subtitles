Welcome to interview question number four for probability theory.

2
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,700
All right this question is a little more involved.

3
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:16,140
So let's take it slowly and explain the entire situation.

4
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,140
Let's imagine that you have two jars.

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:22,570
So there's a table sitting with two empty jars on top of it.

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,630
Then you have 50 red marbles and 50 blue marbles.

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,800
So someone hands you a bag with 50 red marbles in another bag with 50 blue marbles and it's up to you

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:37,010
to place all the marbles into the jars in whatever distribution you want such that when you blindly

9
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:43,040
or randomly pick one marble out of one jar you maximize the chances that the marble you ended up choosing

10
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,160
was red.

11
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:50,060
So let's actually break this down a little bit to fully analyze the situation.

12
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:56,440
So again you're given 50 blue marbles and 50 red marbles and there's two jars on this table.

13
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:01,700
So it's up to you to distribute the marbles into the jars however you want.

14
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:08,890
The rule is you have to place all the marbles in a jar so you they a marble has to be inside a jar so

15
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,150
you can place them however you prefer.

16
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:15,980
And then what's going to happen is when you Bliley pick your first going to randomly pick a jar.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,390
So to give you a hint the odds of any jar being picked is 50 percent right because we're randomly choosing

18
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:29,050
between two jars and the next step is that you randomly stick your hand in that jar and pick out a marble.

19
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:35,770
So the question is what's the best way to distribute these collection of 100 marbles 50 below 50 read

20
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,750
between the two jars to maximize your chance of choosing red.

21
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:41,670
OK.

22
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:45,150
If you have any questions on this one because it's a little bit more complicated of a setup.

23
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,630
Please feel free to post the Q&amp;A forums.

24
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,820
I'll see you at the solutions.
