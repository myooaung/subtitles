Hello everyone and welcome to the solution for probability question number nine.



2

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.670

And for this question Alice has two kids and one of them was a girl.



3

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.330

What's the probability that the other child is also a girl and you can assume that there's an equal



4

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.960

number of males and females in the world.



5

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.110

Basically you can just interpret that to mean that the odds of having a girl are 0.5 Sam is the odds



6

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.020

of having a boy.



7

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:33.610

So if a person has two children the possibilities of the children are when it goes to first born and



8

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.550

second born it's boy boy girl girl boy girl.



9

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:37.550

Or girl boy.



10

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.790

However you know there's already at least one girl.



11

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.170

So then the options that you have are boy girl girl boy or girl girl.



12

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:52.600

Meaning that if you know Alice already has a daughter then you have a one third chance that she has



13

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.690

another daughter of girl girl so kind of a simple solution here.



14

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.900

But you had to figure out that trick that there's four possibilities but then you narrow one down because



15

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.250

boy boy cannot occur because you know Alice already has a daughter.



16

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.420

Meaning the fact that she has a one third chance of having another daughter because the likelihood is



17

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.580

two thirds that she had another boy.



18

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.400

OK thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
