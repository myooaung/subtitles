00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.540

Welcome everyone to the course of the Course overview lecture.



2

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.500

If you could do me a small favor please don't skip this lecture.



3

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.580

We're going to talk about a lot of really important things especially the guidebook which is a really



4

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.730

fundamental part of this course and it's going to help you a lot in your studies to become a data scientist.



5

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.730

So let's get started.



6

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.070

We're going to talk about quickly the course curriculum where to get the resources how to get help during



7

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.520

the course.



8

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.020

And the best approach for taking the course as well as be walking you through the guidebook that goes



9

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.270

along this course.



10

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.590

So first off just very quickly with the course curriculum is we'll discuss it in the very next lecture



11

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.950

again.



12

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.810

But basically there's a non-technical section talking about things like data science careers positions



13

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:44.590

and titles.



14

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:45.960

What knowledge you're going to need.



15

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.410

Then there's also non-technical stuff like how best to prepare your resume what to expect during the



16

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.310

interview process how to negotiate offers etc..



17

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.690

So that's kind of like the first I would say third of the course and then really the bulk of the course



18

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.370

is the technical interview questions.



19

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.810

So these are where you're giving a technical interview a question and then you're given an answer.



20

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:09.970

So there's other topics like probability statistics machine learning design experiments coding product



21

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.960

design metrics etc. So that's how the Course is basically split up.



22

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.640

You can feel free to jump around it's pretty modular.



23

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.220

So as you just mentioned Feel free to jump around the section's course designed to be modular so you



24

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.390

can approach however you want.



25

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.140

Some people prefer to do the technical stuff first and then jump to the non-technical.



26

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.930

Some people like it the other way around.



27

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.590

Really it's totally up to you how you approach this course.



28

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.710

It's designed to be as modular as possible.



29

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.810

Now the most important resource for you in this course is the guidebook that basically goes along with



30

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.090

every single lecture in this course.



31

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:47.660

So it's basically has a bunch of really useful links that relate to every topic we discuss.



32

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.370

So let's explore the guidebook.



33

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.570

The guidebook is a resource link in this lecture.



34

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.210

So as you're viewing this luxury is seen some little pop up saying there's resource for this lecture.



35

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.630

If not you can go to number three frequently ask questions.



36

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.620

There's another link but it's basically a Google document with a lot of useful stuff.



37

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.830

So let's go to that google doc and show you what the guidebook really is.



38

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:07.070

All right.



39

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.530

When you click on that link you should see something that looks like this.



40

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.660

Basically the data science career interview prep guide.



41

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.810

And if you scroll down you'll eventually see a table of contents and you also see the outline list here



42

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.830

on the left.



43

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.700

The pending What browser are using you may or may not see it or you may actually click X but don't worry



44

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.770

that table contents is also right here.



45

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.320

And basically what's really nice about this is that it has a bunch of fundamental resource links that



46

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.690

we discussed during the lectures.



47

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.200

So a lot of times during a lecture you'll hear you'll hear me say check out the guidebook.



48

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.250

Check out the resources there.



49

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.770

Check out the links and this is what I'm referring to.



50

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.880

So let's imagine that you're on data science positions and titles lecture you can come over here to



51

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.520

data science positions and titles.



52

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.300

Click on it and it will bring you down here to data science positions and titles.



53

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.580

And here has various links that are helpful such as a large list of various job titles and then in another



54

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.260

lecture we talk about higher education whether thought whether it's necessary not to have a Master's



55

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.780

Degree or a graduate degree.



56

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.200

There are other links there and other opinions on higher education etc. so that you can see here there's



57

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.890

lots of useful links when we get down to the actual technical interview preparation part.



58

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.800

So for example the very first section is on probability if we go back down there to probability slides



59

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.310

you'll end up seeing that each of these technical sections has its own header so we have probability



60

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.480

theory resources.



61

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.360

The very first link for each of these is going to be the slides.



62

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.980

So if you click on this link we'll go ahead and open this link in a new tab.



63

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.240

So we'll go ahead and click on it.



64

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:33.480

They'll open a new tab.



65

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.240

But basically here we can see the probability theory interview questions.



66

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:43.460

Now the way we approach it in the video course we're going to present one interview question then a



67

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.790

solution than an interview question than a solution.



68

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.400

Sometimes people prefer to see all the interview questions at first and then go through the solutions.



69

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.860

So if you prefer to see all the interview questions first then what you can do is come over here to



70

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.900

the slide show and you can see here there's interview question of one immediately followed by Interview



71

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.900

Question number two as again just a quick reminder during the video course once we show interview question



72

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.150

number one we're going to immediately show the solution if you prefer the method of seeing all the interview



73

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.230

questions first.



74

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.830

Make sure you approach the slides which kind of has it built like that.



75

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:24.000

We try to balance this out because some students like to see interview question solution interview question



76

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.650

solution other students like to just see all the questions first then all the solutions.



77

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:35.720

So depending on what style of learning you prefer you have either the slides or the videos or both to



78

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.250

help you out that way.



79

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:42.260

So as you go down the slides eventually as you go through the interview questions you'll see a slide



80

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.790

here that says solutions solutions are up next solutions.



81

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.210

The question number one to give you enough warning that the solution lies are coming and these slides.



82

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.830

We go over them in the video.



83

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.240

Now let's say we're going through a solution on probability question number one and we want the resource



84

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.480

links that go with that.



85

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.180

So for example the question of one consecutive coin flip.



86

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.380

There's little nicknames given every question.



87

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:08.660

You can see here a bunch of useful links that are appropriate for that question in the probability section



88

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.090

in the course in the videos the lectures themselves are just titled simply question number one question



89

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.950

number two.



90

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.760

If you go to the guidebook you can see here there's a little bit of a description as far as what the



91

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.240

questions pertain to.



92

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.960

So for example it's Question number one.



93

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.170

It had to do something about raining in Seattle.



94

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:31.010

So if you've gone through that question and you kind of remember how to do something raining in Seattle



95

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.720

you can come to the guidebook search for Seattle and you'll probably find what question we talking about.



96

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:36.240

OK.



97

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.630

So that's the guidebook really really useful.



98

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.290

We're going to be referencing it all the time during the course.



99

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:46.610

So this is something that's basically going to be your study tool for the entire course.



100

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:47.170

All right.



101

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.320

Now we discuss the guidebook.



102

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.230

Let's quickly go up and finish our presentation.



103

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.830

All right we're back.



104

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.300

We just explored the guidebook.



105

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.580

Let's go ahead and finish off this lecture.



106

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.330

So the next thing I want to cover is how to get help during the course.



107

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.400

If you're ever facing any sort of technical issues or platform issues things like the video is taking



108

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.810

a long time to load.



109

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:10.610

Or are you having issues giving a comment or posting issues just platform issues in general.



110

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.620

Please e-mail support at you to me dot com.



111

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.510

Actually don't control the platform so there's not much I can be able to help you with there.



112

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.610

But if you send e-mail to them or go to the support page and open up a ticket directly.



113

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.910

The friendly folks that to me are going to be happy to help you out.



114

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.780

Again I can't really help you out with video buffering issues.



115

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.020

Please e-mail support to me dot com and they're happy to help you there.



116

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:35.540

If you have questions related to the course this is the pathway I would recommend approaching to get



117

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.150

the answer to your question as fast as possible.



118

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:42.410

Honestly I would just do a quick Google search first because a lot of other people have probably had



119

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:47.600

the same question as you and posted it on some sort of stack overflow or stack exchange forum and you



120

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.910

can quickly find an answer that way if you're still having trouble with whatever question then I would



121

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.290

suggest do a search in the guidebook.



122

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:55.250

Check out the research links.



123

00:06:55.250 --> 00:07:00.290

There are a lot of them are made to kind of preemptively answer questions that may pop up if you still



124

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:01.560

haven't found the answer.



125

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:04.490

Do do me a favor do a quick search in the Q&amp;A forums.



126

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:09.140

A lot of people often have the same questions so you can do a search in the Q&amp;A forums and talk to other



127

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.870

students who have had the same question that may have already been previously answered by me.



128

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:17.840

If you do all that and still there's no answer to your question feel free to post the Q&amp;A forums and



129

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.110

either I or the t.a will be happy to help you out.



130

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:26.740

As a quick note we can't personally help you with current interviews due to some non-disclosure agreements



131

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.530

that were allowed us to actually create this course.



132

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:33.580

You can feel free to post interview questions that you've been stuck on for other students to help collaborate



133

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:34.110

on.



134

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:39.380

But again we personally cannot help you on your interviews that goes against some agreements we've made.



135

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.350

Some other quick notes you can change the playback speed.



136

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:47.830

So for going too slow for you or too fast you can click on a little gear box in the video.



137

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:53.350

You can either slow it down or speed it up and you can also change the video streaming quality.



138

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:56.380

Also if you want to download the videos you can use that you did the app to do that.



139

00:07:56.470 --> 00:08:00.970

And as I just mentioned all slides are linked to in the guidebooks are really the guidebook has everything



140

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:01.620

you need.



141

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:06.140

Finally I want to discuss the best way to approach the course.



142

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:11.660

Really what this course is it starts off non-technical very brief overviews of how you can approach



143

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:16.460

data science interviews and a data science career in general and then really what the meat of the Course



144

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:16.850

is.



145

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:21.710

It's a list of real example interview questions sourced from real companies and then the solutions to



146

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:25.940

those questions are a lot of times the research that I've seen on line they just provide interview questions



147

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:27.240

with no real solutions.



148

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:30.920

So we try to actually add in solutions to these interview questions.



149

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:35.030

Keep in mind you're really going to need to do extensive self-study to prepare for any data science



150

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:40.440

interview the interview questions are real questions from Silicon Valley tech companies companies like



151

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.750

Google Facebook Air B and B.



152

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:47.550

So you can expect them to be extremely challenging these data science questions can be some of the hardest



153

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:52.770

questions you've ever faced in an interview setting and to be honest if I just went and called on a



154

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:56.770

lot of these questions without having studied beforehand I probably would not do that well.



155

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.210

And I do data science all the time.



156

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:04.560

So really expect these questions to be really challenging and you're going to need to really prep a



157

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.370

lot for your data science interviews.



158

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:09.260

So if you're facing questions and you find them really really hard.



159

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:11.060

Don't worry that's totally normal.



160

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.150

And finally a huge thank you for enrolling in this course.



161

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:16.750
