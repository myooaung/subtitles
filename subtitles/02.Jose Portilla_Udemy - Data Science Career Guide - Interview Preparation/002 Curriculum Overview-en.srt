00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,930
Welcome everyone to this quick lecture we're going to give an overview of the curriculum for this course.

2
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,850
So we're going to go over the curriculum that way you can decide what section you want to jump in.

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,790
The sections are modular so you can either go through the course from the beginning all the way to the

4
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:26,100
end or you can just jump into whatever point you feel most interested in.

5
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,310
So let's start off with the basic overview of the course.

6
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:34,810
We start off with three sections that are non-technical sections that talk a little bit more about a

7
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:40,750
high level overview of what it's like to start the day to science interview process a little bit more

8
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,160
information about data science careers in general.

9
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,160
So the first section is just the data science career overview there we talk about things like Why choose

10
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,740
a career in data science the interdisciplinary aspect the data science different positions and titles

11
00:00:53,740 --> 00:01:00,070
that are in data science fields as well as thoughts on higher education and it's value to those positions.

12
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:05,690
They will continue on to the interview preparation section to a science interview preparation.

13
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,840
That section is actually still not technical.

14
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:13,450
What it involves is talking about what technical tools you should know what theory should know things

15
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:18,280
about machine learning different software that may be useful to you and how to know when you're ready

16
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,660
to begin the interview process in general.

17
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:27,010
After that we have our last section that's not technical which is just an overview of what to expect

18
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,960
for the data science interview process.

19
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,600
These are things like how to prepare your resume what the interview pipeline is like how to land interviews

20
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:37,960
and if everything goes well how you negotiate offers.

21
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:43,750
After that we have the main part of this course which is the interview questions and solutions or answers

22
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:44,580
to them.

23
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:49,240
So that actually has several sections to it and that's really the bulk of this course.

24
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:53,410
So the interview questions and answers we have tons of topics for you we have questions on probability

25
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:57,570
theory statistics product analysis and business metrics working of data.

26
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:01,270
Q Well coding questions machine learning and design of experiments.

27
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:07,510
Now keep in mind certain sections are very technical and they're either right or wrong answers to things

28
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:13,120
like probability theory statistics work and if they do a fescue Well there are going to be kind of the

29
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,810
questions that there's only really one correct way to get back a correct answer for other things like

30
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,230
product analysis and business metrics or design of experiments.

31
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:29,230
There are going to be much more freeflow questions so we'll discuss kind of a higher level overview

32
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,440
how you can approach those type of questions.

33
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:37,140
But keep in mind a lot of those questions don't have one particular right answer the way a math question

34
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:43,120
like one plus one equals two is instead a lot of times in the interview process for a data scientist.

35
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,520
You'll be presented with just kind of a basic product idea and then you'll be asked to come of some

36
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:55,000
metrics some experiment design some models ideas etc. on how do we evaluate that new product or business

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,460
idea.

38
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,670
So some of these questions are a little more open.

39
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:02,320
Some of them are going to be a little more close to try to reflect the rerolled situation of what to

40
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,320
expect in a data science interview.

41
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,780
So that's really the bulk of the Course here.

42
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,780
Now I want to be clear about what this course is not.

43
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:14,650
This course is not an overview that's going to actually teach you probability coding statistics or machine

44
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,400
learning.

45
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,880
Instead we're really only providing questions and solutions for those topics.

46
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:25,060
Now we do provide a lot of great resources that if you want to review those topics and learn more about

47
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,260
them like probability and statistics we're machine learning will have plenty of links you to check out.

48
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,560
But the Course itself cannot teach the entirety of data science in just one course I do have other courses

49
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:40,480
that are really great fits for learning about coding or machine learning or probability or statistics

50
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,950
and we'll also link those as well so you can expect tons of resources tons of leaks as you go through

51
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:45,420
this course.

52
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:49,750
But I want to be clear this course is definitely not going to be able to teach you all of this.

53
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:54,820
Instead of really only provide the questions the solutions for those topics expect you to learn them

54
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:55,530
elsewhere.

55
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:57,270
OK.

56
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,240
Let's get started.

57
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:59,300
I'll see at the next lecture.
