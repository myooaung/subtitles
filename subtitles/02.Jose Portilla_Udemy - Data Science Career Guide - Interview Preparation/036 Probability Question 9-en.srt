Welcome to interview question number nine for probability theory here's the question.

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,090
Let's say Alice has two kids and one of them is a girl.

3
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,470
What is the probability that the other child that she has is also a girl.

4
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:25,950
In this case you can assume that there are an equal number of males and females in the world.

5
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:32,240
That means that the probability of being a girl or a boy in this world is 0.5 for either one.

6
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,050
Best of luck and I'll see at the solutions.
