Welcome to interview question number four for product design and metrics so same situation here were

2
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:16,330
Google released that new version of their search algorithm did some may be testing engineers realized

3
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:19,360
that the new algorithm was returning less relevant results.

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:23,800
The two things that were occurring was there were more queries in the treatment group as well as advertising

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,320
revenue was higher in the treatment group.

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,290
So given the situation the next question is since the less relevant algorithm resulted in higher advertising

7
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:39,640
revenue should it be implemented anyways so kind of to reword that even though we have a search algorithm

8
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,590
that new algorithms returning less relevant results when we tested it with the treatment group it was

9
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:48,280
performing with higher advertising and people were making more searches.

10
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,170
So should you implement to anyway's.

11
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:51,650
All right.

12
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,860
Best of luck and I'll see you at a solution.
