Welcome everyone to the solution for the second probability interview question for this question it



2

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.520

asks What is the probability of rolling a total sum of four with two dice.



3

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.580

So let's go ahead and look at all the ways you could roll two dice and what their sums would be.



4

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.600

We can see here that we have the possible sums to through 12 and if we take a look at the possibilities



5

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.870

for four we see that there's essentially three ways of rolling a 4 1 3 3 1 and 2 2.



6

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:42.050

So there are 36 total ways that the dice can be thrown the ways that can add up to 4 are basically three



7

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.700

ways 1 3 2 2 and 3 1 which gives us 3 over 36.



8

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.850

So the probability that you end up rolling a sum of four for two dice is one over 12.



9

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.580

That should have been pretty straightforward.



10

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.150

If not go ahead and check out the guidebook for extra resources on that.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.930

Thanks and I'll see at the next lecture.
