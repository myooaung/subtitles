Welcome everyone to this lecture on theory knowledge we've already discussed the technical tools of

2
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:15,890
the trade such as programming languages and software tools but general knowledge of the core concepts

3
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:20,870
about data science and the mathematics behind it are actually even more important than the software

4
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:22,210
tools used.

5
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:28,610
Let's cover some of the key concepts you should know when applying sort and begin by discussing some

6
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:32,110
of the more basic methodical topics you should understand and keep in mind.

7
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,810
Few people are complete experts in all of these.

8
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,290
You're going to constantly be learning more on the job as well.

9
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,250
You should just have a general understanding of the basics of these topics.

10
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,880
So some of the mathematical topics you should have an understanding of when applied to data science

11
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:52,460
positions are things like calculus linear algebra probability theory as well as statistics such as a

12
00:00:52,450 --> 00:01:00,260
typical inference and distributions and also descriptive statistics things like means of standard deviations.

13
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,670
Now there are specific mathematical topics that you may need to know depending on what position or what

14
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,050
company are playing to.

15
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:11,510
So social network companies such as LinkedIn or Facebook really want to check they have a good understanding

16
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,490
of graph and network analysis.

17
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:16,580
Sometimes those topics aren't so important for other companies.

18
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:24,050
Companies that do things such as heavy advertisement testing or AB testing on Web sites are once you

19
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:29,020
are going to test your knowledge base in statistics and AB testing in general.

20
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:33,960
So definitely check out the research links for great online resources for these topics.

21
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:39,320
And as a reminder again few people are an expert in all of these topics they the science is definitely

22
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,260
an interdisciplinary field.

23
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:46,940
You just have a general understanding enough so that you can know where to look things up when you need

24
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,940
to dive into these individual topics deeper.

25
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,350
Thanks and I'll see at the next lecture.
