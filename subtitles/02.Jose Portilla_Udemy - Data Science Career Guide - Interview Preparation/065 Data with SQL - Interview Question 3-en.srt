00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:10,070
Welcome back to interview question number three for working with Dedo with Escudo.

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,050
So again it's another question of what's wrong this query.

3
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:18,950
The query is select to use or ID then average function on total as average order total from invoices

4
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,120
having count on order ID greater than or equal to 1.

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,210
So again what's wrong with this query.

6
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,600
Go ahead and pause the screen.

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,060
Think about this query.

8
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,840
Figure out what's wrong with it.

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,900
I'll see at the next lecture or we go over the solution.
