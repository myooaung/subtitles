00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:05,990
Welcome back.

2
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:07,080
For question number four.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,110
In these statistics interview section.

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,590
So this question has a little bit of setup.

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:16,570
It first begins with a new medical test for a virus being created.

6
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:22,140
Now over the entire population 1 percent of the population has the virus.

7
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:23,620
With this medical test.

8
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:27,580
Ninety nine percent of sick people with the virus will test positive.

9
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,630
That is they test positive indicating that they have the virus.

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,380
So ninety nine percent of people who actually have the virus and are sick with it test positive using

11
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,740
this new medical test.

12
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,140
Ninety nine percent of healthy individuals test negative for the virus.

13
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,330
Now here's the question.

14
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:48,740
If you grab the patient not knowing whether or not they had a virus and you administered this new medical

15
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:53,540
test and they tested positive what is the probability that they have the virus.

16
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,320
Given what you know so far.

17
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,800
So you know that overall 1 percent of the population has the virus.

18
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,700
Ninety nine percent of sick people have the virus test positive and 99 percent of healthy individuals

19
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,260
test negative for the virus.

20
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,640
So if you took a patient and they happened to test positive what is the actual probability that they

21
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,790
have the virus.

22
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,570
This is a very common question.

23
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,850
So best of luck and make sure you understand the solution for it.

24
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,010
If you weren't able to get it on your first try I'll see the solution.
