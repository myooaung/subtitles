00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.570

Welcome back everyone to the solution for interview questions.



2

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.490

Three in the product design metrics category.



3

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.210

We're still dealing with this new search algorithm that produces less relevant results.



4

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.240

And now the question was What do you think caused the new algorithm to generate more advertising revenue.



5

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.040

Even though the results were less relevant.



6

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.260

So there's definitely two main things to cover here.



7

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:32.650

And the first one is that we already know more searches are being conducted and just on that alone regardless



8

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:38.500

of whether or not the algorithm is producing less relevant results the fact that we're doing more searches



9

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.940

in general since advertisements are served along with every news search.



10

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.080

There are just more opportunities in general for users to click on an advertisement.



11

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.700

So this in itself is not directly related to the fact that there are less relevant results.



12

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.290

It's just the fact that if more people are doing more searches that means more advertisements are being



13

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.600

served if more advertisements are being served.



14

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.400

You're probably going to produce more advertising revenue.



15

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:07.050

But now let's focus on the fact that the results were less relevant in this new algorithm.



16

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.340

So the Another possibility is that the search algorithm is different than the algorithm used display



17

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:19.060

advertisements so maybe Google has won an algorithm for what's actually return based off your search



18

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.710

results.



19

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.110

And another algorithm for what advertisements to serve you.



20

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.690

And in that case what could be happening is that the advertisements themselves may actually be more



21

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.190

relevant than the search results.



22

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:36.220

Also causing more advertising clicks and in return resulting in more advertising revenue.



23

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.510

So the two main things to consider here are the fact that since you're doing more searches there's just



24

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.400

going to be more opportunities to get advertising revenue because the ads are served along with every



25

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.310

search result.



26

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:53.170

And the second interesting possibility is that the advertising algorithm and the ads themselves end



27

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.510

up being more relevant than the search results causing more people to click on them thus resulting in



28

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.520

higher advertising revenues.



29

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.990

Again this is not the only possible possible correct answer but it's just something to consider.



30

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.140

OK thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
