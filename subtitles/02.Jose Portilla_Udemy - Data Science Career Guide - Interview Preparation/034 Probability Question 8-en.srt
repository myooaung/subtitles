Welcome to interview question number eight for probability theory the question is let's imagine that

2
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:17,220
you're given a biased coin with a probability of greater than 0.5 for heads.

3
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,600
So has a great 50 percent chance of landing on heads.

4
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,970
The question is how could you simulate a fair coin given this biased coin.

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:31,310
So again in general words how do you simulate a fair coin given only access to a biased coin.

6
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:36,330
Now this is actually a really tricky problem and I've seen it asked in Google interviews.

7
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,270
Best of luck at the solutions.
