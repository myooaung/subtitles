Welcome back to the solution for probability question number three.

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,790
So here are the questions a little different than the previous one.

3
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:18,120
It was what is the probability of rolling at least one four with two dice.

4
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,830
So let's think about this for at least one dice.

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:26,570
We need to think about which combinations are in the form either 4 and then some other roll some of

6
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:31,260
the roll and then four or you can get four or four.

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:36,290
So if we take a look at all the possible ways of rolling dice we end up realizing that when looking

8
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:39,890
for those combinations where either one of the dice the first one is a.

9
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,780
The second one is a four or both of them happened to be fours.

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:49,280
There's eventually 11 possible ways so that the answer is then 11 out of 36 probability that you end

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,540
up rolling a four Thanks and I'll see at the next lecture.
