Hello everyone and welcome to interview question number two for sequel.

2
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,000
And the solution for it.

3
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:15,340
So the question was was wrong this query here we can see we're selecting two columns idea and trial

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:19,210
date from the payments table and we're seeing grouped by ID.

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,840
So it's the actual issue.

6
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:24,520
Well there's no aggregate function on the trial date column.

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:29,400
There needs to be some sort of aggregate function on a column that's not in the GROUP BY statement.

8
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:34,680
Otherwise it doesn't really make sense what to return as far as a sequel statement is concerned.

9
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:39,490
And the other thing to think about that makes this even more obvious is that typically you're actually

10
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:44,140
going to be grouping by the date column instead of having it as another column because there aren't

11
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:49,780
a whole lot of ways where you can sort of aggregate data together especially if they're individual time

12
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:50,520
stamps.

13
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:51,850
So just keep that in mind.

14
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:56,320
You always need to either have an aggregate function on the columns you're calling when you're using

15
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,470
a GROUP BY statement or the column itself that needs to be inside the GROUP BY statement.

16
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:01,910
OK.

17
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:03,520
Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture.
