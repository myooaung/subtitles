00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,500
Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,950
This lecture on machine learning knowledge most state of science rules are going to require you to understand

3
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:18,810
the various aspects of machine learning to some degree especially roles that have the word data scientist

4
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,890
or data science or product science or product analysis in them.

5
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,850
Now certain rules like a machine learning engineer are really going to be focusing on these concepts

6
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,910
both theoretically and in implementation and application.

7
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:36,620
So this ask us what different general topics you should be aware of and have an understanding of you

8
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:41,240
should understand what supervised learning is and how it's different than unsupervised learning or how

9
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,020
it's different than reinforcement learning.

10
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,710
And we should also understand the core algorithms of supervised learning things like linear regression

11
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:56,070
logistic regression support vector machines ran the forest came nearest neighbors accepter.

12
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:01,070
Then you should also understand unsupervised learning and how it's different than supervised learning

13
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:06,830
how it doesn't require a label a should understand the main algorithms surrounding unsupervised learning

14
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:13,160
things like Kamins clustering principal component analysis that Minch Naledi reduction ex cetera and

15
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:19,280
then depending on what different types of job positions you're applying for you may want to know about

16
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,290
specialized machine learning fields such as an LP or a natural language processing.

17
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:29,180
So if you notice that the opposition is going to be working with text data a lot you'll definitely want

18
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,420
to have the general principles of natural language processing down.

19
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,550
And then you also want to understand just things that relate to machine learning in general regardless

20
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:44,430
of what learning you're using things like model validation or K Foldes cross-validation etc..

21
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,430
So you're going to want to understand these basic concepts things like bhai's various tradeoff in the

22
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:55,330
sense the difference between L1 and L2 regularisation and regularisation school is in general.

23
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:00,260
And then maybe you'll also want to understand Bagni and boosting and how it relates to certain machine

24
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:04,300
learning algorithms such as decision trees or random force.

25
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:07,760
So you can definitely check out the extra resources we have linked to this lecture.

26
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,130
If you want different sources for learning this sort of material.

27
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,890
Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture.
