Welcome to probability question number six.

2
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,660
And the solution for it.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,510
So just to go over the question real quick again.

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:12,820
You're given a fair coin.

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,750
On average how many flips would you need to get two heads in a row really similar to the first question

6
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,170
and our probability set.

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:24,570
Our specifically only wanting two heads two tails won't cut it either.

8
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,950
So is actually lots of ways to solve this.

9
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:31,000
A general solving for any number of heads in a row is more challenging.

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,180
But since we only care about two heads in a row specifically it's going to be a little easier.

11
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:41,000
If you want more resources on the general solve for kind of the nth toss of two heads in a row you can

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,530
check out the guidebook for resource links.

13
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:47,160
But for now we'll focus on the actual probability question that was asked.

14
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,710
So keep in mind our falling method is not generalized.

15
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,310
It only works for two heads in a row.

16
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:59,160
So we'll go ahead and say let the expected number of coin flips be defined by the term X..

17
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,580
So in the case analysis is going to go as follows.

18
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:08,480
If the first flip is it tails the already wasted 1 flip because you're looking for specifically two

19
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,890
heads in a row.

20
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:15,440
And we know the probability of this event occurring of the first flip being tails is one half and the

21
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:22,580
total number of flips required is going to be X plus 1 because he basically just wasted a flip.

22
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,450
So the first flip is a heads and then the second flip is a tails.

23
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,070
Then you just wasted two flips because that tails basically blocks that first flip of heads from being

24
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:37,680
used and the probability of this event occurring is one fourth and the total number of flips required.

25
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,110
Now after this is going to be X plus two

26
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,730
if the first flip is ahead and the second flip is also heads then you're actually done.

27
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,860
So the probability of this event occurring is 1 2 or 4.

28
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,800
So the total number required for this particular event was to.

29
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,040
Adding these all up into the expectation equation allows us to do this sum.

30
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:06,500
You get 1 1/2 times expl one plus one fourth times x plus two plus one fourth times two.

31
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,620
And for this result we're getting two heads in a row we end up seeing the expect the number of flips

32
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,650
is going to be equal to six.

33
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:18,150
And if you're a little hazy on the expectation equation make sure to check the guidebook for resources.

34
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,580
They'll explain it to you.

35
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,120
All right thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
