Welcome to interview question number seven for probability theory OK here's the question.

2
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,270
Let's imagine you're given 10 coins and out of those 10 coins nine are fair coins.

3
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,470
But one of them is biased.

4
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:25,040
You were told that the biased coin has a probability of greater than 0.5 to be heads.

5
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,140
So overall when you're flipping that coin there's a greater than 50 percent chance of it being heads.

6
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,200
So it's biased.

7
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,360
The other nine are fair coins.

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,060
Let's imagine that you randomly grab a coin flip it three times and you end up getting heads heads tails

9
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,620
or h h t.

10
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,560
The question is based on that fact.

11
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,290
What is the probability that you flipped the biased coin.

12
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:51,120
So in other words was the probability that when you randomly grab the coin it ended up being the biased

13
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,710
one based on the fact that you flipped heads heads tails.

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,560
All right.

15
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,380
Best of luck.

16
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,500
I'll see you at the solutions.
