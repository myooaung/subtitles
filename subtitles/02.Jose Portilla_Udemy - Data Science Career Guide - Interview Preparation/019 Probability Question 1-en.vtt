Welcome everyone to your first interview question for the probability theory section.



2

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:12.730

Here's your question.



3

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.260

Let's imagine that you're given a fair coin a fair coin meaning that there's the same probability of



4

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:24.080

being heads or tails or 50 percent chance of being heads 50 percent chance of being tails once you flip



5

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.870

it.



6

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.530

The question is on average how many flips would you need to get two of the same flip in a row.



7

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.530

That is how many times are you going to have to flip it on average to either get two heads in a row



8

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.960

or two tails in a row just any two of the same.



9

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:40.540

OK.



10

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.640

Best of luck or see at the solutions.
