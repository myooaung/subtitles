00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:03.001
- [Instructor] Before we start using GitHub Flow,

2
00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:04.007
we'll need to make some changes

3
00:00:04.007 --> 00:00:07.000
to our team's shared repository,

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.009
that way it will support our new workflow.

5
00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:13.004
So within GitHub, let's click on the Branches tab,

6
00:00:13.004 --> 00:00:15.003
and here we can see the branches

7
00:00:15.003 --> 00:00:17.008
currently in our repository.

8
00:00:17.008 --> 00:00:20.004
You'll notice that it includes a develop,

9
00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:23.003
a hotfix and a release branch,

10
00:00:23.003 --> 00:00:26.007
which were branches that we used in Gitflow.

11
00:00:26.007 --> 00:00:31.001
Since GitHub Flow only has one long lived branch, main,

12
00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:33.005
we'll need to delete these other branches

13
00:00:33.005 --> 00:00:36.005
since they don't exist in this workflow.

14
00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:39.004
So let's start out by deleting our hotfix

15
00:00:39.004 --> 00:00:40.007
and release branch.

16
00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:43.009
All we need to do is click on the trashcan icon

17
00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:46.002
over here on the right side of the screen.

18
00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:49.001
So first, we'll delete the hotfix branch

19
00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:51.007
and then we'll delete the release branch.

20
00:00:51.007 --> 00:00:54.004
Now you'll notice that the icon

21
00:00:54.004 --> 00:00:57.003
to delete our develop branch is inactive.

22
00:00:57.003 --> 00:01:00.003
That's because we have branch protection roles applied

23
00:01:00.003 --> 00:01:01.007
on the branch.

24
00:01:01.007 --> 00:01:05.006
So let's go into the settings for our repository,

25
00:01:05.006 --> 00:01:08.004
and if we navigate to the branches section,

26
00:01:08.004 --> 00:01:11.001
we can delete those branch protection roles

27
00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:13.009
on the develop branch.

28
00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:15.004
You might need to authenticate

29
00:01:15.004 --> 00:01:17.009
in order to delete these roles.

30
00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.002
Alright, now we can see that the branch protection roles

31
00:01:21.002 --> 00:01:25.002
are removed, so let's head back to our code,

32
00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:27.003
and if we look at the branches,

33
00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:30.007
you'll see that we can now delete our develop branch.

34
00:01:30.007 --> 00:01:34.000
Let's go ahead and do that.

35
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.004
So with these changes,

36
00:01:35.004 --> 00:01:39.003
our repository is now set up to support GitHub Flow.

37
00:01:39.003 --> 00:01:42.003
Taking these other branches out of the equation

38
00:01:42.003 --> 00:01:45.000
is going to streamline our team's workflow,

39
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
which you'll see in the next lesson.
