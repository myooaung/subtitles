- [Instructor] Throughout the rest of the course,

2
00:00:02,003 --> 00:00:05,009
we're going to explore some popular Git workflows.

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:08,009
Some of these workflows will work better than others

4
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:10,009
in certain scenarios.

5
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:14,004
So you might be wondering how you'll know which workflow

6
00:00:14,004 --> 00:00:16,002
is best for your team.

7
00:00:16,002 --> 00:00:20,001
Well, it depends on a few characteristics of your team

8
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:22,002
and its development process.

9
00:00:22,002 --> 00:00:24,008
So let's talk through them.

10
00:00:24,008 --> 00:00:28,000
The first thing to consider is the size of the team

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,003
working on the code base, which in many cases is correlated

12
00:00:32,003 --> 00:00:34,007
with the size of the project.

13
00:00:34,007 --> 00:00:37,003
In a smaller team, it's easy to keep track

14
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:39,007
of what everyone else might be working on

15
00:00:39,007 --> 00:00:41,008
simply because there's less people

16
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:45,001
and fewer lines of communication between team members.

17
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:48,002
So in general, smaller teams can benefit

18
00:00:48,002 --> 00:00:50,004
from more streamlined workflows

19
00:00:50,004 --> 00:00:54,008
that use less branching or perhaps no branching at all.

20
00:00:54,008 --> 00:00:56,007
But as a team grows,

21
00:00:56,007 --> 00:01:00,007
the number of lines of communication increase drastically,

22
00:01:00,007 --> 00:01:02,008
and it's impossible to keep track

23
00:01:02,008 --> 00:01:04,008
of what everybody else is up to.

24
00:01:04,008 --> 00:01:07,008
For these teams, branching and pull requests

25
00:01:07,008 --> 00:01:10,006
become essential features of their workflow

26
00:01:10,006 --> 00:01:12,008
that help facilitate communication

27
00:01:12,008 --> 00:01:15,005
that might not occur without them.

28
00:01:15,005 --> 00:01:18,002
You'll also need to consider how frequently

29
00:01:18,002 --> 00:01:20,004
your team ships code.

30
00:01:20,004 --> 00:01:23,006
This is known as its release cadence.

31
00:01:23,006 --> 00:01:27,000
Teams with a slower release cadence might deploy their code

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,006
on a monthly or quarterly basis.

33
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:30,009
So for them,

34
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:34,008
having more long-lived branches might be acceptable.

35
00:01:34,008 --> 00:01:39,003
For teams that release daily or even several times per day,

36
00:01:39,003 --> 00:01:42,001
having long-lived branches can be a problem

37
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:44,001
because there isn't as much time

38
00:01:44,001 --> 00:01:47,000
to track what a particular branch contains,

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,004
and it can lead to merge conflicts.

40
00:01:50,004 --> 00:01:54,001
Finally, you'll also need to factor in how much automation

41
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:57,001
is built into your delivery process.

42
00:01:57,001 --> 00:02:01,001
More streamlined workflows depend heavily upon automation

43
00:02:01,001 --> 00:02:03,006
and advanced CI/CD pipelines

44
00:02:03,006 --> 00:02:07,007
that can safely build, verify, and deploy your software.

45
00:02:07,007 --> 00:02:10,002
If you don't have these in place,

46
00:02:10,002 --> 00:02:12,005
you're likely to encounter more issues

47
00:02:12,005 --> 00:02:14,007
if you choose to adopt a workflow

48
00:02:14,007 --> 00:02:18,006
that's designed to rapidly release new changes.

49
00:02:18,006 --> 00:02:21,002
These are some of the general considerations

50
00:02:21,002 --> 00:02:23,002
for choosing a workflow,

51
00:02:23,002 --> 00:02:27,000
but each project will be a little unique in its own way.

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,009
So make sure you consider situational factors

53
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:33,004
when selecting a workflow, and don't be afraid to pivot

54
00:02:33,004 --> 00:02:36,000
if something just isn't working.
