00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:02,004
- [Kevin Bowersox] Thanks for watching this course

2
00:00:02,004 --> 00:00:04,003
on Git Workflows.

3
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:05,006
Before we conclude,

4
00:00:05,006 --> 00:00:08,008
I want to highlight some other topics that you might explore

5
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:12,008
and provide you with information about my other courses.

6
00:00:12,008 --> 00:00:14,006
Now that you've learned about workflows

7
00:00:14,006 --> 00:00:16,007
your team can use with Git,

8
00:00:16,007 --> 00:00:19,006
I would recommend checking out two of my other courses

9
00:00:19,006 --> 00:00:21,005
related to the topic.

10
00:00:21,005 --> 00:00:23,008
The first is Git for Teams,

11
00:00:23,008 --> 00:00:26,006
which will provide you with some additional strategies

12
00:00:26,006 --> 00:00:30,005
your team can use to collaborate effectively with Git.

13
00:00:30,005 --> 00:00:31,005
During this course,

14
00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:34,008
we also touched on the need for strong automation

15
00:00:34,008 --> 00:00:37,000
with a CI/CD pipeline.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,007
If you're a Java developer,

17
00:00:38,007 --> 00:00:41,006
I can teach you how to put those pipelines in place

18
00:00:41,006 --> 00:00:43,003
in my LinkedIn Learning course,

19
00:00:43,003 --> 00:00:47,005
Continuous Delivery for Cloud Native Java Applications.

20
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,006
If you just like my teaching style,

21
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:53,001
I have a few other courses on the LinkedIn Learning platform

22
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:54,006
that might interest you.

23
00:00:54,006 --> 00:00:58,007
I can teach you about other topics like Microservices, APIs,

24
00:00:58,007 --> 00:01:03,001
Java Collections, Spring, or GitOps if you're interested.

25
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:05,008
If you're just getting started with software development

26
00:01:05,008 --> 00:01:07,008
or early in your career,

27
00:01:07,008 --> 00:01:09,009
you might benefit from my latest course,

28
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:11,005
A Career in Code.

29
00:01:11,005 --> 00:01:13,007
It contains strategies for advancing

30
00:01:13,007 --> 00:01:18,001
within your software development career at all stages.

31
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:21,007
If you want to tag me when you post your course certificate,

32
00:01:21,007 --> 00:01:25,000
I always like to interact with learners taking my courses

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,001
and enjoy reading your feedback.

34
00:01:27,001 --> 00:01:30,000
Nothing makes my day brighter than when I hear from someone

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,002
who enjoyed a course.

36
00:01:32,002 --> 00:01:34,000
So that's it for now.

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,005
Congratulations on finishing this course

38
00:01:36,005 --> 00:01:38,008
and thanks again for taking it.

39
00:01:38,008 --> 00:01:41,002
Now go put a great workflow

40
00:01:41,002 --> 00:01:44,000
in place for your team and ship some code.
