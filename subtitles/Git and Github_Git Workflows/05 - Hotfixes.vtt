00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.009
- [Instructor] Despite our best efforts to prevent it,

2
00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:05.007
things can go wrong in production environments

3
00:00:05.007 --> 00:00:08.002
that need to be fixed immediately.

4
00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:10.007
In Gitflow, this situation is handled

5
00:00:10.007 --> 00:00:13.004
using a hotfix branch.

6
00:00:13.004 --> 00:00:15.007
So let's imagine that in our website,

7
00:00:15.007 --> 00:00:18.001
we accidentally linked to the wrong course

8
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:21.002
and it needs to be fixed immediately.

9
00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:24.006
Since we've already released these changes to production,

10
00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:26.006
they'll be found in our main branch

11
00:00:26.006 --> 00:00:28.004
because we're using Gitflow.

12
00:00:28.004 --> 00:00:31.009
To perform the hotfix, we'll need to create a hotfix branch

13
00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.007
off of our main branch.

14
00:00:33.007 --> 00:00:36.007
So let's go ahead and we'll name our hotfix branch.

15
00:00:36.007 --> 00:00:40.008
I'm going to call it hotfix/1.1,

16
00:00:40.008 --> 00:00:42.007
and then before creating the branch,

17
00:00:42.007 --> 00:00:44.005
you'll just want to double-check

18
00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:47.001
that it's being branched off of main.

19
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:48.003
Looks like I'm good to go,

20
00:00:48.003 --> 00:00:50.006
so I'll create the branch

21
00:00:50.006 --> 00:00:54.007
and now we can start working on performing the fix.

22
00:00:54.007 --> 00:00:57.008
To fix the issue, we'll need to replace the wrong course

23
00:00:57.008 --> 00:00:59.004
with the right course.

24
00:00:59.004 --> 00:01:03.002
So I'm going to head over to the LinkedIn Learning platform

25
00:01:03.002 --> 00:01:05.008
and here, I'll find my Continuous Delivery

26
00:01:05.008 --> 00:01:08.003
for Cloud Native Java Apps course.

27
00:01:08.003 --> 00:01:09.007
Let's say this is the course

28
00:01:09.007 --> 00:01:12.005
that we wanted to display on the page.

29
00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:15.004
Let's go ahead and copy the markup

30
00:01:15.004 --> 00:01:19.005
that will embed the video for the course on our webpage.

31
00:01:19.005 --> 00:01:22.001
All right, once we have that markup copied,

32
00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:24.008
we can navigate back to GitHub

33
00:01:24.008 --> 00:01:28.002
and here, we can edit our index.md file.

34
00:01:28.002 --> 00:01:30.006
So I'll go ahead and click on the file

35
00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:33.003
and then we can click on the pencil to edit it.

36
00:01:33.003 --> 00:01:35.006
Now, this would be performed normally

37
00:01:35.006 --> 00:01:39.004
on your local workstation, but once again, to save time,

38
00:01:39.004 --> 00:01:41.008
I'm doing it right within GitHub.

39
00:01:41.008 --> 00:01:45.002
Inside of the file, we're going to replace our description

40
00:01:45.002 --> 00:01:48.002
and the existing markup with the correct markup,

41
00:01:48.002 --> 00:01:50.005
that way we can fix the bug.

42
00:01:50.005 --> 00:01:52.001
All right, there, it's in place,

43
00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:55.003
so let's go ahead and we can commit our changes

44
00:01:55.003 --> 00:01:57.006
to this file.

45
00:01:57.006 --> 00:02:00.007
Now that the fix is in our hotfix branch,

46
00:02:00.007 --> 00:02:04.008
we can start to merge that change into our main branch,

47
00:02:04.008 --> 00:02:06.005
that way it gets released.

48
00:02:06.005 --> 00:02:10.001
To do that, we're going to create another pull request.

49
00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:12.006
And you'll notice that GitHub has picked up

50
00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:16.001
on our hotfix branch, so let's use this shortcut

51
00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:18.009
to create the pull request.

52
00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:21.001
I'll just go ahead, click on this button,

53
00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:23.004
the pull request will get created,

54
00:02:23.004 --> 00:02:27.002
and then we can merge the changes into our main branch,

55
00:02:27.002 --> 00:02:31.002
which will cause them to be released.

56
00:02:31.002 --> 00:02:33.004
Now while the release is being performed

57
00:02:33.004 --> 00:02:35.004
by our GitHub action,

58
00:02:35.004 --> 00:02:39.000
let's copy these changes into our develop branch,

59
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.006
that way, all of the branches are in sync.

60
00:02:41.006 --> 00:02:43.008
So I'll go back to pull requests,

61
00:02:43.008 --> 00:02:46.001
click on New pull request,

62
00:02:46.001 --> 00:02:51.000
and then we'll select our develop branch,

63
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.004
and then we'll merge the hotfix branch into it.

64
00:02:54.004 --> 00:02:56.009
Okay, that should set up our pull request,

65
00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:59.009
so let's go ahead and we can create it,

66
00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:01.004
and then I'll click on this button

67
00:03:01.004 --> 00:03:02.008
to create the pull request

68
00:03:02.008 --> 00:03:07.008
so that we can merge it into the develop branch.

69
00:03:07.008 --> 00:03:12.002
Okay, now develop should be up-to-date with our hotfix.

70
00:03:12.002 --> 00:03:14.003
Now let's go check out those changes

71
00:03:14.003 --> 00:03:16.007
that we just made to the main branch.

72
00:03:16.007 --> 00:03:18.008
They should be deployed by now.

73
00:03:18.008 --> 00:03:21.001
There we can see our GitHub action

74
00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:23.001
and if we view our website,

75
00:03:23.001 --> 00:03:27.006
you'll see that we now have the correct course in place

76
00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:30.004
and we were able to fix the bug.

77
00:03:30.004 --> 00:03:34.000
So using a hotfix branch in the GItflow workflow

78
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.001
allowed us to address a critical issue.

79
00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:40.009
The key is to remember to merge the hotfix branch

80
00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:44.007
into main and develop once you've completed it.

81
00:03:44.007 --> 00:03:47.000
So that wraps things up for Gitflow.

82
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Now we're going to move on to our next workflow.
