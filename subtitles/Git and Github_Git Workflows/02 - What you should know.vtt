00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.009
- [Instructor] Before we explore Git Workflows,

2
00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:05.007
let's talk a bit about who the course is for

3
00:00:05.007 --> 00:00:08.007
and what you'll need to know ahead of time.

4
00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:10.003
If you're a software developer,

5
00:00:10.003 --> 00:00:13.002
this course can teach you more about how your team

6
00:00:13.002 --> 00:00:16.001
uses Git to manage their source code.

7
00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:17.009
If you're just starting out your career,

8
00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.005
it can prepare you to collaborate on source code

9
00:00:20.005 --> 00:00:23.003
with other developers in the workplace.

10
00:00:23.003 --> 00:00:24.005
That way you'll be comfortable

11
00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:27.003
with your team's workflow and can merge that code

12
00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:30.009
you've been working on into your team's Git Repository.

13
00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.002
More experienced developers can use this course

14
00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:37.004
to get an overview of the Git workflows available

15
00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:40.004
to them that they can put in place for their team.

16
00:00:40.004 --> 00:00:42.004
And if you're not a developer,

17
00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:45.002
but work closely with a development team,

18
00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:47.000
you'll gain a better understanding

19
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.004
of their processes for shipping code

20
00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:53.005
and some strategies used to perform releases.

21
00:00:53.005 --> 00:00:56.006
There's a few things you'll need for this course.

22
00:00:56.006 --> 00:00:59.001
This course is great for developers

23
00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:00.005
who want to learn techniques

24
00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:02.009
for collaborating better with Git.

25
00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:05.009
However, it shouldn't be your first time using Git.

26
00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:09.003
So, if you haven't learned basic Git commands yet,

27
00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:11.003
check out the LinkedIn Learning Library

28
00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:14.001
for an introductory course on Git.

29
00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:16.001
If you want to follow along with the course,

30
00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:19.003
you'll need to have Git installed on your workstation

31
00:01:19.003 --> 00:01:22.005
running the operating system of your choice.

32
00:01:22.005 --> 00:01:24.008
We'll be using GitHub throughout the course.

33
00:01:24.008 --> 00:01:27.002
So you'll need a GitHub account.

34
00:01:27.002 --> 00:01:29.003
Also, we'll take a look at feature flags

35
00:01:29.003 --> 00:01:31.001
using LaunchDarkly.

36
00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:32.007
So if you want to follow along

37
00:01:32.007 --> 00:01:35.006
with that part of the course you'll need a trial account

38
00:01:35.006 --> 00:01:38.005
or you can just watch those parts.

39
00:01:38.005 --> 00:01:41.000
That's all you'll need to get through the course.

40
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I'll handle the rest.
