00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:03.005
- [Kevin] Before we can begin using trunk-based development

2
00:00:03.005 --> 00:00:05.000
and feature flags,

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.001
we'll need to do some configuration

4
00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:10.006
in our shared repository and our LaunchDarkly account.

5
00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:13.004
So let's start with our repository.

6
00:00:13.004 --> 00:00:16.004
Since we have a very simple project,

7
00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:18.004
let's work directly from trunk,

8
00:00:18.004 --> 00:00:20.005
and we'll also release from there.

9
00:00:20.005 --> 00:00:23.009
That means we'll need to disable the branch protection roles

10
00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:25.004
on our main branch.

11
00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:27.006
So within GitHub, we'll navigate

12
00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:30.004
to the settings of our repository

13
00:00:30.004 --> 00:00:34.003
and then we'll select the Branches section on the sidebar.

14
00:00:34.003 --> 00:00:36.008
And now we can see our branch protection roles

15
00:00:36.008 --> 00:00:38.004
on the main branch.

16
00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:41.005
I'm just going to go ahead and delete that.

17
00:00:41.005 --> 00:00:45.005
And then everything will be set up within our repository

18
00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:48.001
for trunk based development.

19
00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:50.008
Now let's head over to our LaunchDarkly account

20
00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:52.003
and we can turn our attention

21
00:00:52.003 --> 00:00:54.007
to creating our new feature flag.

22
00:00:54.007 --> 00:00:56.007
We're going to create the feature flag

23
00:00:56.007 --> 00:00:59.005
within the default project that was created

24
00:00:59.005 --> 00:01:01.007
with our LaunchDarkly account.

25
00:01:01.007 --> 00:01:03.002
To do that, we can go ahead

26
00:01:03.002 --> 00:01:06.000
and click on Feature Flags on the sidebar.

27
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.009
And then here you'll see the option to create a flag.

28
00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.003
Go ahead and click on that.

29
00:01:12.003 --> 00:01:13.008
In the form that pops up

30
00:01:13.008 --> 00:01:17.006
we can provide the configuration for our new feature flag.

31
00:01:17.006 --> 00:01:21.000
It starts with giving the feature flag a name.

32
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.009
I'm going to name this feature flag course-preview.

33
00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.003
Then the next thing we'll need to do is check this option

34
00:01:28.003 --> 00:01:32.005
to use client side ID in the SDK.

35
00:01:32.005 --> 00:01:34.001
This is going to allow us

36
00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:37.000
to use our feature flag in JavaScript.

37
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.006
Then we'll want to take a look

38
00:01:38.006 --> 00:01:40.002
at the type of flag.

39
00:01:40.002 --> 00:01:42.001
Currently it's set to Boolean

40
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:44.004
and that's going to work for us

41
00:01:44.004 --> 00:01:46.004
because we're just going to use this flag

42
00:01:46.004 --> 00:01:48.000
to toggle the visibility

43
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.004
of a third course that we're going to add to the page.

44
00:01:51.004 --> 00:01:53.002
All right, since everything's in place

45
00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:55.006
I'll just go ahead and hit save flag

46
00:01:55.006 --> 00:01:59.003
and then we'll have a new feature flag within LaunchDarkly

47
00:01:59.003 --> 00:02:02.003
that we can use for our development work.

48
00:02:02.003 --> 00:02:05.009
All right, so now our repository is set up for TBD

49
00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.007
and we've created our feature flag.

50
00:02:07.007 --> 00:02:08.008
Everything's in place

51
00:02:08.008 --> 00:02:11.004
for us to begin developing our new feature

52
00:02:11.004 --> 00:02:13.000
in our next lesson.
