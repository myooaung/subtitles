1
00:00:00,007 --> 00:00:02,007
- [Instructor] Our website is kind of empty,

2
00:00:02,007 --> 00:00:04,008
so let's work on a new feature

3
00:00:04,008 --> 00:00:07,004
that will add some content to the site.

4
00:00:07,004 --> 00:00:08,007
This will give us a chance

5
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:10,006
to see what the workflow looks like

6
00:00:10,006 --> 00:00:13,007
for routine development work with Gitflow.

7
00:00:13,007 --> 00:00:17,006
To get started, we'll need to clone our shared repository

8
00:00:17,006 --> 00:00:19,004
to our local workstation

9
00:00:19,004 --> 00:00:22,003
where we'll do the work in a feature branch.

10
00:00:22,003 --> 00:00:23,005
To perform the clone,

11
00:00:23,005 --> 00:00:26,004
we can click on the Code button within GitHub,

12
00:00:26,004 --> 00:00:28,003
and here you'll see two URLs,

13
00:00:28,003 --> 00:00:31,005
one for HTTPS and one for SSH.

14
00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:33,003
You can choose either of these.

15
00:00:33,003 --> 00:00:35,005
I'm going to use SSH.

16
00:00:35,005 --> 00:00:39,002
Once we've copied that URL to the repository,

17
00:00:39,002 --> 00:00:42,003
we can take that over to a Git Bash shell.

18
00:00:42,003 --> 00:00:45,002
And here I'm going to paste that URL

19
00:00:45,002 --> 00:00:47,005
after the git clone command.

20
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,005
And then once I execute the command,

21
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:53,009
the repository will be copied on my local workstation.

22
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:58,001
Now let's go ahead and we'll navigate into the repository,

23
00:00:58,001 --> 00:01:01,005
and here we can start to create our feature branch.

24
00:01:01,005 --> 00:01:03,000
Now the feature branch

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,004
is where we'll do our development work,

26
00:01:05,004 --> 00:01:08,001
but you'll recall that it needs to be branched

27
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:09,008
from the develop branch

28
00:01:09,008 --> 00:01:13,006
where the team stores its work for the next release.

29
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:16,002
So the first thing we'll need to do

30
00:01:16,002 --> 00:01:18,009
is create a local develop branch

31
00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:23,005
that tracks the develop branch on the shared repository.

32
00:01:23,005 --> 00:01:25,006
Okay, we have that in place,

33
00:01:25,006 --> 00:01:28,009
now we can go ahead and create our feature branch.

34
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:30,005
When naming a feature branch,

35
00:01:30,005 --> 00:01:33,006
I like to prefix it with the word feature,

36
00:01:33,006 --> 00:01:36,001
followed by my initials.

37
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:39,000
This helps if multiple developers are working

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
on the same repository

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,003
because you can sort by branch name

40
00:01:43,003 --> 00:01:46,006
and it's going to group all of your branches together.

41
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:49,005
After my initials, I like to add a ticket number.

42
00:01:49,005 --> 00:01:52,005
Now we're not working with a workload tracking system,

43
00:01:52,005 --> 00:01:55,009
so I'm just going to make one up here, 123.

44
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:58,005
And then finally, to end the branch name,

45
00:01:58,005 --> 00:02:00,007
I like to add a small description

46
00:02:00,007 --> 00:02:02,002
about what I'm working on.

47
00:02:02,002 --> 00:02:05,004
So let's just call this site-content.

48
00:02:05,004 --> 00:02:08,000
All right, we can create our new feature branch,

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,007
and now we're ready to do some development.

50
00:02:10,007 --> 00:02:13,005
So I'm going to hop up a directory.

51
00:02:13,005 --> 00:02:17,002
And then here, I'm going to use Visual Studio Code

52
00:02:17,002 --> 00:02:20,006
to open the folder containing our repository.

53
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:22,007
You can use any editor here

54
00:02:22,007 --> 00:02:25,002
as long as you're able to make some small changes

55
00:02:25,002 --> 00:02:27,003
to the files in the folder.

56
00:02:27,003 --> 00:02:29,006
All right, inside Visual Studio Code,

57
00:02:29,006 --> 00:02:32,004
we'll see our index.md file,

58
00:02:32,004 --> 00:02:34,006
and there's the markup that we added to it.

59
00:02:34,006 --> 00:02:38,000
Now within this file, we're going to embed a link

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,006
to a course on LinkedIn learning.

61
00:02:40,006 --> 00:02:42,007
I'm going to use one of my courses,

62
00:02:42,007 --> 00:02:46,000
but you can choose any course within the platform.

63
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,004
It's really easy. Let me show you.

64
00:02:48,004 --> 00:02:52,002
All you need to do is navigate to the course of your choice

65
00:02:52,002 --> 00:02:54,001
and then click on the Share button,

66
00:02:54,001 --> 00:02:57,002
and you'll see this option for Embed.

67
00:02:57,002 --> 00:03:00,008
This is going to allow you to copy some markup.

68
00:03:00,008 --> 00:03:03,007
And if we take that over to our editor

69
00:03:03,007 --> 00:03:05,007
and paste it within the file,

70
00:03:05,007 --> 00:03:10,003
it's going to embed a video for the course on your page.

71
00:03:10,003 --> 00:03:11,007
All right, with that in place,

72
00:03:11,007 --> 00:03:14,000
let's go ahead and we'll save the file,

73
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,002
and then we're going to navigate back

74
00:03:16,002 --> 00:03:18,002
to a Git Bash terminal.

75
00:03:18,002 --> 00:03:19,008
Inside of this terminal,

76
00:03:19,008 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm going to navigate back into our repository's folder.

77
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,009
And then here,

78
00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:28,003
I'm going to stage the changes that we just made,

79
00:03:28,003 --> 00:03:32,002
and then I'll commit them to the local repository

80
00:03:32,002 --> 00:03:33,009
on our feature branch.

81
00:03:33,009 --> 00:03:38,002
We'll just say that we added content to the site.

82
00:03:38,002 --> 00:03:41,003
And now we're ready to push our local feature branch

83
00:03:41,003 --> 00:03:43,005
to the shared repository.

84
00:03:43,005 --> 00:03:46,004
To do that, we'll use the git push command,

85
00:03:46,004 --> 00:03:48,004
followed by the origin,

86
00:03:48,004 --> 00:03:52,000
so this is the shared repository over on GitHub.

87
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And then we need to provide the name

88
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
of the branch that we're pushing,

89
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,005
so I'll type in the branch name

90
00:03:58,005 --> 00:04:01,004
that we created for the feature branch.

91
00:04:01,004 --> 00:04:04,000
And then we're going to add the -u flag.

92
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,001
This will set up tracking between our local feature branch

93
00:04:08,001 --> 00:04:11,005
and the branch on the shared repository.

94
00:04:11,005 --> 00:04:15,007
All right, let's go ahead and we'll perform the push.

95
00:04:15,007 --> 00:04:18,009
And now we should find that feature branch over on GitHub,

96
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:21,002
so let's go check it out.

97
00:04:21,002 --> 00:04:24,004
Over on GitHub, you can see that it's already picked up

98
00:04:24,004 --> 00:04:26,005
on our new feature branch.

99
00:04:26,005 --> 00:04:28,003
Let's navigate into the branches

100
00:04:28,003 --> 00:04:30,006
for the repository to check it out.

101
00:04:30,006 --> 00:04:33,001
So there we can see our main branch,

102
00:04:33,001 --> 00:04:36,007
as well as our feature branch and our develop branch.

103
00:04:36,007 --> 00:04:38,006
Let's create a pull request

104
00:04:38,006 --> 00:04:42,001
that will merge our feature branch into the develop branch

105
00:04:42,001 --> 00:04:45,004
where the team is storing its work for the next release.

106
00:04:45,004 --> 00:04:48,006
To do that, we can click on the Pull request tab,

107
00:04:48,006 --> 00:04:51,004
and then we can create a new pull request

108
00:04:51,004 --> 00:04:54,000
by clicking on this button.

109
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
In order to create the pull request,

110
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,004
we'll need to indicate the branch

111
00:04:58,004 --> 00:05:00,001
that we would like to merge into,

112
00:05:00,001 --> 00:05:02,005
in this case, it's going to be develop,

113
00:05:02,005 --> 00:05:05,008
and the branch that we would like to merge into develop,

114
00:05:05,008 --> 00:05:08,001
which will be our feature branch.

115
00:05:08,001 --> 00:05:10,008
All right, once we've selected those branches,

116
00:05:10,008 --> 00:05:13,003
we can click on Create pull request,

117
00:05:13,003 --> 00:05:15,008
and now we can provide some additional information

118
00:05:15,008 --> 00:05:18,000
about our pull request.

119
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,006
Here I'm just going to add a description

120
00:05:20,006 --> 00:05:25,003
that says, "We're adding content to the site."

121
00:05:25,003 --> 00:05:26,003
Once I've done that,

122
00:05:26,003 --> 00:05:29,006
I can go ahead and click on Create pull request,

123
00:05:29,006 --> 00:05:31,004
and that will create the pull request

124
00:05:31,004 --> 00:05:34,008
for other members on the team to review and approve.

125
00:05:34,008 --> 00:05:37,000
Now we're working by ourselves,

126
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,006
so I'm just going to perform the merge myself

127
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,007
by clicking on this button to merge the pull request.

128
00:05:43,007 --> 00:05:46,002
We'll then have to confirm the merge.

129
00:05:46,002 --> 00:05:49,004
And once we do that, we'll have merged our changes

130
00:05:49,004 --> 00:05:53,006
from the feature branch into the develop branch

131
00:05:53,006 --> 00:05:56,007
where the team's shared work resides.

132
00:05:56,007 --> 00:05:59,002
You'll also notice that we get the option

133
00:05:59,002 --> 00:06:01,003
to delete our feature branch.

134
00:06:01,003 --> 00:06:04,001
If you know that you're not going to be doing any more work,

135
00:06:04,001 --> 00:06:05,008
it's always good to clean these up,

136
00:06:05,008 --> 00:06:09,004
so I'm going to go ahead and delete that branch.

137
00:06:09,004 --> 00:06:12,006
So that's the development workflow for Gitflow,

138
00:06:12,006 --> 00:06:15,007
which is based on a feature branching strategy.

139
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:17,001
Let's move on from here

140
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:19,008
to look at how we can release these changes

141
00:06:19,008 --> 00:06:22,000
in our next lesson.
