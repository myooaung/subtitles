00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:02.005
- [Instructor] After your team's develop branch

2
00:00:02.005 --> 00:00:04.002
has collected enough features,

3
00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:05.008
you'll want to release them.

4
00:00:05.008 --> 00:00:08.003
In Gitflow, the release process starts

5
00:00:08.003 --> 00:00:11.002
by creating a new release branch that's branched

6
00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:13.004
off of your develop branch.

7
00:00:13.004 --> 00:00:16.000
We can create this branch within GitHub

8
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.007
by clicking on the branch dropdown,

9
00:00:18.007 --> 00:00:21.000
selecting the develop branch,

10
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.004
and then from there, we'll click

11
00:00:22.004 --> 00:00:24.006
on the branch dropdown again,

12
00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:27.002
and here we'll name our release branch.

13
00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:31.002
I'm going to name it release forward slash 1.0

14
00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:33.000
and then you'll just want to check

15
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.001
that you are branching off of your develop branch.

16
00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:37.008
You can see that there.

17
00:00:37.008 --> 00:00:39.009
If everything's in place, go ahead

18
00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:43.006
and click on the line and the new branch will be created.

19
00:00:43.006 --> 00:00:46.001
So now we have our new release branch,

20
00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:48.009
but we don't want to make any major changes to it

21
00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:51.001
like adding a new feature.

22
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:55.002
We can make minor changes that fix any bugs discovered

23
00:00:55.002 --> 00:00:58.003
while this release candidate is being tested.

24
00:00:58.003 --> 00:01:00.005
This is one of the strengths of Gitflow.

25
00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:03.002
We can make small changes in the release branch

26
00:01:03.002 --> 00:01:06.007
to prepare the release while the rest of the team

27
00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:09.001
is doing feature work for the next release

28
00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:11.003
in the develop branch.

29
00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:14.005
So let's imagine that we were supposed to add

30
00:01:14.005 --> 00:01:17.008
a small description of the course on the webpage,

31
00:01:17.008 --> 00:01:19.007
but we forgot to do it.

32
00:01:19.007 --> 00:01:22.009
Let's go ahead and we'll fix this issue.

33
00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.007
I'm going to navigate back to the course page

34
00:01:25.007 --> 00:01:28.007
and if I scroll down, I can find the description

35
00:01:28.007 --> 00:01:30.006
I was supposed to add to our site.

36
00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:32.007
So let's go ahead and copy that

37
00:01:32.007 --> 00:01:35.006
and then we can navigate back to GitHub

38
00:01:35.006 --> 00:01:39.009
where we can place this description in our index.md file.

39
00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.000
So just click on the file

40
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.002
and then come over here to the pencil to edit it.

41
00:01:45.002 --> 00:01:48.005
Now, normally we would do this work on our workstation

42
00:01:48.005 --> 00:01:52.009
in our local repository in another branch, but to save time,

43
00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.001
I'm going to work directly within GitHub.

44
00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:58.001
So I'll just go ahead and paste the description

45
00:01:58.001 --> 00:02:00.004
below the video for the course

46
00:02:00.004 --> 00:02:03.004
and then I'll go ahead and commit these changes.

47
00:02:03.004 --> 00:02:06.000
All right, now they're in place.

48
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.009
Now that we've fixed the issues in our release branch,

49
00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.002
we're going to ship it to production.

50
00:02:11.002 --> 00:02:13.005
In Gitflow, this is done by merging

51
00:02:13.005 --> 00:02:16.000
our release branch into the main branch.

52
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.007
To do that, we're going to use a pull request.

53
00:02:18.007 --> 00:02:21.005
So I'll click on the pull request tab

54
00:02:21.005 --> 00:02:24.002
and here you'll notice that GitHub has identified

55
00:02:24.002 --> 00:02:26.009
our recent changes to the release branch.

56
00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:29.001
So let's just use this shortcut

57
00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:31.005
to create the pull request.

58
00:02:31.005 --> 00:02:33.002
There you can see the pull request

59
00:02:33.002 --> 00:02:36.006
is set up to merge the release branch into main.

60
00:02:36.006 --> 00:02:38.002
It's exactly what we want.

61
00:02:38.002 --> 00:02:41.002
So let's go ahead, we'll create the pull request,

62
00:02:41.002 --> 00:02:43.000
and then since we're working on our own,

63
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.009
we'll just go ahead and merge it.

64
00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:48.002
After I confirm the merge, we can head over

65
00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:55.007
to the actions to watch as our page is built and deployed.

66
00:02:55.007 --> 00:02:57.005
Okay, it looks like it's built

67
00:02:57.005 --> 00:03:00.008
and the deployment should kick off here shortly.

68
00:03:00.008 --> 00:03:02.001
Everything's ready to go.

69
00:03:02.001 --> 00:03:04.003
Let's check out our website.

70
00:03:04.003 --> 00:03:06.008
Awesome, we've just completed our first release

71
00:03:06.008 --> 00:03:11.002
with Gitflow, but there's one last step.

72
00:03:11.002 --> 00:03:14.000
In Gitflow we also need to merge the changes

73
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.008
from our release branch into the develop branch.

74
00:03:16.008 --> 00:03:20.001
That way they're incorporated into future development work.

75
00:03:20.001 --> 00:03:21.008
So let's go ahead and do that.

76
00:03:21.008 --> 00:03:23.000
We'll use a pull request

77
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.003
so I'll click on that tab and then we can click

78
00:03:26.003 --> 00:03:29.000
on this button to create a new pull request.

79
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.001
From here, I'm going to select our develop branch

80
00:03:33.001 --> 00:03:36.000
and then I'm going to select our release branch.

81
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.004
That way the changes from release are merged into develop.

82
00:03:40.004 --> 00:03:41.006
All right, let's go ahead,

83
00:03:41.006 --> 00:03:43.006
we'll create the pull request,

84
00:03:43.006 --> 00:03:46.004
we'll click on this button then to create it,

85
00:03:46.004 --> 00:03:49.005
and now we can merge the pull request.

86
00:03:49.005 --> 00:03:52.004
We'll confirm that we'd like to perform the merge

87
00:03:52.004 --> 00:03:55.005
and now everything is up-to-date.

88
00:03:55.005 --> 00:03:58.002
So those are the steps you'll need to walk through

89
00:03:58.002 --> 00:04:01.001
to perform a release when using Gitflow.

90
00:04:01.001 --> 00:04:04.001
Just be careful that you don't forget that last step

91
00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:06.007
to merge from release into develop.

92
00:04:06.007 --> 00:04:08.006
Otherwise you might be wondering

93
00:04:08.006 --> 00:04:12.000
where your changes went when you do your next release.
