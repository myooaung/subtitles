00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:01,007
- [Instructor] Throughout the course,

2
00:00:01,007 --> 00:00:04,000
we'll be stepping through a number of workflows,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,002
just like you would in the workplace.

4
00:00:06,002 --> 00:00:07,005
To make it more realistic,

5
00:00:07,005 --> 00:00:10,007
we're going to create a shared repository on GitHub

6
00:00:10,007 --> 00:00:12,005
to mimic the shared repository

7
00:00:12,005 --> 00:00:15,000
that your team would use for a project.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So let's walk through the setup of this repository

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,008
so that we can use it in our lessons.

10
00:00:20,008 --> 00:00:23,004
Once you're logged into your GitHub account,

11
00:00:23,004 --> 00:00:26,009
navigate to this dropdown below your profile picture

12
00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:29,003
and click on Your repositories.

13
00:00:29,003 --> 00:00:31,008
Here, we'll click on the green New button

14
00:00:31,008 --> 00:00:35,003
to create the new repository for the course.

15
00:00:35,003 --> 00:00:38,002
For this repository, we're going to use a neat feature

16
00:00:38,002 --> 00:00:40,009
of GitHub called GitHub Pages.

17
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:44,004
It allows you to host static websites from a repository

18
00:00:44,004 --> 00:00:47,007
right on GitHub using a tool called Jekyll.

19
00:00:47,007 --> 00:00:49,003
By using GitHub pages,

20
00:00:49,003 --> 00:00:52,002
we'll be able to visualize the changes that are made

21
00:00:52,002 --> 00:00:55,001
within a branch on our shared repository,

22
00:00:55,001 --> 00:00:58,005
which we'll consider the production ready branch.

23
00:00:58,005 --> 00:01:00,009
To get started with GitHub Pages,

24
00:01:00,009 --> 00:01:03,007
you'll need to give your repository a special name

25
00:01:03,007 --> 00:01:04,005
when you create it.

26
00:01:04,005 --> 00:01:10,002
It needs to be your GitHub username, then .github.io.

27
00:01:10,002 --> 00:01:13,005
So I'm going to enter the name of my user,

28
00:01:13,005 --> 00:01:16,008
then .github.io.

29
00:01:16,008 --> 00:01:18,007
All right, once I have that in place,

30
00:01:18,007 --> 00:01:20,007
I can scroll down to the bottom of the page

31
00:01:20,007 --> 00:01:23,006
and create the repository.

32
00:01:23,006 --> 00:01:26,007
So right now our repository is empty.

33
00:01:26,007 --> 00:01:30,005
Let's go ahead and we can add a new file to the repository.

34
00:01:30,005 --> 00:01:32,007
That way there's something in it.

35
00:01:32,007 --> 00:01:36,009
We're going to name this new file index.md.

36
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:38,007
It's going to be a markdown file

37
00:01:38,007 --> 00:01:41,001
that's used for the homepage of the site.

38
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:42,007
In the contents of the file,

39
00:01:42,007 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm just going to add an h1 tag,

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,006
and here, I'm going to add the header,

41
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:52,004
Great LinkedIn Learning Courses.

42
00:01:52,004 --> 00:01:56,007
Okay, so now we have some content on our site's homepage.

43
00:01:56,007 --> 00:01:57,007
Let's scroll down

44
00:01:57,007 --> 00:02:00,004
and we can commit those changes to the file.

45
00:02:00,004 --> 00:02:04,005
All right, now we have a single file within our repository.

46
00:02:04,005 --> 00:02:06,003
At this point, we can go ahead

47
00:02:06,003 --> 00:02:08,007
and publish our GitHub page.

48
00:02:08,007 --> 00:02:11,002
To do that, we need to adjust some settings.

49
00:02:11,002 --> 00:02:13,005
So I'll click on the Settings tab,

50
00:02:13,005 --> 00:02:15,005
and then on the left hand sidebar,

51
00:02:15,005 --> 00:02:17,006
I'm going to click on Pages.

52
00:02:17,006 --> 00:02:21,008
Here, you'll see that the main branch has been selected

53
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:25,001
as the branch to build our GitHub page from.

54
00:02:25,001 --> 00:02:27,004
That's exactly what we want.

55
00:02:27,004 --> 00:02:29,004
Let's go ahead and we'll click on this button

56
00:02:29,004 --> 00:02:31,007
to add a theme for our site.

57
00:02:31,007 --> 00:02:34,003
Here I'm going to choose the Slate theme.

58
00:02:34,003 --> 00:02:38,000
So this will just add some styling to the site.

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,005
Once I've selected Slate,

60
00:02:39,005 --> 00:02:42,004
I can click on this button to select the theme,

61
00:02:42,004 --> 00:02:45,009
and now we're ready for our GitHub page to be published.

62
00:02:45,009 --> 00:02:49,004
We can see that by clicking on the Actions tab,

63
00:02:49,004 --> 00:02:53,001
and you'll notice that GitHub has created actions

64
00:02:53,001 --> 00:02:55,005
that will build and deploy our page.

65
00:02:55,005 --> 00:02:59,002
We can see them here, and they're already in progress.

66
00:02:59,002 --> 00:03:01,008
Let's go ahead and we'll click on this action.

67
00:03:01,008 --> 00:03:04,006
And you'll notice the build has completed

68
00:03:04,006 --> 00:03:06,004
and the page has been deployed.

69
00:03:06,004 --> 00:03:09,004
And down here's the link to the actual page.

70
00:03:09,004 --> 00:03:11,002
This pipeline will be triggered

71
00:03:11,002 --> 00:03:14,003
each time we publish new code to our main branch,

72
00:03:14,003 --> 00:03:17,001
which will cause the page to be updated.

73
00:03:17,001 --> 00:03:19,001
Let's go ahead and we'll click on the link

74
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:21,001
to our new page to take a look.

75
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:23,006
Excellent. So now we have our new site.

76
00:03:23,006 --> 00:03:25,006
Throughout the remainder of the course,

77
00:03:25,006 --> 00:03:29,005
we'll be working with this shared repository on GitHub

78
00:03:29,005 --> 00:03:32,008
and a clone of it on our local repository.

79
00:03:32,008 --> 00:03:35,006
These two repositories will help us simulate

80
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:38,005
the workflows we'll cover throughout the course.

81
00:03:38,005 --> 00:03:42,000
Let's move on to the next chapter to see our first workflow.
