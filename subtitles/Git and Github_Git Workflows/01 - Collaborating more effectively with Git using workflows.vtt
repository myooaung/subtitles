- [Instructor] Collaborating with your team

2
00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:04.009
in Git becomes easy once you've learned

3
00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:07.009
and put in place an effective workflow.

4
00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:10.000
That's why development teams turn

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.009
to establish Git workflows to improve their practices

6
00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.006
for managing source code with Git.

7
00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:19.000
Hi, I'm Kevin Bowersox.

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.004
I've been teaching developers how to use Git

9
00:00:21.004 --> 00:00:25.003
for over a decade and know the pain points they encounter

10
00:00:25.003 --> 00:00:28.004
and how Git workflows like Gitflow,

11
00:00:28.004 --> 00:00:32.008
GitHub flow, and Trunk-based development can eliminate them.

12
00:00:32.008 --> 00:00:35.009
These popular Git workflows that I'll teach you

13
00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:37.007
in this course are used

14
00:00:37.007 --> 00:00:40.006
by many teams to simplify their process

15
00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:44.006
for integrating code changes and performing releases.

16
00:00:44.006 --> 00:00:46.008
So after watching this course

17
00:00:46.008 --> 00:00:49.000
you'll understand the main concepts

18
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.005
behind these Git workflows and be able to execute them

19
00:00:52.005 --> 00:00:56.002
so that you can work seamlessly with your team.

20
00:00:56.002 --> 00:01:00.003
So if you want to work more effectively with Git, join me

21
00:01:00.003 --> 00:01:02.000
on my LinkedIn Learning Course

22
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.007
to learn how Git workflows will streamline

23
00:01:04.007 --> 00:01:08.000
your development process.
