00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:03,007
- [Instructor] Let's set up our shared repository on GitHub

2
00:00:03,007 --> 00:00:06,002
to support the Gitflow workflow.

3
00:00:06,002 --> 00:00:09,008
At the moment, the repository has one long-lived branch,

4
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:12,003
Main, and that's going to contain

5
00:00:12,003 --> 00:00:14,009
a copy of our production code.

6
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:18,003
Now Gitflow requires two long-lived branches,

7
00:00:18,003 --> 00:00:20,000
develop and main,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,004
so we'll need to create the develop branch

9
00:00:22,004 --> 00:00:24,001
so that developers can branch

10
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:25,008
their feature branches off of it

11
00:00:25,008 --> 00:00:27,007
when following the workflow.

12
00:00:27,007 --> 00:00:28,009
To create the branch,

13
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:32,003
just click in this text box and type the name develop.

14
00:00:32,003 --> 00:00:34,002
That will be our branch name.

15
00:00:34,002 --> 00:00:35,007
Then we'll click on this button

16
00:00:35,007 --> 00:00:38,000
in order to create the branch.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,001
Alright, there you can see it's created.

18
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:42,008
And now we have the two long-lived branches

19
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:45,001
that are required for Gitflow.

20
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:48,003
In Gitflow, these are very important branches,

21
00:00:48,003 --> 00:00:49,003
especially main,

22
00:00:49,003 --> 00:00:52,001
which contains the copy of our production code

23
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:55,007
that the GitHub action publishes the website from.

24
00:00:55,007 --> 00:00:58,006
To protect them from being accidentally modified,

25
00:00:58,006 --> 00:01:02,004
let's configure some rules on these branches within GitHub.

26
00:01:02,004 --> 00:01:05,002
To do that, we'll click on the Settings tab,

27
00:01:05,002 --> 00:01:06,009
and then on the sidebar,

28
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:08,008
you'll see the Branches option.

29
00:01:08,008 --> 00:01:09,008
Click on that,

30
00:01:09,008 --> 00:01:10,007
and then you'll notice

31
00:01:10,007 --> 00:01:13,008
that we can apply branch protection rules

32
00:01:13,008 --> 00:01:16,004
on the branches within our repository.

33
00:01:16,004 --> 00:01:19,005
So let's click on Add Rule to get started.

34
00:01:19,005 --> 00:01:21,001
The first thing we'll need to do

35
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:24,004
is provide the name of the branch we'd like to protect.

36
00:01:24,004 --> 00:01:26,005
In this case, it's going to be main.

37
00:01:26,005 --> 00:01:29,002
Now there's a lot of rules that we can apply,

38
00:01:29,002 --> 00:01:30,009
but we're going to keep it simple

39
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:32,004
and we'll check this option

40
00:01:32,004 --> 00:01:35,006
to always require a pull request before merging.

41
00:01:35,006 --> 00:01:37,008
That way other members of the team

42
00:01:37,008 --> 00:01:40,005
get the opportunity to review code changes

43
00:01:40,005 --> 00:01:43,005
before they're merged into the main branch.

44
00:01:43,005 --> 00:01:46,002
Now you'll notice it selects this option

45
00:01:46,002 --> 00:01:48,002
to require approvals.

46
00:01:48,002 --> 00:01:50,007
This is a good feature to put in place,

47
00:01:50,007 --> 00:01:53,005
but since we're working by ourselves in the course,

48
00:01:53,005 --> 00:01:55,008
we're going to go ahead and uncheck it.

49
00:01:55,008 --> 00:01:58,005
Okay, now that we have our rule configured,

50
00:01:58,005 --> 00:02:00,001
let's scroll down to the bottom

51
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:01,006
and click on the Create button

52
00:02:01,006 --> 00:02:03,009
to put it in place on the branch.

53
00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:05,007
We will need to authenticate

54
00:02:05,007 --> 00:02:09,002
in order to have the rule put into effect.

55
00:02:09,002 --> 00:02:12,008
Okay, so that's our first rule on the main branch.

56
00:02:12,008 --> 00:02:16,001
We'll also need to put this in place on the develop branch.

57
00:02:16,001 --> 00:02:19,005
So I'll just click on the Add rule button once again

58
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:21,007
and then I'll type the name develop here

59
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,003
and then click the option

60
00:02:23,003 --> 00:02:25,006
to require a pull request before merging

61
00:02:25,006 --> 00:02:28,007
and then uncheck the require approvals option.

62
00:02:28,007 --> 00:02:31,001
And then I'll go ahead and create the rule.

63
00:02:31,001 --> 00:02:33,004
Okay, that completes the configuration

64
00:02:33,004 --> 00:02:36,004
of our shared repository for Gitflow.

65
00:02:36,004 --> 00:02:38,009
And we can now safely do some development work

66
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:41,000
on new features.
