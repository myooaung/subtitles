Hi, my name is Nertil, and welcome to my course,

2
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.030
Building Data‑driven Apps with AWS AppSync.

3
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.930
With modern applications having to consume data from multiple sources,

4
00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:23.040
we are in need of a robust scalable solution to unify our data access layer.

5
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.670
Being able to quickly create scalable, secure,

6
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.540
and reusable APIs is paramount in building large‑scale applications.

7
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.420
Learn how AppSync works and how it can help you quickly create

8
00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.250
scalable and secure APIs for your mobile,

9
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.340
desktop, and web applications.

10
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.340
Some of the major topics that we'll cover in this course

11
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.050
include creating and configuring AppSync APIs,

12
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.840
querying and mutating data,

13
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.500
implementing authentication using Amazon Cognito user pools,

14
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.600
working with real‑time data,

15
00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.140
and finally implement offline capabilities on our client applications.

16
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.230
By the end of this course,

17
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.380
you'll know how to create AppSync APIs and consume them from your

18
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.050
client applications by querying and mutating data, how to

19
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.850
authenticate your users using Amazon Cognito user pools so only

20
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.140
authenticated users can access the data.

21
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.270
You'll learn how to subscribe to data changes so you can get the latest

22
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:28.850
data on your client applications in real time, and also learn how to enable

23
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.110
offline support for a client applications in order to allow your users to

24
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.000
work while they are offline, and synchronize the data when an internet

25
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.340
connection becomes available.

26
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.670
Before beginning this course,

27
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.480
it's recommended that you are familiar with GraphQL

28
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.540
and Amazon Cognito user pools.

29
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.890
I hope you will join me on the journey to learn how to build

30
00:01:51.890 --> 00:02:03.000
data‑driven applications with the Building Data‑driven Apps with AWS AppSync course, at Pluralsight.
