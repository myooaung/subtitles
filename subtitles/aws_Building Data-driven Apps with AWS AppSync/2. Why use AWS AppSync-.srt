00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:05,600
AWS AppSync is a service that was built to simplify and speed

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,640
up the application development process.

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,770
It enables us to quickly create flexible APIs,

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:16,170
which we can use to securely access, edit,

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,440
and combine data from multiple data sources.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,040
For example, we can get data from NoSQL data stores,

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,240
which is the most common way of storing data in AppSync.

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,650
We can also use relational databases, get data from HTTP APIs, and

9
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,040
other common data stores using lambda functions,

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,140
allowing for great flexibility when it comes to storing data.

11
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:43,050
The AppSync service uses GraphQL so we can quickly get the data

12
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,740
that we need and only the fields that we want.

13
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:50,680
Now let's look at some of the benefits of using AppSync for application

14
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,940
development. We can get up and running very quickly.

15
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,780
It takes just a couple of minutes to get up and running

16
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,240
with our first API using AppSync.

17
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,600
We can use the application management console to quickly

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,040
create our back end with a couple of clicks,

19
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,980
or we can use the Amplify CLI to automatically generate

20
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,710
our APIs and the client‑side code.

21
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:16,140
Another important benefit is service integration.

22
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,800
AWS AppSync integrates with Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Aurora,

23
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,920
Elasticsearch, AWS Lambda, and other AWS services,

24
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,190
enabling us to create sophisticated applications with

25
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:32,280
virtually unlimited throughput and storage that can scale

26
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,140
according to our business needs.

27
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,730
AppSync also supports real‑time subscriptions. One of the best

28
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:41,180
features of AppSync is real‑time subscriptions.

29
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,820
It enables our client applications to subscribe to data changes.

30
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,330
So whenever a data change is made, the client application can show the latest

31
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:53,640
data to the user. It also has support for offline access.

32
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,440
Whenever the client application loses internet access,

33
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:01,180
users can still edit data on the application. And when internet access

34
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:05,540
becomes available, the data is synced for us automatically.

35
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:10,290
It also provides us with customizable conflict detection and resolution so

36
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:13,840
we can customize our logic when merge conflicts occur.

37
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,920
And last but not least, it's a unified data access layer. Using GraphQL,

38
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,840
it enables us to query data across multiple data

39
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,140
sources with a single network call.

40
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,880
It makes it easy for us to secure the data using multiple

41
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,300
concurrent authentication modes, as well as allowing us to

42
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,820
define fine‑grained access control at the data definition level

43
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,840
directly from our GraphQL schema.

44
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:44,000
Now let's see these features in action. We'll start creating our first API in the next clip.
