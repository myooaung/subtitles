1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,810
In this demo, we are going to add, delete,

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:08,340
and edit tasks from our AppSync back end.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,550
In our GraphQL schema,

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:14,480
we have three mutations, createTask, update, and deleteTask. We need to

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,530
define those same mutations in our application so we can use them. In

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,020
our application, in the GraphQL folder,

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,080
we are going to define the mutations in the Mutations.ts file.

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,780
Just like we did with our queries, we are going to use the

9
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:31,640
graphql‑tag library to convert the query definition into a GraphQL

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,740
query object for AppSync client.

11
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,730
Here, we are exporting three mutations, the createGlobomanticsTasks,

12
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,040
updateGlobomanticsTasks, and deleteGlobomanticsTasks.

13
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,120
The mutation definition is the same as defined in the GraphQL

14
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,060
schema in our AppSync API. If we have made any mistakes, the

15
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,240
GraphQL client will let us know.

16
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:59,340
Now let's navigate back to the index.ts file and import these three mutations.

17
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,400
We are going to import the CreateTaskMutation, UpdateMutation, and

18
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,940
DeleteTaskMutation from the GraphQL Mutations.ts file.

19
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:11,440
Now let's start implementing the task creation.

20
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,000
We are going to implement the task creation

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,120
functionality in the createTask function,

22
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,540
which is wired up to the UI. And we get a title and the description.

23
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:24,440
Let's start by making an instance of a createTask mutation GraphQL object.

24
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,140
Next, we are going to define the task object.

25
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,850
The task object will have a title,

26
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:32,810
which is going to be the input title that is specified in the UI, a date,

27
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,820
which is going to be the current date, and the

28
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,040
description that is specified in the UI.

29
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,140
Using the AppSync client, we can call the mutate function.

30
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,640
The mutate function requires a mutation,

31
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,620
which is going to be the createTask mutation. And then,

32
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,400
we need to specify the variables.

33
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,230
The variable name required from a createTask mutation is

34
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:53,540
called createglobomanticstasksinput,

35
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,210
and we need to specify it as

36
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:58,260
createglobomanticstasksinput. Otherwise it will not work,

37
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,940
and it will assume that the variable is empty. And as a

38
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:05,340
value, we are going to specify our task.

39
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,490
Once the request is done,

40
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,850
we are going to reload the tasks and then close the

41
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,440
pop‑up model that shows in the UI.

42
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,940
Next, for updating tasks, we are going to follow the same logic.

43
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,440
First, we create an instance of the UpdateTaskMutation query object.

44
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,380
Then, we specify the task details.

45
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:25,040
This time around, we need to specify the ID, title, and description.

46
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,320
The ID is required to make an update,

47
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,480
and we do not need to specify date since we don't want to change

48
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,180
it. And then using the client.mutate function, we specify the

49
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,840
mutation. And then this time around,

50
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,380
the variable is going to be

51
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:43,040
updateglobomanticstasksinput, and then we load the tasks.

52
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,870
And finally,

53
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:47,200
let's implement the DeleteTaskMutation. In the

54
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,540
deleteTask function, we only get the ID.

55
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,940
We are going to use the same logic as we did for updating and creating tasks.

56
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,270
First, we create an instance of the DeleteTaskMutation object,

57
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,940
and then we specify the task object.

58
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,840
This time around, we only need the ID of the task to delete it.

59
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,730
And then we do the same logic, client.mutate. We specify the mutation. And

60
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,160
then for variables, we specify the deleteglobomanticstaskinput to the task

61
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,440
object that we created, and we load all the tasks.

62
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,340
And now, let's save the changes and try this in action.

63
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,610
Let's try creating a new task using the Create new task button. Let's

64
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:32,800
specify a title. Let's name it Test Event. And here, we can specify the

65
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,640
description and create it using the Create button.

66
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,550
As soon as we do, a new task is created,

67
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:45,060
and then all the tasks are reloaded. Now let's try editing the task

68
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,720
that we just created. We can do that using the Open button. And

69
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,920
here, we can edit it. Let's change the title to Edited and save the

70
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,140
changes using the Save button.

71
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,800
This will trigger the updateTask function that we just

72
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,820
implemented earlier. And as soon as we do,

73
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:08,340
the task is updated. And finally, the delete functionality.

74
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,230
As soon as we click the Delete button,

75
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,390
the delete function that we implemented earlier is

76
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:16,840
triggered. And our task should be deleted.

77
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,280
Let's navigate back to the code and try to misspell one of the variables

78
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:26,570
to see how we can debug this. Here, on the mutations, let's change the

79
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:33,260
createglobomanticstasksinput and make it createtasksinput2. Now let's

80
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:38,210
save the changes and navigate back to our UI. Let's open the console and

81
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:39,940
navigate to the Network tab.

82
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,840
Here, we can see the requests going in and out.

83
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,740
Now let's try to create a new task.

84
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:52,640
Let's name it Debugging. And as soon as we try to create it,

85
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,540
we can see that nothing happens.

86
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,940
And if we inspect the request,

87
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:01,840
we can see that the data object is null, and then we have a list of errors.

88
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,010
In the errors, we can quickly see that the variable

89
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:08,690
createglobomanticstasksinput has a null value for a NotNull

90
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,440
property CreateGlobomanticsTasksInput.

91
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,800
So this time around, it's expecting a createglobomanticstasksinput2 variable,

92
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:21,590
but we did not specify it. The AppSync API has very insightful error code and

93
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:28,000
error messages. So whenever we have an error, it's easy to debug.
