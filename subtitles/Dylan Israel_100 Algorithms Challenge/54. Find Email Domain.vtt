00:00.670 --> 00:04.450
All right find email domain.

00:04.450 --> 00:10.900
This was a fun one mainly because I think I solved it in a very interesting way.

00:11.320 --> 00:20.710
So essentially what's happening here is we are trying to get the email addresses domain right so in

00:20.710 --> 00:25.680
our input here Pre-N simple example dot com we want to return examples.

00:25.920 --> 00:32.870
In this crazy input here we want to return exampled dot org.

00:32.890 --> 00:33.350
Right.

00:33.520 --> 00:39.890
So a lot of stuff going on there was stuff going on there.

00:40.780 --> 00:42.200
So there's a couple different ways we could do.

00:42.200 --> 00:45.290
There's probably a regular expression way that you could go about and solve this.

00:45.280 --> 00:46.530
That's not how I did it.

00:46.570 --> 00:50.520
I used the last index of and slice so those your hints.

00:50.740 --> 00:53.680
Let's jump into the solution.

00:53.680 --> 00:54.320
All right.

00:54.340 --> 01:03.710
So last index of we'll get the last value where you see a certain string a certain something.

01:03.820 --> 01:07.370
And that's what the last index value.

01:07.510 --> 01:17.830
So in our string what we're going to do is Rinke get create a concert or say last at index is going

01:17.830 --> 01:21.190
to be equal to the address that we're passing in.

01:21.490 --> 01:25.210
Last index of returns last occurrence of the substring in the string.

01:25.210 --> 01:26.780
That's a much better way of putting it.

01:27.100 --> 01:31.660
But so that's what we want.

01:31.660 --> 01:34.350
Like so and so we're going to get from the right side.

01:34.360 --> 01:42.340
The last one last at Simbel basically the starting point and then all we need to do is return the address

01:45.120 --> 01:52.500
slice and then we have the index for which you slice slice to the end of the string.

01:52.590 --> 01:59.550
And so that's the last at inducts plus 1 because we don't want it's going to include the at symbol and

01:59.540 --> 02:00.450
we don't want that.

02:00.450 --> 02:05.270
Instead we just want to go down to the domain itself.

02:05.280 --> 02:09.220
Add yourself to the end and there you go.

02:09.240 --> 02:10.790
That's pretty much it.

02:11.100 --> 02:14.570
Just two method calls in and we're done.

02:14.790 --> 02:19.740
It took me a second to sort of wrap my mind around how I was going to solve this without regular expressions

02:20.070 --> 02:26.010
because I went down the regular expression around and I found it increasingly difficult to try and handle

02:26.280 --> 02:29.950
all use cases and I thought this was a pretty cool way of solving it.
