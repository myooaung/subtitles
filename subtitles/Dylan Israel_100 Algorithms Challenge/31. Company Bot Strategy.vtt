00:00.600 --> 00:01.360
All right.

00:01.380 --> 00:09.060
So we've got a lot of wall of text here going on and this actually this hour is from the code fights

00:09.060 --> 00:14.620
bot challenge itself where they time you can get five minutes to solve it is actually really stressful.

00:14.740 --> 00:22.460
So essentially essentially the company bought strategy to challenge it saying I'm all for trainers solved

00:22.680 --> 00:29.640
correctly so the answer is three plus six plus or post-flood divided by four equals 4.5 each code company

00:29.640 --> 00:32.370
bought is trained by engineers from that specific company.

00:32.370 --> 00:36.510
The way that it works is a representative group of engineers from each company is identified as trainers

00:36.510 --> 00:41.430
before the body goes live and they and they code fight against the body during the training phase of

00:41.430 --> 00:44.460
current training algorithm is definitely more complex.

00:44.460 --> 00:51.090
Let's assume it works this way for each trainer we click two pieces of information per task answer time

00:51.480 --> 00:52.800
and correctness.

00:52.800 --> 00:58.410
Correctness is one if the answer was correct negative one if the answer was wrong in 0 if no answer

00:58.410 --> 01:00.870
was given in this case the box correct answer.

01:00.870 --> 01:06.030
Time for a given task would be the average the answer times from the trainers who answered correctly

01:06.390 --> 01:11.750
given all the training information for a specific task calculate the bot's answers.

01:11.790 --> 01:19.900
So in our example here it's going to return 4.5 5.0 5.0 and zero point zero.

01:19.920 --> 01:26.340
So a lot going on there to evaluate in about a five minute time span is very intimidating.

01:26.360 --> 01:31.470
But they will get done about three and a half minutes after I understood the problem little bit but

01:31.470 --> 01:33.570
let's go ahead and dive into it.

01:33.570 --> 01:38.640
All right so there's a lot of scary text there when doing two dimensional arrays and so may have been

01:38.640 --> 01:39.590
very intimidating.

01:39.600 --> 01:44.640
But if you slow down and read the problem which About two thirds of that isn't necessary it's really

01:44.640 --> 01:52.530
not that difficult of a problem what it's asking is hey what essentially is our average when we have

01:52.890 --> 01:56.980
a a time and a correctness for a right answer.

01:57.150 --> 01:58.360
That's really what we're asking.

01:58.500 --> 02:00.520
And so that's what we need to define.

02:00.630 --> 02:07.040
So let's set time equal to zero and correctness equal to zero as well.

02:07.440 --> 02:12.840
So now what we're going to do is really iterate through the training data is used for each year and

02:12.840 --> 02:17.260
data and that will be of type a number.

02:17.860 --> 02:27.000
That's optional but I think I think it's fun to put that here and what we're going to say is if Now

02:27.000 --> 02:27.810
remember this.

02:27.830 --> 02:29.300
Ciro index's time.

02:29.360 --> 02:37.500
And this one is correctness if data 1 is in fact equal to one meaning that it is correct.

02:37.500 --> 02:43.720
That was the guidelines for how we want to keep our data how we how we want to average our data.

02:43.880 --> 02:54.880
What we need to do is that time is equal to data zero time up to time data zero and then add to correctness.

02:55.050 --> 02:55.680
Data one

02:59.420 --> 03:01.910
it's correctness plus equals or other

03:04.880 --> 03:05.900
nice.

03:06.010 --> 03:12.130
Now all we have to do now that we've calculated these values up we can just a return time divided by

03:12.130 --> 03:16.430
correctness and you'll see we have not a number.

03:16.510 --> 03:18.400
We're just going to hit this with an OR for zero.

03:18.400 --> 03:22.020
That means that no problems were work correct.

03:22.190 --> 03:28.200
And because of it we can't we're dividing 0 by zero which returns an infinite number.

03:28.210 --> 03:28.450
Right.

03:28.450 --> 03:32.110
There is no times where they were correct and thus there is no correctness.

03:32.110 --> 03:36.430
And you could just throw this or statement to return 0 was the score.

03:36.430 --> 03:42.180
So a lot of tech's going on there and that's usually a common thing to get people overwhelmed sometimes.

03:42.390 --> 03:46.120
I know I feel overwhelmed sometimes I see a wall of Tax-Free like oh my God.

03:46.120 --> 03:51.370
But you sort of have to read through it and ask yourself What am I actually being asked and filtered

03:51.370 --> 03:52.640
through sort of the bullshit.
