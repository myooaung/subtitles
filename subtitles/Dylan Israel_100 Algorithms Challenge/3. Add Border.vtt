00:00.770 --> 00:05.070
All right soon the next one we're going to be building a wall or so

00:08.250 --> 00:16.410
you'll see here that we have a a array of strings and what we want to do is we want to build a border

00:16.410 --> 00:19.440
around all of the strings.

00:19.440 --> 00:24.120
And the way that we're going to do this is with concat on shift and push this first Schwall is going

00:24.120 --> 00:29.970
to be all Asterix and then each asterisk on each side of the word.

00:29.970 --> 00:35.310
So we have all the string values completely covered like a wall around it.

00:35.310 --> 00:39.970
So some hints as to how I solved using cat on shift and push.

00:40.080 --> 00:41.890
Let's go and just dive right into it.

00:44.460 --> 00:44.690
All right.

00:44.700 --> 00:50.910
So all of the strings are going to be even in length so define the size of our wall.

00:50.910 --> 00:58.260
All we have to do is is take the first value get the length of it and then add two to it.

00:58.260 --> 00:59.360
So that's where we're going to start.

00:59.410 --> 01:06.040
I'll call this size of wall length of office probably a better length of walk.

01:06.210 --> 01:07.930
And so what's the length of the wall.

01:07.980 --> 01:15.030
And this is going to be of type number we don't have to explicitly say it will implicitly assign it

01:15.270 --> 01:22.890
and we'll say Picture zero dot length plus 2.

01:23.080 --> 01:28.820
Now that we have that we know that and Concat a wall together.

01:28.930 --> 01:37.040
So there's something like four equals zero size less than length of four

01:39.750 --> 01:41.140
plus plus.

01:41.770 --> 01:48.140
And we can go ahead and say a wall is equal to the wall dog and cat.

01:48.340 --> 01:55.390
And then what we want to concat is that asterisk this is going to give us oh we need to Walder we will

01:55.400 --> 02:02.320
hear conc wall that's victory's me a lit wall equal an empty string.

02:02.940 --> 02:11.280
So now we have that we have our wall right right now if we wish for a turn Wall we just can't see they

02:11.460 --> 02:16.710
make this any for the time being because we just want to see the return.

02:16.710 --> 02:25.470
You'll see that when we go ahead and finally turn on Koka that will get a five asterisk wall because

02:25.470 --> 02:28.430
there's 3 here and then we've done that so that that's working.

02:29.360 --> 02:41.670
Relatively well so now we have that what we need to do is think about creating a a wall a starting wall

02:41.850 --> 02:47.900
and an ending wall and the way that we can do that is we can take our picture that we already have and

02:47.900 --> 02:54.570
we can modify it and we can use remember because our picture is nothing but this array right now.

02:54.780 --> 03:04.710
And so we can say Picture dot shift and it's going to shoot the wall to the front and then we see a

03:04.710 --> 03:07.090
picture dot.

03:07.090 --> 03:07.620
Push

03:10.630 --> 03:20.040
and you're going to put push the Wasil Now when we actually instead of returning a or turn picture and

03:20.040 --> 03:24.390
we can see what we're getting back is the wall then letters than the wall.

03:24.390 --> 03:31.950
So all we have to do now is make sure that we can catch the wall with the values there.

03:32.070 --> 03:33.880
And and then we're good to go.

03:33.880 --> 03:34.700
So how do we do that.

03:34.720 --> 03:36.490
Well it's pretty straightforward.

03:36.490 --> 03:39.750
What we need to do is just create a for loop that does it for us.

03:39.790 --> 03:43.490
So we have a for loop here and that includes that.

03:43.510 --> 03:46.040
And we don't need this give us a little bit more room.

03:46.270 --> 03:56.610
And so say let go zero is less than what actually is going to be equal to 1.

03:57.520 --> 04:06.790
And I will be less than the picture length minus one because we already changed the zero index so we've

04:06.790 --> 04:13.550
already changed the last index which is where we shifted and pushed the wall here.

04:13.930 --> 04:23.170
Now that we've done that all we're going to do is say picture I the current index value that we're iterating

04:23.170 --> 04:24.070
on.

04:24.070 --> 04:32.070
We want to take an asterisk and we want to concat on that point.

04:32.290 --> 04:35.300
The current value of picture.

04:35.410 --> 04:40.690
So that's going to put an asterisk in front of it and Concat will let us take in multiple values in

04:40.690 --> 04:41.210
order.

04:41.230 --> 04:47.920
And then this will concat value at the end of it and you'll see here now we've essentially built our

04:47.920 --> 04:48.710
wall.

04:48.760 --> 04:53.540
Now how might we maybe make this code a little bit more efficient.

04:54.510 --> 05:03.150
One way I believe there's a string repeat I could be I could be mistaken and see if I if I if I am doing

05:03.150 --> 05:03.570
this right.

05:03.570 --> 05:11.040
So we do star repeat and then we just repeat it for the length of the law.

05:11.320 --> 05:18.790
I didn't originally do this but it's always good to it's always good to maybe simplify your code so

05:18.790 --> 05:19.830
we can do this.

05:19.840 --> 05:21.900
So let's go ahead and just clean up our gut.

05:21.910 --> 05:25.590
How do we do this sort of length of wall.

05:25.990 --> 05:34.190
Let's just change this to Wall and we'll do something like this and we'll eliminate length of wall here.

05:35.390 --> 05:37.920
And wham bam.

05:38.210 --> 05:45.510
And we make that of course and then excuse me this will be we can eliminate this variable as well.

05:45.650 --> 05:47.170
This variable as well.

05:49.570 --> 05:50.240
And nice.

05:50.330 --> 05:53.510
That's a lot cleaner in my opinion than what we had there before.

05:53.930 --> 05:56.180
I saw that as I was doing this we can do better.

05:56.300 --> 06:01.610
So whenever you get a chance refactor your code is very helpful and make it look better if anyone ever

06:01.610 --> 06:02.430
looks at it right.
