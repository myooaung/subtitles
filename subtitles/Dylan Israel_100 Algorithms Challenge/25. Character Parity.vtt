00:00.650 --> 00:02.610
All right so character parody.

00:02.660 --> 00:05.770
This was a fun one and Pritish pretty straightforward.

00:05.780 --> 00:10.760
We've got to use is not a number as one of our hands and parsing which is always get a chance to use

00:10.760 --> 00:10.950
that.

00:10.970 --> 00:16.730
But basically the gist of it here is we're taking in a single character which may be a string the phi

00:16.730 --> 00:18.890
number where it may be an actual character.

00:18.890 --> 00:22.810
If it's a string of high number we want to return if it's even or odd.

00:22.910 --> 00:26.150
And if it is a character we want to return not a digit.

00:26.210 --> 00:26.960
That's really it.

00:26.970 --> 00:29.500
At the end of the day.

00:29.510 --> 00:30.010
All right.

00:30.020 --> 00:35.780
The way that I did this was I created a constant variable that I just called a result and I set it equal

00:35.780 --> 00:43.010
to the parsed value of our symbol parameter.

00:43.040 --> 00:49.580
Now once we have that what I did was I did in the return set in the return statement.

00:49.580 --> 00:54.400
I do a double turn area where the first check I do is it is it not a number.

00:54.410 --> 01:01.310
When you parse a string and there's no number in it it will if you check that result is in fact not

01:01.310 --> 01:06.440
a number and thus that would return true if that's the case I'm going to turn not a digit.

01:06.670 --> 01:11.780
And if it's not I'm going to do my second turn area which is going to check if the result is even or

01:11.780 --> 01:13.280
odd and then return the correct amount.

01:13.280 --> 01:17.860
So here we're safe return is not a number.

01:17.930 --> 01:18.940
Result.

01:19.280 --> 01:26.660
And if that is a true statement what we wanted to return back is not a digit.

01:26.660 --> 01:32.890
Now if that is a false statement we want to do a number check where we want to say take result and model

01:32.930 --> 01:36.270
by two and check if it is the zero.

01:36.470 --> 01:42.200
If it is we want to return even if it's not we want to return faade

01:45.300 --> 01:47.430
to appear real real.

01:47.620 --> 01:54.060
And that's really at the end of the day we can figure out how to parse it without doing a string.

01:54.060 --> 02:00.180
I think the first time I did this I did a very strange map where I said hey if it's 0 1 0 and it was

02:00.220 --> 02:03.990
a very it wasn't a very unique solution.

02:04.350 --> 02:07.950
But at the end of the day this is it pretty much.
