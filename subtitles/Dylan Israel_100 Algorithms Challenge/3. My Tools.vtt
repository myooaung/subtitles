We don't really need much set up a lot of times people ask Hey what are you using.

00:03.970 --> 00:09.760
So here's what I will be doing this entire course and one of my tech center of choice is Visual Studio

00:09.760 --> 00:11.370
code.

00:11.410 --> 00:12.550
My.

00:13.240 --> 00:18.340
That's pretty much it unless you want to use the Koka extension that I'll be using which is going to

00:18.340 --> 00:25.450
allow us to print out the console logs in our actual J.S. file or TS file and see the data.

00:25.450 --> 00:26.910
So if you want to do that.

00:26.930 --> 00:31.360
And I think that's kind of cool and it's a free extension so you might as well check it out as you need

00:31.360 --> 00:33.550
to go ahead and solve note if you don't have it yet.

00:33.580 --> 00:35.390
No just an organ.

00:35.440 --> 00:41.590
And then this extension we can go ahead and install it through the visual studio extensions section

00:42.310 --> 00:44.260
by just jumping in here.

00:44.260 --> 00:47.330
Click in the square box and go in and search for Quokka.

00:47.350 --> 00:48.370
I already have it installed.
