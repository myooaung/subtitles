00:01.050 --> 00:01.890
All right Guy.

00:01.900 --> 00:09.000
So here we are on Largest number and what we're trying to do here is take in a single digit and here

00:09.060 --> 00:13.400
saying and we want to print out the largest number that can come out.

00:13.400 --> 00:18.300
So if it's two it's going to be ninety nine if it's three is going to be nine hundred ninety nine for

00:18.300 --> 00:20.040
nine thousand nine hundred ninety nine.

00:20.160 --> 00:27.690
The largest digit number based off of and that's really it at the end of the day for example here are

00:27.690 --> 00:34.100
for the hints I use concat and parce And let's get started.

00:34.100 --> 00:39.720
All right so the way that I solved this was pretty straightforward.

00:40.080 --> 00:43.980
I created what I called the word it's just going to be a string.

00:44.040 --> 00:46.560
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to iterate through

00:50.150 --> 00:58.760
through the array for the length of then and then I'm just going to concat in a I'm going to concatenate

00:58.820 --> 01:06.350
a 9 on there and then from there all I'm going to do is go ahead and parse the ant at the answer and

01:06.350 --> 01:10.670
say word is equal to Word doc Concat.

01:10.890 --> 01:17.420
You don't have to use concat I just am trying to introduce methods to get you guys comfortable with

01:17.420 --> 01:17.560
it.

01:17.570 --> 01:18.050
We could do.

01:18.050 --> 01:22.650
Plus equals what string says with this string nine as well.

01:22.760 --> 01:30.050
And then at the end here all we want to do is return word parsing of word because it needs to come back

01:30.050 --> 01:30.920
as a integer.

01:30.920 --> 01:35.700
That was our requirement here and I believe I forgot to turn on.

01:36.140 --> 01:41.600
But you'll see here that we get our '99 if we change this to 3 9 9 9.

01:41.600 --> 01:43.320
All that sort of stuff.

01:43.340 --> 01:49.670
But really at the end of the day that's what we're doing here is we're just concatenating Neyens on.

01:49.880 --> 01:58.370
And now that I think about it I think there is a just say word

02:02.900 --> 02:05.970
saurian say.

02:06.460 --> 02:13.800
TR repeat see isn't there a repeat Yeah.

02:13.820 --> 02:15.790
Repeat and repeat.

02:15.800 --> 02:21.090
Nine comma end times that it.

02:21.140 --> 02:26.410
Sorry I spent six when our units were to repeat DO.

02:26.420 --> 02:29.460
Again I thought no I don't use it ever.

02:29.480 --> 02:33.170
As you can tell I thought there was a string repeat.

02:33.280 --> 02:37.450
And you can tell I'm kind of doing this on the spot here.

02:43.150 --> 02:44.110
Oh OK.

02:44.410 --> 02:47.980
When I repeat 9 times that's what it is.

02:47.980 --> 02:48.600
Excellent.

02:48.850 --> 02:52.230
And we're going to search the N word parsed out word here.

02:52.360 --> 02:56.730
That's another way we can solve atomizer fact that is a much better way of solving it.

02:56.730 --> 03:00.050
So we'll do that and I'll go ahead and leave it there.

03:00.280 --> 03:03.480
We can parse that from there and just read it.

03:03.490 --> 03:06.410
We can change at any cost and we're done.
