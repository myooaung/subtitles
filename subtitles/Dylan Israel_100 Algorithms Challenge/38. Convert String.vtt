00:00.730 --> 00:01.720
All right.

00:01.780 --> 00:07.730
So in convert string We are taking in two parameters.

00:07.730 --> 00:13.190
One is a string and the second one is a string we're going to find out if we remove some letters.

00:13.210 --> 00:16.360
If we could in fact get the second word.

00:16.360 --> 00:22.840
So in this crazy string here loops and this crazy string here can we get code fights and it is in fact

00:22.840 --> 00:23.770
true.

00:24.460 --> 00:29.200
And then we do the same thing for this one and you'll see there's no d in our word here and this is

00:29.200 --> 00:30.820
going to return false.

00:30.820 --> 00:32.730
That's really it at the end of the day.

00:32.830 --> 00:37.060
Some hints I use concat and split to solve this.

00:37.240 --> 00:42.700
And it wasn't too bad to be honest with you I enjoyed it quite a bit.

00:42.710 --> 00:45.190
Let's let's go ahead and get started.

00:45.190 --> 00:45.810
All right.

00:45.840 --> 00:52.190
When I saw convert's string was I created an empty word and I also kept track of the index.

00:52.190 --> 00:56.420
Now the reason for that is our Krita index variable.

00:56.520 --> 01:02.260
What we're going to do is we're going to iterate through our long word and then we're going to find

01:02.260 --> 01:05.130
out just concat until that word matches.

01:05.140 --> 01:12.400
And if it does so in our case we're going to return false if our check doesn't pass we're going to do

01:12.400 --> 01:16.040
that like so and now we're going to create a variable here.

01:16.180 --> 01:22.180
We'll call this last word equal and just for the empty string and then we're also going to have an index

01:22.190 --> 01:31.530
value to keep track of all this as index to keep track of where we are.

01:31.540 --> 01:42.640
Excuse me t index where we are in string t to know what letter we're checking for and then we're going

01:42.640 --> 01:49.510
to take s we'll say it costs us what we want to call this

01:52.420 --> 01:59.240
char's is equal to and this is a string array is equal to split.

01:59.260 --> 02:04.600
And we're going to split them up on each character because that's what we're going to be checking against.

02:04.600 --> 02:04.920
All right.

02:04.930 --> 02:05.940
Very nice.

02:05.950 --> 02:11.770
So now what we need to do is we need to iterate through all of our array like so.

02:11.800 --> 02:20.410
So it is less than just live plus plus excellent.

02:20.560 --> 02:29.260
So now that we're here all we need to do is see if the current value that we're checking of our of our

02:29.260 --> 02:40.960
char array of II is equal to the current value of t of the word that we're in check index drink so t

02:40.960 --> 02:42.700
index.

02:42.700 --> 02:44.170
So if that's true

02:46.980 --> 02:47.840
what we want to do.

02:47.850 --> 02:50.920
Meaning that a C matches with a C and we're at that point.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.990
What's that word equal the word doc and cat you two plus two equals.

02:56.220 --> 03:02.340
I was just more or less trying to use some additional methods show that they exist but as of-I.

03:02.430 --> 03:11.190
So we're going to say that is now equal there and now we're going to need to update the index just by

03:11.190 --> 03:16.400
one because now we are saying OK cool we got like in this first and we got our C.

03:16.410 --> 03:22.260
Now as you know we need to say next what we need to check is 0 and last but not least we're going to

03:22.260 --> 03:23.550
do a simple check here.

03:23.670 --> 03:34.130
If word is equal equal to T meaning we have our word return true.

03:37.750 --> 03:39.190
Else return false.

03:41.350 --> 03:42.330
Like so.

03:42.350 --> 03:44.480
So let's just go over the logic again.

03:44.830 --> 03:52.330
We are turning our our array of care or creating an array of characters based off the total available

03:52.330 --> 03:53.310
letters.

03:53.320 --> 03:56.930
We're keeping track of an index value or keeping track of a string.

03:56.980 --> 04:03.130
We're then going to iterate through that array of characters and if it happens to match the letter that

04:03.130 --> 04:10.210
we're currently on in our in our answer string t here we're going to go ahead and Concat that character

04:10.210 --> 04:10.650
onto it.

04:10.660 --> 04:16.810
Add 1 and if at any point our word ever equals our T.

04:16.870 --> 04:20.070
We're going to return TRUE else if we go through this whole loop.

04:20.080 --> 04:23.170
It doesn't have all the characters we need and thus is going to return false.
