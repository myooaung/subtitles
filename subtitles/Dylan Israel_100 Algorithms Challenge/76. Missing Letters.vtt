00:00.620 --> 00:01.430
All right.

00:01.430 --> 00:07.790
So missing letters this is a fun one where we're taking in a string from ADAs the.

00:08.030 --> 00:14.250
Essentially it can it can be from A to Z and if it is we want to return undefined.

00:14.270 --> 00:20.190
If it's not we won't want to return the first letter that is missing.

00:20.220 --> 00:24.860
And our string so ABC we're returning d this string.

00:24.890 --> 00:30.680
The first one that's missing is I and a string from loops and a string from all the way to the end.

00:30.680 --> 00:35.240
We are returning undefined because there is no missing letter.

00:35.420 --> 00:37.420
So that is our objective here.

00:37.430 --> 00:41.430
The only thing I really have for you is split what is good and jump into it.

00:41.450 --> 00:42.050
All right.

00:42.050 --> 00:47.940
So the way that I solve this was I created a constant which is an alphabet string from eight is the

00:47.950 --> 00:49.160
slowest start there.

00:49.320 --> 00:50.420
And credit card.

00:50.570 --> 00:52.610
I'm not that big with consequence.

00:52.910 --> 00:56.660
And we're going to go ahead and call this alphabet.

00:57.090 --> 01:07.150
So this equal to a string and here a b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q r s do you give it to you.

01:07.200 --> 01:07.530
The

01:10.620 --> 01:13.430
W X Y and Z.

01:14.190 --> 01:20.730
So have our alphabet and from here what we want to do is we're going to split up our alphabet into a

01:21.720 --> 01:27.540
a character array and then we're going to iterate through our string that we're going to split up into

01:27.540 --> 01:32.820
a character array and from there what we're going to do we're we are going to compare the letters and

01:32.820 --> 01:35.880
see if they are identical if they are not.

01:35.880 --> 01:40.410
We want to return undefined if there's camera.

01:40.470 --> 01:41.480
Come back to me.

01:41.560 --> 01:44.520
Camera one can go if they are not.

01:44.530 --> 01:50.390
We want to return return the letter that is missing from our alphabet.

01:50.550 --> 01:54.990
So it's gotten to split this up into a character like so.

01:55.350 --> 02:05.630
And then here we'll go ahead and say Konst word is equal to Estuardo split and we'll split that up on

02:05.630 --> 02:12.560
each character and we'll start off real quick and handle some some and so necessary logic for the undefine

02:12.560 --> 02:28.720
and we say look if our word on lexical this char's if our chars of chars 0 is not equal to lowercase

02:28.720 --> 02:32.070
say in this case we don't have to worry about uppercase or lowercase values.

02:32.290 --> 02:33.270
They're all lowercase.

02:33.280 --> 02:36.510
If that is correct mean that they are not.

02:36.570 --> 02:39.320
It is not equal because we are just going to return undefine

02:42.020 --> 02:44.560
like so next.

02:44.580 --> 02:47.990
Well we're going to do is we're going to iterate for the rest of the cases.

02:48.030 --> 02:57.150
That's a unique case where we want to handle it the first character not being there.

02:57.280 --> 03:06.820
But if we're not worried about that we're going to say look let i equal 0 0 is less than our charas

03:07.090 --> 03:10.620
length and check each of these values.

03:11.530 --> 03:12.760
Plus plus.

03:12.760 --> 03:26.480
Now what we're going to do is we're going to iterate through here and see if our value in our char's

03:27.260 --> 03:37.640
that we're checking is not equal to our alphabet meaning that the letters are not instinct and they

03:37.640 --> 03:38.700
should be.

03:39.260 --> 03:42.190
We're going to go ahead and just return that letter of the alphabet.

03:45.750 --> 03:46.140
Which

03:51.510 --> 03:52.350
DNA.

03:52.740 --> 03:53.790
That's it.

03:53.790 --> 03:54.740
At the end of day.

03:55.170 --> 03:58.180
So we are hearing through our strings.

03:58.200 --> 04:05.460
We're creating a essentially a a map at this point and we could if we wanted to it probably be better

04:05.460 --> 04:07.020
to go and create an array.

04:07.020 --> 04:11.760
This is just a little bit quicker and it definitely would be just to create initialize if we're going

04:11.760 --> 04:12.970
to all of this way.

04:13.020 --> 04:18.770
Then creating a character from our input and then we are doing some special.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.000
You even need to do this

04:22.960 --> 04:23.240
now.

04:23.260 --> 04:24.960
But I think this is a console log.

04:24.970 --> 04:25.840
So if you can.

04:25.960 --> 04:28.520
So I think we have to do this here to take a for a door.

04:28.660 --> 04:34.340
The undefined if we try to console log something that doesn't return we think it will return undefined.

04:34.570 --> 04:36.190
It's not actually returning undefined.

04:36.190 --> 04:38.690
It's just Prinny undefined because it's not doing anything.

04:38.890 --> 04:42.880
So I think we do need this logic here but then we're iterating through our characters and we're just

04:42.880 --> 04:51.270
checking to see which is the first value that that returns it doesn't return correctly else.

04:52.760 --> 04:59.510
Actually we're not even returning undefined for this return undefined here for when it gets there all

04:59.510 --> 05:03.280
these values meaning it's gone through and now we're actually returning undefined.

05:03.280 --> 05:08.720
So if we return you know like something like this where we just sort of turn 5.

05:08.820 --> 05:09.430
So yeah.

05:09.500 --> 05:11.940
So we need to handle the undefine case here.

05:13.380 --> 05:15.280
So that's very much it.

05:15.410 --> 05:18.740
So if it gets you all this it means it has a letter Skydome return undefined.

05:18.800 --> 05:25.670
If it doesn't check to see which ones which one is there now think we need this either.

05:25.900 --> 05:28.670
And we can do a quick check.

05:28.670 --> 05:30.830
I don't know why I had that in my code.

05:30.830 --> 05:37.970
Probably because it works because it doesn't do dick and will do something like this where B.C.E. is

05:37.970 --> 05:38.940
going to return.

05:39.020 --> 05:41.000
Because that's the first letter that it's missing.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.090
So you don't need that either.

05:42.090 --> 05:43.360
We can't eliminate that.

05:43.400 --> 05:44.770
Got a little bit of refactoring.

05:44.990 --> 05:47.930
But that idea is pretty much the same alphabet array.

05:47.990 --> 05:50.620
Compare find the first one that doesn't make sense.
