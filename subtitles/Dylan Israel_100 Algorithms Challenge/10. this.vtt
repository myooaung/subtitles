Are at a another really common question you'll get in javascript is what is this.

00:05.160 --> 00:06.560
Define this.

00:07.020 --> 00:15.780
So this refers to the context of what you're working with in a common example of this would be when

00:15.780 --> 00:18.080
it comes to object oriented programming.

00:18.150 --> 00:24.600
So let's say we had some properties or methods and we wanted access to them within the within the same

00:24.600 --> 00:28.830
object we would call this dot proper this dot method name

00:31.650 --> 00:35.760
so as you'll see here we're using this in our constructor.

00:36.210 --> 00:42.120
So we have an example of it using just a class here which we'll just call cat and we'll say by default

00:42.120 --> 00:47.280
they're there four feet but maybe we want to override the amount of fetor you know probably not even

00:47.280 --> 00:53.420
define at all would be fine as well but you'll see that to have access to the feet.

00:53.440 --> 00:57.030
We're saying we on a target field within our class component.

00:57.180 --> 01:05.700
So this dot feet is equal that day that outfit and this will target this target target the property

01:05.760 --> 01:10.080
within the context that we're in in which is the feet property of class.
