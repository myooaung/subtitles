00:00.500 --> 00:06.900
All right so we have a haunted hotel and we know floors are haunted in this two dimensional array where

00:07.590 --> 00:08.780
this is our column right.

00:08.820 --> 00:11.150
Right here these are columns and these are our rows.

00:11.250 --> 00:16.920
And when a column is haunted or a floor is haunted the values below it no longer count as you can see

00:16.920 --> 00:17.870
here.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.160
So what we're trying to get is the total cost of all the available rooms.

00:22.170 --> 00:26.780
We have yet to be haunted so you'll see 1 1 2 0 here.

00:26.880 --> 00:32.040
And so it's no we don't count the zero obviously and we don't count the haunted floors below it and

00:32.050 --> 00:32.860
we get 1 5.

00:32.880 --> 00:35.870
We don't count this because it's a 0 0 0 here.

00:35.880 --> 00:38.500
We don't count the three as well.

00:38.520 --> 00:44.790
Then you'll see we'll add up all the values on the floors that have yet to be haunted below the haunted

00:44.790 --> 00:45.370
floors.

00:45.510 --> 00:46.870
And we end up with nine.

00:46.950 --> 00:54.270
So the values that I use here was push an index of methods and index of what's go ahead and jump into

00:54.270 --> 00:55.080
it.

00:55.080 --> 01:00.060
All right so the way that I solve this was I created this price a variable and then that's what we're

01:00.060 --> 01:08.150
going to modify to return and I create a band index which is going to be an array of The Haunted floors.

01:08.310 --> 01:17.130
And if there's a zero we're going to add that haunted floor and if there is a if there is a if it's

01:17.130 --> 01:22.080
not we're going to just add the value to our price chill because that's what we want to return here.

01:22.650 --> 01:25.800
A little bit of this I already typed out I forgot to delete it.

01:25.950 --> 01:27.860
So I apologize about that.

01:28.140 --> 01:41.050
But let's go ahead and create that brand index not band index but our band index or set it equal to

01:41.050 --> 01:41.930
an empty array.

01:42.250 --> 01:46.150
And we're going to set this to be a number.

01:47.080 --> 01:47.980
Excellent.

01:47.980 --> 01:53.100
So now we are going to iterate through two four loops right because there's a two dimensional array.

01:53.320 --> 01:55.190
So I called to zero.

01:55.240 --> 02:03.570
All eyes less then and index plus plus.

02:04.590 --> 02:10.600
And we're going to do a second for loop because when I checked the column value and the row value and

02:10.730 --> 02:23.530
before that we need to zero on J is less than the matrix of being passed in of high length or the values

02:23.560 --> 02:29.560
in the array the nested array increment through each one.

02:29.680 --> 02:34.550
So we're just put plus plus now all we're going do is we're going to check if that value is a zero.

02:34.570 --> 02:36.590
And if it is we're going to add it to our band index.

02:36.590 --> 02:39.700
So if Matrix I have J.

02:39.730 --> 02:46.450
Her column then row is exactly equal to zero.

02:46.480 --> 02:53.440
We want to go ahead and push the column value which is J.

02:53.510 --> 03:03.820
And so we're going to say band index push J nice LCF.

03:04.690 --> 03:08.410
It's not going to be banned.

03:09.610 --> 03:14.600
Well do check your ban index dot index of J.

03:14.980 --> 03:15.940
Is equally good.

03:15.940 --> 03:18.130
Now you have one man who hasn't been banned yet.

03:18.550 --> 03:22.070
We're going to go ahead and take price level and set it.

03:22.330 --> 03:22.990
Update it.

03:22.990 --> 03:31.140
Plus sequels to The Matrix II Matrix II.

03:32.210 --> 03:32.460
Jay

03:35.510 --> 03:40.480
that's really it at the end of the day did do something wrong here.

03:40.900 --> 03:41.870
Oh see here.

03:41.900 --> 03:46.510
So it doesn't seem we should be getting that.

03:46.520 --> 03:47.150
We'll see.

03:47.150 --> 03:50.190
I might have a slight mistake.

03:50.190 --> 03:55.110
So we're checking the oh not the bad index but with checking the matrix stuff.

03:55.180 --> 03:57.030
There we go.

03:57.160 --> 03:58.480
So go Reloj wartime.

03:58.480 --> 04:01.880
We're creating a variable to store the band values.

04:01.930 --> 04:04.850
We're then going to iterate through the matrix.

04:04.930 --> 04:08.420
We're going to do a check to see if it's a haunted floor.

04:08.710 --> 04:10.650
And then we're going to push that down value.

04:10.720 --> 04:18.940
If it's not a zero we're going to do a check to see if it is a if it is included in the index and we'll

04:18.940 --> 04:21.820
go ahead and change just to includes

04:24.390 --> 04:33.130
I right or J No J and go and go do one of those bad boys because we want it not to be in there and.

04:33.550 --> 04:37.000
And then if it's not in they're going to add the value and finally we are going to return it.
