00:01.200 --> 00:06.840
All right so RE MAX consecutive Some what's our objective here.

00:06.840 --> 00:14.760
Well we want to know what is the max number Windgate if we add two numbers together or caid numbers

00:14.760 --> 00:20.520
together and so you'll see here we have in our example an array of numbers with Keiko's shoes so you'll

00:20.520 --> 00:25.470
see two series Five Three plus five say five plus on a 6 on plus six or seven.

00:25.500 --> 00:32.130
And so our math our highest consecutive sum based off of the number that we're getting here of k is

00:32.130 --> 00:34.480
in fact 8.

00:34.680 --> 00:36.750
All right let's go ahead and solve this one.

00:36.750 --> 00:39.000
I don't really have any hints for this one.

00:39.090 --> 00:48.390
You just have to you know understand what they're asking and be able to iterate through a couple times.

00:48.390 --> 00:53.880
All right so the way I solve this was I created two variables here one called some initialises to zero

00:54.150 --> 00:56.950
and one called Max initializers is there.

00:56.970 --> 01:01.260
And what we're eventually going to return is our max value.

01:01.260 --> 01:10.840
Now I started off by iterating through the array here for my cats closing cupboards opening hours.

01:10.980 --> 01:13.810
So we're just letting them of input array.

01:17.860 --> 01:20.960
And we're going to take notes.

01:21.100 --> 01:24.100
So some sequels to No.

01:24.180 --> 01:24.440
All right.

01:24.460 --> 01:32.050
We're going to get that Max sum and then we're just going to initialize the value here.

01:32.320 --> 01:40.500
And so now that we have that we'll go ahead and set max equal to some very nice.

01:40.580 --> 01:46.700
Now the next thing that we have to do is we have to take into consideration that K and we're going to

01:46.700 --> 01:54.250
start by slowly minus seeing the values from that array like so.

01:54.290 --> 01:56.990
So we're going to have a for loop.

01:57.170 --> 02:00.520
So what I equal to we're going to start off OK.

02:00.890 --> 02:13.850
And then we're going to say Well I it's less than the input array length plus plus call.

02:13.910 --> 02:22.940
Now what we want to do is want a minus equal some from that value in the input array of minus K..

02:23.090 --> 02:26.900
This will give us the ability once we then add the next value.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.520
So we're taking off values Cahoot.

02:28.550 --> 02:38.750
We can only have so many values in there and this will give us a value here so some Plus equals input

02:38.750 --> 02:42.540
array.

02:43.370 --> 02:48.110
And now that we've done that and we've added new value in myself really what we're going to do from

02:48.110 --> 02:58.470
here is all we have to do is just do a simple statement say look if the sum is greater than the max.

02:58.790 --> 03:01.580
Go ahead and set max equal to some

03:04.530 --> 03:05.610
and we're done at the end.

03:05.610 --> 03:08.010
And that was that was it a lot.

03:08.220 --> 03:11.150
I feel like my logic is a little bit flawed in here in the shuffle.

03:11.150 --> 03:13.170
A better way to solve this.

03:13.440 --> 03:19.980
But at the end of the day this worked in this past you know the 20 tests we only have one test year.

03:19.980 --> 03:24.420
But when I did pass the 20 or so actually that's they're turning their own over

03:30.350 --> 03:31.810
my nooner on here.

03:32.180 --> 03:35.610
Oh whoops I mean a little bit of an error in my logic here.

03:35.670 --> 03:38.080
I changed this by mistake.

03:38.180 --> 03:41.210
And so this is actually needs to only iterate.

03:41.250 --> 03:44.050
So the reason that we have this first for loop.

03:44.850 --> 03:50.730
So we're just getting the value we're initializing the value of the max here.

03:50.730 --> 03:54.750
And so we're are say well I was listening K plus plus.

03:54.750 --> 04:00.180
And now here we have input array and pass and I

04:04.810 --> 04:08.060
go a little bit of a.

04:08.780 --> 04:10.070
That makes a lot more sense.

04:10.270 --> 04:14.640
So we're let's go through logic one time because we made some mistakes here.

04:14.770 --> 04:17.560
We are creating two values one is some.

04:17.560 --> 04:18.880
And one is the max value.

04:18.880 --> 04:27.310
We're then going to find the consecutive numbers up to K to initialize our max value.

04:27.430 --> 04:33.430
We are then going to start off AK because we're already there and minus that value then add another

04:33.430 --> 04:33.860
one.

04:34.090 --> 04:38.410
And then we're going to do a check to see if we want to reset it and then go through the whole array

04:38.410 --> 04:40.390
and finally return the max.

04:40.400 --> 04:47.700
I got a little lost there and here and I'm sorry if that's a little bit confusing but here let's go

04:47.700 --> 04:48.920
ahead and move on to the next one.
