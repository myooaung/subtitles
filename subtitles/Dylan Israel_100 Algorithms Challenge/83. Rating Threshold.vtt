00:01.260 --> 00:03.510
All are right rading threshold.

00:03.510 --> 00:12.330
So here we have a bunch of pro Thum tackers and we they have an array of ratings for them about how

00:12.330 --> 00:15.220
well they're doing between 1 to 5.

00:15.240 --> 00:22.090
Now when one of these pros has an average rating that is less than 3.5.

00:22.170 --> 00:29.370
We want to turn in an array and end their index values saying hey this pro one needs to be reviewed

00:29.370 --> 00:30.290
manually reviewed.

00:30.300 --> 00:32.010
That's what our objective here is.

00:32.010 --> 00:36.040
So in this case three and four that's going to have 3.5 3 3 3 and 4.

00:36.090 --> 00:39.400
It's going to have just under 3.5 so index one here.

00:39.630 --> 00:44.680
That's a pro number one needs to be reviewed and then four is above 3.5 So that's.

00:44.680 --> 00:47.070
So we're going to return in a rate of 1.

00:47.130 --> 00:51.050
That's our objective here when we find out which one of these guys seem to be reviewed.

00:51.080 --> 00:53.500
Is more of a logic and math based one.

00:53.910 --> 01:01.440
At the end of day the only really hands I have free is I use push to store the review.

01:01.440 --> 01:03.700
Let's go ahead and jump into it.

01:04.050 --> 01:04.590
All right.

01:04.590 --> 01:09.840
So one thing I in May a little bit unclear as I said 3.5 specifically but we're actually passing in

01:09.840 --> 01:11.770
our threshold value here.

01:12.030 --> 01:15.100
So it doesn't necessarily it's not necessarily going to be 3.5.

01:15.100 --> 01:20.550
It could be though in our example but we don't want to hard code that right what we're expected to return

01:20.550 --> 01:22.080
here is our number.

01:22.170 --> 01:23.610
We're passing our threshold.

01:23.610 --> 01:25.660
And then of course our ratings that come with it.

01:25.830 --> 01:29.870
So the way that I saw this was we know that we want to return an array.

01:29.940 --> 01:34.170
So we're going to create the review array the people we're going to review.

01:34.180 --> 01:37.980
This is going to be a number array re-initialize.

01:38.100 --> 01:41.630
And at the end here we want to do is go ahead and return review.

01:42.480 --> 01:47.640
Now from here it's just a matter of iterating through both for loops Let's start there.

01:47.640 --> 01:50.440
So we're going to start with a standard for Lupul.

01:50.890 --> 01:52.440
It's less than zero.

01:53.000 --> 02:02.430
I mean it is less than our Raytheon's length continue iterating through I plus plus and we're uncreate

02:02.550 --> 02:04.160
what I call the total here.

02:04.350 --> 02:10.470
So wristlet total equal to zero because we have to store something to find the average of it and that's

02:10.470 --> 02:12.310
what we're doing with our total variable here.

02:12.450 --> 02:15.180
And then we're going to go ahead and iterate through

02:18.330 --> 02:23.550
through our value here and actually go ahead and use a for loop for this we don't have to for each loop

02:23.550 --> 02:25.260
for or ratings.

02:25.620 --> 02:34.500
I dot for each element we'll just say rating what they are and our ratings here.

02:34.540 --> 02:37.780
If we want to sign a value are actually going to be number.

02:37.830 --> 02:38.570
Have to sign on.

02:38.580 --> 02:40.010
But I think it's all right.

02:40.830 --> 02:45.270
And then we just want a total plus equals each rating.

02:45.930 --> 02:53.320
That's our total rating and probably we should rename that I think that's a better variable name here.

02:53.760 --> 03:01.890
So tolerating plus equal or 80 and now we just have a simple IF statement says hey if our total divided

03:01.890 --> 03:12.750
by our current rating ratings I dot length the amount of ratings that are in there if that is less than

03:12.750 --> 03:15.350
our threshold that we're passing it.

03:15.850 --> 03:24.420
And again this is totally what we're going to do here is we're going to take that review the rate and

03:24.420 --> 03:29.310
we're going to push the index value on there and that's it.

03:29.310 --> 03:32.130
So to go over the logic roll group we create a rate of return.

03:32.250 --> 03:33.690
We're iterating through the array.

03:33.690 --> 03:39.050
We have a variable here to keep track of the amount of total ratings.

03:39.080 --> 03:44.260
Then we divide by the length of that array to get our average and if our average is less than our threshold

03:44.280 --> 03:46.530
real push that rate that's pretty much it.
