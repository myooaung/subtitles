All right array replace we're going to take in three three parameters the input array which is going

00:08.250 --> 00:13.200
to be an array numbers and element to replace and a substitute element.

00:13.200 --> 00:17.380
So our objective here is we're going to iterate through the array.

00:17.550 --> 00:25.620
We're then going to find the element that we're in check to see if that value is the element to replace

00:25.620 --> 00:29.250
if it is risk swap it out with the substitution element.

00:29.250 --> 00:34.470
I don't really have any hints for you for this one this is just a pure logic sort of algorithm.

00:34.530 --> 00:36.920
Let's jump right into it.

00:36.930 --> 00:37.400
All right.

00:37.400 --> 00:38.810
Slade is this is.

00:38.910 --> 00:40.880
I didn't have a variable or anything.

00:40.880 --> 00:44.720
I store this I basically just modified and put a array.

00:44.880 --> 00:51.990
So at the end here what we want to return is a modified version of input array and I took our input

00:51.990 --> 00:57.910
array and I just used it for each loop on it and on here.

00:58.050 --> 01:00.590
And I think I might be able to refine this but we'll do it this way.

01:00.590 --> 01:07.290
I pass in an element an index element would be a number and it would also be a number.

01:08.830 --> 01:19.210
And I just checked to see if our current value in our in our array is exactly equal to the element to

01:19.210 --> 01:21.360
replace.

01:21.670 --> 01:23.800
We want to go ahead and set the and put her

01:27.070 --> 01:33.250
on that index equal to a substitution element.

01:33.250 --> 01:35.270
Now I'm looking at this and that's it.

01:35.320 --> 01:36.890
We're done actually.

01:36.980 --> 01:39.570
I only get on this second second class.

01:39.580 --> 01:47.830
I think what we can do is eliminate this index and just set element equal to that.

01:48.170 --> 01:51.180
For some reason that doesn't do it which is very surprising.

01:51.220 --> 01:54.120
So I did I did for some reason have this set

01:59.150 --> 01:59.540
up.

01:59.610 --> 02:02.280
I wonder if it's because it stores a reference to it perhaps.

02:02.490 --> 02:05.330
I'd have to look a little bit more into the fine details for each.

02:05.460 --> 02:07.300
But the logic is pretty much the same here.

02:07.440 --> 02:12.330
We're then changed and then put the value here where you answer it we're doing the check and then if

02:12.330 --> 02:15.060
it is true we're going to go ahead and reset the value there.

02:15.180 --> 02:17.000
Then finally just turn that around.
