All right so we are going to affect your lives a number that means that we are going to take in a number

00:06.180 --> 00:11.570
such as five and then we're going to find the factorial which is starting for one of that number multiplying

00:11.670 --> 00:14.390
all of the values to get in this case 120.

00:14.410 --> 00:20.380
If you do 10 would then be was this three million six hundred twenty eight thousand eight hundred.

00:20.400 --> 00:21.420
So that's our objective here.

00:21.420 --> 00:25.560
I don't have any hints this is pure logic one to kind of get you going.

00:25.680 --> 00:26.380
All right.

00:26.580 --> 00:32.220
So when I saw this was I obviously just created this total which I initialises you and I eventually

00:32.220 --> 00:34.710
return total.

00:34.820 --> 00:35.370
All right.

00:35.550 --> 00:38.480
And from here on I'm going home and create a for loop.

00:38.490 --> 00:40.360
So all eyes are equal to zero.

00:40.380 --> 00:44.280
Actually can here you just set it to one.

00:44.770 --> 00:51.630
We will go ahead and say that towable equal to one as well.

00:51.710 --> 00:52.940
Toll's going to be one.

00:53.100 --> 00:55.970
Because if we multiply by zero we'll never get out of that.

00:56.070 --> 01:03.540
I will say a lie is less than the number I plus plus we may have to play around with this.

01:03.540 --> 01:06.570
I don't have my solution off hand so no big deal.

01:06.610 --> 01:12.930
And we want to switch just one take total and times equals it to I.

01:13.410 --> 01:17.930
And you'll see here we're currently going to get 24 and then we're off by 1.

01:17.940 --> 01:22.620
We're going to go ahead and add 1 to this number because we want to actually multiply the number that's

01:22.620 --> 01:24.560
on there as well.

01:24.930 --> 01:26.510
Let's see is it better to add one.

01:26.550 --> 01:30.960
I think instead of adding one what we'll do is we'll just do less than or equal to include that number

01:30.960 --> 01:34.230
because that's really what we want to do we want to include that number.

01:34.230 --> 01:35.840
So initialize it to 1.

01:35.910 --> 01:43.270
We then multiply each of these values to go and get the factorial essentially until we're there including

01:43.270 --> 01:44.930
the number we're going up to.

01:44.980 --> 01:46.930
And and then we just return the total.

01:46.930 --> 01:47.660
That's pretty much it.
