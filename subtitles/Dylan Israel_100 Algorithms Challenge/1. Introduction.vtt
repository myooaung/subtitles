00:01.290 --> 00:01.920
All right.

00:01.920 --> 00:07.650
Welcome to the technical side of phone screen section of this course is something I'm adding after the

00:07.650 --> 00:11.250
fact because I think it's equally as important as solving the algorithms.

00:11.250 --> 00:15.840
Typically your average interview process might go you have a phone call with a recruiter going to kind

00:15.840 --> 00:19.040
of verify your resume a little bit asking some basic questions.

00:19.050 --> 00:24.540
Nothing technical usually and then you'll follow up with one of the devs that you may or may not be

00:24.540 --> 00:26.100
working with.

00:26.220 --> 00:31.650
And in that interview you typically will have about a 30 minute phone screen where they're going to

00:31.650 --> 00:35.270
be asking you questions about your subject matter of choice right.

00:35.340 --> 00:38.190
In this case we're talking about javascript type truth.

00:38.400 --> 00:41.280
What are the what are the questions that they're going to be asking.

00:41.280 --> 00:45.750
That's what this section is about how to ask them and the way these these videos are going to go is

00:45.960 --> 00:50.070
first so I say what the question is then I'm going to answer it and then I'm going to explain it in

00:50.070 --> 00:55.340
code right so you won't have an opportunity most of the time to explain it in code.

00:55.380 --> 01:01.740
But the answer is important because I want you to be able to clearly communicate what the answer is

01:01.740 --> 01:04.020
correctly over you know audio.

01:04.020 --> 01:09.960
That's why we're doing the the video part first and then I want you to understand it as well right.

01:10.110 --> 01:14.560
No one wants to go and memorize this stuff but so that's how this section is going to go.

01:14.670 --> 01:16.280
And let's go ahead and jump into.
