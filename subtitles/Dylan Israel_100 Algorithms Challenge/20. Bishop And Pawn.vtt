00:00.750 --> 00:07.320
All right Bishop and the pawn so if you feel if you have ever played chess before the bishop can go

00:07.320 --> 00:11.520
diagonally in any direction that it is on the same color.

00:11.550 --> 00:16.980
So you'll see here so that we are going here we are going there we are going here we are going there.

00:17.130 --> 00:19.720
And so we're going to get is a.

00:20.100 --> 00:25.560
And if you don't know how chess works this is essentially a one be one two and you can see it's kind

00:25.560 --> 00:26.580
of on a chart graph.

00:26.580 --> 00:33.420
So what we're going to get is the bishop position which will be our first parameter and the pawn position

00:33.540 --> 00:37.470
which will be our second one and we need to return a true or false value.

00:37.470 --> 00:39.860
If it's going to be able to hit our pawn.

00:39.870 --> 00:47.660
So if our bishop is on a 1 and our pawn is on C3 we need to understand that he can hit it.

00:47.670 --> 00:50.960
That is our objective here with this algorithm.

00:51.060 --> 00:57.570
I remember struggling very much so on this until I thought of a unique way to solve this problem I don't

00:57.570 --> 01:01.740
know if it's unique but it was a very straightforward way of solving this problem.

01:01.740 --> 01:03.210
So let's go to dive into it.

01:03.210 --> 01:11.410
The only hint I have for this is that I use parts and the rest is just logic and understanding the board.

01:11.440 --> 01:16.010
All right so the way I solved this was there's actually a mathematical equation.

01:16.020 --> 01:23.570
If you create a board object which I did and we can see if they line up when we add a couple of values.

01:23.700 --> 01:27.210
And so that's what we're going to do to start by creating a board.

01:27.790 --> 01:30.140
Then this will be a constant.

01:30.320 --> 01:32.130
Well in my example here I did not do that.

01:32.130 --> 01:34.690
Shame on me for not making that concept.

01:34.980 --> 01:39.020
And so here we have remember how we had a.

01:39.030 --> 01:44.890
So it is a one B will be a two

01:48.700 --> 01:54.400
C K C will be 3.

01:54.860 --> 01:57.200
Oh my goodness I'm just fat finger and everything.

01:57.340 --> 01:58.580
So D.

01:59.110 --> 02:01.150
Well we have four.

02:01.560 --> 02:04.990
He will be a five.

02:05.930 --> 02:18.720
And then if we say X and then he will be a seven.

02:19.190 --> 02:20.920
And finally H.

02:22.750 --> 02:25.660
Will be a 8.

02:25.660 --> 02:25.950
All right.

02:25.960 --> 02:26.730
Excellent.

02:26.740 --> 02:34.540
So we have our board now what we need to do is we need to get the the letter values so the bishop's

02:34.600 --> 02:35.970
x and y values.

02:35.980 --> 02:44.850
So we're going out of here through another Conte's or this bishop x is equal to the board.

02:44.860 --> 02:45.480
Bishop

02:48.110 --> 02:48.740
zero.

02:48.750 --> 02:53.730
So remember these are strings and we're targeting the very first character so this way and you'll see

02:53.730 --> 02:58.770
winning passport and here we're say board of keyway which will return the value 1.

02:58.830 --> 03:04.950
And now we're going to do the same thing almost the same thing for Bishop Y and we're going to set this

03:04.950 --> 03:16.040
equal to the parse value of Biche up on index 1 to 1.

03:16.050 --> 03:17.960
We want that treated as an integer.

03:18.120 --> 03:18.770
So cool.

03:18.840 --> 03:24.510
And let's go and just put return false on here because we're expecting a boolean output so we can handle

03:24.510 --> 03:27.020
the true statements and false statements.

03:27.290 --> 03:32.730
It's going to create another cost because now we're going to the same exact thing except this is now

03:32.730 --> 03:36.310
going to be the pond's x and y coordinates so we'll call this pawn.

03:36.330 --> 03:43.220
X is going to be equal to board up.

03:43.810 --> 03:54.050
X is a board pawn zero so that the numerical value in our end create another cost which will be porn

03:54.080 --> 04:02.090
y and this will be good to board on 3 percent

04:05.740 --> 04:12.250
of board of porn I'm really killing it right now.

04:12.260 --> 04:14.260
Porn boy.

04:15.190 --> 04:16.120
Excellent.

04:16.120 --> 04:25.210
So now we have the values of R X Y and R x and y for the bishop and R x and y is done at this point.

04:25.420 --> 04:29.590
You know if you did this you probably figured out that there is an association if you add these together

04:29.800 --> 04:32.490
so there's true true values that we have here.

04:32.620 --> 04:51.230
If the if the bishop X plus the bishop Y is equal equal equal to the porn y plus the pawn X we return

04:51.230 --> 04:51.690
true.

04:51.770 --> 05:01.970
But there's also another or here or if either one is the history the bishop X plus the upon Y is equal

05:01.970 --> 05:13.160
equal equal to the pawn X plus the bishop y we return true and that's it.

05:13.160 --> 05:14.090
At the end of the day.

05:14.090 --> 05:19.340
So if you're able to look at the the graph and see that there is a new as even though there is an A1

05:19.340 --> 05:24.500
and B when all this or so that there's a number associated with it and draw the be able to figure out

05:24.530 --> 05:30.380
this sort of little equation here of how those numbers represent each other it's just a matter pulling

05:30.380 --> 05:32.600
the data out and comparing them.

05:32.690 --> 05:38.060
I found this one a bit hard because I originally didn't know where to start.

05:38.070 --> 05:42.560
Right and I find that to be the hardest thing and I say I practice more and more with these algorithms

05:42.920 --> 05:48.620
and I continue going through I start to see these patterns of OK now we're treating things like an X

05:48.620 --> 05:50.290
and a Y What does that mean.

05:50.360 --> 05:53.290
How do we make those comparisons how you know without getting overwhelmed.

05:53.300 --> 05:55.640
So that was this problem that show.
