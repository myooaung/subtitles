00:00.810 --> 00:03.880
All right so extract each.

00:03.900 --> 00:06.160
Kate Kate Elman essentially.

00:06.270 --> 00:08.640
So what we're doing here is are taking an array.

00:08.640 --> 00:14.700
And we want to remove the every k element in this case it's a number right.

00:14.700 --> 00:24.390
So we're saying hey remove each third value so 1 2 4 5 7 8 10 would be the resulting array.

00:24.390 --> 00:29.690
The only hint I have that I use Was I use the array method filter.

00:30.090 --> 00:31.110
Pretty straightforward.

00:31.140 --> 00:34.860
There's a couple different ways we could solve this you don't have to use filter but it's pretty much

00:34.860 --> 00:39.460
what is designed for it in terms of doing something exactly like this.

00:39.470 --> 00:39.980
All right.

00:39.990 --> 00:43.700
So as you might have guessed I use filter for this one.

00:43.740 --> 00:45.020
It's pretty straightforward.

00:45.030 --> 00:51.870
All things consider the only thing that I did was I created a return statement here I took our input

00:51.870 --> 00:56.640
array and then I filtered the results into a new array that was returned.

00:56.820 --> 01:00.870
And then here we're going to have the element and we're also going to take the index from it because

01:00.870 --> 01:04.740
we're in you didn't know what the index value was to return it.

01:04.800 --> 01:18.520
So the values we want to return are when index plus 1 modulo K is not equal equal to zero.

01:18.630 --> 01:28.190
Now the reason that we have that plus one is simply because the index value is you know the third value

01:28.190 --> 01:29.480
is going to be indexed to.

01:29.640 --> 01:32.140
And so this is where logic goes with it.

01:32.220 --> 01:34.280
So we're just adding one to the index value.

01:34.320 --> 01:40.200
We're finding out if it's evenly divisible by that if it is we don't want to include it and those we

01:40.200 --> 01:40.940
don't.

01:41.310 --> 01:47.100
And that's pretty much it at the end of the day we filtered it down and said look we don't want whatever

01:47.100 --> 01:50.150
k index value to be added to our new array.
