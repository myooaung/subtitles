One tip I want to give you before we go into the actual questions as well as to answer things fully.

00:07.060 --> 00:12.760
And our first example will give an example of that with the double equals triple equals but you need

00:12.760 --> 00:19.060
to answer fully is when they answer ask a question not only to answer it but to give an example and

00:19.330 --> 00:25.890
make sure you're using the correct terminology as well if you know it if you don't that's fine say that

00:26.110 --> 00:32.920
but you need to answer things fully with examples terminology and sometimes even just reiterate it with

00:32.920 --> 00:33.590
a set.

00:33.610 --> 00:35.740
A second example if it's relevant.
