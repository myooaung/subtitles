00:00.680 --> 00:01.390
All right.

00:01.400 --> 00:07.700
So where we are on proper noun correction what we're trying to do here is we're going to pass in a string

00:07.940 --> 00:12.920
and we want to treat it as a proper name meaning that we want to have the first letter capitalized in

00:12.920 --> 00:17.330
the rest of it lowercase So in our example here is Paris come out like this.

00:18.290 --> 00:25.960
An example like John it'll come out as strong some methods or some hints that I use was to uppercase

00:25.960 --> 00:34.320
to lowercase concat and slice a lot of methods for pretty simple simple function.

00:34.400 --> 00:35.720
It was great and jump into it.

00:36.700 --> 00:42.340
All right so we talked a little bit about what the objective here is and really what it's comes down

00:42.340 --> 00:47.350
to two pieces the first character which we need to uppercase and the rest of the string which we need

00:47.350 --> 00:49.580
to lower case that's what we're into right now.

00:49.600 --> 00:54.660
So you go ahead and create this Conte's and we're just going to call this first char and where it's

00:54.660 --> 01:02.080
at this equal to the noun that we're passing in that we're now going to make proper and that zero character

01:02.080 --> 01:08.600
on that very first character we want to put the two uppercase value of it.

01:08.870 --> 01:14.830
Now after that what we want to do is we want to get the rest of the values in lowercase and the way

01:14.830 --> 01:19.690
that we can do that is we can just create this rail which I just call the rest of word.

01:19.900 --> 01:26.590
And we're going to slice off all of the string except the very first index values so we're going to

01:26.590 --> 01:32.800
slice it off starting on the one index and not the zero because we don't want that and going for the

01:32.800 --> 01:42.280
length of the string and on top of that will reduce and go ahead and chain the two lower case the value

01:42.280 --> 01:43.590
here together.

01:43.690 --> 01:49.620
And now all we have to do is return that value and we can go ahead and take the first chart and concat

01:50.260 --> 01:55.320
the value rest of word on top of it and we're done.

01:55.330 --> 02:01.870
It's going to handle all cases of a single string coming in regardless of how many are capitalized and

02:01.870 --> 02:03.620
whatnot.

02:03.730 --> 02:04.970
Pretty straightforward.

02:05.130 --> 02:06.980
Our rhythm just really testing your.

02:07.090 --> 02:10.890
Hey can I put all these little pieces together these four little methods together.

02:10.930 --> 02:13.440
Not the only way to solve it but it's a simple way.
