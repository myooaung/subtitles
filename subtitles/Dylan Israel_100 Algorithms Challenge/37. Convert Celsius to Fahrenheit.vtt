00:00.600 --> 00:03.490
All right here we have a nice little warm up out of them.

00:03.510 --> 00:07.010
We want to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit.

00:07.020 --> 00:08.780
That's our goal here.

00:08.810 --> 00:16.380
The the algorithm to do the math to do that is you know temporary Celsius times nine fifths plus 32

00:16.380 --> 00:17.340
degrees.

00:17.340 --> 00:25.770
So when we are getting 30 hours or inputting returned nager 22 or you have 10 returns 14 and we're getting

00:26.460 --> 00:28.190
there to eat zero returns.

00:28.230 --> 00:29.510
Thirty two.

00:29.670 --> 00:31.330
Let's go ahead and dive into it.

00:32.250 --> 00:32.660
All right.

00:32.670 --> 00:38.470
So this and the ad one that we had early in the sector are probably going to be the two easiest algorithms

00:38.580 --> 00:41.430
which is really just to get you going at the end of the day.

00:41.430 --> 00:48.060
So let's go ahead and say you know basically Can you read instructions as sort of the idea here and

00:48.060 --> 00:51.040
do you understand how to use mathematical operators.

00:51.090 --> 00:58.770
So they told us how to what our values are here and they said look the way that we get our our input

00:58.770 --> 01:04.720
is Celsius times nine divided by five plus 32.

01:05.460 --> 01:05.940
That's it.

01:05.940 --> 01:07.410
At the end of the day

01:10.230 --> 01:12.010
you know it's just being able to.

01:12.020 --> 01:19.170
Hey can we use our input can we read the instructions and see what the output should you know how to

01:19.560 --> 01:22.180
parse the algorithm question can we read through.

01:22.230 --> 01:23.990
And this is an important skill.

01:24.300 --> 01:29.340
But this is definitely a hey let's just get you up and running a sort of algorithm you know sort of

01:29.510 --> 01:31.190
first one a very easy one.

01:31.480 --> 01:33.090
In that category I would throw out into.
