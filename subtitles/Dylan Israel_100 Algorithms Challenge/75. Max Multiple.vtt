00:00.690 --> 00:06.780
So here we have a little bit of a math heavy rhythm for Max multiple We are taking in a divisor and

00:06.780 --> 00:15.160
we are taking in a bound and maximal is kind of a strange name for this boy Bisley three rules and we

00:15.970 --> 00:24.390
we are saying End is devised well by a number our result is also less than or equal to the bound and

00:24.390 --> 00:25.680
is no greater than.

00:25.770 --> 00:29.930
And it is greater than zero and they are guaranteeing that we are.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.100
There is a real number for input.

00:33.150 --> 00:35.520
In our example we're just going to do this first on three and 10.

00:35.520 --> 00:36.750
I have no hints for you.

00:36.780 --> 00:42.750
It's a sort of a math problem if you don't think of it that way but really it is here to see if you

00:42.750 --> 00:47.010
can understand just a little bit of algorithm talk I think more than anything else.

00:47.010 --> 00:51.240
All right so hopefully you had a second to look at sort of those three requirements and really take

00:51.240 --> 00:56.770
a look at it and understand what they were asking what they were asking was.

00:57.030 --> 01:03.810
We need to modulo are bound by the divider and find out what that is.

01:03.810 --> 01:06.630
And then with our bound I called the remainder.

01:06.690 --> 01:08.400
That's our actual solution.

01:08.400 --> 01:15.990
So we're going to create a variable here which I call remainder and we're going to take bound and modular

01:16.230 --> 01:17.930
by the divisor.

01:18.530 --> 01:21.250
I sort of step one to actually getting the result that we want.

01:21.480 --> 01:28.170
And then we're going to return the bound minus the remainder.

01:28.170 --> 01:30.990
That's really it at the end of the day.

01:31.200 --> 01:37.380
There's a lot of sort of algorithm talk in it and sometimes when you do these algorithms cites and problems

01:37.380 --> 01:42.670
like that they want to get you used to those those types of questions and that type of talk.

01:42.670 --> 01:46.650
There's probably a much easier way to explain this problem in sort of plain old English.

01:46.660 --> 01:50.310
The end is this if J is this and if this correlated with this.

01:50.340 --> 01:53.620
And you know if it's a full moon you know whatever.

01:53.660 --> 01:56.430
So that's really all they were asking at the end of the day.
