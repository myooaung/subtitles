00:00.520 --> 00:01.100
All right.

00:01.100 --> 00:02.120
Shape area.

00:02.130 --> 00:11.580
So we're going to be taking in a single number and based off of it we're going to be building now a

00:11.850 --> 00:16.100
sort of sort of plus sign a little bit for each iteration.

00:16.110 --> 00:21.420
Our objective here is to find out how many of these squares based off of and the number that's being

00:21.420 --> 00:22.470
passed in that we're going to have.

00:22.470 --> 00:29.500
So for two we would have five squares and for three if you count these up we'll have a total of 13.

00:29.550 --> 00:31.010
That's our objective here.

00:31.200 --> 00:32.580
Let's go ahead and jump into it.

00:32.580 --> 00:33.510
I don't have any hints for you.

00:33.510 --> 00:35.640
This is a pure logic one.

00:36.270 --> 00:41.750
So use this image and try to see if you can find the pattern and solve it.

00:42.030 --> 00:48.200
Hopefully I didn't give it away too much and look for a pattern and hopefully you're able to find one.

00:48.210 --> 00:55.050
So the way that I solve this was what we're basically have to see is that for every additional eye we're

00:55.050 --> 01:00.350
adding 4 on to our value a multiple of four past one.

01:00.750 --> 01:03.780
So the way that we do this we set an area little one.

01:03.870 --> 01:06.860
We're going to return area.

01:06.930 --> 01:15.340
Now we're going to iterate through a for loop starting one because we already have the one value we've

01:15.430 --> 01:21.240
initialize when when winner and is equal to one here so there's no reason to do that iteration or say

01:21.240 --> 01:26.730
Y is less than an increase by now the whole thing here is.

01:26.730 --> 01:33.270
Were you able to see the pattern if you were what you would go is our area is equal to four times each.

01:33.900 --> 01:34.430
That's it.

01:34.440 --> 01:42.180
So on one end when we get to we're going to multiply four by that number one less than the previous.

01:42.180 --> 01:43.760
And that's it.

01:43.770 --> 01:46.260
We've really solved it at that point.

01:46.800 --> 01:49.590
It's it took me a moment to be able solve this.

01:49.590 --> 01:55.110
I try to do a bunch of different patterns where I thought I tried to treat it as a square and then minus

01:55.110 --> 02:00.900
a few and what eventually helped me solve this was I pulled out a white board and in different colors

02:01.170 --> 02:04.370
I drew it out piece by piece for each number section.

02:04.380 --> 02:07.900
I drew it out until I fully understood the pattern.

02:07.920 --> 02:12.000
So sometimes you have to just break it down piece by piece and figure it out.

02:12.000 --> 02:12.900
This was one of those.
