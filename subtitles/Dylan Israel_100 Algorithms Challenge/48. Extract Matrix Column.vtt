00:00.670 --> 00:07.950
All right extract matrix column so well we're going to have here is a two dimensional array with a bunch

00:07.950 --> 00:14.400
of numbers in there and then we're going to get a index value or a column value.

00:14.520 --> 00:21.460
And what we're expected to return is a array of those values so if the column is true or index to where

00:21.470 --> 00:23.670
we are in turn 1 we're in turn 0.

00:23.670 --> 00:25.240
We're going to return 3.

00:25.260 --> 00:29.920
The only hint I really have for you is that I use push as a method in here.

00:30.240 --> 00:33.000
Let's go ahead and get started.

00:33.000 --> 00:41.640
All right so when I saw this was I created a array that I just called Matrix column and this is going

00:41.640 --> 00:47.260
to be a number single dimension number and we're going to initialize it to an empty array at the end

00:47.270 --> 00:47.860
here.

00:47.880 --> 00:55.570
Only 1 do is go ahead and take matrix column and us and just return it.

00:55.590 --> 01:04.110
Now we have this column number here and all we have to do is take our two dimensional array matrix and

01:04.170 --> 01:10.890
iterate over it and just take what we'll call row for our element to paint the picture a little bit

01:11.310 --> 01:16.250
and put make sure it's column push.

01:17.070 --> 01:19.260
Or do we push in from each one of these rows.

01:19.260 --> 01:25.650
Well we're going to be pushing the column value column which essentially is our index value and that's

01:25.650 --> 01:29.100
it really at the end of the day it's going to subtract it out.

01:29.100 --> 01:36.990
So just to go over the logic real quick we can go ahead and say look go and get the matrix created.

01:37.020 --> 01:37.890
Create an array.

01:38.190 --> 01:42.670
Iterate through our two dimensional matrix on each one of the rows.

01:42.750 --> 01:47.690
Go ahead and push the column value that we want which are right here.

01:47.790 --> 01:49.560
And then finally just return the array.
