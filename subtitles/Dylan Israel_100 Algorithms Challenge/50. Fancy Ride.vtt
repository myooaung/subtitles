00:00.740 --> 00:02.160
All right so here was a fun one.

00:02.160 --> 00:09.330
This was another one of the Hey I solved this in five minutes for our company of them problems specifically

00:09.330 --> 00:10.350
for Uber.

00:10.350 --> 00:16.140
So the scenario is you are a new uber user and you have a $20 off your first ride and you want a ball

00:16.140 --> 00:17.430
hard but not too hard.

00:17.430 --> 00:19.430
Basically you have five options.

00:19.430 --> 00:24.380
You can order racks and racks it plus were black and uber SUV.

00:24.390 --> 00:32.100
So essentially we have $20 and we want to know with the length of the ride and with these ride numbers

00:32.100 --> 00:41.940
here are with these and the fares here what is the largest What is with the fares being passed in what

00:41.940 --> 00:51.930
is the highest value that we can we can sort of ball on and not not have to pay any money out of pocket.

00:51.990 --> 00:53.570
So it's.

00:53.730 --> 00:56.610
And then just return that specific ride.

00:56.880 --> 00:57.920
That's basically it.

00:57.930 --> 00:59.590
I don't really have any hints for you.

00:59.590 --> 01:03.660
This is just sort of a math and algorithm type one.

01:03.660 --> 01:10.560
The only thing keep in mind is that fares go from largest to smallest smallest to largest as you could

01:10.560 --> 01:10.890
see them.

01:10.890 --> 01:12.180
So these are in order.

01:12.200 --> 01:18.710
You were Access Point three Lubeck Zale point five Cedric's center SUV being the last one.

01:18.720 --> 01:19.100
All right.

01:19.100 --> 01:23.440
So the way that I solved this one was I created a ride's constant.

01:23.670 --> 01:30.960
And and in here what we're going to do is we're going to decrement backwards until we meet our wind

01:30.960 --> 01:40.860
condition our return condition and that in fact is the the the first value where it's less than or equal

01:40.860 --> 01:41.850
to $20.

01:41.850 --> 01:47.980
When we multiply the fair times the length of the ride because that's what determines the money.

01:48.020 --> 01:53.810
The total cost less critical for and recall this rides and this is going to be a string array.

01:54.510 --> 02:02.760
And here we're going to have Uber X that we're going to have.

02:02.860 --> 02:07.580
So then we're going to have reflux

02:11.070 --> 02:17.190
who were plus then we're going to have uber black.

02:17.310 --> 02:22.960
I you know it's been so long since I've taken a nuber I didn't even know that these were all options.

02:23.950 --> 02:30.150
And then the SUV I thought there is like to like the low budget uber inexpensive are neither here nor

02:30.150 --> 02:30.470
there.

02:30.600 --> 02:37.050
So we're going to iterate backwards because we want the very first value that hits to and this algorithm

02:37.050 --> 02:38.510
and return that value.

02:38.520 --> 02:44.670
So instead of us having to reverse the array there's no reason to do that we take fares length to initialize

02:44.680 --> 02:48.890
up eye I going minus one because we're checking index values right.

02:49.080 --> 02:52.730
And so while I is greater than or equal to zero.

02:53.790 --> 02:57.510
We want to discriminate by one.

02:57.570 --> 03:04.980
So all we have to do here now is do a little bit of math and say if our current fare fares I

03:07.440 --> 03:15.360
times the length is less than or equal to $20 was trying to wall hard not too hard to remember where

03:15.370 --> 03:18.920
did it turn the rides of.

03:19.290 --> 03:22.550
Because those are the ones which will get uber Xcel.

03:22.600 --> 03:24.730
Everybody's happy.

03:24.870 --> 03:28.980
Pretty much it at the end of day the only thing you have to sort of keep in mind is you know we haven't

03:28.980 --> 03:33.600
decremented too many for loops is something new to you and you know so many people get stuck in like

03:33.600 --> 03:35.450
I only can go one direction at a time.

03:35.450 --> 03:37.620
No we can we can customize our For loops here.

03:37.800 --> 03:40.610
And then just really understand what the problem is asking.
