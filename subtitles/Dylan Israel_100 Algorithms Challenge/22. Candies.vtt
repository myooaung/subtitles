All right so Candie's.

00:02.790 --> 00:09.990
So in our problem here we want all of our kids who have an equal amount of candy it is socialism for

00:09.990 --> 00:17.370
kids and candy essentially and in our we have an end amount of children which in our first example here

00:17.370 --> 00:20.860
is three and that amount of candies which is 10.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.560
So we're expecting that nine candies in total will be eaten by the children goes.

00:27.570 --> 00:31.380
Each one of them there is enough candy for each one of them to have three.

00:31.410 --> 00:35.660
The only hint I have is I use math floor to solve this.

00:35.910 --> 00:37.680
And that's pretty much it.

00:37.680 --> 00:40.280
Let's go ahead and dive right into it.

00:40.320 --> 00:47.310
So this is just a basic introductory problem but I think it's important to sort of understand what our

00:47.310 --> 00:51.040
objectives here and how we might sell this so in our.

00:51.120 --> 00:55.750
I'm going to share and I'm just going to call this candy and we're going to take.

00:56.020 --> 01:03.400
We we want to have the number of candies divided by the children.

01:03.540 --> 01:05.840
Now that would give us a multiplier.

01:06.030 --> 01:13.860
But we need it to be a whole number and we wanted to round down because what we want to return here

01:15.300 --> 01:23.010
is Candy times the number of children which equals roughly 10.

01:23.040 --> 01:27.780
But there's more than that because we need to drop the remainder so the way that we can drop the remainder

01:27.790 --> 01:29.870
is just using math or floor.

01:30.330 --> 01:32.540
And we can drop that remainder.

01:33.210 --> 01:34.860
Now we're good we get the right answer.

01:34.860 --> 01:39.840
So really here is just understanding if you can just sort of manipulate do some basic math.

01:39.990 --> 01:43.640
You know there's probably one or there's probably maybe even a cleaner way that doesn't involve not

01:43.640 --> 01:48.670
the floor but I found this to be pretty straightforward and I liked it.

01:48.840 --> 01:51.330
But if you have a better solution feel free to share it in the comments.
