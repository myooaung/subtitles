00:00.090 --> 00:07.470
All right we are on we are on are similar are similar was a fun one and actually stopped me for about

00:07.470 --> 00:12.960
a minute or two as I was trying to find actual nature to for a minute.

00:13.190 --> 00:14.550
You give up think.

00:14.710 --> 00:22.340
And so our objective here is we give in to race and we want to see if they are similar are similar being

00:22.380 --> 00:28.860
that if we swapped a value for we swap values from one array to another a single value would they be

00:28.860 --> 00:29.500
the same.

00:29.640 --> 00:35.900
So in our case here in and with an array one to three and one two three we could swap one with the one

00:36.060 --> 00:38.850
and it would be a true value.

00:38.880 --> 00:49.020
Now you can see here one two three two one three with these values and it would still be a similar value.

00:49.070 --> 00:55.490
But however when you get to 1 to 2 and 2 1 1 it be false because there is no way for us to swap them.

00:55.530 --> 01:00.150
So hence I used to string and I actually used reverse as well.

01:00.150 --> 01:02.790
I forgot to add that in there the array methods are reversed.

01:02.790 --> 01:04.590
So those are your hints.

01:04.590 --> 01:08.050
That's how I solve this along with a lot of logic.

01:08.260 --> 01:11.640
And let's go ahead and see what it.

01:11.670 --> 01:22.440
So the first thing that we can do is what we know that there is a a value that is completely the same.

01:22.440 --> 01:28.500
We can meaning the array value is in order and so we just return true because in those cases it will

01:28.500 --> 01:32.460
always pass and we do something like this if

01:35.490 --> 01:40.020
if a two string is equally equal to be not too string

01:43.500 --> 01:46.410
we just go ahead and return true.

01:49.590 --> 01:53.260
And of course we need to use this like so very nice.

01:53.280 --> 01:56.190
So it's going to handle the cases when they're already the same values.

01:56.190 --> 01:57.270
We can swap them.

01:57.270 --> 01:59.610
We know that and that that's good to go.

01:59.790 --> 02:04.950
So the way that I solve this was I created to a race that I called C and D.

02:04.980 --> 02:07.300
Probably not the best names.

02:07.360 --> 02:13.520
But we then iterate through the first array A or B.

02:13.530 --> 02:14.660
Doesn't really matter.

02:14.790 --> 02:22.430
And then we say look if ii is not equal to B of I meaning that value does not equal that.

02:22.650 --> 02:29.640
Go ahead and push it to erase see go ahead and push BVI to a Radie.

02:29.790 --> 02:39.100
We then are going to reverse the value in the in the array and then we're going to do a check.

02:39.450 --> 02:41.850
Did we only push two values here.

02:41.850 --> 02:50.280
The reason for here for this is those two values to see for instance that well tell us if we made only

02:50.280 --> 02:53.560
one swap right because if you swap you could swap twice.

02:53.580 --> 02:55.850
Essentially if you think about it and.

02:56.010 --> 03:01.930
And we're going to say hey is when we make see India string art are they matching after reverse.

03:01.930 --> 03:07.480
D Because in theory d the Radie will have been reversed.

03:07.620 --> 03:14.910
And when we it will be the swapped values that is in C and if those are the same it's true everything

03:14.910 --> 03:16.000
else is false.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.820
So that's a lot of talking.

03:18.030 --> 03:24.150
Let's go ahead and get a little bit more or so we're going to create a see here and this is going to

03:24.150 --> 03:25.190
be a number.

03:25.400 --> 03:26.190
All right.

03:26.340 --> 03:31.030
So this you go to like so and then we're going to create a list here.

03:31.050 --> 03:36.450
And the reason this is a light is because we're going to be re-assigning the value using the reverse

03:38.160 --> 03:42.720
array method in a minute here so that's why that one is of course all left very nice.

03:42.720 --> 03:48.030
Now what we want to do is want to iterate through like so with

03:50.910 --> 03:58.470
a for loop and we say I's less than a length.

03:59.730 --> 04:03.510
Plus plus So we want to iterate through the whole loop.

04:04.230 --> 04:13.020
Now we're going to see if VI is not equal to be of II because remember they're the same length so we

04:13.020 --> 04:16.460
can do this just because I have to worry about it failing or anything like that.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.990
What we want to hear is we want to go ahead and push

04:23.680 --> 04:24.560
to see.

04:24.630 --> 04:31.000
And when I go and push the of-I Judy.

04:32.040 --> 04:39.320
So this is going to give us the swopped values when they're not equal very nice art.

04:39.680 --> 04:50.290
So now that we've done that we will go ahead and do our check before we do our check because the swab

04:50.290 --> 04:56.180
values because D needs to be the reverse of C or is the reverse of C when it works.

04:56.400 --> 05:01.800
Well we need to do is we need to take D and we're going to regress for versey because that's going to

05:01.800 --> 05:05.640
account to see hey did our swap work.

05:05.640 --> 05:07.880
Did our swap make sense here.

05:08.070 --> 05:10.290
And if it is great if we didn't.

05:10.560 --> 05:11.490
Well it's false.

05:11.640 --> 05:15.300
So we're going to at the end here return false.

05:15.300 --> 05:19.990
I should set that up because in this instance we're checking all the Truthy cases.

05:20.430 --> 05:27.480
So we need to check that only a single swap has been made which would set C's length to say that length

05:28.470 --> 05:33.390
is equal equal to two because in theory there can be two numbers wrong.

05:33.570 --> 05:36.030
So there can be two swaps.

05:36.030 --> 05:45.720
And then we have to check now that C when we convert it to a string is exactly equal to D.

05:45.810 --> 05:47.190
When we convert it to a string

05:49.950 --> 05:53.770
if both are true we can now return true.

05:53.940 --> 06:00.690
And we pass all of our cases quite a bit going on in this one when you first look at it.

06:00.840 --> 06:01.680
Little bit jumbled.

06:01.710 --> 06:03.450
Probably a better way to solve this.

06:03.450 --> 06:05.130
This was how I solved it.

06:05.130 --> 06:13.470
I found this to be a a difficult one for me at least conceptually about how to go about this and how

06:13.790 --> 06:18.110
but this was how I solved and and will be helpful.
