00:00.680 --> 00:05.960
All right welcome to the hundred algorithms challenge how to ace the javascript coding interview so

00:05.970 --> 00:07.720
this is one of those ones.

00:07.730 --> 00:12.580
Catch Tuesday in development we got to get in because we can't believe they are good developers.

00:12.590 --> 00:14.350
So many people are not.

00:14.480 --> 00:16.340
And we need to make sure that you the best the best.

00:16.340 --> 00:21.560
But if you do a set technical stressful interview you can make good money and have good opportunities

00:21.560 --> 00:25.250
to get paid better than the average Dev and that's really our objective here.

00:25.250 --> 00:26.320
So a little bit about me.

00:26.330 --> 00:26.930
Who am I.

00:26.930 --> 00:29.420
My name is John Ishall am 30 years old.

00:29.540 --> 00:30.650
I myself started to help.

00:30.650 --> 00:31.880
I have three cats.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.410
I really was trying not to get the section to sound like a dating profile but that's what it sounds

00:36.410 --> 00:37.490
like regardless.

00:37.520 --> 00:41.370
I currently work as a front end engineer but I can do full stack.

00:41.630 --> 00:44.240
I am a content creator on YouTube as well.

00:44.240 --> 00:49.600
I get about a million minutes before watch a month and the minute I watch a lot.

00:49.760 --> 00:53.630
We need to work on some of our spelling in past tense here.

00:53.720 --> 00:59.480
But you know you go to YouTube datacom slash co-insurance 360 and check out some videos or doing anything

00:59.480 --> 01:07.750
from tutorials to topic oriented to projects like coding whatever it may be.

01:07.760 --> 01:10.370
Depends on the flavor of the month of how I'm feeling.

01:10.380 --> 01:12.170
That's who I am very passionate.

01:12.170 --> 01:13.850
I just go to meet ups and joy.

01:13.880 --> 01:16.880
I enjoy all aspects of code really at the end of day.

01:16.910 --> 01:19.010
So what's your objective with this course.

01:19.010 --> 01:23.830
Well our objective here is we're going to get better with javascript and Tipler if you don't do 100

01:23.840 --> 01:29.090
algorithms and not get better in the language of that choice we're going to get more familiar with some

01:29.090 --> 01:33.950
of those higher order functions that you you maybe don't use and you know maybe write a for loop here

01:33.950 --> 01:38.630
and you do some if statements that's fine and something wrong with that but you should know the tools

01:38.630 --> 01:43.490
and the power of the higher order functions that are available by the end of this you'll have a hundred

01:43.490 --> 01:44.690
algorithm portfolio.

01:44.690 --> 01:49.450
My goal for you is every time we finish an algorithm you push it you get out you get going to start

01:49.450 --> 01:52.460
building that up and you show that you're coding every day and learning every day.

01:52.460 --> 01:54.240
That's my that's my goal for you.

01:54.710 --> 01:58.000
And more than more importantly I guess are all really important.

01:58.010 --> 02:01.340
But you're going to be prepared for technical interviews.

02:01.380 --> 02:06.280
The key to success in life is often repetition and consistency.

02:06.280 --> 02:11.630
So that's what you're that's what our objective here is by going through these hundred algorithms seeing

02:11.630 --> 02:16.730
my solutions and developing ones of your own that hopefully you pick up a few things so that the technical

02:16.730 --> 02:19.320
interview comes you're ready to go.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.350
And so what are we going to cover.

02:21.350 --> 02:22.440
We're going to cover javascript.

02:22.460 --> 02:27.800
We're also in cover typescript I did this course in Taipei which is a superset of javascript and if

02:27.800 --> 02:30.050
you don't know typescript don't worry about it.

02:30.050 --> 02:31.540
There's no learning curve at all.

02:31.540 --> 02:31.930
Really.

02:31.940 --> 02:37.700
Honestly guys it's real simple and if you don't like typescript it which I can't imagine why not.

02:37.700 --> 02:44.420
But if you don't like it you can just write it in very Guler javascript so we're going to of course

02:44.420 --> 02:48.830
cover a hundred problems so you don't put a 100 algorithm challenge for having 100 algorithms and we

02:48.830 --> 02:53.840
have 100 here solved that I solved these aren't just things I pulled off the internet and ripped answers

02:54.110 --> 02:57.770
these items that I sat down I solved in my own time.

02:57.890 --> 03:02.230
I spent probably about two to three months doing this building this course.

03:02.230 --> 03:08.510
It's been a long process but something that already today with my own job interviews and my own my own

03:08.800 --> 03:14.090
you know assessments I'm much better than I was just by going through this process so I have high hopes

03:14.090 --> 03:19.180
for most of you you if you follow the design of the course so what is I is of course how does that work.

03:19.190 --> 03:21.870
Well we're going to give you an objective right.

03:21.890 --> 03:26.750
We're going to give you an hour with some examples that will show you in the next video a little bit

03:26.750 --> 03:30.550
more of a breakdown so we can actually see it right slides are just words with me talking.

03:30.550 --> 03:32.090
Let's actually see what we'll be doing.

03:32.180 --> 03:34.820
But you're going to have an objective that's our algorithm that we want.

03:34.820 --> 03:36.500
So you're going to try and solve it.

03:36.500 --> 03:39.410
My hope is that you solve about two to three of these a day.

03:39.830 --> 03:41.060
Some are super easy.

03:41.060 --> 03:43.740
Some are super hard and they range right.

03:43.880 --> 03:48.830
And I sort them alphabetically because I don't really know where you are and to me if I was organized

03:48.920 --> 03:53.000
by difficulty I don't know that that would be the best because I want you to challenge yourself.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.840
And what's difficult for me may not be difficult for you.

03:55.850 --> 04:00.380
So what I what you're going to do is hopefully you'll solve it.

04:00.380 --> 04:02.600
And if you do you just compare answers.

04:02.660 --> 04:06.520
If you do you sort of hit a wall and you don't know where to go.

04:06.630 --> 04:07.830
Go watch the video.

04:07.900 --> 04:09.100
No there's no shame in that.

04:09.100 --> 04:09.950
You're here to learn.

04:09.950 --> 04:10.380
Right.

04:10.580 --> 04:12.530
But do challenge yourself to get going.

04:12.530 --> 04:17.280
So let's go ahead and jump in to see how the Course actually works with some with some code.
