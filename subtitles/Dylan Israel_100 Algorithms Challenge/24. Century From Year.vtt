00:00.530 --> 00:02.850
All right century from a year.

00:02.860 --> 00:04.980
So this was a fun one.

00:04.990 --> 00:13.780
We here have to get the century based off of a four digit year so 1005 should return the 20th century

00:14.110 --> 00:17.760
and 17:00 should return 17.

00:17.770 --> 00:26.340
So basically you know the year is 0 to 100 on and so are zero to zero on.

00:26.350 --> 00:29.920
We're not working with negative numbers or b.s. or anything like that.

00:30.070 --> 00:33.030
So just let's go ahead and dive into it.

00:33.120 --> 00:36.430
And I have is I use math the floor and my solution.

00:36.430 --> 00:44.720
All right so the way that I solved this was I first did a condition for when a value is even or odd.

00:44.800 --> 00:51.970
And so if something divides evenly I want it to return the value to check which essentially is just

00:51.970 --> 00:53.990
a number divided by 100.

00:54.010 --> 00:56.550
And then we're going to modify that for when a number is an even.

00:56.620 --> 01:01.540
But because that's our strange use case that's what we're going to do here so I'm going to define a

01:01.570 --> 01:05.200
Conte's called value.

01:05.880 --> 01:07.710
I'll use a check.

01:09.310 --> 01:11.600
Don't ever name anything of value to check.

01:11.690 --> 01:17.320
I'm just hearing myself say this right now year divided by 100.

01:18.340 --> 01:19.880
And let's actually change that.

01:19.930 --> 01:27.860
We're going to call this century so a century will call a year divided by a hundred as the century.

01:28.000 --> 01:40.560
And if the year that we're passing then modulo 100 is exactly equal to zero then we have you know eight

01:40.600 --> 01:48.420
even century and we can return the century.

01:48.430 --> 01:50.680
So for 17:00 we solved that.

01:50.680 --> 01:53.760
Now all we have to do is understand how that we're going.

01:53.980 --> 02:00.100
What we have to change in our return here and if we put a return century just so that we can see the

02:00.100 --> 02:00.760
output.

02:00.880 --> 02:02.400
It may become a little bit more apparent.

02:02.530 --> 02:04.340
So we're getting 1905.

02:04.360 --> 02:07.110
So we need this actually be 20 and dropped the 0 5.

02:07.120 --> 02:11.160
Well we can add one MIKE So now we get 25.

02:11.650 --> 02:19.670
So what we can do here is just use math dot floor and go ahead and drop that like so and we're done.

02:19.810 --> 02:25.100
So the only the only caveat is the only you know you have to know what map to Florida.

02:25.100 --> 02:26.520
So not a modular.

02:26.710 --> 02:34.030
But essentially you get century and then we are handling the edge case where it is a 1 in 100 chance

02:34.030 --> 02:36.960
that is a perfectly even 100 years and we handle that.

02:36.970 --> 02:41.560
And if not we simply floor the century value that we got here and add 1 to it.
