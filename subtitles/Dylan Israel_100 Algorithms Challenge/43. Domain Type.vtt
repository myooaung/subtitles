00:00.750 --> 00:01.740
All right.

00:01.860 --> 00:03.960
So domain types.

00:03.960 --> 00:09.570
This was actually one where it was a five minute challenge for Go Daddy for them to sort of recognize

00:09.570 --> 00:12.720
you I guess at the end of the day was Go Daddy's challenge.

00:12.900 --> 00:19.440
And what we have here is an array that takes in domain names like Wiki dot org code Facebook com dot

00:19.440 --> 00:29.160
net and dot info and what we want here is to find out if it's a information site and networking site

00:29.160 --> 00:31.510
a commercial site or organization.

00:31.530 --> 00:33.740
So that's what we're going to be doing here.

00:33.750 --> 00:38.760
We're dot net needs our network info information so forth and so on.

00:38.760 --> 00:47.040
So the way that I solved it I split and push and there's probably a great Jex that might be able to

00:47.040 --> 00:50.680
do this for them but I feel like this is just as good.

00:51.120 --> 00:54.670
So go ahead and jump right into it.

00:54.680 --> 00:55.160
All right.

00:55.160 --> 01:05.130
So I created an array called domain type and I stored the values in here for each one of these or else.

01:05.130 --> 01:08.730
And what I did was I entered it through the array that was being passed in.

01:08.760 --> 01:16.200
I then split it up on each individual dot and then I checked the very last one to see if it match org

01:16.230 --> 01:17.610
commnet or info.

01:17.620 --> 01:21.730
And did I push the type of domain it was to it accordingly.

01:21.930 --> 01:23.960
So that's how we're going to solve this one.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.570
So we're going to say domain type.

01:27.060 --> 01:32.010
I'm going to set this to a string array and repeat school to an empty race.

01:32.020 --> 01:40.290
I know that when I say like for what i equals zero is less than the domains that are being passed in

01:40.770 --> 01:43.640
total length iterate through each one.

01:43.830 --> 01:44.740
All right.

01:44.880 --> 01:49.790
Now we just have it if and I'm probably going to copy a lot of this logic over and just second I want

01:49.800 --> 02:11.510
to say you know say cons conc the last domain last domain is equal to the domain.

02:11.780 --> 02:13.350
I forgot to split it.

02:13.700 --> 02:18.490
So we need to split it first so create a domain here.

02:18.710 --> 02:25.040
So the domain is the string except we are now splitting domains.

02:27.320 --> 02:35.300
Dot split on the character and we need to go ahead and just assign equals and not the type.

02:35.300 --> 02:35.920
There you go.

02:36.210 --> 02:38.180
So now we split that up.

02:38.460 --> 02:47.780
We want the last domain to be equal to domain domain lanes minus one that would give us our last value.

02:48.000 --> 02:53.680
Now that we have that all we're doing here is checking if last domain is equal equal to four.

02:54.420 --> 03:00.350
If it is we just want to push two domain type organization

03:04.670 --> 03:11.900
and let's go ahead and just copy this about four times so we're going have to modify it slightly.

03:11.910 --> 03:12.730
We'll take care of that.

03:12.930 --> 03:21.630
So this if it's now going to be an ELSE IF and the org instead will be a column.

03:21.630 --> 03:35.040
This will be commercial and this will be a sieve and this will be a net and this will be network

03:38.480 --> 03:43.540
and then this will be an LCF or else if it's of a house is it.

03:43.570 --> 03:47.990
It could be foreseeable that it doesn't match one of these four types and we don't want to do anything

03:47.990 --> 03:50.090
with it because that wasn't the objective.

03:50.100 --> 03:52.220
So all the info and that the information

03:55.160 --> 03:57.610
and finally we just go ahead.

03:57.740 --> 04:02.040
So the for loop turn domain type.

04:03.080 --> 04:04.700
And that's it really at the end of day.

04:05.080 --> 04:07.780
There's probably a better way of doing this.

04:07.790 --> 04:12.050
I remember being under quite a bit of stress trying to solve this in under five minutes and this was

04:12.050 --> 04:13.860
the first thing that came to mind.

04:14.120 --> 04:19.550
But it's pretty readable you get an idea what's going on here but I usually don't like multiple elses

04:19.940 --> 04:22.430
as well so might be some way that we can avoid that.
