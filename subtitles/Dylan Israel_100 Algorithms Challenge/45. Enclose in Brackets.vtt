00:00.500 --> 00:03.030
All right we have a pretty straightforward one here.

00:03.390 --> 00:10.220
We are given a street and a function and we need to enclose it in brackets so we get this ABC a B.A.

00:10.440 --> 00:13.350
and we want to wrap it in brackets.

00:13.350 --> 00:15.110
I don't really I mean hands free for it.

00:15.120 --> 00:17.430
This is a pretty much as easy as they can get.

00:17.430 --> 00:20.310
But let's jump right into it.

00:20.320 --> 00:21.010
All right.

00:21.020 --> 00:29.510
So pretty much all we need to do is use a little bit of E-6 tactics here and we're going to take.

00:29.560 --> 00:36.100
First off we're going to start with our princes and then we're going to use a little bit string interpellation

00:36.100 --> 00:38.820
here with the tactics and use the dollar sign.

00:38.830 --> 00:43.160
Double curly brace and just pass in our parameter and there we go.

00:43.180 --> 00:44.140
That's pretty much it.

00:44.140 --> 00:48.100
At the end of the day we could have name it some strings.

00:48.100 --> 00:56.420
We could of you know use plus to concatenate and and but this is probably the cleanest and best solution.

00:56.530 --> 00:57.800
Don't wanna spend too much time on this.

00:57.800 --> 01:00.540
There's plenty of other more complicated ones so we can focus on.
