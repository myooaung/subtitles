So one of the most common interview questions I get and it's sort of a a basic problem to really make

00:06.140 --> 00:12.680
sure that you understand what's going on here and Javascript is what is the difference between double

00:12.740 --> 00:15.190
eagles and triple equals in jobs.

00:15.230 --> 00:22.190
Now they ask this question not because a super complex but because is unique to javascript for the most

00:22.190 --> 00:22.760
part.

00:22.850 --> 00:26.300
And your answer should be something like this.

00:26.460 --> 00:34.340
Well double equals is comparing just the value while triple equals is comparing the value and the type.

00:34.340 --> 00:42.290
And an example of that would be a string five double equals to a number 5 would return true while a

00:42.290 --> 00:49.280
string five triples equals to a number five would return false because the type and the value are different.

00:49.460 --> 00:53.850
And just the type or just the value being the same is not enough.

00:53.930 --> 01:01.130
And to elaborate even further I would say that it is good programming convention to only use SHIBLEE

01:01.130 --> 01:05.360
goals because we want to write our code in the strictest fashion possible.

01:05.720 --> 01:10.940
So a couple of things to note from that is one we answered it fully right.

01:11.090 --> 01:19.610
We didn't just say we gave examples we we we reiterated it and we also you know wanted to you know talk

01:19.610 --> 01:21.210
about good conventions right.

01:21.230 --> 01:26.120
So it gives you a good opportunity to sort of showcase a little bit of knowledge in that aspect.

01:26.120 --> 01:29.240
Let's go ahead and give an example in the code now.

01:29.250 --> 01:33.980
All right so when it comes to W who is terribly close to just cancel logs and values.

01:34.200 --> 01:37.350
So in my example I said five is equal to five.

01:37.570 --> 01:39.660
You're going to see that that is in fact true.

01:39.660 --> 01:49.640
And if we did the same thing with a triple equals you would see that this is false because in searches

01:49.680 --> 01:57.040
comparing just the values while in Tripoli Eagles we are stricter in comparing the type and the values.

01:57.040 --> 02:01.990
Now one follow up question you might get to this is how do you think this happens in the background

02:02.230 --> 02:04.540
when we're working with double equals.

02:04.540 --> 02:11.410
I kind of stumbled on this when I first asked me but the the answer is Well it probably parses it or

02:11.730 --> 02:17.950
it converts the value to a string such as a number five to a string of problems just call to string

02:17.950 --> 02:21.190
on both ends of it and sees if they are in fact the same.

02:21.190 --> 02:23.280
That's another follow up question you might get about this.
