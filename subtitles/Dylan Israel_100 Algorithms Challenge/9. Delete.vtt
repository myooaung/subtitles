And it's those of us who maybe learn Javascript first before other more object oriented proper language

00:08.550 --> 00:15.940
is if you only use that term so it's just like Java or C-Sharp there are things that that might catch

00:15.940 --> 00:18.750
those C sharpened Java developers off.

00:18.760 --> 00:24.150
And one thing that's asked because of that is what does delete do.

00:24.490 --> 00:26.660
You know what is delete what does it really do.

00:26.680 --> 00:33.300
So delete allows us to completely remove an element from a an array.

00:33.310 --> 00:39.640
It also can delete a property off of a object.

00:39.640 --> 00:44.410
Now this is something that's somewhat unique to javascript because if you're coming from a background

00:44.410 --> 00:51.820
like C-Sharp those models that you're defining are that's sort of the contract with the database with

00:51.820 --> 00:54.240
the back end and to the front end.

00:54.430 --> 00:59.280
And we know it's expected that you wouldn't be able to straight up delete those values.

00:59.320 --> 01:07.240
However in javascript we are a little bit more dynamic and a little bit less strict and deletes serves

01:07.240 --> 01:09.210
that purpose.

01:09.250 --> 01:14.900
All right so let's take a look at our file here and you'll see we have an object with some properties.

01:14.900 --> 01:19.220
We have an array with some properties and we check if that property exists.

01:19.370 --> 01:27.720
It does and if we check the value of let's say some array index one you know we're going to get one.

01:27.760 --> 01:34.800
And why Rattle's go ahead and just cancel a log out the summary value as well go.

01:35.080 --> 01:38.220
So we have our object we have our array.

01:38.260 --> 01:40.210
Now this gives an example of delete.

01:40.300 --> 01:48.540
Let's say we wanted to delete prop 1 there we would target some object use the delete key word and prop

01:48.540 --> 01:48.900
1.

01:48.950 --> 01:53.830
And no it's false because we've actually removed that property entirely from the object.

01:53.980 --> 02:03.940
And if we did the same thing on an array we could do some array that one and you'll see that it's actually

02:03.940 --> 02:06.330
going to get undefined we're removing it from there.

02:06.330 --> 02:08.250
It has sort of the space in here.

02:08.530 --> 02:14.910
If you think of it that way but we're moving the object we're doing it from there from the array.
