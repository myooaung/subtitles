00:00.760 --> 00:06.640
All right so here we have it is case insensitive palindrome.

00:06.790 --> 00:15.100
What's this asking is is a string that's passed in the same forward as it is backward ignoring the case

00:15.280 --> 00:19.950
differences and you'll see here we have a B A.

00:20.380 --> 00:21.320
That is true.

00:21.460 --> 00:28.360
ABC would be false re some hints that I use to solve this I use join reverse to lowercase and split

00:28.720 --> 00:31.160
quite a few compared to some of these.

00:31.300 --> 00:33.940
I found this one to be pretty easy and straightforward.

00:34.020 --> 00:36.740
It was good and jump into it.

00:36.970 --> 00:43.980
All right so we know that it needs to be case insensitive and so there's two ways we can go about it

00:43.980 --> 00:44.160
first.

00:44.260 --> 00:46.630
We can change the string to lowercase or we can change it.

00:46.630 --> 00:47.080
Uppercase.

00:47.080 --> 00:49.460
I just happened to go for it to lowercase.

00:49.510 --> 00:50.830
So that's what we're going to do.

00:50.890 --> 00:57.580
So I'm going to create a constant here that's going to be called Original lowercase meaning that it's

00:57.580 --> 01:00.200
the original input string except to lower lowercase

01:04.340 --> 01:06.550
to lower case.

01:06.590 --> 01:07.140
Excellent.

01:07.340 --> 01:13.490
And now we're going to create the reverse version that we are then going to make in a comparison in

01:13.490 --> 01:15.090
our return here.

01:15.230 --> 01:24.020
So of course we just can't call this reversed or reversed word and we're going to set this equal to

01:24.470 --> 01:32.650
input string to lower case and then we're going to split it into an array of characters.

01:32.660 --> 01:36.260
We're going to reverse theory then we're going to join it back together.

01:39.260 --> 01:40.100
All right.

01:40.310 --> 01:43.670
And join back together.

01:43.850 --> 01:50.090
All right now that we've now that we've made this string lowercase both versions all we have to do now

01:50.120 --> 01:57.490
is return the comparison original lowercase is equal equal to the reversed word.

01:57.710 --> 01:58.880
And if that's true

02:05.660 --> 02:06.790
that breaks all.

02:07.160 --> 02:08.600
Oh I forgot to reverse it.

02:08.600 --> 02:10.120
That's why they are buzzer.

02:10.250 --> 02:11.210
We forgot to return it.

02:11.210 --> 02:12.950
So we split it and then we reverse.

02:12.950 --> 02:14.690
I was like why isn't this working.

02:14.940 --> 02:15.520
It's true.

02:15.590 --> 02:19.440
Now looking at this I think there's one additional thing that we can refactor.

02:19.490 --> 02:23.680
There's no reason to really call two lower lowercase on the input string here.

02:23.690 --> 02:29.120
We've already lowercase to it and we can actually go ahead and do original lowercase r.

02:29.140 --> 02:38.750
Or or or read you know or original or case this or that.

02:38.950 --> 02:40.480
So oh my goodness

02:45.550 --> 02:46.170
there we go.

02:46.250 --> 02:47.370
Just a little spelling.

02:47.420 --> 02:49.870
So we're changing one word Dillo.

02:49.880 --> 02:55.490
We're changing the word to lowercase we're then splitting it in on each character reversing the array

02:55.760 --> 03:00.950
and then joining it back together and making a comparison if they're equal then it is in fact a case

03:00.950 --> 03:02.120
insensitive palindrome.
