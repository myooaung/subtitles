00:00.600 --> 00:04.440
All right so here we have a growing plant.

00:04.440 --> 00:10.410
We are growing a plant that grows by a little bit every day but at night time it shrinks a little bit

00:10.740 --> 00:15.770
and then we want to track how long it will take us to get to our desired height.

00:15.780 --> 00:18.050
How many days will it take.

00:18.090 --> 00:25.920
So if we have an up speed of 100 a down street of 10 and desired height of 910 it will take us 10 days

00:26.350 --> 00:31.770
because every day it goes up then drops by 10 goes up by a hundred just by 10 it goes up by a hundred

00:31.780 --> 00:35.480
drops of I-10 that happens ten times over 10 days.

00:35.490 --> 00:37.430
I don't really have any hints for this one.

00:37.440 --> 00:40.440
This is a basic logic type algorithm.

00:40.440 --> 00:43.610
Let's go to and dive into my solution.

00:43.620 --> 00:49.260
All right so the way that I solve this was like two variables one a day because that's what we want

00:49.260 --> 00:56.400
to return down after things then just go ahead and start by setting Day Zero right because that's that's

00:56.400 --> 00:56.840
our story.

00:56.880 --> 01:02.640
And at the end here we just want to return day because that's that's our that's our goal here is updating

01:02.640 --> 01:03.150
day.

01:03.330 --> 01:05.900
And then we also want to keep track of the total height.

01:05.910 --> 01:11.880
So let's go ahead and create a total height or is this equal to zero as well.

01:12.000 --> 01:18.330
And what we need to do is understand that while our total height is less than our desired height remember

01:18.360 --> 01:25.950
how high we want it to be before we return the day we need to go ahead and set total height plus equals

01:26.220 --> 01:27.490
to the up speed.

01:27.540 --> 01:33.510
Meaning how much it grows and then if total height is less than our desired height we're going to minus

01:33.840 --> 01:36.380
the total height minus the down speed.

01:36.450 --> 01:37.650
That's really it at the end.

01:37.680 --> 01:44.170
So a little something like this wall total height is less than desired height.

01:44.730 --> 01:48.610
While that is a true statement we want to go ahead and add a day.

01:48.930 --> 01:56.550
Now if you choose me let's go ahead and make that days.

01:56.630 --> 01:58.530
So that's one that's more that's more correct.

01:58.590 --> 02:04.730
And if we wanted to now we have that we're going to go ahead and increment total height pluck plus equals

02:04.770 --> 02:08.280
to the speed and.

02:08.570 --> 02:08.910
Oh.

02:08.940 --> 02:16.790
And of course let's make sure that we for turn are gone so we can see everything.

02:17.200 --> 02:20.050
And that was all that this will work for what we have here.

02:20.080 --> 02:25.780
But the issue with this is later on when there were more complex problems there was issues where we

02:25.780 --> 02:27.960
were decrement we haven't decremented yet right.

02:27.960 --> 02:30.480
So you'll see here oh that looks to work.

02:30.580 --> 02:34.030
But we also need to take total height and we need to.

02:34.060 --> 02:36.490
Minus equals the down speed.

02:36.790 --> 02:38.790
And now you'll see we get that 11.

02:38.800 --> 02:39.820
So how can we solve that.

02:39.820 --> 02:44.390
Well a couple of ways I solve is pretty simple.

02:44.420 --> 02:45.450
It just put me here.

02:45.470 --> 02:48.640
So if total height is less than desired height

02:51.610 --> 02:54.070
you go ahead and

02:56.650 --> 03:00.440
just do that and say look don't decrement it because we already hit our goal.

03:00.460 --> 03:01.400
Want a break.

03:01.510 --> 03:02.670
We'll also have wraps.

03:02.680 --> 03:05.160
You know this there's a couple different ways.

03:05.170 --> 03:06.390
But this is pretty straightforward.

03:06.400 --> 03:11.970
And the solution here is just go with the logic again we keep track of the current height current and

03:11.970 --> 03:18.970
I would have been a better descriptor variable than total high then we keep track of the days we increment

03:18.970 --> 03:25.660
the day we add to the total height total height is ever less than the desired height we decrement because

03:25.660 --> 03:27.280
now we're going through the night cycle.

03:27.280 --> 03:31.550
If it isn't we're going to go ahead and we've beat our wall condition here.

03:31.570 --> 03:35.230
This is now a false statement and it's going to return days.
