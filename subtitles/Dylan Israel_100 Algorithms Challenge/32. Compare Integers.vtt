All right compare integers is pretty straightforward.

00:04.130 --> 00:12.080
What we want to do here is we were taking in two integers as strings and A-and to be who we want to

00:12.350 --> 00:14.870
find out if A is less than beat.

00:14.870 --> 00:16.660
We want to return less.

00:16.790 --> 00:20.160
And if A is greater than B we want to return greater.

00:20.330 --> 00:23.720
And if they are equal we want to return equal.

00:23.750 --> 00:29.000
The only hint I have for you here is that I use parce and in solving this.

00:29.060 --> 00:31.590
So let's go ahead and jump right into it.

00:31.940 --> 00:39.070
So I solve this on one line with a single return statement using a double ternary.

00:39.500 --> 00:40.760
And that's all I'm going to do it here.

00:40.910 --> 00:42.300
So I'm going to parse it.

00:42.290 --> 00:48.770
Remember we're taking in a integer as a string so we need to parse that and so we're say look is a greater

00:48.770 --> 00:49.340
than B.

00:49.370 --> 00:50.080
That's the first thing.

00:50.090 --> 00:56.690
We basically if three conditions are the it is a very good and B is a less than B or the equal and then

00:56.690 --> 00:57.730
we need to handle that.

00:57.750 --> 01:04.160
And when you do that with a double ternary and like so so if a is greater than B I want to go ahead

01:04.160 --> 01:10.550
and return greater if it's not we won't want to checking the other condition and when I say parse it

01:12.020 --> 01:15.020
is a less than B.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.910
Is that the case.

01:16.910 --> 01:24.320
If that's the case we want to go ahead and return less.

01:24.380 --> 01:31.880
Now if that's not the case it's not greater is not less than what it is is it's then equal by by process

01:31.880 --> 01:34.420
of elimination and we're done.

01:34.460 --> 01:35.900
That's pretty much it.

01:35.960 --> 01:41.750
It's really just testing your you know do you understand how parse it works and and making comparisons

01:41.750 --> 01:43.540
and we can do this with the IF.

01:43.700 --> 01:44.770
IF.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.780
Or else if.

01:46.780 --> 01:53.520
Else if or else statement here and handle that like so.

01:53.620 --> 01:58.070
But for me I never go past two ternary statements.

01:58.150 --> 02:01.680
You could in theory but I think this is fine.

02:01.760 --> 02:08.560
It reads a little strange but maybe maybe maybe the if else if if if else if else would be a cleaner

02:08.560 --> 02:10.000
way round this but this works.
