So another fairly common question is what is use strict.

00:06.390 --> 00:08.790
And your answer should be something like this.

00:08.790 --> 00:17.020
Use strict is a command to javascript to make us write stricter as the name suggests javascript.

00:17.160 --> 00:26.430
An example of this is you would throw the the string use strict up at the top of a file and the compiler

00:26.430 --> 00:31.500
essentially would know hey we are applying stricter rules here to solve some of the issues that javascript

00:31.500 --> 00:38.340
may have had in the past which is accidental creations of global variables is a very common one and

00:38.640 --> 00:47.330
nowadays it's not as important because most most things will use a web pack with the Linter such as

00:47.340 --> 00:53.130
TS lint in typescript which will handle a lot of these items and make us write cleaner safer and stricter

00:53.130 --> 01:00.640
jouster but use Strict was kind of in that same in-body that same sort of methodology.

01:00.900 --> 01:06.150
This is kind of a hard example to give but typically use strict would be something like this top of

01:06.150 --> 01:13.290
a file and you'll see here that we're actually you know accidentally creating a global scope variable

01:13.290 --> 01:18.690
so use strict with thrown Arison a you know this isn't something we do and would kind of remind you

01:18.690 --> 01:25.230
to throw a VAR or a light on this as well as many other items as you know many other sort of coding

01:25.230 --> 01:26.570
practices as well.
