00:00.780 --> 00:03.480
All right switch lights.

00:03.720 --> 00:09.570
So you'll see here we have all of these scandals very big graphic here but we're going to take an array

00:09.570 --> 00:10.780
of ones and zeros.

00:10.800 --> 00:16.610
And whenever a light is lit it's a one and whenever it is unlit it is a zero.

00:16.630 --> 00:22.590
And so when we come across a light that is lit what we want to do is we want to then switch.

00:22.600 --> 00:28.860
We want to swap or switch the values that come after it so we want to turn off the light and then we

00:28.860 --> 00:33.210
want to change the values that come immediately after.

00:33.210 --> 00:34.090
So you'll see here.

00:34.130 --> 00:35.280
A one ok cool.

00:35.280 --> 00:42.090
Turn this one off and then we're in turn this one off and then we're going to go through all of these

00:42.090 --> 00:48.780
iterations until finally we end up with something that looks like 0 1 0 1 0.

00:48.840 --> 00:54.900
After we go through all the values we're essentially going to be switching on and off the values for

00:54.900 --> 00:56.450
every time we hit a lit candle.

00:56.460 --> 01:01.050
And if we don't have any lit candles for instance then it wouldn't swap anything right.

01:01.050 --> 01:02.870
So that's what we're going to be doing here.

01:03.510 --> 01:08.490
All right so the first thing we want to do is we just want to create a reference to our original lights

01:08.490 --> 01:08.930
here.

01:09.080 --> 01:16.380
And so we'll just go ahead and say it's all original lights and I set this equal Jr. and we're just

01:16.380 --> 01:23.200
not unwrap the values in our in our array here go ahead and start Cuoco forgot to turn them all.

01:23.460 --> 01:24.030
Very.

01:24.070 --> 01:29.640
OK so now we have that we're going to iterate through our array and then we going to say look if this

01:29.640 --> 01:34.920
value was originally a one go ahead and swapped the lights that are there.

01:35.040 --> 01:38.480
The reason we didn't just store references we one actually knew it right.

01:38.520 --> 01:39.540
So iterate through here.

01:39.670 --> 01:50.730
Let's say for it I go there live i equal to zero eyes is less than a length are going to original light.

01:50.730 --> 01:59.300
So it doesn't really matter that length I pulls plus.

01:59.660 --> 02:00.330
OK.

02:00.510 --> 02:09.620
And now we're going to do a check and see if our original value was an eye or a one or other.

02:09.630 --> 02:15.750
We're going to have to do some logic and we're going to reset the value of original lights and the way

02:15.750 --> 02:18.100
that we're going to do that is we're going to write a separate function here.

02:18.270 --> 02:21.970
Not because I think it just we clean it up a little bit.

02:21.980 --> 02:28.710
We're at a function here and just called Swap lights and we're going to take in our lights which is

02:28.710 --> 02:30.860
going to be the number.

02:31.050 --> 02:37.320
We're also going to take in a current index value because we only want to swap.

02:37.500 --> 02:40.670
Up until that point.

02:40.800 --> 02:42.050
So now we have that.

02:42.210 --> 02:45.030
So of course we'll be a number as well.

02:45.810 --> 02:52.390
And what we're going to return back is a is a number.

02:53.310 --> 02:53.950
All right.

02:54.210 --> 03:01.740
So in our in our function here which if it's equal to 1 you know reset original lights to be equal to

03:02.220 --> 03:09.840
swap lights with the original light so we're passing in as well as our index on.

03:10.530 --> 03:11.920
All right.

03:14.010 --> 03:18.990
And we'll go ahead and make that a lot as well since we're overriding goal.

03:19.680 --> 03:25.480
So what we're going to iterate through the array that I will to zero by is less than the current index

03:27.000 --> 03:34.480
plus And then we're going to set a reset light psi equal to the opposite value of itself.

03:34.500 --> 03:39.250
So in that lights I would just use a Turnour here if it's equal equal to 1.

03:39.270 --> 03:42.120
Go ahead and return 0 if it's not return 1

03:51.770 --> 03:54.510
I'll leave the lights I think.

03:54.760 --> 03:55.910
What was that.

03:56.210 --> 04:05.130
Now all we're going to do here is go ahead and reset the current index value to zero.

04:05.130 --> 04:05.400
All right.

04:05.420 --> 04:11.680
So it's next to zero.

04:12.290 --> 04:17.180
Now we could probably I think we can eliminate this line here.

04:17.270 --> 04:18.300
So I originally did.

04:18.350 --> 04:20.400
I think we set plus one there.

04:20.540 --> 04:22.870
That would be fine but Wolf worry factor after.

04:22.940 --> 04:30.700
Now if Doo's return lights and at the end will just have to return our original lights which probably

04:30.820 --> 04:37.410
is not a bad name because they're not our original lights we are originally storing them so.

04:37.860 --> 04:42.890
So I think what we can do here is we knew plus one.

04:42.890 --> 04:49.370
And then when you can eliminate that altogether too to lower our code just a bit.

04:49.370 --> 04:53.630
So let's just go over the logic we are creating a reference to the original lights were then iterating

04:53.630 --> 04:59.780
through and then we're swapping the light values for each one that is actually called a 1 in our logic

04:59.780 --> 05:00.020
here.

05:00.030 --> 05:03.560
And then just returning the tool that's pretty much it.
