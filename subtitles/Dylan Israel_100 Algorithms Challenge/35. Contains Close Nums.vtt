00:01.030 --> 00:04.080
All right.

00:04.090 --> 00:04.650
All right.

00:04.750 --> 00:08.660
So we're in it was this one called contains close Gnome's art.

00:08.770 --> 00:15.070
So what we're doing here is we're taking in an array of values and we're also taking in a number and

00:15.070 --> 00:23.900
we want to find out is that if the absolute difference if there is a a a that two values in here where

00:24.100 --> 00:30.340
within our array where the absolute difference will ever equal our integer k but they cannot be on the

00:30.340 --> 00:37.330
same exact position meaning that you know you can't add minus from 1 if mine is from the index that

00:37.330 --> 00:41.340
you're on to get the value so that that's a that's not OK.

00:41.590 --> 00:46.100
So in our example here can we ever get is equal to 2.

00:47.230 --> 00:48.530
OrlicÃ­ let's use this for.

00:48.710 --> 00:54.070
So the output should be equal 3 less than or equal.

00:54.110 --> 01:03.360
By the way it's true because we can get 3 by 8 and 5 minus 2 or 2 minus 5 on get the absolute value

01:03.360 --> 01:11.420
of the case using our return false because the absolute difference between the positions of two twos

01:11.450 --> 01:12.600
is three.

01:12.970 --> 01:13.680
OK.

01:14.090 --> 01:21.330
So what we're going to do is your only hint is math that abs.

01:21.470 --> 01:22.480
It's a little bit confusing.

01:22.470 --> 01:27.860
I always have trouble explaining this when we throw in what so I do the J the K and the values but it's

01:27.860 --> 01:30.350
really not that bad of a problem.

01:30.350 --> 01:39.980
Our objective here is to find out that if if the indexes are not the same and if our values match what

01:39.980 --> 01:40.480
are.

01:40.670 --> 01:45.890
When we have matching values on different indexes.

01:45.890 --> 01:49.630
What is the what is.

01:49.650 --> 01:57.410
If the math thought absolute of minus J of the indexes is less or equal to K is true if none of them

01:57.410 --> 01:59.080
pass fasces it's false.

01:59.300 --> 02:03.990
So I don't know if I did an excellent job explaining that both just jump into the problem or Absolutely

02:04.050 --> 02:05.950
I solve this was I essentially brute force.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.370
It means that we're going to have a double nested array so go ahead and start there.

02:10.370 --> 02:21.320
So for what I can say is less than zero is less than Gnome's length.

02:21.410 --> 02:23.130
Plus plus.

02:23.180 --> 02:23.670
All right.

02:23.960 --> 02:27.740
And then we're going to do another four loop here were say Well J.

02:27.770 --> 02:40.360
People it was 0 0 0 J is less than length J plus plus an R R read me and said we're basically going

02:40.360 --> 02:44.810
to handle the true instances which mean that if we make it through here we're going to return false.

02:44.810 --> 02:48.610
Now read me told us that we don't want them to have the same indexes.

02:48.710 --> 02:52.590
So we can go ahead and start there with a hey if I.

02:52.940 --> 02:56.060
Is not equal equal to J.

02:56.460 --> 02:57.230
Deuce of stuff.

02:57.230 --> 02:58.820
What does a stuff want to do.

02:58.820 --> 03:03.440
Well it also told us that we want our values to be the same.

03:03.440 --> 03:06.550
So from Gnome's I to.

03:06.620 --> 03:14.780
And so you knew and if here say Gnome's Why is equally equal the gnome's J.

03:14.800 --> 03:19.160
And that's true on those values were the indexes are the same.

03:19.190 --> 03:30.380
We want to find out if the absolute value of excuse me of the if on the in the array the values on Gnome's

03:30.410 --> 03:38.330
I A.J. if they match we one do we find out the absolute value of i minus J to see if that's less than

03:38.330 --> 03:39.550
or equal to k.

03:39.560 --> 03:41.330
That's our objective.

03:41.330 --> 03:47.570
So the hardest part was just sort of deciphering this and you could see as I struggled to kind of explain

03:47.580 --> 03:53.680
that began in the intro and now that we're here what we're trying to say now that we've done that is

03:53.690 --> 03:55.850
just you need know the math.

03:55.910 --> 03:59.010
Absolute is a thing we do I J.

03:59.150 --> 04:05.890
And then we'll do less than or equal to K and spacier.

04:06.200 --> 04:11.120
And to hear if we've made it here we've passed all our TRUE instances.

04:11.350 --> 04:12.620
And so we're good right.

04:12.650 --> 04:19.640
So this is one of those ones that was a bit harder just because it was a little bit more scientifically

04:19.850 --> 04:23.120
mathy as I like to say in the example.

04:23.600 --> 04:28.220
But if you could kind of I remember when I first solved it I kind of was ready three four five times.

04:28.220 --> 04:30.740
I was like What the hell are they actually asking.

04:31.040 --> 04:34.450
And so on but at the end of it not too bad.
