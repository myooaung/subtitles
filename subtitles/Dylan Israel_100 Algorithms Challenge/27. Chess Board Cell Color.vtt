00:00.660 --> 00:06.600
All right here we are in chessboards cell color so we're taken two strings.

00:06.600 --> 00:07.990
Sell one and sell two.

00:08.190 --> 00:15.330
And what we're expecting here is to find out if they are in fact on the same color so a 1 and c 3 are

00:15.330 --> 00:17.490
going to be brown and Brown I guess.

00:17.490 --> 00:19.490
And then A-one in age 3.

00:19.500 --> 00:25.060
So I would return true and then a one and three would be false right because ones white ones Brown.

00:25.140 --> 00:27.380
So let's go ahead and jump right into it.

00:27.380 --> 00:32.070
The only concern I have for you really are that I use parsing in my solution.

00:32.100 --> 00:37.620
Now if you watch one of my earlier ones where we had a chess board based problem we're going to start

00:37.620 --> 00:44.610
in a similar fashion where I'm going to create my board object and this is going to contain the letters

00:44.700 --> 00:49.710
and their respective number because we can use a number for each letter to do a little bit of math to

00:49.980 --> 00:56.360
figure out if a 1 and c 3 are in fact on the set on the same color.

00:56.380 --> 00:57.830
And so we're to do that.

00:57.930 --> 01:00.300
It goes all the way to age so see

01:06.210 --> 01:10.630
the leaf.

01:11.650 --> 01:20.710
If that will be six G 6:48.

01:21.180 --> 01:28.080
Go ahead and make a colon and H that will be 8.

01:28.080 --> 01:28.830
All right.

01:29.010 --> 01:38.310
So we've creator for now what we're going to do is we're going to find out the the total value for a

01:38.790 --> 01:46.200
current board and we're going to compare that with we're getting a pair our cells together and so we're

01:46.200 --> 01:48.750
to say what is the index 0.

01:48.780 --> 01:53.520
If we treat them like a character right character want a character too when we say a one way is that

01:53.520 --> 02:00.990
equal to it's two and then we're going to we're going to say are these when we mod them by two equal

02:01.050 --> 02:02.970
and if in fact they are.

02:02.970 --> 02:11.250
Meaning that once we get the values that they're both even or both odd they will in fact be on the same

02:11.250 --> 02:12.420
color on the board.

02:12.420 --> 02:13.620
So let's just go ahead and do that.

02:13.620 --> 02:17.380
So rinse critic costs here and I just call it total 1.

02:17.380 --> 02:22.500
This is a really bad name I encourage you to have much better names and we're going to say the board

02:22.510 --> 02:25.980
and I say sell one which is the first index is 0.

02:25.980 --> 02:29.040
Now we created this board to get this value here.

02:29.100 --> 02:33.060
Now we're going to plus parse and we're going to parse the amp because it's going to be a string of

02:33.060 --> 02:35.340
five index that we're getting.

02:35.340 --> 02:40.130
We're giving the one the character one of this string.

02:40.180 --> 02:44.070
You say you want to look at it and one like so.

02:44.070 --> 02:49.080
So that's going to be our first value and then we're going to create total two which is going to really

02:49.080 --> 02:54.980
be sell to sell to total might have been a better name septal one told to.

02:55.170 --> 03:00.380
I don't like those those names at all and we will worry about naming conventions over time.

03:00.420 --> 03:01.830
So sell sell too.

03:02.010 --> 03:03.930
And we're going to do the same exact thing here.

03:04.170 --> 03:11.120
And except now we're going to parse and sell to on the one index.

03:11.120 --> 03:11.740
All right.

03:11.790 --> 03:17.040
Now that we have each one on their respective totals all we have to do is return to find out if they're

03:17.040 --> 03:19.820
both even or they're both odd.

03:19.860 --> 03:30.630
And so you do total one to one Angelo two is exactly equal to total two modulo two.

03:30.880 --> 03:35.030
And if that's the case then they both are on even tiles or they're both on odd times.

03:35.160 --> 03:42.540
Thus it is thus it is the correct color.

03:42.600 --> 03:44.990
I don't really like this Montu logic in here.

03:44.990 --> 03:46.060
Now I look at it.

03:46.140 --> 03:49.590
So I think I'm going to take some of that logic out here.

03:49.800 --> 03:53.440
I'm going to wrap that in it's own thing.

03:53.490 --> 04:02.270
I don't put my two and I'm a do the same thing here on total two and I'm going to mod to it.

04:03.600 --> 04:09.170
And now I'm just going to go ahead and delete that and go ahead and delete that.

04:09.180 --> 04:10.500
It's the same exact thing.

04:10.650 --> 04:14.220
I think this reads better personally in my opinion.

04:14.220 --> 04:16.440
So there we go up cleaned up a little bit.

04:16.560 --> 04:17.500
That's pretty much it.
