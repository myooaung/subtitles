All right in reverse a string we're going to be reversing a string if that wasn't apparent enough.

00:06.510 --> 00:10.060
So here we're going to pass an HELOC.

00:10.080 --> 00:10.560
Hello.

00:10.560 --> 00:17.810
And we'll get oil ph and will be reversed and same with howdie and then it'll be the very first way.

00:17.810 --> 00:23.610
And they were in two different ways that we can do this just because it's a fairly simply simple example

00:23.970 --> 00:26.110
and simple algorithm.

00:26.130 --> 00:27.650
So why don't we should too.

00:27.730 --> 00:29.680
Two quick way so we can knock this out.

00:30.240 --> 00:38.340
All right so the first way that I would knock this out is I would actually just use some rain methods

00:38.700 --> 00:40.000
so I would take the string.

00:40.110 --> 00:43.560
I would then convert it into a character array.

00:43.620 --> 00:47.540
So I'm going to split it up on each individual character.

00:47.780 --> 00:49.430
And let's go ahead and start Koka.

00:49.440 --> 00:50.950
Sorry I forgot about that.

00:51.450 --> 00:58.320
So you see we have each visual characters I would then reverse the values in the array using the verse

00:58.720 --> 01:01.870
or anything like join it back together become a string.

01:02.310 --> 01:03.950
So you see that worked just fine.

01:04.140 --> 01:10.830
So turn into a character we reverse that character and join those characters back in together with adding

01:10.830 --> 01:13.920
no additional content so we can do that.

01:13.920 --> 01:18.250
We could also do something that's a little bit more.

01:18.460 --> 01:22.770
But this is a better way because we're calling a couple of different array methods here and that takes

01:22.770 --> 01:23.100
time.

01:23.100 --> 01:23.710
Right.

01:23.730 --> 01:26.430
So it's not the most efficient item here.

01:26.490 --> 01:32.020
When instead what we can do is we go ahead and create a for loop.

01:32.220 --> 01:37.810
So we'll just create a reverse sister word.

01:37.910 --> 01:39.610
So this equal to an empty string.

01:39.810 --> 01:42.060
And now we go hence create a for.

01:42.130 --> 01:49.260
Let my equal TR Layne's minus one.

01:50.130 --> 01:55.380
And then while II is greater than zero.

01:55.490 --> 01:58.530
Continue iterating and then high minded us.

01:58.580 --> 02:06.110
So we're just going to decrement the for loop and eventually return reverse word here which currently

02:06.110 --> 02:07.250
is an empty string.

02:07.250 --> 02:15.460
The long you just do this we just want concat sequel's onto a reversed word.

02:15.770 --> 02:23.310
So you do as G.R. I think and let's see

02:28.330 --> 02:29.560
greater than or equal to.

02:29.560 --> 02:30.830
Sorry about that.

02:30.910 --> 02:34.200
So greater than or equal to zero.

02:34.310 --> 02:36.740
Now everything is reversed.

02:36.910 --> 02:41.530
Not too bad and this should be much faster than the other items that went through.

02:41.530 --> 02:44.520
In reality let's we're dealing with millions of characters.

02:44.530 --> 02:46.110
It's probably not going to matter.

02:46.540 --> 02:48.100
But I think either solution is fine.
