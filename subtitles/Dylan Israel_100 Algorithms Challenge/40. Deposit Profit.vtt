00:00.600 --> 00:01.380
All right.

00:01.380 --> 00:05.110
So here we are with deposit profit.

00:05.130 --> 00:13.050
What's happening here is we're taking in three separate parameters one a deposit amount a rate of return

00:13.110 --> 00:16.480
and then a threshold to find out what year we.

00:16.770 --> 00:17.880
We accomplished that.

00:17.880 --> 00:25.890
So in our example here we start with $100 at the end of year 1 we made a 20 percent rate on it at the

00:25.890 --> 00:29.780
end of year two we made another 20 percent or up to 144.

00:29.790 --> 00:35.900
And then at the end of year three we're now up to one seventy two point eight which would be our return

00:35.990 --> 00:39.830
it would take three years for us with a 20 percent return to get there.

00:39.990 --> 00:44.300
And so that's what we're trying to solve here.

00:44.370 --> 00:49.540
I don't really have any hints for you this is just one of those basic math type algorithms.

00:49.590 --> 00:51.350
Let's go into it.

00:51.360 --> 00:57.450
All right slewing I did this was I just start off by creating a variable called year and we're going

00:57.450 --> 01:00.760
to use a while loop because we don't know how many iterations each take.

01:00.760 --> 01:07.300
And that's really what we're trying to get the answer to is what is our year that we break out.

01:07.300 --> 01:09.820
And so we want to return year here.

01:10.010 --> 01:13.680
So going have a wall loop while loops we don't know what you're going to.

01:13.680 --> 01:18.080
How many times are going to do it typically end to be a while loop or some form of recursion.

01:18.270 --> 01:21.990
And so there is a threshold is greater than the deposit.

01:21.990 --> 01:30.210
So while that is true meaning that our of actually create new very rough edges and Javascript like when

01:30.210 --> 01:35.900
you reassign promoters will just create a value on those accounts.

01:38.770 --> 01:46.080
Count status account which is called account and also equal to deposit.

01:46.460 --> 01:52.520
And then all that is true here you go ahead and modify deposit.

01:52.670 --> 02:03.350
And so the account or our deposit is going to be plus equals to the account value that it currently

02:03.350 --> 02:11.420
is times the rate of return divided by 100 right because we don't multiply by twenty one and multiply

02:11.420 --> 02:13.260
it by point to zero.

02:13.290 --> 02:15.760
We're going to add that to our account.

02:15.890 --> 02:21.290
After that we're going to take a year and we just had one to it and that's it really at the end of the

02:21.290 --> 02:27.440
day just testing if you can put together some math where you create a of a variable here for the year

02:27.740 --> 02:36.140
we then increment our account value and then add the add to it the additional the interest the rate

02:36.140 --> 02:36.910
of return.

02:37.010 --> 02:42.750
We add a year and when this is now greater than this we go ahead and break out of it.

02:42.770 --> 02:48.510
In reality it should probably be greater than or no greater the greater is fine.

02:48.940 --> 02:53.020
Should we agree and then you go I have to go back and look at the tests but I think you get the idea.
