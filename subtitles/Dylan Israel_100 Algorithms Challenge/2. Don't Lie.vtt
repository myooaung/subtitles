One one thing I wanted to say is these phone screens these technical interviews are very stressful and

00:07.170 --> 00:13.470
sometimes simple answers you may not know due to stress nerves or whatever it is or you may just not

00:13.470 --> 00:16.250
know or you may not be super well experienced in it.

00:16.290 --> 00:20.850
And one thing I want to stress is how to handle that situation.

00:20.880 --> 00:24.960
You know I get asked questions about re-act a lot of times I haven't really worked with REACT TO MUCH

00:24.970 --> 00:26.130
A lot of react.

00:26.130 --> 00:27.650
You know God or anything like that.

00:27.780 --> 00:33.550
But I do understand how javascript works and how frameworks work and I can't answer questions like that.

00:33.570 --> 00:39.000
So in situations where I don't know I am OK and you should be ok saying I don't know.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.270
It's a much better answer than to sort of you know b.s. your way through say you know what I don't know

00:44.310 --> 00:47.420
but knowing what I know about javascript this is what I would think.

00:47.460 --> 00:51.660
I don't know I you know I'm not that in-depth about react but I would think it would have something

00:51.660 --> 00:53.410
to do with the lifecycle methods.

00:53.510 --> 00:54.140
No wine.

00:54.240 --> 00:59.460
And that would be not not as impressive but it will be more impressive than sort of BSE in your way

00:59.460 --> 01:04.620
because it is very apparent when someone starts saying stuff that is just it is worse to say something

01:04.620 --> 01:09.850
that is wrong with confidence than to say you know what I'm not really sure.

01:09.990 --> 01:11.020
I couldn't tell you.

01:11.130 --> 01:16.200
But this would be my guess based off what I know about about this subject matter so keep that in mind

01:16.200 --> 01:19.410
when you're handy having these technical interviews.
