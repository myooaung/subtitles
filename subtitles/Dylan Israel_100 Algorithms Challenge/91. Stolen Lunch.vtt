00:00.660 --> 00:01.260
All right.

00:01.260 --> 00:06.000
So a very interesting problem here and stolen lunch.

00:06.030 --> 00:12.960
No I just on lunch we're going to be taking in this string that has some letters and some numbers that

00:12.960 --> 00:16.180
need to be swapped from up to J.

00:16.470 --> 00:22.230
So essentially what we're doing is we're going to go 8:59 is going to be swamped with there in place

00:22.230 --> 00:24.690
values of character.

00:24.690 --> 00:33.660
So a would be one B would be two all the way up to J which is 9 and then vice versa if it's a nine.

00:33.660 --> 00:39.570
We need to swap a J and if it's an x ray we need to swap a one and that's what our objective here is

00:41.640 --> 00:45.920
to get R R to get our output here you'll never guess it.

00:46.490 --> 00:47.350
Right.

00:47.640 --> 00:48.300
That's our object.

00:48.300 --> 00:53.360
The only real thing I have to suggest for you is that I use the method split.

00:53.370 --> 00:55.730
I also use has own property.

00:55.900 --> 00:57.070
Let's go ahead and jump in.

00:57.090 --> 01:03.300
And I really did like this one quite a bit and I tried to solve it in a couple of different ways and

01:04.590 --> 01:09.780
the way that I solved it I think was pretty simplistic which is good when you're when you're developing

01:09.780 --> 01:11.420
a solution.

01:11.430 --> 01:17.310
All right so the way that I solve storing lunch was I created a a coat what I called a code dictionary

01:17.310 --> 01:24.490
which essentially is an object array that from 0 maps to a a map is 0 and for all of the numbers to

01:24.510 --> 01:30.960
the letters which is 0 to nine and Ada J I created that and then I took our input here and I made it

01:30.960 --> 01:36.350
an array of characters from there what I did was I iterated through that array of characters.

01:36.540 --> 01:43.830
And if the code dictionary that we created has that property we then swap in that character if it doesn't

01:43.830 --> 01:46.590
we just ignore it and just add the character.

01:46.590 --> 01:47.260
That would be there.

01:47.310 --> 01:49.730
So that was my solution.

01:49.770 --> 01:51.100
There's another way of doing this.

01:51.120 --> 01:56.340
I want to say where you check if it's an integer and then you check if it's you know the character code

01:56.370 --> 01:58.620
value and it gets very complicated very quickly.

01:58.620 --> 02:00.670
I thought this was a very clean way of doing this.

02:00.690 --> 02:05.310
So let's start by creating our array of characters and we'll just call this char's and this is going

02:05.310 --> 02:07.670
to be of type String Array.

02:07.910 --> 02:10.440
And we're set this equal to the note we're passing on.

02:10.440 --> 02:17.520
And when I split that on each individual character next on News read create this translated message

02:17.790 --> 02:21.110
which is just going to be equal to an empty string.

02:21.180 --> 02:27.120
And here on want return translated message that's our objective is to modify translated message.

02:27.120 --> 02:32.640
Now I want to copy this over and I don't think there's any reason that you see me type this out but

02:32.640 --> 02:33.930
this is our code dictionary.

02:33.930 --> 02:36.100
We're going to be referencing zeros.

02:36.540 --> 02:41.730
And when a is one and all these sorts of values so we have our keys and our values were in check if

02:41.730 --> 02:46.470
this the if the key exists or the property exists in our array.

02:46.500 --> 02:54.510
So we're going to do that for every value in our in our array and we can go ahead and swoony the index

02:54.510 --> 02:56.130
value couldn't use a for loop here.

02:56.190 --> 03:00.120
So I'll say let char of chars.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.700
Now all we need to do is we can say

03:05.420 --> 03:10.280
if Originally I used I use the if else.

03:10.290 --> 03:14.110
And we'll set this off and I think I'll convert this to a turner.

03:14.250 --> 03:22.620
But if this has the property that we are checking for meaning that it's an 8 or 0 2 or 9 but if it has

03:22.620 --> 03:30.120
that property we want take our translated message and we want to set it to that value of code dictionary

03:31.440 --> 03:34.930
of char else.

03:35.070 --> 03:40.510
What we want to do is one go ahead and take translating message and add that just add the value that's

03:40.520 --> 03:44.910
there which is the char value and that that is the solution.

03:44.910 --> 03:46.000
So we're creating a dictionary.

03:46.050 --> 03:49.470
We're splitting up area of characters we're then appending to a string.

03:49.470 --> 03:53.510
And if the property exists in a dictionary we're going to add that value.

03:53.550 --> 03:55.650
If not we're just going to add the values there.

03:55.680 --> 04:01.710
I think I'm going to actually go ahead and refactor this as I mentioned a second ago and instead what

04:01.710 --> 04:04.120
I would like to do is I'd like to just use a turn.

04:04.320 --> 04:07.420
So I think this is a fine example of use for turnout.

04:07.500 --> 04:13.280
So what we're going to do here is we're going to take code dictionary has own property.

04:13.350 --> 04:15.420
So that's a true statement.

04:15.420 --> 04:19.860
We want to go ahead and devalue to that

04:27.930 --> 04:38.100
that's actually a question or else we just want to get the value to our C code dictionary.

04:38.170 --> 04:42.650
Char translated message.

04:44.020 --> 04:44.840
There we go.

04:45.180 --> 04:50.550
So it looks a little while because I'm zoomed in a bunch but when you have a normal size font you can

04:50.550 --> 04:52.970
see we sort of eliminate a couple lines of code.

04:53.340 --> 04:57.360
And you know some people disagree that this is cleaner than others I think.

04:57.380 --> 04:58.950
I think it's all right one way or the other.

04:59.100 --> 05:05.640
But this is my preferred method if we can fit on one line of code like this while still having a decent

05:05.640 --> 05:06.180
font size.

05:06.180 --> 05:07.570
That's how I like to do it.

05:07.570 --> 05:09.110
But that was our solution.
