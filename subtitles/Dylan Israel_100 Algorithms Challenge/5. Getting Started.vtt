00:00.680 --> 00:04.230
All right to get you going so you don't have to go and create all these folders right.

00:04.230 --> 00:05.520
There's 100 problems you know.

00:05.520 --> 00:07.490
I don't want you to do things 100 times.

00:07.500 --> 00:13.560
So what we have here is our initial repo which will look exactly like our markdown repo or mark down

00:13.560 --> 00:15.110
that we showed a few videos ago.

00:15.190 --> 00:18.130
Next up we have all hundred problems in here and those differences are.

00:18.150 --> 00:19.660
Now this read me.

00:19.800 --> 00:24.970
So all you have to do if you're familiar with get help is you can go and clone this at.

00:25.020 --> 00:29.940
There will be a link in the description here but essentially it's good pizza poker.

00:29.970 --> 00:36.480
The 100 algorithm challenge or you go this link you just download if you're not familiar with it as

00:36.480 --> 00:36.940
well.

00:36.960 --> 00:41.640
So the three things that I'll provide here for you to get up and going is one there will be a link to

00:41.640 --> 00:46.380
this get help page to there'll be a link to a full typescript video if you just want to learn it more

00:46.380 --> 00:47.140
in depth.

00:47.160 --> 00:49.110
It's completely free just on my YouTube channel.

00:49.170 --> 00:53.370
And three there will be a link to a get up to Torro which is about 30 minutes which will get you up

00:53.370 --> 00:57.750
and going I really want those you are not comfortable with it.

00:57.990 --> 01:02.770
Just start getting comfortable is a hard skill in today's market and it's really easy to get going.

01:02.790 --> 01:07.080
30 minute video you can do everything you need to do here you can copy this replay you can push when

01:07.080 --> 01:08.600
you have a new solution to your own.

01:08.670 --> 01:09.600
It's going to be a fun thing.

01:09.690 --> 01:12.480
Let's go ahead and jump in to the algorithms finally.

01:12.520 --> 01:12.810
I don't know.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.970
I don't know about you but I'm not a big setup guy.

01:14.970 --> 01:17.890
I want to get into the code so let's get into the code.
