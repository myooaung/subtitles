All right seats in theater so we have these several paragraphs and feel free to read over them.

00:07.470 --> 00:12.780
But basically what this is saying is that you are in a theater and we want to know how many people when

00:12.780 --> 00:18.960
you get up to go to the bathroom you're going to walk across and interrupt their movie.

00:18.960 --> 00:24.300
So we're taking four parameters the number of columns the number of rows and the column and row that

00:24.300 --> 00:26.240
you're currently sitting in.

00:26.910 --> 00:34.020
So in our case as we are right here in this corner and we walk all the way across to here we're going

00:34.020 --> 00:36.680
to interrupt 96 people's movies.

00:37.080 --> 00:37.890
I don't have a history.

00:37.890 --> 00:39.600
This is a pure logic one.

00:39.660 --> 00:41.020
Let's go in and jump into it.

00:42.250 --> 00:49.120
So hopefully you're able to look at that image and tell that it's basically a graph there's an x coordinate

00:49.180 --> 00:54.390
there's a y coordinate and between our this is the max amount of of Y.

00:54.430 --> 00:55.710
The max amount of X's.

00:55.720 --> 01:00.850
And then our advice our current space and we need to find out how we can.

01:00.850 --> 01:06.360
How many people are in the end each behind us and to the right of us as we go to X it out.

01:06.370 --> 01:11.230
So there's basically two differences that we need to find we need to find the Cullom difference and

01:11.230 --> 01:12.700
the road difference.

01:12.880 --> 01:18.610
And then if we multiply those we can get our output are what we're expecting to get.

01:18.640 --> 01:27.420
So it's going to go to a concert here or S call this call if and we're set this equal to the total number

01:27.420 --> 01:33.540
of columns minus the current column we're on plus 1.

01:33.540 --> 01:38.760
The reason that we have plus one here is because we want to include the people that were currently in

01:38.760 --> 01:43.560
our row so when we stand up we're immediately blocking the people behind us.

01:43.630 --> 01:52.860
The next thing we do is do a road if we're set this exactly equal to the number of rows minus the current

01:52.860 --> 01:53.750
row.

01:54.420 --> 01:57.030
This is more of a logic one I guess more than a math one.

01:57.030 --> 01:59.230
So what have you figured that out at this point.

01:59.250 --> 02:03.960
All we have to do is call diff times rodef and we're done.

02:03.960 --> 02:05.330
It's a it's it's a.

02:05.370 --> 02:10.340
Can you visualize the situation as a graph and understand what they're asking.

02:10.470 --> 02:15.330
No this is pretty straightforward if you can figure that out it's just really breaking the problem down

02:15.330 --> 02:16.600
really at the end of the day.
