00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,536
How can we make the most of the power of SpEL for dynamic dependency injection?

2
00:00:07,536 --> 00:00:10,138
Join me in this module to learn how.

3
00:00:10,138 --> 00:00:14,664
I'm Buddhini Samarakkody, and let's continue our journey from here.

4
00:00:14,664 --> 00:00:17,283
Now we've come to the most exciting part of our course!

5
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:21,687
We are going to see how we can apply the magic of @Value annotation

6
00:00:21,687 --> 00:00:25,750
along with the power of collection manipulation and expression

7
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:30,169
templating in SpEL to render order details based on the user's

8
00:00:30,169 --> 00:00:33,017
locale in our E-Commerce application.

9
00:00:33,017 --> 00:00:37,923
I will also show you how to use SpEL in the context of XML Spring

10
00:00:37,923 --> 00:00:41,521
configuration for those of you who might still need to work with it.

11
00:00:41,521 --> 00:00:41,831
Finally,

12
00:00:41,831 --> 00:00:44,990
we will look at some typical situations where you

13
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,158
could possibly think of using SpEL.

14
00:00:47,158 --> 00:00:49,222
By the end of this module,

15
00:00:49,222 --> 00:00:53,181
you will be fully equipped with hands-on experience on how

16
00:00:53,181 --> 00:00:57,423
dynamic dependency injection can be done using SpEL by

17
00:00:57,423 --> 00:01:00,933
manipulating objects or object graphs at runtime.

18
00:01:00,933 --> 00:01:01,629
In this module,

19
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:05,117
we are going to extend our E-Commerce Application and see how we

20
00:01:05,117 --> 00:01:09,479
can use the @Value annotation with SpEL for dynamic bean property

21
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:11,706
wiring based on a runtime condition.

22
00:01:11,706 --> 00:01:17,277
We will also look at how collection manipulation in SpEL can be used

23
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:24,000
when wiring some bean properties and look at how expression templating can be applied in our application.
