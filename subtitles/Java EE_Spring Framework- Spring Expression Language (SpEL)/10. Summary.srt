00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,970
Now that we've come to the end of this module, as well as the

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:09,290
course, let's do a quick recap. Throughout this course, you saw

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:13,650
the beauty of SpEL with its capability of performing dependency

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,610
injection at runtime.

5
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:19,070
I demonstrated different aspects of SpEL to you,

6
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,850
starting off by writing and parsing simple expressions using plain

7
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:26,720
Java code, making use of evaluation context when parsing

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,780
expressions. And then, I showed you the magic of the @Value

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,350
annotation along with the power of collection,

10
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,440
manipulation, and expression templating.

11
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,870
You saw all these features coming alive in the context

12
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,820
of a simple ecommerce application.

13
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,450
SpEL is an excellent choice for dependency injection

14
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,140
based on conditional situations,

15
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,570
and I hope you'll make use of it in your future

16
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,240
applications. Since we've reached the end of this course on

17
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,470
SpEL, as I mentioned at the beginning,

18
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:03,930
I believe that you are now fully equipped with handsâ€‘on experience of SpEL,

19
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,910
and I'm sure that it added to your skills as experienced developers.

20
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:14,000
Thank you for watching my course. I hope you have enjoyed watching.
