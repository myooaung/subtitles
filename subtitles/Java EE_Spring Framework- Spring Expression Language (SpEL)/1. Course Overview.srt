Hi everyone!

2
00:00:02,721 --> 00:00:10,728
My name is Buddhini Samarakkody, and welcome to my course,

3
00:00:10,728 --> 00:00:13,686
Spring Framework: Spring Expression Language (SpEL).

4
00:00:13,686 --> 00:00:17,169
I'm a Java developer and an independent consultant,

5
00:00:17,169 --> 00:00:20,864
and my passion is to teach and share my knowledge.

6
00:00:20,864 --> 00:00:24,455
SpEL is a powerful expression language that can be

7
00:00:24,455 --> 00:00:28,132
used within the Spring portfolio, as well as independently.

8
00:00:28,132 --> 00:00:31,975
This course is a quick but comprehensive course that gives

9
00:00:31,975 --> 00:00:35,012
you hands-on experience to work with SpEL.

10
00:00:35,012 --> 00:00:39,066
Some of the major topics that we will cover include writing and

11
00:00:39,066 --> 00:00:42,655
parsing basic SpEL expressions using plain Java,

12
00:00:42,655 --> 00:00:47,688
using evaluation context, using SpEL with @Value annotation,

13
00:00:47,688 --> 00:00:52,345
collection manipulation with SpEL, and expression templating.

14
00:00:52,345 --> 00:00:54,060
By the end of this course,

15
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,542
you'll be fully equipped with all the knowledge required to

16
00:00:57,542 --> 00:01:01,162
apply SpEL to an application of any scale.

17
00:01:01,162 --> 00:01:02,638
Before beginning the course,

18
00:01:02,638 --> 00:01:06,658
you should be familiar with Spring fundamentals and Spring Boot.

19
00:01:06,658 --> 00:01:11,355
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn SpEL with the Spring

20
00:01:11,355 --> 00:01:21,000
Framework: Spring Expression Language (SpEL) course, at Pluralsight.
