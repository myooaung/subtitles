00:00:02,185 --> 00:00:06,020
Another interesting feature that SpEL provides is the

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,475
systemProperties predefined variable,

3
00:00:07,475 --> 00:00:11,936
which we will soon be using in our demo application.

4
00:00:11,936 --> 00:00:15,386
System properties is an object of key/value pairs that stores

5
00:00:15,386 --> 00:00:19,007
information about the current runtime environment.

6
00:00:19,007 --> 00:00:22,498
These include information such as the operating system,

7
00:00:22,498 --> 00:00:26,214
the user's locale-specific information such as country,

8
00:00:26,214 --> 00:00:29,533
language, time zone, and many more.

9
00:00:29,533 --> 00:00:34,376
This information becomes extremely useful when we need to conditionalize the

10
00:00:34,376 --> 00:00:38,030
behavior of an application based on runtime properties.

11
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:47,000
SpEL makes accessing of these system properties in expressions convenient by providing an in-built variable called systemProperties.
