1
00:00:02,353 --> 00:00:03,856
As part of project generation,

2
00:00:03,856 --> 00:00:07,287
JHipster creates two roles and four user accounts for you.

3
00:00:07,287 --> 00:00:09,729
First, let's look at the roles.

4
00:00:09,729 --> 00:00:12,238
The administration role, as you would expect,

5
00:00:12,238 --> 00:00:15,448
is for admin functions in the application.

6
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:18,534
This includes viewing metrics, managing users,

7
00:00:18,534 --> 00:00:21,385
and managing the database and development.

8
00:00:21,385 --> 00:00:25,589
The user role is for functions that require authentication.

9
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:26,571
In this module,

10
00:00:26,571 --> 00:00:30,499
we're going to change this role to be something that's less abstract.

11
00:00:30,499 --> 00:00:32,984
We're going to name it ROLE_PATIENT.

12
00:00:32,984 --> 00:00:38,027
It's likely in your application that you may follow similar steps.

13
00:00:38,027 --> 00:00:41,993
Along with roles, JHipster generates four user accounts for you.

14
00:00:41,993 --> 00:00:46,901
The administration user has all of the admin and user authority rights.

15
00:00:46,901 --> 00:00:50,000
It's likely you're going to delete this account in favor of having one

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,506
or more operational users with this level of access.

17
00:00:53,506 --> 00:00:55,747
If you do use this account in any deployed environment,

18
00:00:55,747 --> 00:00:58,657
just make sure to change to the default password.

19
00:00:58,657 --> 00:01:02,577
The anonymous user represents an unauthenticated user, or a guest.

20
00:01:02,577 --> 00:01:04,861
JHipster doesn't use this by default,

21
00:01:04,861 --> 00:01:08,516
so it's up to you if you want to keep it or remove it.

22
00:01:08,516 --> 00:01:14,099
The system user is a user that's leveraged for batch jobs and auditing features.

23
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:16,290
Finally, the user named user,

24
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,804
represents the authenticated account with non-administration access.

25
00:01:19,804 --> 00:01:22,152
Similar to the admin,

26
00:01:22,152 --> 00:01:26,232
you're likely going to delete this account in favor of real user accounts.

27
00:01:26,232 --> 00:01:29,950
Also, similar to the admin account, if you keep this for any reason,

28
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,417
make sure you change the default password.

29
00:01:32,417 --> 00:01:36,287
These users and roles are foundational to the JHipster generated application,

30
00:01:36,287 --> 00:01:40,405
and are going to be mentioned again as we go through the course.

31
00:01:40,405 --> 00:01:42,379
JHipster assumes that you're managing the users and

32
00:01:42,379 --> 00:01:45,841
roles within your own application, but depending on your environment,

33
00:01:45,841 --> 00:01:49,322
it's likely you'll be integrating with some external source for this data,

34
00:01:49,322 --> 00:01:51,211
such as a directory server.

35
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:51,497
Unfortunately,

36
00:01:51,497 --> 00:01:54,941
integration with these sources is outside of the scope of this course.

37
00:01:54,941 --> 00:01:55,518
For now,

38
00:01:55,518 --> 00:02:02,494
let's just focus on the admin role to understand what JHipster's providing you.

39
00:02:02,494 --> 00:02:07,432
I've opened up the Chrome browser to the server URL of localhost:8080.

40
00:02:07,432 --> 00:02:11,470
Note here that I'm showing the anonymous user's landing page.

41
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:14,119
At the top I have a navigation bar that includes a ribbon

42
00:02:14,119 --> 00:02:16,544
to tell me what environment I'm in.

43
00:02:16,544 --> 00:02:18,526
Right now we're in dev.

44
00:02:18,526 --> 00:02:23,537
I also have an icon, I have the application name, and I have a release version.

45
00:02:23,537 --> 00:02:27,950
On the right side of the navigation bar I have two menus, Home and Account.

46
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,418
I'll talk about Account menu now.

47
00:02:30,418 --> 00:02:31,777
In the Account menu I have two items.

48
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:33,835
I'm going to click on the Register menu item,

49
00:02:33,835 --> 00:02:37,665
and we see a Registration page that JHipster generated for you.

50
00:02:37,665 --> 00:02:40,810
This registration page allows you to create a new

51
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,698
user account with the user role.

52
00:02:42,698 --> 00:02:45,859
It's likely you're going to make some customizations to this,

53
00:02:45,859 --> 00:02:49,741
such as allowing for the registration of different user types.

54
00:02:49,741 --> 00:02:52,870
For this course, we're just going to leave the registration view as is,

55
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,115
though,

56
00:02:53,115 --> 00:02:57,979
we're going to need to change the server logic for our new patient role name.

57
00:02:57,979 --> 00:03:03,806
Let's go back to the homepage, and now I'm going to click the Account menu,

58
00:03:03,806 --> 00:03:06,264
and I'm going to select Sign in.

59
00:03:06,264 --> 00:03:09,158
I get prompted with a modle for sign in.

60
00:03:09,158 --> 00:03:12,220
It includes inputs for the Login, the Password,

61
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,900
and the check box for Remember Me.

62
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:19,133
The Remember Me check box remembers the user's identity after log in.

63
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:22,315
This functionality is actually a JHipster extensions of

64
00:03:22,315 --> 00:03:25,161
the Spring Security remember me feature.

65
00:03:25,161 --> 00:03:29,751
JHipster also provides you with support for recovering a password.

66
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,779
Let's try to log in.

67
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:34,623
I'm going to answer in user, for the Login,

68
00:03:34,623 --> 00:03:37,918
and also enter in user for the Password.

69
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:41,203
As you can see, not very secure.

70
00:03:41,203 --> 00:03:43,023
Let's click Sign in.

71
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:47,118
And now we can see the user's landing page.

72
00:03:47,118 --> 00:03:49,836
We know that they've logged in because first of all,

73
00:03:49,836 --> 00:03:53,354
the content area tells me that I'm logged in as user.

74
00:03:53,354 --> 00:03:58,255
Also, the navigation bar now has a new menu item called Entities.

75
00:03:58,255 --> 00:04:01,129
What is this Entities menu item?

76
00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:03,901
Well let's try clicking it.

77
00:04:03,901 --> 00:04:06,119
Hmm, there's nothing there.

78
00:04:06,119 --> 00:04:10,028
What's happening here is JHipster's providing you a container,

79
00:04:10,028 --> 00:04:14,859
that container will show menu items if you use a separate generator.

80
00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:17,555
This generator is going to create all of the client and

81
00:04:17,555 --> 00:04:20,846
server code for you around an entity type.

82
00:04:20,846 --> 00:04:25,180
Then, you can perform CRUD operations and the views that get generated.

83
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,859
I'm not going to show you this feature in the course,

84
00:04:27,859 --> 00:04:32,149
but it's pretty cool and I would check it out if you get a chance.

85
00:04:32,149 --> 00:04:34,625
Let's look at the Account menu.

86
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:35,803
This has also changed.

87
00:04:35,803 --> 00:04:38,160
Instead of just the Sign in and Register,

88
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,523
I now have four more menu items, Settings,

89
00:04:41,523 --> 00:04:43,625
Password, Sessions, and Sign out.

90
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:46,713
Settings are just general information about the user.

91
00:04:46,713 --> 00:04:49,282
Password allows me to change the password.

92
00:04:49,282 --> 00:04:52,998
Sessions shows the sessions that I have for the user.

93
00:04:52,998 --> 00:04:55,012
And Sign out obviously logs me out.

94
00:04:55,012 --> 00:04:58,439
Let's do that now because I want to log in as an admin.

95
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:03,378
So we're back to the anonymous page, and I'm going to click Account again,

96
00:05:03,378 --> 00:05:06,395
and I'm going to select Sign in.

97
00:05:06,395 --> 00:05:08,468
Now let's log in as an administrator.

98
00:05:08,468 --> 00:05:14,128
The admin account is a Login of admin, and a password of admin.

99
00:05:14,128 --> 00:05:19,963
Let's click Sign in, and now again I'm logged in as an admin because one,

100
00:05:19,963 --> 00:05:23,327
my content area says that I am, and second of all,

101
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,607
I have a new navigation bar.

102
00:05:25,607 --> 00:05:27,621
I still see the Entities menu.

103
00:05:27,621 --> 00:05:32,405
Note that that Entities menu is accessible both for the user and the admin,

104
00:05:32,405 --> 00:05:35,595
because the admin includes the user role.

105
00:05:35,595 --> 00:05:39,360
Let's look at that Administration menu now.

106
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,328
Under here I have User management,

107
00:05:41,328 --> 00:05:44,851
which lists the available user accounts in the app,

108
00:05:44,851 --> 00:05:48,540
Metrics, which includes basically Spring Boot metric data,

109
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,998
Health, which is also coming from Spring Boot,

110
00:05:51,998 --> 00:05:54,747
the Configuration of my application, Audits,

111
00:05:54,747 --> 00:05:58,101
which is a feature provided by JHipster,

112
00:05:58,101 --> 00:06:02,161
Logs, which shows me the application log levels,

113
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:05,135
API, which gives me access to Swagger, and Database,

114
00:06:05,135 --> 00:06:08,641
which is where we can see an H2 database console.

115
00:06:08,641 --> 00:06:12,284
Since we're using H2 database I have this menu item,

116
00:06:12,284 --> 00:06:15,607
I'm going to go ahead and check it out.

117
00:06:15,607 --> 00:06:17,904
Here I've opened up the H2 console.

118
00:06:17,904 --> 00:06:21,003
You can see the information about the local database,

119
00:06:21,003 --> 00:06:23,557
including the driver, the URL, and credentials.

120
00:06:23,557 --> 00:06:25,211
Let's click Connect.

121
00:06:25,211 --> 00:06:29,072
Okay great, now I'm in the console.

122
00:06:29,072 --> 00:06:29,731
On the left,

123
00:06:29,731 --> 00:06:34,060
let's note that you have all of the tables that were generated by JHipster.

124
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,883
These are all prefixed with JHI_.

125
00:06:37,883 --> 00:06:41,518
You're going to see this prefix as a common pattern

126
00:06:41,518 --> 00:06:42,972
throughout the generated project.

127
00:06:42,972 --> 00:06:45,162
Let's explore some of these tables.

128
00:06:45,162 --> 00:06:53,002
If I click on the JHI_USER table, I'll be able to run the SQL query.

129
00:06:53,002 --> 00:06:57,106
And I can see all of the information that's being stored about the user.

130
00:06:57,106 --> 00:07:00,641
Is see their unique identifier, their login ID,

131
00:07:00,641 --> 00:07:05,773
a hashed password, their name, and their email.

132
00:07:05,773 --> 00:07:10,340
Now, let's query the JHI_AUTHORITY table.

133
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,514
Here we see the two roles that we discussed earlier.

134
00:07:13,514 --> 00:07:17,638
At this point we see the role named ROLE_USER.

135
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:18,463
It's a generic role,

136
00:07:18,463 --> 00:07:21,941
and one that we want to change to capture the concept of a patient.

137
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:32,000
Obviously, updating this value right in the database is not the right approach. Instead, let's look at how JHipster created this data.
