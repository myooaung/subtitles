00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:05,500
I created this course for developers like me who are focused

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,442
on getting new projects off the ground.

3
00:00:07,442 --> 00:00:09,688
I assume you have a Java development background,

4
00:00:09,688 --> 00:00:13,143
and that you have some experience with the Spring and Angular frameworks.

5
00:00:13,143 --> 00:00:16,785
This course is not geared to a specific level of Java developer,

6
00:00:16,785 --> 00:00:17,088
however,

7
00:00:17,088 --> 00:00:20,002
the course will be more fluid if you've created

8
00:00:20,002 --> 00:00:22,790
projects from the ground up in the past.

9
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,111
Beginners can certainly benefit from this course by using

10
00:00:25,111 --> 00:00:33,000
it as a starting point for learning. Let's summarize what we've learned so far, then dive into JHipster development.
