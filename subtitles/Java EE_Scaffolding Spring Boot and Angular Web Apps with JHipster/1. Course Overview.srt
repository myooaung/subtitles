00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,688
Hi everyone, my name is Michael Hoffman,

2
00:00:05,688 --> 00:00:09,751
and welcome to my course,

3
00:00:09,751 --> 00:00:13,829
Scaffolding Spring Boot and Angular Web Apps with JHipster.

4
00:00:13,829 --> 00:00:15,908
Along with being an author here at Pluralsight,

5
00:00:15,908 --> 00:00:18,416
I'm also a principle consultant at Solstice,

6
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:21,352
based out of beautiful Chicago, Illinois.

7
00:00:21,352 --> 00:00:23,950
Building a new web application using modern tooling

8
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,341
has always presented a challenge.

9
00:00:25,341 --> 00:00:27,663
You need to address a lot of development concerns,

10
00:00:27,663 --> 00:00:31,598
such as what frameworks to use, the configuration of the application,

11
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:34,666
and scripts for builds and deployments.

12
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:34,956
Yeah,

13
00:00:34,956 --> 00:00:37,563
you need to balance addressing these concerns with the

14
00:00:37,563 --> 00:00:39,166
priority of developing new features.

15
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:40,151
In this course,

16
00:00:40,151 --> 00:00:42,996
we're going to walk through a web application

17
00:00:42,996 --> 00:00:45,676
scaffolding generator by the name of JHipster.

18
00:00:45,676 --> 00:00:47,721
You'll see why it's one of the best options for

19
00:00:47,721 --> 00:00:49,540
starting your next new web application,

20
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,952
as it addresses development concerns early,

21
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:55,686
and allows for the development of new features right out of the gate.

22
00:00:55,686 --> 00:00:58,366
Some of the major topics that we're going to cover include

23
00:00:58,366 --> 00:01:00,049
installation of the JHipster generator,

24
00:01:00,049 --> 00:01:02,772
creation of a new project through JHipster,

25
00:01:02,772 --> 00:01:05,374
customization of the project's security,

26
00:01:05,374 --> 00:01:08,291
implementation of the client and server code for a new feature,

27
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:12,780
and finally, the deployment of the project using a production configuration.

28
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,061
By the end of this course,

29
00:01:14,061 --> 00:01:16,458
you'll know enough to successfully leverage JHipster for

30
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:18,674
generating your next web application.

31
00:01:18,674 --> 00:01:22,513
Before you begin the course, you should have some familiarity with Java,

32
00:01:22,513 --> 00:01:26,255
JavaScript, the Spring boot framework, and the Angular framework.

33
00:01:26,255 --> 00:01:29,127
I hope you join me on this journey to learn JHipster,

34
00:01:29,127 --> 00:01:39,000
with the Scaffolding Spring Boot and Angular Web Apps with JHipster course at Pluralsight.
