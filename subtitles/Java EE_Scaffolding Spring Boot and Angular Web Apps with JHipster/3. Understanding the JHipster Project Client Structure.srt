1
00:00:02,323 --> 00:00:07,077
JHipster has generated a full Angular 4 client application for you.

2
00:00:07,077 --> 00:00:09,541
There are three main folders at the root directory.

3
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:12,731
The app folder contains the Angular application module,

4
00:00:12,731 --> 00:00:14,944
and corresponding code base.

5
00:00:14,944 --> 00:00:20,807
The content folder contains static content like style sheets and images.

6
00:00:20,807 --> 00:00:26,326
The swagger-ui folder contains the UI code for the Swagger API viewer.

7
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:30,029
Also, at the root directory is the main index page.

8
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:32,728
I'll be making a majority of the changes for the feature

9
00:00:32,728 --> 00:00:35,464
using the contents of the app folder.

10
00:00:35,464 --> 00:00:38,159
So let's quickly cover its contents.

11
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,611
At the root of the app directory is the definition of our application module.

12
00:00:42,611 --> 00:00:45,199
We will make a small change to the application module

13
00:00:45,199 --> 00:00:47,336
to declare our new patient module.

14
00:00:47,336 --> 00:00:52,082
The first two folders under the app directory are for the

15
00:00:52,082 --> 00:00:54,320
user account management and admin UI.

16
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,422
You saw most of this in the previous module,

17
00:00:56,422 --> 00:00:58,919
including the user editor page, metrics,

18
00:00:58,919 --> 00:01:01,316
registration, and password reset.

19
00:01:01,316 --> 00:01:06,387
I don't plan to cover these modules in any more detail for this course.

20
00:01:06,387 --> 00:01:08,798
The next folder is the blocks directory.

21
00:01:08,798 --> 00:01:13,359
This includes common code for configurations such as pagination,

22
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:16,191
interceptors for authentication expiration,

23
00:01:16,191 --> 00:01:18,315
errors, and notifications.

24
00:01:18,315 --> 00:01:22,585
Again, I won't be covering these, but you should be aware of them.

25
00:01:22,585 --> 00:01:25,695
The entities folder contains modules that you can generate

26
00:01:25,695 --> 00:01:28,391
using a JHipster sub generator command.

27
00:01:28,391 --> 00:01:32,411
The home folder contains the home page of the application

28
00:01:32,411 --> 00:01:34,748
that you saw when the browser loaded.

29
00:01:34,748 --> 00:01:38,047
The next folder is the layouts directory.

30
00:01:38,047 --> 00:01:40,028
This contains the layout sections of the page,

31
00:01:40,028 --> 00:01:42,586
including the navigation bar and footer.

32
00:01:42,586 --> 00:01:45,517
We will be changing the navigation bar as we want to include our

33
00:01:45,517 --> 00:01:49,555
new patient menu and appointment request form.

34
00:01:49,555 --> 00:01:52,305
The last folder is the shared directory.

35
00:01:52,305 --> 00:01:55,377
It contains common services around users,

36
00:01:55,377 --> 00:01:57,903
requests, notifications, and pagination.

37
00:01:57,903 --> 00:02:01,217
We will be making use of some of the services in this directory,

38
00:02:01,217 --> 00:02:08,000
especially for authorization. With that out of the way, let's start to make changes to the navigation bar.
