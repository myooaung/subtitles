1
00:00:02,181 --> 00:00:04,415
The goal of this course is to give you enough working

2
00:00:04,415 --> 00:00:08,315
knowledge of the JHipster platform to use it for starting

3
00:00:08,315 --> 00:00:10,499
your next Java web application.

4
00:00:10,499 --> 00:00:15,868
First, you will learn how easy it is to install JHipster as a command line tool.

5
00:00:15,868 --> 00:00:19,883
Next, you will use the command line tool to understand how to generate a project,

6
00:00:19,883 --> 00:00:22,773
including the different options available to you.

7
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:24,420
After the project has been generated,

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,005
you will see a demonstration of how to develop a client-side feature.

9
00:00:29,005 --> 00:00:30,349
You will learn what JHipster creates for you,

10
00:00:30,349 --> 00:00:32,507
and where to add components in the code.

11
00:00:32,507 --> 00:00:34,735
With the client-side code in place,

12
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:38,461
you'll get a demonstration of wiring up the server-side code for the feature.

13
00:00:38,461 --> 00:00:41,307
Again, you will continue to learn what JHipster generates,

14
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:44,549
and where to add backend components.

15
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:45,811
Following the code demo,

16
00:00:45,811 --> 00:00:48,966
you will get to walk through deployment of the application.

17
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:51,336
You will see the options available to you for runtime,

18
00:00:51,336 --> 00:00:55,291
and learn how to customize the deployment strategy for your needs.

19
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:56,752
Along with the goals of this course,

20
00:00:56,752 --> 00:01:01,577
it's important to understand what this course is not intended to be.

21
00:01:01,577 --> 00:01:04,927
As JHipster generates a project with a multitude of dependencies,

22
00:01:04,927 --> 00:01:07,336
it's very possible that you may not have worked with,

23
00:01:07,336 --> 00:01:11,044
or even heard of one or more of these dependencies.

24
00:01:11,044 --> 00:01:17,015
Unfortunately, it would be impossible to cover every technology in this course.

25
00:01:17,015 --> 00:01:18,938
To help you with potential gaps in learning,

26
00:01:18,938 --> 00:01:21,429
I've provided the link to a GitHub project.

27
00:01:21,429 --> 00:01:24,183
This project provides resources for the various

28
00:01:24,183 --> 00:01:27,407
frameworks and tools that JHipster depends on.

29
00:01:27,407 --> 00:01:32,646
You can find the project at github.

30
00:01:32,646 --> 00:01:33,394
com/michaelhoffmantech.

31
00:01:33,394 --> 00:01:37,481
You can also visit the JHipster website for links to these dependencies.

32
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:40,500
That website is jhipster.

33
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,255
github.

34
00:01:41,255 --> 00:01:42,010
io.

35
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:48,000
Now that you know what you can learn, let's make sure this is the right course for you.
