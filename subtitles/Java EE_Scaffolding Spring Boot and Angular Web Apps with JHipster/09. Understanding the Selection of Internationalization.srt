00:00:02,509 --> 00:00:05,861
By default, JHipster will provide you with support for internationalization,

2
00:00:05,861 --> 00:00:09,674
both at the client-side and at the server-side.

3
00:00:09,674 --> 00:00:11,806
JHipster supports over 40 different languages,

4
00:00:11,806 --> 00:00:17,509
and allows you to select one or more languages to support if you require it.

5
00:00:17,509 --> 00:00:18,771
By selecting this option,

6
00:00:18,771 --> 00:00:22,969
you'll have typical message resources created in an i18n folder,

7
00:00:22,969 --> 00:00:25,590
created in your resources directory.

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,173
A message properties file will be created per selected language.

9
00:00:30,173 --> 00:00:32,240
As I don't need internationalization for the demo,

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm just going to select No for this option. Next, let's look at the decision for testing.
