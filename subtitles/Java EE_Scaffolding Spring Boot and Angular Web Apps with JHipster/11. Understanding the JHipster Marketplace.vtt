00:00:02.033 --> 00:00:04.872
The final decision you'll need to make is whether or not you want to

2
00:00:04.872 --> 00:00:08.845
install other modules from the JHipster Marketplace.

3
00:00:08.845 --> 00:00:11.373
The marketplace is a site that offers modules that are

4
00:00:11.373 --> 00:00:13.107
written by third-party developers,

5
00:00:13.107 --> 00:00:17.408
and are used for specialized scaffolding generation.

6
00:00:17.408 --> 00:00:21.479
These modules introduce non-official JHipster features to the project.

7
00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:23.921
For example, if you were looking to use React,

8
00:00:23.921 --> 00:00:28.029
you may consider checking the marketplace to include a React module.

9
00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.357
As we don't need additional modules for this demo,

10
00:00:30.357 --> 00:00:32.813
I'll just enter No for this decision.

11
00:00:32.813 --> 00:00:41.000
Note that once that is clicked, the project will begin to generate, which I'm going to cover in the next section.
