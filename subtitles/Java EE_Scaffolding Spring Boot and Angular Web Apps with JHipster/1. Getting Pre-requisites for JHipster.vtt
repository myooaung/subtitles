00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.274
Hello, my name is Michael Hoffman,

2
00:00:02.274 --> 00:00:05.946
and in this module I'll walk you through the most

3
00:00:05.946 --> 00:00:07.981
common path for setting up JHipster.

4
00:00:07.981 --> 00:00:11.188
Let's start with some prerequisites for the installation.

5
00:00:11.188 --> 00:00:13.567
If you plan to try the examples in this course,

6
00:00:13.567 --> 00:00:17.026
it's recommended that you first install the following features.

7
00:00:17.026 --> 00:00:19.446
I don't plan to demonstrate each feature installation,

8
00:00:19.446 --> 00:00:22.625
however I'll mention the features website for your support.

9
00:00:22.625 --> 00:00:26.669
JHipster leverages the Java language version 1.

10
00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:27.247
8.

11
00:00:27.247 --> 00:00:29.490
You can download it from java.

12
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.863
oracle.

13
00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:30.237
com.

14
00:00:30.237 --> 00:00:33.901
JHipster generates projects using the Maven or Gradle build tools,

15
00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:37.106
however this course will leverage Gradle exclusively.

16
00:00:37.106 --> 00:00:41.254
Gradle provides several benefits over Maven's XML-based configuration,

17
00:00:41.254 --> 00:00:44.875
and it's become a de facto standard that I'm working with.

18
00:00:44.875 --> 00:00:47.003
You can download it from gradle.

19
00:00:47.003 --> 00:00:47.358
org.

20
00:00:47.358 --> 00:00:50.690
This course will leverage version 4 of the tool.

21
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.920
It will be leveraged during JHipster project creation in this course,

22
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.116
as well as in the discussion around build and deployment.

23
00:00:57.116 --> 00:01:02.907
You can download the latest version, which is version 2, from git sem.

24
00:01:02.907 --> 00:01:03.352
com.

25
00:01:03.352 --> 00:01:06.714
An IDE Is recommended for viewing the generated project.

26
00:01:06.714 --> 00:01:10.059
The course will leverage the Eclipse IDE version Oxygen.

27
00:01:10.059 --> 00:01:13.518
You can download Eclipse from the website, Eclipse.

28
00:01:13.518 --> 00:01:13.950
org.

29
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.546
Next, two package managers are required.

30
00:01:16.546 --> 00:01:16.975
Why?

31
00:01:16.975 --> 00:01:20.839
Because Yarn makes improvements to the MPM package manager,

32
00:01:20.839 --> 00:01:24.987
and is highly recommended for faster generation of JHipster scaffolding.

33
00:01:24.987 --> 00:01:29.837
You will first need to install NPM, which comes as part of Node.

34
00:01:29.837 --> 00:01:30.583
js installation.

35
00:01:30.583 --> 00:01:31.091
Node.

36
00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:35.151
js can be installed from the website, nodejs.

37
00:01:35.151 --> 00:01:35.659
org.

38
00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.850
Please make sure to choose the LTS version.

39
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.402
If you've already installed NPM,

40
00:01:40.402 --> 00:01:43.431
it's recommended that you update to the latest version.

41
00:01:43.431 --> 00:01:43.820
Finally,

42
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.993
Yarn will be the primary package manager for the projects that you generate.

43
00:01:48.993 --> 00:01:54.992
After installing NPM, you can install Yarn from the website yarnpkg.

44
00:01:54.992 --> 00:01:55.537
com.

45
00:01:55.537 --> 00:01:59.597
Select the latest version, which at the time of the writing of this course was 0.

46
00:01:59.597 --> 00:02:00.170
27.

47
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:10.000
Once these prerequisites are installed, you can continue with the next topic, which covers the installation of the JHipster generator.
