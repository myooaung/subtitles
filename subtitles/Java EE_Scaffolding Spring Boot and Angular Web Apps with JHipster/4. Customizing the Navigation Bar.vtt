1
00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:07.667
The client implementation will be a four-step process.

2
00:00:07.667 --> 00:00:10.149
First, I'll update the navigation bar.

3
00:00:10.149 --> 00:00:13.155
I want to add a new menu item called patient.

4
00:00:13.155 --> 00:00:17.491
Then, I want to add a sub item under patient, called appointments.

5
00:00:17.491 --> 00:00:22.573
The appointments menu item should route the user to the appointments page.

6
00:00:22.573 --> 00:00:23.767
Once I have the navigation in place,

7
00:00:23.767 --> 00:00:27.078
the next step will be to render the display of the list

8
00:00:27.078 --> 00:00:28.771
of existing appointment requests.

9
00:00:28.771 --> 00:00:32.336
This list will be specific to the patient.

10
00:00:32.336 --> 00:00:38.382
I'll also render a form that allows the user to enter new appointment requests.

11
00:00:38.382 --> 00:00:42.522
Finally, I'll stub out the server calls to get existing appointments,

12
00:00:42.522 --> 00:00:44.499
and post new appointments.

13
00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:49.441
Let's start with a closer look at the navigation module.

14
00:00:49.441 --> 00:00:53.543
I'm displaying a snippet of code from the NavbarComponent definition.

15
00:00:53.543 --> 00:00:56.251
You can find this in the Navbar.

16
00:00:56.251 --> 00:00:56.638
component.

17
00:00:56.638 --> 00:01:04.263
typescript file located in the directory source/webapp/app/layouts/navbar.

18
00:01:04.263 --> 00:01:06.544
JHipster takes the approach of defining the

19
00:01:06.544 --> 00:01:08.628
template and styles in separate files.

20
00:01:08.628 --> 00:01:12.945
We're going to make our change to the navigation HTML

21
00:01:12.945 --> 00:01:17.047
template by adding our additional menu.

22
00:01:17.047 --> 00:01:20.222
Within the NavbarComponent definition is an important service

23
00:01:20.222 --> 00:01:23.462
included by the constructor for security.

24
00:01:23.462 --> 00:01:26.586
Principal is a service that, amongst other behaviors,

25
00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:29.928
will retrieve the user identity from the server.

26
00:01:29.928 --> 00:01:33.463
The navigation bar component also has a function for calling this principal

27
00:01:33.463 --> 00:01:37.511
service to determine if the user is authenticated or not.

28
00:01:37.511 --> 00:01:40.550
This is important as the navigation bar elements will be

29
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.575
different based on if the user is authenticated,

30
00:01:42.575 --> 00:01:45.165
as well as if the user has specific authorities.

31
00:01:45.165 --> 00:01:49.016
For an example of the menu item I'll be adding,

32
00:01:49.016 --> 00:01:54.120
I'm showing code for a similar menu item called administration.

33
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.699
Note the jhiHasAnyAuthority directive.

34
00:01:58.699 --> 00:02:02.967
It's just another helper that JHipster is providing you around security.

35
00:02:02.967 --> 00:02:07.139
It restricts the view of the template based on a user's authority.

36
00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:11.022
Our new menu item will check for the authority,

37
00:02:11.022 --> 00:02:15.408
ROLE_PATIENT, where the one I'm displaying checks ROLE_ADMIN.

38
00:02:15.408 --> 00:02:16.802
After this menu item is created,

39
00:02:16.802 --> 00:02:20.271
I'll be able to create a new module to correspond to the route.

40
00:02:20.271 --> 00:02:25.515
Let's add the code for the new menu item now.

41
00:02:25.515 --> 00:02:28.658
So I've opened up Eclipse, I have the project in the work space,

42
00:02:28.658 --> 00:02:32.584
and I've already gone ahead and opened up the navbar.

43
00:02:32.584 --> 00:02:32.976
component.

44
00:02:32.976 --> 00:02:34.154
html template file.

45
00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:38.859
Again, this file is going to define the HTML for our navigation component,

46
00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:42.797
including our menu items for our home, our entities,

47
00:02:42.797 --> 00:02:44.488
our administration, etc.

48
00:02:44.488 --> 00:02:47.307
When JHipster generated this project,

49
00:02:47.307 --> 00:02:53.142
it generated again the HTML and the CSS as two externalized files of the navbar.

50
00:02:53.142 --> 00:02:53.533
component.

51
00:02:53.533 --> 00:02:54.316
typescript file.

52
00:02:54.316 --> 00:02:58.005
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to minimize the package

53
00:02:58.005 --> 00:03:01.147
explorer so we can see this HTML template in full.

54
00:03:01.147 --> 00:03:01.597
Great.

55
00:03:01.597 --> 00:03:06.488
So now you can see there are two menu items that are

56
00:03:06.488 --> 00:03:08.103
being displayed in the editor.

57
00:03:08.103 --> 00:03:13.375
The first one is the Home menu, and the second one is the Entities menu.

58
00:03:13.375 --> 00:03:19.063
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to drop in our new menu for Patient.

59
00:03:19.063 --> 00:03:21.234
So I've dropped in quite a bit of code,

60
00:03:21.234 --> 00:03:25.631
what you can see here to start with is that we have a new list item,

61
00:03:25.631 --> 00:03:30.380
this list item is for the patient menu, and then we have a drop-down,

62
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.977
which includes our appointment submenu.

63
00:03:31.977 --> 00:03:34.788
I'm not going to get into all of the code here,

64
00:03:34.788 --> 00:03:38.209
but I do want to point out a couple of key aspects.

65
00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:43.404
First, note that we have the jhiHasAnyAuthority directive.

66
00:03:43.404 --> 00:03:48.251
This directive is going to determine whether or not this menu item shows,

67
00:03:48.251 --> 00:03:50.167
based on the user's role.

68
00:03:50.167 --> 00:03:54.795
Remember that again we changed our role for ROLE_USER to ROLE_PATIENT,

69
00:03:54.795 --> 00:03:57.828
and I'm including that as the authority,

70
00:03:57.828 --> 00:04:02.076
so I only want users with the patient role to have

71
00:04:02.076 --> 00:04:04.408
the authority to see this menu.

72
00:04:04.408 --> 00:04:08.111
That's going to include both the menu and the submenu.

73
00:04:08.111 --> 00:04:10.324
Now where does that get defined?

74
00:04:10.324 --> 00:04:15.393
I've also opened up a file called has-any-authority.

75
00:04:15.393 --> 00:04:16.822
directive.

76
00:04:16.822 --> 00:04:18.250
ts.

77
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.916
Let's go ahead and open that now.

78
00:04:19.916 --> 00:04:23.688
And I'll open up the package explorer so you can see

79
00:04:23.688 --> 00:04:26.032
where this file was generated.

80
00:04:26.032 --> 00:04:27.462
Scroll up here.

81
00:04:27.462 --> 00:04:33.449
So while our Navbar was defined in the layouts folder, the has-any-authority.

82
00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:37.125
directive was generated under the shared/auth folder.

83
00:04:37.125 --> 00:04:41.795
So as you can see here, JHipster generated this construct for you,

84
00:04:41.795 --> 00:04:45.330
so it's supporting this feature to be able to show and hide

85
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.389
based on your authority right out of the box.

86
00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.138
And this is kind of a neat feature.

87
00:04:50.138 --> 00:04:52.961
So, again, we're going to use that to show and hide our patients,

88
00:04:52.961 --> 00:04:55.112
so I'll go ahead and I'll close this,

89
00:04:55.112 --> 00:05:00.236
and I'll also minimize the package explorer again.

90
00:05:00.236 --> 00:05:03.417
And one last thing that I want to note is that in the definition of the

91
00:05:03.417 --> 00:05:06.454
submenu for appointments we have our router link.

92
00:05:06.454 --> 00:05:09.989
So that router link will point to our new module's route,

93
00:05:09.989 --> 00:05:13.257
which is going to patient-appointments.

94
00:05:13.257 --> 00:05:15.741
I'm going to drop that in here shortly,

95
00:05:15.741 --> 00:05:20.100
but that's pretty much all we needed to do to add a new menu item.

96
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:26.060
Let's look at the browser now and we can see what this new menu looks like.

97
00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.706
So I'm showing the browser again, I have the application up and running,

98
00:05:29.706 --> 00:05:33.453
note if you haven't started both the client and server,

99
00:05:33.453 --> 00:05:35.140
I would recommend doing so now.

100
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.846
If we look at the navigation bar we can see as an

101
00:05:38.846 --> 00:05:41.626
anonymous user I don't have the Patients menu.

102
00:05:41.626 --> 00:05:43.682
So let's try to log in.

103
00:05:43.682 --> 00:05:47.418
I'm going to click the Account menu, let's click Sign in.

104
00:05:47.418 --> 00:05:56.044
Again I'm going to log in with user as the Login and user as the Password,

105
00:05:56.044 --> 00:06:00.918
click Sign in, and there we go, we have our Patient menu.

106
00:06:00.918 --> 00:06:07.583
Let's try to look at the drop-down, and we see an Appointments submenu.

107
00:06:07.583 --> 00:06:11.335
So, our navigation bar menu has been added successfully.

108
00:06:11.335 --> 00:06:15.590
If I try to click on it, well it's not really going to do much,

109
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.119
right, because we haven't set up the route,

110
00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:20.550
but we at least know that we now have this navigation bar.

111
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.311
So our setup as well of the has authority was successful

112
00:06:24.311 --> 00:06:27.691
because we have our patient role already configured for our

113
00:06:27.691 --> 00:06:29.811
user as per our last module,

114
00:06:29.811 --> 00:06:32.971
and let's just make sure that the administration account works as well.

115
00:06:32.971 --> 00:06:35.088
So I'm going to log out of here,

116
00:06:35.088 --> 00:06:39.755
I'm going to click Account again and click Sign in,

117
00:06:39.755 --> 00:06:43.605
and let's try with admin.

118
00:06:43.605 --> 00:06:45.827
So I logged in with admin as the Username,

119
00:06:45.827 --> 00:06:50.172
admin as the Password, and once again we see the Patient menu,

120
00:06:50.172 --> 00:06:53.110
and we also see the Appointments submenu.

121
00:06:53.110 --> 00:07:02.000
So it looks like everything was successful with the navigation bar. Now, let's build out the module to support this feature.
