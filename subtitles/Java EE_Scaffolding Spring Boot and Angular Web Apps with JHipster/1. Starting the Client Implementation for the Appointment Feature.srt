00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,665
Hello, my name is Michael Hoffman.

2
00:00:03,665 --> 00:00:05,497
In this module,

3
00:00:05,497 --> 00:00:07,507
I'll be demonstrating the next step for adding a new

4
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:10,591
feature to the JHipster generated project.

5
00:00:10,591 --> 00:00:13,623
We're going to start the actual construction of the new feature.

6
00:00:13,623 --> 00:00:14,361
Just to recap,

7
00:00:14,361 --> 00:00:16,574
the business case is to allow patients to interact

8
00:00:16,574 --> 00:00:19,559
with their physicians in a practice.

9
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:22,406
Eventually, this is going to be a full functioning portal,

10
00:00:22,406 --> 00:00:23,210
but to start with,

11
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,135
I just want a feature that allows patients to manage their appointments.

12
00:00:26,135 --> 00:00:27,621
In the previous module,

13
00:00:27,621 --> 00:00:31,721
you saw the steps needed to change a security aspect

14
00:00:31,721 --> 00:00:33,854
in the JHipster generated project.

15
00:00:33,854 --> 00:00:36,505
This was a good exercise as it should have warmed you up to some of

16
00:00:36,505 --> 00:00:40,123
the basics of making a change to the code base.

17
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:43,682
We're going to put that new security role name to use in this module.

18
00:00:43,682 --> 00:00:44,315
To start with,

19
00:00:44,315 --> 00:00:47,630
I want to create a form that allows a patient to request an appointment.

20
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:52,053
The user will need to be logged in and have the new patient role.

21
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:56,326
The second task is to provide a view of all the appointments a user has made.

22
00:00:56,326 --> 00:00:59,439
I'm going to keep the data for this form very simple because we want

23
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:01,591
to maintain focus on what JHipster has provided.

24
00:01:01,591 --> 00:01:02,702
In this module,

25
00:01:02,702 --> 00:01:07,247
I'll be focusing on only the client-side implementation of these tasks.

26
00:01:07,247 --> 00:01:09,914
I'll cover the server-side in the next module.

27
00:01:09,914 --> 00:01:16,000
Let's start by running webpack again, so that you can get some additional details about it.
