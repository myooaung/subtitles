00:00:01.873 --> 00:00:02.699
In this module,

2
00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:05.962
I covered an example of deploying a JHipster application to production.

3
00:00:05.962 --> 00:00:06.315
First,

4
00:00:06.315 --> 00:00:10.434
I showed you the list of Spring profile constants that are

5
00:00:10.434 --> 00:00:13.231
provided out of the box by JHipster.

6
00:00:13.231 --> 00:00:15.861
This included environment-based profiles for dev,

7
00:00:15.861 --> 00:00:21.463
test, and prod, as well as feature-based profiles for swagger and Liquibase.

8
00:00:21.463 --> 00:00:25.806
Next, I covered making changes in the generated project configuration files.

9
00:00:25.806 --> 00:00:29.211
Changes were made both to a production properties file,

10
00:00:29.211 --> 00:00:30.773
and the logging configuration file.

11
00:00:30.773 --> 00:00:31.086
Then,

12
00:00:31.086 --> 00:00:35.340
I showed you how to run Microsoft SQL Server using a docker

13
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.834
configuration generated for you by JHipster.

14
00:00:37.834 --> 00:00:42.307
Finally, I demonstrated running the JHipster project as an executable WAR file.

15
00:00:42.307 --> 00:00:47.374
I showed you how to build the WAR, and execute it directly from a command line.

16
00:00:47.374 --> 00:00:48.445
This concludes the course.

17
00:00:48.445 --> 00:00:53.263
Let me provide you with some details to close things out.

18
00:00:53.263 --> 00:00:56.357
As an author, I take great pleasure in creating these courses for Pluralsight,

19
00:00:56.357 --> 00:01:00.215
and knowing that I can give back to you and the community through mentoring.

20
00:01:00.215 --> 00:01:05.270
Along with being an author, I'm also a principle consultant at Solstice.

21
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.764
Solstice is a digital innovation firm that helps Fortune 500 companies seize

22
00:01:09.764 --> 00:01:13.625
new opportunities through world changing digital solutions.

23
00:01:13.625 --> 00:01:14.620
As a consultant,

24
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.274
my primary focus is around solutions that leverage

25
00:01:17.274 --> 00:01:18.659
Spring and Pivotal Cloud Foundry.

26
00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.055
If you need to reach me for any reason,

27
00:01:21.055 --> 00:01:24.940
the first place to do so is in the Pluralsight discussion area for the course.

33

I hope that you will continue to explore the

34
00:01:46.446 --> 00:01:48.035
features that JHipster has to offer,

35
00:01:48.035 --> 00:01:55.000
and you'll see the same benefits that I've seen from using it in your applications.
