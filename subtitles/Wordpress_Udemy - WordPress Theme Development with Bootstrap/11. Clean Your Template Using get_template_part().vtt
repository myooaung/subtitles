00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.060
Hey everyone, welcome back to Bootstring
come with Bootstrap to WordPress.

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.511
In this lecture we're gonna be cleaning
our templates with get_template_part().

3
00:00:07.511 --> 00:00:15.796
[MUSIC]

4
00:00:15.796 --> 00:00:16.980
Woo, all right.

5
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.900
Now we're in the last video
of this module where we,

6
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.760
basically all we're gonna do now is
just clean up our home template.

7
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.990
As you can see,
we have a lot of code in HTML and

8
00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.400
PHP in this page, in this template.

9
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.190
We have 372 lines of code
just in this page, and

10
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.440
we can minimize that quite a bit actually.

11
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.710
And I also want to use this as a good
opportunity to introduce you to another

12
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.750
development technique in WordPress.

13
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.730
So which is super common, and
something you should know, so

14
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.100
I think this is the perfect
opportunity to show you.

15
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.010
So basically, I want to show you how to
use the function called get template part.

16
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.140
Here's the WordPress codex.

17
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.070
The famous WordPress Bible,
I think I will call it.

18
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.010
It lets you know everything you need
to know about WordPress, so right now,

19
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.000
we're going to be using the get
template part function.

20
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.570
And so, what it does, is it loads
a template part into a template,

21
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.350
other than a header, sidebar or footer,
because those have their own specific

22
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.840
functions, like get header,
get sidebar, get footer.

23
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.220
Remember?

24
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.135
So it makes it easy for a theme to reuse
sections of code, and an easy way for

25
00:01:23.135 --> 00:01:25.410
child themes to replace
sections of their parent theme.

26
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.340
So includes the name template part for
the theme.

27
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.130
Or if a name is specified,
then a specialized part will be included.

28
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.390
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
blah blah blah blah blah blah.

29
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.380
Basically what you gotta do is use
the function, get_template_part and

30
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.500
then the parameters are slug and name.

31
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.320
How that works is,
let me just show you a perfect example.

32
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.340
Look over here in your sidebar of Coda.

33
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.340
If you're using Coda, which you should.

34
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.540
And if you're not,
just open up the page.php.

35
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:05.830
The generic WordPress page.php that's
supplied with your underscores theme.

36
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.987
You can see here the function
get_template_part is used.

37
00:02:09.987 --> 00:02:12.696
So page.php is the default
page that's used for

38
00:02:12.696 --> 00:02:15.411
all pages if they're not
specified otherwise.

39
00:02:15.411 --> 00:02:18.825
And so if you open this up here, page.php.

40
00:02:18.825 --> 00:02:20.390
It looks pretty empty.

41
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.880
There's not a lot to it.

42
00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.710
But if you wanted to update the template,
the code, the markup, the layout.

43
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:27.690
Where is it?

44
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.680
Well it's actually in content page.

45
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.320
So where is that?

46
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.920
Again look over here in your sidebar.

47
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.190
Here we go, we got some PHP files
here called content, dash, and

48
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.710
a series of different pages.

49
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:48.180
So we have content-none, page-search,
single, and just plain old content.php.

50
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.041
get_template_part.

51
00:02:50.041 --> 00:02:56.874
If you just say content, then that should
just serve up your content.php page.

52
00:02:56.874 --> 00:03:03.064
But what we're really looking for
here is content-page,

53
00:03:03.064 --> 00:03:10.330
and so in here is where the content
is available for you to edit.

54
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.130
Basically, this is just a fancy
WordPress way of using includes, so

55
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.200
if you took my php course.

56
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.680
You know that we included.

57
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.406
We went php include header.php.

58
00:03:23.406 --> 00:03:27.893
Or include slash, or php function include.

59
00:03:27.893 --> 00:03:32.016
And then in the includes folder
we chose header, sidebar,

60
00:03:32.016 --> 00:03:35.727
footerl whatever, member whatever we did.

61
00:03:35.727 --> 00:03:38.350
So basically this is a fancy
way of doing that so

62
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.205
get_template_part is
what were going to use.

63
00:03:40.205 --> 00:03:45.415
So if your a forward thinker then you
already know what were going to do is just

64
00:03:45.415 --> 00:03:51.380
take certain sections out of these,
literally sections,

65
00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.430
HTML5 sections, and we're going to put
them in their own content templates.

66
00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.420
So that we can get template part.

67
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.990
Just to keep things a little bit cleaner.

68
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.929
And so, there are a few ways we can do it.

69
00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:09.064
We can just take the entire home
page from in between header and

70
00:04:09.064 --> 00:04:14.223
footer, all the way down here,
and just say content-home.

71
00:04:14.223 --> 00:04:16.837
Boom, done.

72
00:04:16.837 --> 00:04:21.470
The page-home.php literally is six or

73
00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.050
seven lines of code and
an include in the center of it.

74
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.840
But that leaves us with a pretty
meaty content-home.php.

75
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.540
And it's really kind of useless to us, all
we're doing is just taking content from

76
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.730
one spot, taking code from one spot and
shoving it into another php file.

77
00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:38.730
Doesn't really help us out.

78
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.980
And we can't reuse that as efficiently.

79
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.710
What if we wanna reuse the hero
section on a separate page.

80
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.871
What if want to reuse the opt-in section.

81
00:04:45.871 --> 00:04:48.890
What if we want to reuse boost in
your income, so on and so forth.

82
00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.921
Then all we need to do is get
template part, content, boost income,

83
00:04:51.921 --> 00:04:52.826
whatever, right?

84
00:04:52.826 --> 00:04:54.388
So that's essentially what we're gonna do.

85
00:04:54.388 --> 00:04:56.720
So super easy.

86
00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:57.870
Let's do it.

87
00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.703
All you gotta do is just
create some files here, so

88
00:05:01.703 --> 00:05:07.476
I'm gonna create a new file called
content dash, let's start with hero.

89
00:05:07.476 --> 00:05:10.877
Content-hero.PHP.

90
00:05:10.877 --> 00:05:15.414
Now what we could do is we
could take everything, so for

91
00:05:15.414 --> 00:05:21.630
example this, or we can take just
the content within the container.

92
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.490
I think what is best practice and for
future scalabilities is to take the entire

93
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.540
thing, because what if we wanna
use the entire hero section?

94
00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.770
Then we just have to say
get_template_part content hero

95
00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.160
rather than code the first few tags and
then get template part and

96
00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.120
then add those tags,
you know what I'm saying?

97
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.750
So just take that, get it right out
of there, and go to content hero.

98
00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:48.070
Bam, paste that in there.

99
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:54.693
Save that, now make sure before anything,

100
00:05:54.693 --> 00:06:02.467
you php
get_template_part('content','hero') and

101
00:06:02.467 --> 00:06:09.030
then the two parameters are content and
then hero.

102
00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.230
So that should grab our content hero.

103
00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.970
Let's give it a check.

104
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.560
All right here it is, and I see
immediately a couple pretty major issues.

105
00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.320
Where are the prices?

106
00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.900
And where is the button text?

107
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.070
That's a problem.

108
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.800
But I already know what it is, so
follow me back to the code editor.

109
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.750
Basically the problem is, here in
the content hero, we're referencing some

110
00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.820
variables that don't exist in this page,
in this PHP page.

111
00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:39.400
And it can't pull from these variables
back here because they're specific here

112
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.370
and they're not global.

113
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.930
So we need to just essentially grab

114
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.280
the custom fields cuz that's
the ones we're using there.

115
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:53.535
And cut those out of there
paste it at the top of

116
00:06:53.535 --> 00:06:58.962
your content hero in a PHP script and
save that.

117
00:06:58.962 --> 00:07:02.910
Give that a check, they're good
to go there it is, no problem.

118
00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:09.331
However it looks like our opt in box
is gone probably because I went in and

119
00:07:09.331 --> 00:07:13.183
grabbed the opt in content right here, and

120
00:07:13.183 --> 00:07:17.908
I put it in the content hero
when it's actually not.

121
00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.040
Here we go,
I'm gonna leave that there for now.

122
00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:27.840
Opt in section,
I'm gonna want to use that.

123
00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.590
Because, maybe we wanna add an opt in
section on other pages in the future.

124
00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:37.650
So, go ahead and create a content

125
00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:41.440
page called content-optin.php.

126
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.319
Grab that opt in section.

127
00:07:45.824 --> 00:07:47.330
Paste that in there.

128
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:52.990
You're gonna need to start a PHP script
up here, because we need to grab those

129
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:57.700
variables that we created up here.

130
00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:00.509
Yeah.
There it is.

131
00:08:00.509 --> 00:08:01.009
Boom.

132
00:08:04.126 --> 00:08:06.140
There we go.

133
00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:06.880
That should work.

134
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:07.910
Let's just check.

135
00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:15.280
Actually, you can't check until you
get_template_part('content'_optin').

136
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:15.780
There we go.

137
00:08:19.155 --> 00:08:20.110
There it is.

138
00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:22.180
Boom.

139
00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.360
Great.
Now we've got our

140
00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.750
How You Can Boost Your Income section.

141
00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:25.319
All right.

142
00:08:25.319 --> 00:08:31.536
We're gonna go content,
new page, content-boost.php.

143
00:08:31.536 --> 00:08:32.609
That sounds good to me.

144
00:08:32.609 --> 00:08:34.520
Grab boost your income.

145
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:37.980
Cut that out of there.

146
00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:38.940
Content boost.

147
00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:46.350
And don't forget you're gonna need to grab
those variables specific to that page.

148
00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:49.957
And that should be this one right here.

149
00:08:52.577 --> 00:08:54.710
Great.

150
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:56.556
Paste those in a PHP script up here.

151
00:09:00.961 --> 00:09:02.140
Excellent.

152
00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:05.720
Save, double check your work.

153
00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.410
You don't want to keep going and
find out you messed up.

154
00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:09.420
I messed up, see.

155
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:12.830
I gotta go back to the home page,
here, see what happened.

156
00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:19.250
Content optin, I forgot to
get_template_part('content','boost').

157
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:21.310
Good thing I check my work, right?

158
00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:22.180
There it is.

159
00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.120
This is looking good.

160
00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:23.690
All right.

161
00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:24.790
Back to Code Editor.

162
00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:26.410
You should know the deal by now.

163
00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:28.010
I'm going to keep going.

164
00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:30.280
I won't fast forward because
maybe you need to follow along.

165
00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.850
But I'm just basically going to try and
hammer through this as fast as possible.

166
00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:35.610
Next up we've got our
who benefits section.

167
00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:36.980
New file.

168
00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.300
Content-benefits.php.

169
00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:44.217
We're gonna snag that out of there.

170
00:09:57.369 --> 00:09:58.640
Grab this out of there too.

171
00:09:58.640 --> 00:09:59.696
Paste that in.

172
00:09:59.696 --> 00:10:03.103
Good to go, and don't forget, again,

173
00:10:03.103 --> 00:10:08.425
the
get_template_part('content','benefits').

174
00:10:08.425 --> 00:10:12.663
What are course features?

175
00:10:12.663 --> 00:10:19.223
We're going to go New File,
content, coursefeatures.

176
00:10:19.223 --> 00:10:19.733
All one word.

177
00:10:19.733 --> 00:10:20.990
Kind of a big one.

178
00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:24.320
And I'm gonna grab our
course features here.

179
00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:29.290
Paste that in.

180
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.580
Start my PHP script up at the top here.

181
00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:36.080
Hit back.

182
00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.560
Go ahead and grab my features.

183
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:45.710
Paste them in, save, and
then get _template_part.

184
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:51.052
That is ('content','coursefeatures'),

185
00:10:51.052 --> 00:10:57.764
and then we got our project features,
projectfeatures.php.

186
00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:01.646
I'm going to snag this, cut it out.

187
00:11:05.505 --> 00:11:06.115
Paste that.

188
00:11:06.115 --> 00:11:06.771
Boom.

189
00:11:06.771 --> 00:11:08.669
PHP.

190
00:11:11.403 --> 00:11:15.060
Grab our project feature content.

191
00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:18.600
That should be about it.

192
00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:22.972
And then we're going to have
to get that template part and

193
00:11:22.972 --> 00:11:25.840
that will be project features.

194
00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:26.340
Great.

195
00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:29.300
And then we have our video featurette.

196
00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:35.889
So, let me just go New File content,
video.PHP.

197
00:11:35.889 --> 00:11:40.197
Maybe it's a bad name cuz maybe we'll
have a different content video.

198
00:11:40.197 --> 00:11:45.670
Content video, let's just call it
featurette, that's pretty specific.

199
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:52.450
Although this is static content in there,
in the future we may change that.

200
00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:58.280
Maybe you have already did my
challenge that I suggested you try.

201
00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.070
And I still suggest you try it.

202
00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:01.440
Is make this dynamic.

203
00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.500
Use some advanced custom fields.

204
00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:07.840
And give yourself the ability
to embed a video.

205
00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:08.440
See what happens.

206
00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:11.250
Okay.

207
00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:13.490
And I'm gonna have to
get that template part.

208
00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:14.700
We have no variables for that one.

209
00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:17.547
And this is ('content','featurette').

210
00:12:19.369 --> 00:12:25.358
And then we've got a new
file content instructor.php.

211
00:12:25.358 --> 00:12:29.457
Grab that content for instructor.

212
00:12:29.457 --> 00:12:30.490
Bam.

213
00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:33.044
Paste it in.

214
00:12:33.044 --> 00:12:42.252
PHP Grab those variables,
we've got quite a few.

215
00:12:48.689 --> 00:12:50.670
Save that.

216
00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:58.126
This is going to be
('content','instructor').

217
00:12:58.126 --> 00:12:59.850
And then we've got our testimonials.

218
00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:04.530
This is an important one to make dynamic
because testimonials are great and

219
00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:06.120
it would be a good idea to have them be

220
00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.430
available on any part of the site
that I want to be able to add it.

221
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:13.790
So grab the testimonials.

222
00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:16.710
Paste those in there.

223
00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.970
And there are no variables for
that, so we're good.

224
00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:23.977
Make sure to get_template_part for
testimonials.

225
00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:32.072
And then, clean that up here.

226
00:13:32.072 --> 00:13:39.752
Now looky, looky at our page-home.php.

227
00:13:39.752 --> 00:13:40.907
Look how clean this is.

228
00:13:40.907 --> 00:13:42.420
26 lines of code.

229
00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:46.020
Could be less if I didn't have so
many spaces in between, but there we go.

230
00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:47.040
We have our sections, but

231
00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:51.080
now let's just make sure that they're
all there and that we didn't mess up.

232
00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:54.470
So right from the top, we've got our Hero,
Opt-in, Boost Your Income section,

233
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:59.500
Who Should Take This Course,
Course Features, Project Features.

234
00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:00.500
The video featurette.

235
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.570
And oh, something's happening here.

236
00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:06.680
The instructor section doesn't work.

237
00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.260
I wonder why.

238
00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:16.220
Hm, well what I do think is when we,
there could be a few possible options.

239
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:19.800
When we split our stuff
out into templates,

240
00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:24.560
potentially maybe we forgot to close
a PHP tag or something like that.

241
00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:29.120
But I actually went through
beforehand to see what happened.

242
00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:33.630
And what I did was I took this
line of code qnd I cut it, and

243
00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:36.810
paste it one after another
after each section and

244
00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:41.040
then refresh the page to
see where the problem was.

245
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:46.570
So when I pasted it after hero, fine,
after optin fine, boost your income fine,

246
00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:50.580
but when I pasted it after course
features it stopped working, so

247
00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:54.470
that tells me that course features
is where the problem was.

248
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:59.090
And when I look at the course
features page there's no errors.

249
00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:04.100
But what I do see is we changed
the global WordPress query

250
00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:08.400
to something specifically
targeting course feature.

251
00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:13.673
And then the reason why the next couple
like we have the project features and

252
00:15:13.673 --> 00:15:15.100
the testimonials.

253
00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:21.628
The reason why those are fine is because
they're taking the WordPress query and

254
00:15:21.628 --> 00:15:26.510
they're rewriting it to what
those templates need it for.

255
00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:32.009
But the instructor page isn't redefining

256
00:15:32.009 --> 00:15:38.380
what the WordPress query
global variable is.

257
00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:43.090
And so therefore it's trying to find
instructor info from course feature and

258
00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:44.620
that ain't gonna work.

259
00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:49.070
So what you gotta do is reset the query,
and there is,

260
00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:53.720
luckily, or thankfully, a function for
that, just WordPress reset query.

261
00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:58.310
It restores the WordPress query and global
post data to the original main query.

262
00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:01.610
It should be called after query_posts
if you must use that function.

263
00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:04.136
So for example, check it out here.

264
00:16:04.136 --> 00:16:06.895
We use pretty much exactly
this at some point so

265
00:16:06.895 --> 00:16:10.871
we have our custom query,
new WordPress query and the arguments.

266
00:16:10.871 --> 00:16:13.951
And then we go and
loop through our course features,

267
00:16:13.951 --> 00:16:18.850
product features, testimonials,
end the loop but we don't reset the query.

268
00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:19.820
That's important.

269
00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:23.740
So lets go back to our course features.

270
00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:30.450
And after endwhile, go ahead and
reset that query like that.

271
00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:38.210
But we need to also use that in our
project features after the endwhile.

272
00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.950
And we should probably do it after
testimonials as well because we

273
00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:45.630
create a new variable.

274
00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:49.250
So now, let's check it out
to see if our site works, or

275
00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:51.450
if our instructor section works.

276
00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:55.880
And there you go, there I am looking
like Elvis, and there's all my info,

277
00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.150
everything's great and we're good to go.

278
00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:01.600
Wait a minute, broken image, real quick,

279
00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.220
head to that footer page,
that footer template.

280
00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:05.790
Darn footer.

281
00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:11.190
We just need to take the, here it is.

282
00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:12.735
That's going to be php

283
00:17:12.735 --> 00:17:22.735
bloginfo['stylesheet_directory'].

284
00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:27.420
And then slash assets image,
blah blah blah.

285
00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:28.310
Let's see if that worked.

286
00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:30.400
All right, we're good.

287
00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.670
Back to the races.

288
00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:32.210
There it is.

289
00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:33.990
There's the homepage, perfect.

290
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:37.790
You did it, it's fully dynamic,
beautiful, amazing.

291
00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:38.870
Great work,

292
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:43.890
we're gonna enter a new module now and
we're gonna create our resources page.

293
00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:45.690
We're gonna make a resources page dynamic,
and

294
00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:50.870
that's gonna be a lot of fun because we're
gonna be using more custom post types.

295
00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:54.727
See you there.
