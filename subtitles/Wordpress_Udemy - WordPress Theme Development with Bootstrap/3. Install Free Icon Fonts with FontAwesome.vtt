Hey everybody, welcome back to Boost
Your Income with Bootstrap to WordPress.

2
00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:07.582
This lecture is called Installing
Free Icon Fonts with Font Awesome.

3
00:00:07.582 --> 00:00:15.849
[MUSIC]

4
00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.860
Okay, so in this lecture, we're gonna
install something called Font Awesome.

5
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.520
If you don't know what Font Awesome is,
it is a font that let's you use icons.

6
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.360
So your icons are vectors so they
are not blurry like bitmap graphics or

7
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.930
actually vectors.

8
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.575
So this is the Font Website.

9
00:00:32.575 --> 00:00:37.420
Fontawesome.io and you can scroll through
and check it out, if you'd like, but

10
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.600
we're gonna only be using
a couple of these icons.

11
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.380
But basically, you can see here, we have
a whole bunch of icons that you can use in

12
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.178
your websites and your web
applications and they're fonts, so

13
00:00:48.178 --> 00:00:52.819
they are infinitely scalable and they'll
always look sexy on your websites or

14
00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:56.303
on your global applications or
whatever you use them for.

15
00:00:56.303 --> 00:00:58.905
So to go ahead and download those,

16
00:00:58.905 --> 00:01:02.782
you can head to the home page here and
hit Download.

17
00:01:02.782 --> 00:01:06.150
The version that I'm downloading is 4.2.0.

18
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.520
And just to show you here, in your course
files folder that you have downloaded

19
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:17.590
awhile back, in the assets here of
the Final static website, assets.

20
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.490
If you go to CSS, you'll see a folder
here called Font Awesome and

21
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.180
then there's a couple folders in there.

22
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.970
That's what we're gonna be installing.

23
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.470
If you wanted you could just drag
this Font Awesome folder right into

24
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.950
your CSS folder in your static website
that you're building right now.

25
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.840
But, what you might wanna try doing is
just downloading the most recent version.

26
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.230
Remember that I'm using 4.2.0, so
if you every come across any bugs

27
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.740
it's probably because you are using
a more up to date version.

28
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.020
So i'll leave that to you
to do some bug fixes.

29
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.520
Otherwise if you don't want
to go through that hassle,

30
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.470
just make sure you are using 4.2.0.

31
00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.670
And I have that version like
I said right here in my

32
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.670
CSS folder of the course files folder.

33
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.940
Okay, so I've downloaded that here.

34
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:05.560
I'll show you.

35
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.330
Font Awesome zip file,
go ahead and unzip that.

36
00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.830
And just for readability sake,
delete the version number.

37
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.900
It just looks a little bit easier on
your eyes 4.2.0 you don't need that.

38
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.300
And in your static site that
you're building right now,

39
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.370
drag that folder into your CSS folder.

40
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.700
So, Font Awesome.

41
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.660
Go ahead and
drag that right in there, cool.

42
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.570
So now you have a few folders in here.

43
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.536
There are a couple of things we
don't actually need less and SCSS.

44
00:02:36.536 --> 00:02:40.140
Those are a couple

45
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.130
CSS languages that we're not gonna
be using right now in this course.

46
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.550
We're just gonna be using CSS and font.

47
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:46.910
So just go ahead and wipe those out.

48
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.060
All right.

49
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.680
Now we have everything we need.

50
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.310
And we'll need to go
to our code editor and

51
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.620
create a reference to those,
to that folder.

52
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.170
So that we can actually
utilize our icon fonts.

53
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.530
So here it is in our CSS folder,
Font Awesome.

54
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.160
You probably already know how to do this.

55
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.147
Just go ahead and add a link tag here,

56
00:03:15.147 --> 00:03:19.589
href and it is in your assets

57
00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:24.624
folder css/font-awesome.

58
00:03:24.624 --> 00:03:27.925
And you're gonna need to
reference the CSS itself here,

59
00:03:27.925 --> 00:03:30.930
so let's see what that's called.

60
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.860
So there's a CSS and a fonts folder, we
need to make references to both of those.

61
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.990
So we have Font Awesome CSS and min.CSS.

62
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.505
Let's just use min because it
will take less time to load.

63
00:03:41.505 --> 00:03:46.350
Css/font-awesome.min.css, and

64
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:53.402
let's put a rel attribute there for
stylesheet, cool.

65
00:03:53.402 --> 00:03:58.332
All right, and I'm just gonna put
a HTML comment up here just so

66
00:03:58.332 --> 00:04:00.949
I can know what this is all about.

67
00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:03.827
Font Awesome Icons.

68
00:04:03.827 --> 00:04:08.935
So, yeah, this is all you need to do to
add your reference to your Font Awesome.

69
00:04:08.935 --> 00:04:12.303
There is in the Font Awesome folder,
you can see there's a Fonts folder.

70
00:04:12.303 --> 00:04:16.393
So we might wanna make sure that the CSS
is referencing this Fonts folder

71
00:04:16.393 --> 00:04:19.129
correctly, because
that's why this is here.

72
00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:21.008
Our CSS Is going to look for

73
00:04:21.008 --> 00:04:25.885
this font's folder in order to serve
up those fonts or those icons.

74
00:04:25.885 --> 00:04:29.856
So let's just open our Font Awesome CSS.

75
00:04:29.856 --> 00:04:34.800
All right, so it looks like here
the source URL is looking for fonts.

76
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.630
So we're going up a directory, jumping
down into fonts, Font Awesome web font.

77
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.580
We're here in CSS, we're jumping up
a directory, and then down to fonts.

78
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.380
It looks like this is perfect you
don't need to change this at all.

79
00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.930
And again right here we're using min.css
so if you are gonna make any changes,

80
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.330
make sure that you make
changes to the min.css or

81
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.400
if you do it to the CSS compile
it to a minified version.

82
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:05.230
And just to show you what will be using
those the Font Awesome icon font four.

83
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:10.150
Right here, these little social icons
Twitter, Facebook and Google Plus.

84
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.330
These are actually icon fonts, they're
not graphics, I didn't use Photoshop or

85
00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.520
download them at all.

86
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.080
This is actually, these are fonts,
so if you had your font size really

87
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.860
large those would scale and
you can still see here,

88
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.750
I'm zoomed really disgustingly far in,
these things are still sharp,

89
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.860
that's because they are fonts and
not actually bitmap graphics.

90
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.010
All right.

91
00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.620
So that's it for the icon fonts for
installing Font Awesome.

92
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:38.500
Don't you dare go anywhere,

93
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.680
because in the next lecture I'm going
to show you how to add the type kit and

94
00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:48.030
Google Fonts libraries to your website so
you can use some sexy fonts.

95
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:48.666
See you there.

96
00:05:48.666 --> 00:05:52.199
