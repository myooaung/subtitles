00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.100
Hey everybody.
Welcome back to

2
00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.970
Boost Your Income With
Bootstrap To WordPress.

3
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.190
We're in a brand new section now or
module as we can call it.

4
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.600
Where we're going to be converting
our static templates into dynamic.

5
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.670
WordPress.

6
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.370
Pages.
So in this first lecture of this section,

7
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.640
we're going to be creating
a homepage template.

8
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.159
It's a very simple lecture,
see you in there.

9
00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:28.679
[MUSIC]

10
00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:30.390
All right everyone,
here's whats gonna happen.

11
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.110
We're going to get started
on the good stuff here.

12
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.810
So here's our local version of the site,
and

13
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.050
we need to basically start making
it look a bit more like this.

14
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.240
So this right here is a template.

15
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.540
It's an actual template
that I created in php and

16
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.010
associated it with WordPress, and then
we can use that to start creating this.

17
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.791
So, right now that might sound confusing,
or whatever, but

18
00:00:57.791 --> 00:01:01.110
let me just show you
how we're gonna do it.

19
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.476
Go to your code edition.

20
00:01:02.476 --> 00:01:06.590
What you're gonna want to do is,
in your root directory of the theme,

21
00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.955
you're going to want to
create a file called

22
00:01:12.955 --> 00:01:18.200
page-home.php.

23
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:25.340
Now, the naming convention with
this is to create a template.

24
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.030
You need to start off by calling it page.

25
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.360
So you see here how there's a page.php.

26
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.198
Page.php is actually the default page,
that displays or

27
00:01:34.198 --> 00:01:37.580
the default template that displays for
all pages.

28
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.736
So right here, this is actually
serving up content from or

29
00:01:42.736 --> 00:01:49.660
the structure from page.php but
if we wannnacreate alternate templates.

30
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.240
And we just need to create
new files called page- and

31
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.420
then whatever the title is.

32
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.020
Whatever you want to call it.

33
00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.710
This doesn't actually show
up anywhere on the site.

34
00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.790
It's just for your reference.

35
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.000
So I know this is gonna be the homepage.

36
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.590
So page-home, makes perfect sense for me.

37
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.000
So go ahead and do that.

38
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.555
And what you're gonna want to do now
is actually take the content from

39
00:02:12.555 --> 00:02:17.530
page.php, copy it and paste it in here.

40
00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.850
Now we're basically gonna be
getting rid of most of it but

41
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.390
I just want to show you the basic
structure and get this going.

42
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.300
So, right here,
we start out with some text.

43
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.250
And this is from the page.php, and it's
all in a comment just letting you know,

44
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.090
this is the default template
that displays for all pages.

45
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.380
Please note that this is
the WordPress construct of pages, and

46
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.700
that other pages on your WordPress
site will use a different template.

47
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.150
So we're gonna be creating
different templates for our pages.

48
00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.820
And because the homepage is very specific,

49
00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.540
we need to create a very
specific template.

50
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.540
So get rid of this, basically all of this,
and add a new php comment here.

51
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.860
And in here, this is where you
give the title of the template.

52
00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.890
And this is important because it
actually shows up on the front end or

53
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.500
the dashboard at WordPress and
I'll show you now in a sec.

54
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.760
So Template Name, it's important
that you type that out, Home Page.

55
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.580
That's what we're gonna
call this template.

56
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.240
And then leave get_header.

57
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.000
We're gonna rid of all of the HTML cuz we
have our own that we're gonna be building.

58
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.190
And we actually don't need the sidebar for
this, so don't get_sidebar.

59
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.430
That function, if you are curious,
pulls sidebar.php right here.

60
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.152
But we don't need it.

61
00:03:37.152 --> 00:03:41.704
Get_header pulls header.php
right over here, and

62
00:03:41.704 --> 00:03:44.960
get_footer, you guessed it,
pulls in footer.php.

63
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.310
We don't need the sidebar, so
this is what we need right now.

64
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.840
Go ahead and save that.

65
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.850
Let's go back to WordPress,
and open up the dashboard.

66
00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.110
And go to pages.

67
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.990
And let's just delete the sample page.

68
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.040
We don't need it,
we're gonna start from scratch.

69
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.400
Go ahead and add a new page.

70
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.270
And here, call it, just call it Home.

71
00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.810
Now over here in the page attributes.

72
00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:15.360
Right here.

73
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.240
You see this section called Template.

74
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.653
So Default Template is page.php but
I wanna click this and

75
00:04:23.653 --> 00:04:26.320
now we have an option called Home Page.

76
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.076
And that's only there because
we created a new page meaning

77
00:04:31.076 --> 00:04:38.930
page-home.php and in the php comment said
template name home page, here it is.

78
00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:47.420
So now this content is what's gonna be
pulled into our page-home template.

79
00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.260
When we serve up the homepage.

80
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.291
So go ahead and publish that.

81
00:04:52.381 --> 00:04:54.000
And you're not gonna
see anything right now.

82
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.280
So if I go view page, it's actually
gonna be totally empty except for

83
00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.620
the header because there's nothing.

84
00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.190
There's nothing here.

85
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:07.450
And we're not telling WordPress in any way
to pull in content from the database or

86
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.350
pull in our HTML or anything.

87
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.196
It's just start from scratch.

88
00:05:12.196 --> 00:05:19.070
So now, just to get started a little bit,
open up your static HTML file.

89
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:24.900
And basically everything in
here from HERO all the way down

90
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:30.460
to just before SIGN UP SECTION.

91
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.670
So at the end of kudos your
gonna cut that or copy it and

92
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.138
then paste it in your page home.

93
00:05:37.138 --> 00:05:40.810
Right there, there it is.

94
00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.890
So now what you actually wanna do,
what I forgot to do in the footer lecture,

95
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:50.630
which is just a couple back,
was put the footer info from index, so

96
00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:56.910
sign up section and footer and modal.

97
00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.320
We want that as well, copy that and

98
00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.750
put it in footer.php right above
the Bootstrap core JavaScript.

99
00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:11.030
That's where we want it, because that
stuff is important to have global.

100
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.470
We want it on all of the templates,
all the pages.

101
00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:14.379
So save that.

102
00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.750
And let's just check it
out on the front end.

103
00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:24.660
So now our home page actually has our
content and it's pretty much perfect.

104
00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.180
Except for
our images are pulling the wrong path,

105
00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.920
which we can fix with a batch search and
replace.

106
00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.140
We'll do that in a sec.

107
00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.790
But everything is here.

108
00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:38.600
What's awesome now is that we've
already coded the static template,

109
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.620
the static files in the first
section of this course.

110
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:47.030
And now, we just need to go through, and
just nit pick and use some WordPress

111
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:51.510
functions, and fiddle around with some
variables and php and all the fun stuff.

112
00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.130
And then we're going to start
having a really cool, dynamic site.

113
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:59.430
It's actually quite easy once you get
the grasp and you know what you're doing.

114
00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.962
And that's why I'm here to show you.

115
00:07:01.962 --> 00:07:05.880
I'm gonna show you how to do this so
you can replicate this process for

116
00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.630
your own projects in the future.

117
00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:10.460
Whether it's a personal project, whether
it's a startup and you're building your

118
00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:16.680
own website, whether you're a graphic
designer and you get a project to design.

119
00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:21.530
And then instead of hiring a web
developer and paying them three, five,

120
00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:23.530
ten thousand dollars, or whatever.

121
00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.820
You can charge that and pocket that.

122
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.850
So by knowing the skill, you're every

123
00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:35.290
new lecture that you take with me
now is just going to equip you with

124
00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:40.460
incredibly valuable skills that you
can be charging a lot of money for.

125
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.210
And that's why I want to teach you this,
it's super exciting.

126
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.910
And for me it was life changing and
I hope it's the same for you.

127
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:47.980
So there's my little inspirational moment.

128
00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:49.500
Let's get back into the good stuff.

129
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.040
I'm just gonna do a couple things.

130
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.860
Let's maybe do that batch search and
replace,

131
00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:56.630
because those images
are bugging me right now.

132
00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:57.430
Okay.

133
00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:02.080
So all we really need to do for this
stuff, maybe let's not do this one by one.

134
00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.480
Let's do a search and replace again.

135
00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:08.705
If you're using Coda, Cmd+F,
or you can, somewhere up here,

136
00:08:08.705 --> 00:08:14.510
you can do Edit > Find > Find and
Replace, that sort of stuff.

137
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:16.380
But right here it's a little toolbar,
Cmd+F.

138
00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:20.160
If you're using a different code editor,
I guess you're on your own,

139
00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.610
but it should be pretty easy to do that.

140
00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:23.650
Okay.
So

141
00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:26.180
all we really need to do again is source.

142
00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:33.639
And I'm gonna select everything

143
00:08:33.639 --> 00:08:39.266
that's src="assets/img.

144
00:08:39.266 --> 00:08:46.123
And then over here I want this

145
00:08:46.123 --> 00:08:52.989
to be src="php bloginfo.

146
00:08:55.079 --> 00:09:00.550
And in bloginfo we have a couple strings,
stylesheet_directory.

147
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:07.180
Now it's gonna give us the style
sheet directory, /assets/image.

148
00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:10.310
And we don't have a trailing slash at the
end over here, so don't put it over here.

149
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:12.890
Go ahead and find and
replace all of those, and

150
00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:14.820
that would be 11 instances on this page.

151
00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.440
So now if I save and refresh.

152
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:23.430
We should have our images and
they should all be there, perfect, great.

153
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:25.570
One last thing here,
while we're on the home page,

154
00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:26.920
basically, this is it for this lecture.

155
00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:31.110
But, there's one little thing here,
if you look up here in the address bar,

156
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:38.360
you can see local host port 8888/ and
then we have query string page id=7.

157
00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:42.810
So this is the standard default
way that WordPress pulls in pages.

158
00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:46.960
Cuz it's php and so it's pulling
the page ID that the database stored for

159
00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.400
this page and
that's how it's serving up the content.

160
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.600
But it doesn't look good, it looks bad.

161
00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.100
And it's not good for SEO.

162
00:09:55.100 --> 00:10:00.783
And it's not good for
telling your friends or your clients,

163
00:10:00.783 --> 00:10:08.470
go to my website bradic.ca/?page_id=7%,
whatever, it's no good.

164
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:13.030
So it's very easy to fix,
just go to your dashboard and

165
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:17.750
head to Settings > Permalinks.

166
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:22.030
And then right away I just wanna fix this
because we're gonna do it at some point,

167
00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:24.290
might as well do it now.

168
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:25.610
Post name.
You can use any of these.

169
00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:28.970
Numeric, month and
day name if you're blogging heavily and

170
00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:32.000
you want everything categorized by date.

171
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.990
Or you just want to be numeric like this.

172
00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:40.290
Or post name, which just always
has / whatever the page name is.

173
00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:44.600
It could be /about, /blog,
/ if you have a post name,

174
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:50.510
like how I made a thousand bucks,
it'd be /how-I-made so on so forth.

175
00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:55.770
Or custom structure if you want it to be
a little more detailed, like you want look

176
00:10:55.770 --> 00:11:02.760
your website name / the category
of the blog/the blog post name.

177
00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:07.842
And I like doing that because I
think it's a little bit better for

178
00:11:07.842 --> 00:11:10.959
SEO, and it's a bit more structured.

179
00:11:10.959 --> 00:11:15.416
So if you're going to, if you prefer
a blog post and it's categorized code,

180
00:11:15.416 --> 00:11:19.272
then it will be,
the URL will be website.com/code/postname.

181
00:11:19.272 --> 00:11:20.750
Do you know what I mean?

182
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:21.550
So let's do that.

183
00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:22.126
It's really easy.

184
00:11:22.126 --> 00:11:31.170
It's just /%category%/%postname%/.

185
00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:32.180
So that's all.

186
00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:34.540
It's very straightforward.

187
00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:38.070
And that just means it's gonna pull
the category, if there is one.

188
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:43.330
And if there are multiple, it's just gonna
pull the first one and then postname.

189
00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:44.210
So go ahead and save that.

190
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:46.510
You don't have to do it, but
that's what I want to do.

191
00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:48.210
Perfect.
So

192
00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:52.900
now if I go back it should just say
nothing because we're on the homepage.

193
00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:54.330
So I just noticed something here.

194
00:11:54.330 --> 00:12:01.300
I went back to the main page of the site
and then somehow we're back here.

195
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.760
The reason being is I forgot
to do a couple of things.

196
00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.330
So very easy fix.

197
00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:06.151
Let's go back to our dashboard.

198
00:12:08.427 --> 00:12:12.302
Now what we're gonna do is go ahead and

199
00:12:12.302 --> 00:12:17.600
go back to settings and
then go to Reading.

200
00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.540
So it's right here.

201
00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:21.480
The front page displays,
by default this is your latest post, so

202
00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.590
it acts as the blog page.

203
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:28.210
Otherwise, you can have a static
page display as a front page,

204
00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:30.710
which is what we want,
which would be our homepage.

205
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:33.180
So go ahead and
select Home for front page.

206
00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:36.270
Posts page, we don't have a blog page yet,
which we will.

207
00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:39.590
Leave that as just Select for
now, and we'll change that.

208
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:42.470
And while you're working on you site
locally make sure to discourage search

209
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:44.860
engines from indexing the site.

210
00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:48.050
That's just so
you don't accidentally index your site.

211
00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:52.710
However it's not gonna happen
because you're working locally but

212
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:54.820
if you put it up on a staging URL and
you're still working on it,

213
00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:57.460
you don't want your site to be
indexed until it's fully live.

214
00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:00.450
So make sure that is
checked until you are live.

215
00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:01.180
Good.

216
00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:04.180
So, now if I go back to the homepage,
we should be good.

217
00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:04.860
There we go.

218
00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:05.820
Great.
That's it.

219
00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:06.580
See you in the next lecture.

220
00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:11.330
We're going to start playing around with
some variables and some custom fields and

221
00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:12.560
start making this dynamic.

222
00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:18.489
Cool, see you there.
