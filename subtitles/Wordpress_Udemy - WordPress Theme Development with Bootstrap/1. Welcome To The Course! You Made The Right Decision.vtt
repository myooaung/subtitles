Welcome to the first lecture of Boost

3
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.070
I'm your instructor Brad Hussey.

4
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.795
Hang on tight.

6
00:00:16.128 --> 00:00:17.510
All right, hey everybody.

7
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.270
First of all I want to welcome you
to the course and thank you so

8
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.550
much for signing up.

9
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:22.800
I truly appreciate it.

10
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.780
Let me tell you why you
made the right decision for

11
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:32.540
choosing me and this course, Boost your
Income with Bootstrap to WordPress.

12
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.760
I've spent a whole block of time,
hours and hours and

13
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.530
hours, putting this course together.

14
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.760
And I've spent even more hours learning
these skills throughout my career, so

15
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.350
that I could put it together
in this course for you.

16
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.450
The reason why I want to teach you this is
because, not only is it just a really fun,

17
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.350
cool skill to learn.

18
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.170
Learning to code or learning how to
create a website and, you know, and

19
00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.760
develop a WordPress website.

20
00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.270
Sure, that's great.

21
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.730
But, just learning how to code
a website in Bootstrap and

22
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.140
how to code a WordPress website,
standalone those are just skills.

23
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.200
They're just stand alone.

24
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.770
There's nothing really
important about that.

25
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.970
What's really special about those
skills when you put them together and

26
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:22.770
then when you take them in this course is
you can significantly increase you income.

27
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.270
You can improve your life by knowing

28
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.680
how to do what I'm about to
teach you in this course.

29
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.300
Why are you wondering that?

30
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.000
Well whether you're a freelance designer,
an entrepreneur, an employee for

31
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.370
a company, code hobbyist or
just looking for

32
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.740
a new career, this course gives
you an immensely valuable skill.

33
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.150
That will enable you to either
make money on the side.

34
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.120
So that you can save up for that Hawaiian
vacation that you've been wanting.

35
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.140
Help pay off your debt, your car, your
mortgage or simply just to have some bonus

36
00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:00.020
cash laying around or
to create a full time income.

37
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.880
WordPress developers, they have options.

38
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.860
Menu developers, they make a generous
living, creating custom WordPress themes

39
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.890
and selling them on
websites like Theme Forest.

40
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.250
Freelance designers and developers can
also take on WordPress projects and

41
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.270
then make an extra one to five thousand
a month, that's pretty awesome.

42
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.400
So yes, we're going to learn
how to code a website,

43
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.200
a responsive website in boot strap and
we're going to make it

44
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.470
dynamic with the content management system
using WordPress and that's awesome.

45
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.630
But where the goods really come into play
is that when you're done this course,

46
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.320
you can make your money back
tenfold in a single project.

47
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.150
You could create a career out of this.

48
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.660
You can improve your current career.

49
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.400
You can get a raise at your job,
or you can get a better job.

50
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.220
You can stop waiting tables
if you're actor, and

51
00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.370
you can take on side jobs
as a web developer, and

52
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.870
make way more money than you would
ever make serving espressos or pizza.

53
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.430
So what I'm trying to say here is you
made the right decision, because,

54
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.580
one, you're learning a really neat skill.

55
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.420
Bootstrap and WordPress,
web development, that's awesome.

56
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.940
But, two.

57
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.690
You're going to have a valuable skill that
you will have with you forever, as long

58
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.170
as you keep it up to date I suppose, but
you could take that and change your life.

59
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.790
It's changed my life.

60
00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:39.480
And, I wanna share that with you in the
form of a really well structured course.

61
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.920
So I hope I live up to my excitement.

62
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.600
Obviously you can do what
you wish with the course.

63
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.570
You can take the course and
leave a review and say great,

64
00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.900
that was fun brushing up
on my bootstrap skills.

65
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.750
Or you can take it and
run and significantly

66
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.120
improve your quality of life,
your income, or just have a lot of fun.

67
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.420
So, yeah,
I really hope you love this course.

68
00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.440
I've designed it in a way
that you will love it, and

69
00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.150
if you don't, if it doesn't live up to
your expectations, or my excitement, then,

70
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.960
well, you have 30 days here
to just get your money back.

71
00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.150
So there really is no risk.

72
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.110
I'm excited to teach you.

73
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.628
Let's jump in.

74
00:04:25.628 --> 00:04:28.959
