Hey, everybody!

3
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.630

Scripts to Your HTML Document.

Check it out.

5
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.263
At the very, very bottom before
our closing body tag we have some

6
00:00:22.263 --> 00:00:27.460
bootstrap core JavaScript that
we're going to need to add.

7
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:35.650
So let's add an HTML comment there,
Bootstrap Core JavaScript,

8
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.090
and so that will be placed
at the end of the document.

9
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.840
Let me just get a little.

10
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.380
May as well use the same HTML comment.

11
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.610
Perfect, okay.

12
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.670
So we're gonna need to add a script tag,
and

13
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.910
that script tag is gonna have
some attributes here, source.

14
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:04.330
And we're gonna load up the version
that is on Google APIs.com website so,

15
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.370
slash slash don't put http or
https, this will do it for you.

16
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.570
It will decide whether to
serve up the secure one or

17
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.733
not, that's just kind
of one way of doing it.

18
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:26.468
googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jq-

19
00:01:26.468 --> 00:01:29.815
uery.min.js.

20
00:01:29.815 --> 00:01:34.410
Now if you're wondering hey Brad,

21
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.440
do you have a crazy memory and
how do you remember all that?

22
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.170
Well, I don't remember all this.

23
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.370
It's just if you download a template
off of the getbootstrap.com website,

24
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.950
all of this stuff is kind of included.

25
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:56.640
So I've just picked and chosen the stuff
that I want included in our project.

26
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.600
So I actually have something that
I'm just looking at right now and

27
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.010
just typing the same thing out.

28
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.156
So you copy me, I copy my old work,
everybody's good.

29
00:02:05.156 --> 00:02:07.407
Capisce, capoosh.

30
00:02:07.407 --> 00:02:09.380
Script, got another script here.

31
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.000
Source, assets.

32
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.130
This one is actually local.

33
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:23.280
So what we're doing here is

34
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.720
we're checking here for
the version online and

35
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.395
if we don't have an internet connection
it will default to our local version

36
00:02:32.395 --> 00:02:42.030
"assets/js/jquery-2.1.1.min.js.

37
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.580
Now, you might be wondering, Brad,

38
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.020
we don't actually have J Query
in our assets JS folder.

39
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.840
You're right, so
we need to go ahead and download that.

40
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.660
So just head to Google and
type in Google, jQuery, so

41
00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.650
that'll pull up the Google
hosted libraries here.

42
00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.050
Open that up, and
it will give you a bunch of

43
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.040
hosted libraries that you can just
utilize Google's servers to serve up.

44
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.470
So you can see all
the available libraries here.

45
00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.750
We're going to need jQuery.

46
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:12.990
That'll pop us down to jQuery.

47
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.170
And you can see here it gives you a couple
of script snippets that you can copy.

48
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.730
We use the 1.11.1, but looks like there's
a new one, so let's just copy that.

49
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.700
And go back to our code editor and

50
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.084
replace this script with the most
up to date one, which is 2.1.1.

51
00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.060
We're gonna also need to download jQuery.

52
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.780
So, there's a couple ways you could do it.

53
00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.220
The recommended way is just
to go to jquery.com and

54
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.970
download the latest version of jQuery,
which I will do right here.

55
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.030
jQuery 2x.

56
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.140
Let's download the latest
version of jQuery.

57
00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.220
So, the compressed production version.

58
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.960
That should be good,
there's J query 2.1.1.

59
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.714
Gonna open that up there.

60
00:03:57.714 --> 00:04:02.824
In our Bootstrap 2 WordPress site here,

61
00:04:02.824 --> 00:04:08.956
in JS,
I'm gonna drag J query 2.1.1 into our

62
00:04:08.956 --> 00:04:14.070
JS folder, we should now have that here.

63
00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.590
And this reference should
now be a real reference.

64
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.350
Okay, and then one last thing.

65
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.330
We'll just add it now while we're here.

66
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:33.490
script src="assests/js/main.js" And
we're going to close that up there.

67
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.700
So we don't have one in there so
we might as well add one.

68
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.600
We're not going to do anything with
it yet, but main.js in our js folder.

69
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.540
And we'll come back to
that when the time comes.

70
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.520
So let's just do a quick review here,
to make sure we've got everything.

71
00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.150
We have our doc type,
we have all the necessary HTML tags,

72
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.410
we have some meta tags that we'll
be filling out here once we get

73
00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.140
into WordPress in a little while from now.

74
00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:01.010
We're referencing our
favicon in our images folder.

75
00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.920
The title, got some HTML5 shiv and respond
js for those silly Internet Explorer

76
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.960
browsers, and then we've got our header
hero opt in, booster income section,

77
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.300
who benefits, yada yada yada, a bunch
of HTML section tags, HTML5 footer tag,

78
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.230
a div for our modal, and
boot strap, core JavaScript.

79
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.830
We added all that fancy,
schmancy stuff there.

80
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.880
Body, HTML, we're good.

81
00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.800
If you just got that far and
you survived good job, you're awesome.

82
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.600
See you in the next lecture,
where we're going to be

83
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:39.000
installing the free icon fonts,
Font Awesome.

84
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.939
See you there.
