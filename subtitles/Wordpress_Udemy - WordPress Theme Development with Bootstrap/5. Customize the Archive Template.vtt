Hey welcome back to Boost Your
Income With Bootstrap to WordPress,

2
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.430
Whatcha know about the archive template?

3
00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:13.010
[MUSIC]

4
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:13.970
All right, so

5
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:19.330
in this lecture we're going to be fixing
what is called the archive template and

6
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:25.010
the archive template basically is able to
show you any posts that you're looking for

7
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.970
within an archive, and an archive could
count as, show me all the posts in

8
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.905
a specific category in a specific tag,
and everything like that.

9
00:00:34.905 --> 00:00:38.445
So if I clicked on a tag
here like fake post

10
00:00:38.445 --> 00:00:42.725
this will pull up all the posts
that were tagged under fake posts.

11
00:00:42.725 --> 00:00:48.315
Uncategorized category pulls up all
the categories within that category,

12
00:00:48.315 --> 00:00:51.375
called uncategorized,
that was a lot of the same word.

13
00:00:51.375 --> 00:00:55.215
So hopefully that makes sense,
that's what the archive template is and

14
00:00:55.215 --> 00:01:01.840
luckily there is actually a template
in Wordpress called archive.php.

15
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:02.790
Open that up.

16
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.470
So this the template for
displaying archived pages, and it's

17
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.350
a little intimidating looking, there's a
lot of if and else if statements here, and

18
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.759
it's basically just trying to pull in
all the possibilities for the archives.

19
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.290
And then it's just giving you what you
need but, the structure itself for

20
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.150
the HTML doesn't match our styles and

21
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.850
we just need to make
that a little bit better.

22
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.660
So, it's quite easy to fix so,
let's just get started.

23
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.140
We're going to just go through and we're
gonna clean up some of this mark up here.

24
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.590
So let's just get rid of
the section in main here.

25
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.340
Get rid of those and scroll all the way to
the bottom, and remove those closing tags.

26
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.520
We don't need those.

27
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.150
We're going to use our own mark up
that's gonna match what's gonna work for

28
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.350
our styles.

29
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.899
So at the very top let's have
our if statement have posts.

30
00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.800
And then, get rid of this header, and

31
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.130
make sure to delete the closing tag as
well, so you don't run into any issues.

32
00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.770
Page header down here.

33
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.570
Great, we're gonna basically,

34
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.120
make the archive page look
a little bit like our blog page.

35
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.550
The layer,
where we have this big header here, and

36
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.500
we want our posts to show up, kind of
like in the excerpt, the blog overview.

37
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.030
And we wanna have our sidebar, and
then we wanna have the category

38
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.000
displayed up here with a nice,
parallax background image.

39
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.280
So head back, and then right up here,
outside of the level one heading,

40
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.810
we're going to grab
the feature image section,

41
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.801
and we're going to paste it here,
so let's open up our blog.html.

42
00:02:36.801 --> 00:02:42.120
And let's grab the section
header right here, copy that,

43
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.620
and paste it, but
then remove the closing section tag and

44
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.630
the level one heading, cuz we're gonna
keep the section tag as the opening tag.

45
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.740
Everything is fine here,
we don't need to change anything.

46
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.020
We just need to make sure to
close that tag all the way

47
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.710
down here after the level one heading.

48
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.280
There we go, and

49
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.520
now while we're down here let's grab
this php, the optional term description.

50
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.840
We're going to grab that and put it
within the level one heading as well.

51
00:03:16.833 --> 00:03:19.090
After this php here.

52
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.530
And within the print function right here.

53
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.410
We're gonna change this from
a div to a small tag, and

54
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.900
make sure to close that small tag,
because in our level one heading, or

55
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.020
in any heading,
if we have a small tag within it,

56
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.020
it has a specific style that we have
set up and it should look pretty good.

57
00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.040
And I'll show you what this optional
term description is shortly.

58
00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.590
Save that.

59
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:43.270
Scroll back up.

60
00:03:44.827 --> 00:03:46.290
And make sure this is good.

61
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.530
We have our section level 1 heading,
okay great.

62
00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.010
I'll scroll down after the level 1
heading we have some stuff here.

63
00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.770
We have the loop.

64
00:03:54.278 --> 00:04:00.258
And so, before the loop starts,
we wanna have some markup and

65
00:04:00.258 --> 00:04:05.433
this is gonna be a div with
the class "container" and

66
00:04:05.433 --> 00:04:10.723
then we're going to have a div
with the ID of primary and

67
00:04:10.723 --> 00:04:16.128
the class of row and
after that we're going to have a main

68
00:04:16.128 --> 00:04:21.442
tag with the ID of content,
the class"col"-sm-8

69
00:04:24.413 --> 00:04:27.580
And then we're gonna have to make
sure that all of these close.

70
00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.230
So the main tag will close directly

71
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:37.087
after the content,
the else statement here, after the endif:.

72
00:04:38.787 --> 00:04:41.220
This will be the main tag.

73
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.610
There we go.
And then after that,

74
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:50.260
we'll close our primary tag, and
then we'll close our container.

75
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.710
There we go.

76
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.150
Let's tab this in and move these back.

77
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.190
There we go.

78
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.010
It should all line up.

79
00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.630
But now we need to make
sure to have the sidebar.

80
00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.240
So we're gonna cut this out, the sidebar,

81
00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.250
and we're gonna move it
directly after main.

82
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.223
And we're gonna have our sidebar here.

83
00:05:13.223 --> 00:05:17.875
And then aside tag,

84
00:05:17.875 --> 00:05:22.765
aside tag will have the class of col

85
00:05:22.765 --> 00:05:28.510
small four so that we can equate to twelve
and then paste the get side bar PHP.

86
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:33.320
Save that and let's go back to our
category and see what that looks like.

87
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:40.380
There we go, looks good like it was
just a few small tags to change,

88
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.590
and it looks perfect.

89
00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.500
And so should the tags,
the tags look good.

90
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.350
Perfect.

91
00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.880
Now the only thing is, what was the part,
the optional category description?

92
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.900
Well, let's edit this category.

93
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.430
In here you can see description,
and it's empty.

94
00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.390
So I'm just gonna put a description here.

95
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:04.330
Let's say uncategorized,
the description will be Update.

96
00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.440
Now let's go back to our blog and
view those categories, or

97
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.660
that specific category.

98
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:13.440
So here we go.

99
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.970
We can see the description isn't under it,
but it's grey and

100
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:20.140
you can't see in the background
therefore we just need to do a quick

101
00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.830
little CSS update and
this should look great.

102
00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:27.250
So go back to your code editor, open up
your styles and all we need to do is go to

103
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:32.110
our global section, and
after level one heading just go h1 small.

104
00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.490
So we're just gonna make that color white.

105
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.540
Now, we should be off to the races.

106
00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:38.340
There we go.

107
00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.960
Uncategorized, these are posts that have
been neglected and don't have a real home.

108
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:41.800
Just kidding.

109
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.560
There we go.

110
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.380
Now, up next, we just need to
work on our search template.

111
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.600
You see it doesn't look very good and
that's what the next one is all about.

112
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.804
See you there.
