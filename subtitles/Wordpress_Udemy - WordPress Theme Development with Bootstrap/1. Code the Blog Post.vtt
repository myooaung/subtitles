Hey everyone.

2
00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.573
Welcome back to Boost Your Income
with Bootstrap to WordPress, and

3
00:00:04.573 --> 00:00:07.493
in this lecture we're gonna
code the full blog post.

4
00:00:07.493 --> 00:00:15.712
[MUSIC]

5
00:00:15.712 --> 00:00:16.235
All right.

6
00:00:16.235 --> 00:00:18.515
The first thing I want you to
do is open your code editor and

7
00:00:18.515 --> 00:00:20.817
create a new file called post.html.

8
00:00:20.817 --> 00:00:25.895
And in post.html I want you to copy
everything you did in blog.html and

9
00:00:25.895 --> 00:00:26.595
paste it in there.

10
00:00:27.745 --> 00:00:32.295
Because we're using essentially the same
template, we don't have to do too much.

11
00:00:32.295 --> 00:00:34.670
We just have to make some modifications.

12
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.340
Now let me just show you what
the final post that HTML looks like,

13
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:40.800
here it is right here.

14
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.410
It essentially looks like the blog
overview just a bit bigger, and

15
00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:51.580
it includes a comments section with
some sample comments and a comment form.

16
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.270
All right, so back to our code editor.

17
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.500
You copied and pasted that.

18
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.970
Let's just make a few
modifications all ready here.

19
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.650
The title I just want to add blog post
in there, just for our own reference.

20
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.300
We're obviously going to be changing
that once we hook into WordPress.

21
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.890
All right.
Let's head down, all the way down to

22
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.850
this section right here
where it says blog content.

23
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.170
So we're gonna remove this section and

24
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.240
we're gonna take everything
out of blog content.

25
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.880
We're just gonna remove
everything right down to

26
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.330
the end of the main tag right there.

27
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.770
So all we're left is the header and then
the sidebar and everything after that.

28
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.030
So in here,
this is we will add a new HTML comment,

29
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.200
and change that to main content.

30
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.480
And we need to add a couple divs here so

31
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.470
we can make sure to close the divs all
the way down here, row and container.

32
00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.500
So first we'll have [INAUDIBLE]
class of container and remove

33
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.490
the closing gift tag because it's already
closed at the bottom of this HTML page.

34
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.740
And then a row div tag
with a class of row.

35
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.358
And remove the ending div tag
because it's at the bottom already.

36
00:02:14.358 --> 00:02:19.790
Okay, let's tab this back one, and

37
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.280
in here we need to add another div and
that would be div

38
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.820
with the id of content and
class callsmall8.

39
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.820
And we're going to want to close that

40
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.970
because then the next tag that will be
beside that, is the sidebar called small4.

41
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.500
Okay, and in here,
let's start adding some HTML.

42
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.050
We're going to have an article tag.

43
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.150
And we're going to give that
article tag the class of post.

44
00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.410
And then in there,
we're going to have a header tag.

45
00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.550
Within header, we'll have a level
one heading saying blog title here.

46
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.250
And then we'll also have a div
with a class of post details.

47
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.520
And basically let's just
copy what we already had

48
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.240
in our blog because we don't want
to re-invent the wheel here.

49
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.359
So header, we have post details,
just copy those.

50
00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.980
And in fact you could
also copy post images.

51
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:28.680
So copy post image and
copy all the way up to post details.

52
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.670
So you're gonna be grabbing header here,
but

53
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.370
I'll show you how to paste that properly.

54
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:41.552
So right here, post-details,
and remove that,

55
00:03:41.552 --> 00:03:46.380
paste that here, and that should be good.

56
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.250
There we go.
So you have your article,

57
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.590
you have your header, and then you
have the post-details within there,

58
00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:57.580
the title and the post-image,
there you go.

59
00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:07.140
After that we want to
add the post body and

60
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.680
within post body let's just add,
you can literally add whatever in here.

61
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.890
This is where we're going
to have the blog post, so

62
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:19.930
I'm going to add a few paragraph
tags with some in each of them.

63
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.970
I'm just going to copy that,
paste it a couple more times, And

64
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.050
then within there I'll just
put some other formatting.

65
00:04:32.821 --> 00:04:35.933
And then I'll do another
level four heading here.

66
00:04:40.043 --> 00:04:41.228
And then a paragraph tag.

67
00:04:43.595 --> 00:04:44.779
Some lorem ipsem.

68
00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:46.150
There we go, good enough.

69
00:04:47.635 --> 00:04:51.025
Close this article here with a comment.

70
00:04:51.025 --> 00:04:52.319
Post.
There we go.

71
00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:55.910
So I think we should have the blog post.

72
00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:56.510
Let's check it out.

73
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.990
All right, so we're pretty much there,
so we have our blog post here and

74
00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.150
it goes all the way down, looks good,
we just need some padding and

75
00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.300
we are missing an ID, and
that ID would be at the very top here.

76
00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.850
After the class of row we need
id of primary 'cuz that gives us

77
00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.700
the CSS to pop that down a bit.

78
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.362
Perfect and we're going to have to
do some CSS here to fix this up, so

79
00:05:26.362 --> 00:05:28.050
let's head into our CSS file.

80
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.330
Let's head into our blog section.

81
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:39.930
And in here, this style right here,
post header, post excerpt,

82
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:46.050
we also need to add post and
post-body because now we

83
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.910
have a new div with a class of post- body,
because it is different from the excerpt.

84
00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.540
So let's save that and
that should be everything.

85
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.610
Post body, there we go,
and it looks perfect.

86
00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:05.880
All right, and that's the post detail,
that's the full blog post right here.

87
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:11.130
Hang on tight, in the next lecture we're
actually going to code and style our

88
00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:15.840
comments section right here with some
sample comments and the comment form.

89
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:16.707
All right, see you there.

90
00:06:16.707 --> 00:06:19.764
