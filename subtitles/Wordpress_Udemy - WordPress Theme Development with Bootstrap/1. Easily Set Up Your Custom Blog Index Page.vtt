Hey everyone.
Welcome back to Boost Your Income

2
00:00:03.027 --> 00:00:05.188
with Bootstrap to WordPress, and

3
00:00:05.188 --> 00:00:09.525
in this lecture we are going to easily
set up a custom blog index page.

4
00:00:09.525 --> 00:00:17.787
[MUSIC]

5
00:00:17.787 --> 00:00:18.380
Hey guys.

6
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.230
Welcome back.

7
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.200
What we're gonna do here is
set up our blog index page.

8
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.010
The first thing you wanna
do is create a new page.

9
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.490
And just straight up call it blog.

10
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.100
You can call it news or,
you know, whatever.

11
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.910
But for the purposes of this course,
I'm gonna say stick to calling it blog.

12
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.360
Okay.
So we got our blog here.

13
00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.950
Just leave the default template for now.

14
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.060
And we're just gonna hit publish.

15
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.710
We just wanna be able to add that page,

16
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.310
so that we can go into our settings and
reading settings.

17
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.240
And then posts, so
we can finally change this to blog.

18
00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:03.410
So now this is telling WordPress,
hey the blog is using the blog page.

19
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.900
So, I know that sounds kind of stupid.

20
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.400
When we create a blog page, in Pages,

21
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:17.910
we can tell WordPress what to assign
the blog template to by default.

22
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:18.840
So go ahead and hit save.

23
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.900
And so head back to the front end
of the site, and here's your blog.

24
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.980
Click on that and see what we get.

25
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.960
So we get something.

26
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.090
We get kind of generic content here,

27
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.790
and our sample post that's provided
with most WordPress themes.

28
00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.540
We're going to go and
make this look a lot better.

29
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.990
Go to your code editor and
open up the index.php file.

30
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.990
It looks a bit like this.

31
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.500
It's called the main template file.

32
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.440
The most generic template file in
a WordPress theme is one of two required

33
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.320
files for a theme.

34
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.550
It's used to display page when
nothing more specific matches a query.

35
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.180
So it puts together the homepage when
no home.page file exists, and so

36
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.050
on and so forth.

37
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.830
So we're gonna use this for
our blog index page.

38
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.210
It is called index, so
that works out pretty well for us.

39
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.030
We don't have to do too much
here on the index page.

40
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.970
We just have to kind of
fix up the formatting, and

41
00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.110
it's actually surprisingly easy.

42
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.003
So open up the static version your blog.

43
00:02:20.594 --> 00:02:23.977
So in here, in the blog to html,
the static version of it,

44
00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:27.540
if you scroll down below header,
you should see a thing.

45
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.200
An hml5 tech called section, where we
have our feature image with the h1 for

46
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.030
the page title.

47
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.580
Copy that itself.

48
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.260
Go back to your index.

49
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.770
And right in under get_header,
paste that in there.

50
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.510
We're going to have that in there, and
you don't even need to do anything.

51
00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.620
Just leave it as is.

52
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.480
And then down here, we're going to
repurpose this content a little bit.

53
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.161
So we need to grab the main tag,
right here.

54
00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.038
And the primary and container tags.

55
00:03:02.038 --> 00:03:05.930
So we basically grab all this,
but don't grab any articles.

56
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.370
Just mean and the two dibs,
plus the comment.

57
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.840
We're going to paste
that directly under here.

58
00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.070
And then now what I want to do is
I want to close up those tags,

59
00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.910
just to make sure we're
not Messing around here.

60
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.010
And then I want to close that row.

61
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.290
That is the idea of primary.

62
00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.370
And then after that I want
to close up the container.

63
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.400
So disregard the stuff down here for
a sec.

64
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.399
What we want to do inside of our main tag

65
00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:42.110
is include the if have_posts php.

66
00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.609
All the way down to the endif,
so everything here.

67
00:03:47.455 --> 00:03:48.200
Remove that.

68
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.957
Paste it in here.

69
00:03:53.334 --> 00:03:53.920
There we go.

70
00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.400
And now, after main,
we need to actually have our sidebar.

71
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.800
So go back to your blog.html,
the static version, and

72
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.970
grab the sidebar comment and
the aside opening tag.

73
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.743
Then all you need to do is
paste that after the main tag.

74
00:04:19.563 --> 00:04:21.138
Close out that aside tag.

75
00:04:21.138 --> 00:04:24.387
And then.

76
00:04:26.627 --> 00:04:32.290
Inside the aside tag,
use the get sidebar function down below.

77
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:33.020
Paste it in there.

78
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.610
There you go.

79
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.940
And this looks like it's a little wonky.

80
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.720
I'm just gonna make sure
this is cleaned up properly.

81
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.130
There we go.

82
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.000
Okay.

83
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.730
And remove this.

84
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:45.860
Just mark it down here.

85
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.800
Now if I save that.

86
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.620
It looks good to me.

87
00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.162
Let's go back to our blog index page.

88
00:04:53.391 --> 00:04:53.980
There we go.

89
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.070
It's looking a lot better, isn't it?

90
00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.450
So, that's really it for
setting up the blog index page.

91
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.650
What we're going to to do next is
actually get everything set up.

92
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.080
The templates set up for
the individual blog excerpts right here,

93
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.210
because right now it's a little messy and
it doesn't look like it should.

94
00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.869
Which is right here.

95
00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:14.738
Needs a little bit more like this.

96
00:05:14.738 --> 00:05:16.346
So let's get to it.

97
00:05:16.346 --> 00:05:21.669
