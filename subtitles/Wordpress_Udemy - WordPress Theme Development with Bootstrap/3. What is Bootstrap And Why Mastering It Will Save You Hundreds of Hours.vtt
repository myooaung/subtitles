Hey, everyone.
Welcome back to Boost Your Income with

2
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:02.980
Bootstrap to WordPress.

3
00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.877
This lecture is called What is Bootstrap,

4
00:00:05.877 --> 00:00:09.503
and Why Mastering It Will
Save You Hundreds of Hours.

6
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.490
So I wanna tell you a little
bit about Bootstrap.

7
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.590
Bootstrap is a framework.

8
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.530
It is the most popular HTML and
CSS framework, actually, for

9
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.280
developing responsive and
mobile first projects on the web.

10
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.780
And responsive and
mobile first basically means it focuses on

11
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:42.140
websites that are coded to be fully
accessible on mobile devices and tablets.

12
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.760
So instead of developing your website
first for the desktop, and then later on,

13
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.820
adding in some media queries and making
it work on your iPhone or something,

14
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.470
that's not what Bootstrap tries to do.

15
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.500
What they're doing is focusing
primarily on mobile, and

16
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.520
then scaling it up to desktop.

17
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.230
So it should work all across the board.

18
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.015
So it's really great for that,
and it helps you save time,

19
00:01:04.015 --> 00:01:05.751
which is what this lecture is about.

20
00:01:05.751 --> 00:01:07.790
Before I started using Bootstrap, and

21
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.267
I've tried a bunch of other
frameworks too, and they're great.

22
00:01:11.267 --> 00:01:15.959
But before I started using Bootstrap,
I used to just hand-code by HTML and

23
00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:17.330
CSS templates.

24
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.932
And what I mean by templates is I worked
at a studio as a front-end web developer.

25
00:01:22.932 --> 00:01:27.480
What front-end web developers do
are code templates in HTML, and

26
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.179
CSS, and JavaScript or J-Query.

27
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.436
And then they hand those templates
off to a back-end developer.

28
00:01:34.436 --> 00:01:38.880
The back-end developer then
integrates those HTML and

29
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.360
CSS static templates into the database,
makes them dynamic, uses PHP or

30
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.970
whatever programming language, and
sets the rest of the website up.

31
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.984
So basically,
takes it from the front-end guy,

32
00:01:49.984 --> 00:01:55.210
the back-end guy does the really intense,
advanced development.

33
00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.410
And then you kinda have
a well-rounded website.

34
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.750
Bootstrap comes into play when you
are trying to build templates.

35
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.250
So like I said, when I used to code
templates by hand, I used to take

36
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.450
a long time because I am recoding
everything over and over and over again.

37
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.320
And a lot of the same elements,

38
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:19.520
I'm just basically reinventing every
single time, and it's time consuming.

39
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.700
When I discovered Bootstrap, I realized,
hey, I can actually use this

40
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.640
to save me a massive amount of time
because they already have things

41
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.640
that you just don't need to recode every
single time, like grids, responsive grids.

42
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.660
Sure, I can code a responsive
grid like nobody's business.

43
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.410
But I don't want to every single time I do
a project, because it's gonna waste time.

44
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.750
And I like to deliver fast and
efficiently.

45
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.440
Instead of me saying, hey, no,
I wanna practice my responsive grids,

46
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.040
I could just use Bootstrap to
just basically do it for me.

47
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.070
Things like form elements,
styling typography,

48
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.140
components like icons,
these are font icons.

49
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.990
Things like badges, and alerts,

50
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.650
panels, like this, just simple things,
little panels like this,

51
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.620
or wells where you kind of highlight
some texts in a little well.

52
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.880
Navigation bars, and tabs, buttons,

53
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.440
things like styling images,
and things like tables.

54
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.870
Tables are a pain in the butt to look
good, and they've already just done it for

55
00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.070
you by just adding a class called table.

56
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:37.170
So it's amazing because there's so
much here that you just

57
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.660
don't need to recreate over and over and
over and over again every single project.

58
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.630
So here's a good example, lets say you're
self-employed or you work at a company.

59
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.172
If you understand Bootstrap and how to
develop website layouts with Bootstrap,

60
00:03:52.172 --> 00:03:55.260
it's gonna save you and
your company precious development time.

61
00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.690
And what I mean precious development time,

62
00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.180
I mean hundreds of hours,
or thousands of dollars.

63
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.330
So if you're self-employed,
look at it this way.

64
00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.770
Two self-employed web developers are each
hired to build a small website for

65
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:08.855
let's say, $1,000.

66
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.550
Developer number one
hand-codes his website, and

67
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:18.050
it takes him about 40 hours to complete,
effectively making him $25 an hour.

68
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:22.050
Developer number two uses Bootstrap to
build his website, and it takes him 20

69
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:28.570
hours, because he's saving so much time,
effectively making him $50 an hour.

70
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.510
So which developer do you wanna be?

71
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:37.628
So in that 40 hours, developer number
two could do projects and make $2,000.

72
00:04:37.628 --> 00:04:40.984
Rather than developer number one
who's hand-coding everything, and

73
00:04:40.984 --> 00:04:43.090
he only did the one
project in the 40 hours.

74
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.350
Imagine how much time you can save and

75
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.990
how much more money you can make by
using a framework like Bootstrap.

76
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.700
That's why I sing its praises so much
because it's awesome, and it saves me so

77
00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:53.370
much time, and

78
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.940
it literally makes me thousands of
dollars more because I use Bootstrap.

79
00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.190
When Bootstrap says, it's the most
popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for

80
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.890
developing responsive, mobile first
products on the web, they mean it.

81
00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.100
And I know that because I work
with it every single day,

82
00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.930
and I've developed hundreds
of websites using Bootstrap.

83
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.878
So that's why we're using
Bootstrap in this project.

84
00:05:15.878 --> 00:05:19.389
