Hey everyone!
Welcome back to Boost Your Income with

2
00:00:02.218 --> 00:00:03.420
Bootstrap To WordPress.

3
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.150
This lecture is called

4
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.300
Two Ways Building Custom WordPress
Websites Can Make You More Money.

5
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:18.748
Check it out.
[MUSIC]

6
00:00:18.748 --> 00:00:19.248
All right,

7
00:00:19.248 --> 00:00:22.350
let me tell you the two most common
ways you can make money with WordPress.

8
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.650
Now keep in mind this course and

9
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.400
what I'm about to say isn't a get rich
quick scheme or anything like that.

10
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.840
You're not just going to
make money overnight.

11
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.060
You actually have to put
significant effort into any way

12
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.250
you're going to make money.

13
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.710
With WordPress.

14
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.970
It doesn't come easy, hard work is
involved and you need to be good at it.

15
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.110
So, keep that in mind as we move forward.

16
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.925
The first most common way of making money
with WordPress is by developing custom

17
00:00:49.925 --> 00:00:55.460
WordPress themes and selling them
on a marketplace like ThemeForest.

18
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.120
So here's an example of
a list of WordPress blog and

19
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.980
magazine themes that you could
download at themeforest.net.

20
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.780
Basically you come here, you check out
a theme, you see if you like the design,

21
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.400
looks good, you wanna use that for
your specific WordPress blog, or

22
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.550
your WordPress theme.

23
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:15.370
You download that.

24
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.170
Install that in WordPress and
then boom, there it is, it's a custom

25
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.750
designed theme you just purchased and
slapped it on your blog.

26
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.390
You can make money doing that obviously.

27
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.250
Basically what you do is,
you develop a custom WordPress theme and

28
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.860
then publish it on
the ThemeForest Marketplace,

29
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.590
however it's not as easy
as just doing it like that.

30
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.540
Building a custom WordPress
theme is actually a lot of work.

31
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.720
And by taking this course, keep in mind,
this course isn't about how to make custom

32
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.830
WordPress themes for ThemeForest, because
that could be a whole separate course.

33
00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.880
There are things that need to
go into marketing your theme and

34
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.760
support, you need to have ongoing support
you have to always update your theme.

35
00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.653
And there are a lot of intricate
little details involved in a custom

36
00:02:12.653 --> 00:02:14.340
WordPress them that you need to cover.

37
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.330
This course, more specifically,
is about the second way of making

38
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.140
money with WordPress,
which I'll touch on in a second.

39
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.280
I just wanna show you for those who are
interested in the possibility of making

40
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.760
money selling themes on ThemeForest or
any other theme marketplace.

41
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:40.243
I wanna show you how much it's possible
to make with WordPress themes.

42
00:02:40.243 --> 00:02:42.987
So here I have the WordPress blog and

43
00:02:42.987 --> 00:02:48.690
magazine themes I just pulled up this and
I am sorting it by sales.

44
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:55.090
Right here it's sorting by descending,
so it's currently showing the most

45
00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.360
popular or
the WordPress theme with the most sales.

46
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.875
So basically you just have
to do a little bit of math.

47
00:03:04.875 --> 00:03:10.740
$58 is what they're selling this theme
for, and they've made 11,823 sales.

48
00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.020
That's just south of three
quarters of a million dollars.

49
00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.790
So it's likely that TaiLabs,
the author of this plugin, is a studio.

50
00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.090
And they develop WordPress
themes exclusively.

51
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.200
So they might have a team, and
they are probably pretty dang good.

52
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.070
And you know they have expenses.

53
00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.960
They have to pay there employees.

54
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:30.700
They have insurance.

55
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.210
They probably have a brick and
mortar shop.

56
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.560
They have servers, and
they probably hire a support team.

57
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.870
So that's why they have so much money.

58
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.760
From this theme.

59
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.520
But this is just one theme.

60
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:48.520
These guys, they probably have
a few themes and they do.

61
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.800
They look like they have
a handful of themes.

62
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.770
And so if one of those
themes was making just south

63
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.290
of three quarters of a million dollars,
can you imagine four, five,

64
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.930
six themes, even if those only
did half as good as this one.

65
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.880
That's a lot of money.

66
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.880
Now keep in mind, you don't just
start developing WordPress themes and

67
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.150
then all of a sudden you're a millionaire.

68
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.050
Doesn't work like that.

69
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.120
If I sort this by ascending so from the
bottom to the top, you can see this theme

70
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:23.890
by this author, it's selling for
$43 and has sold two themes.

71
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:28.310
So this person has made, what, $86?

72
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:34.330
Plus the hosting that they've paid for
to put the website up and

73
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.240
the work that they've put in to
creating it, and they've made 86 bucks.

74
00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.330
Not a really good profit margin.

75
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.980
Now, this is the worst of the worst.

76
00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.400
And this is the best of the best.

77
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.700
So, that's a lot of
wiggle room in between.

78
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.130
From $86 to three quarters
of a million dollars.

79
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.630
Somewhere in the middle there, if you
create something really great, you really,

80
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.826
really look into creating
an amazing WordPress theme.

81
00:05:02.826 --> 00:05:08.241
And you put in all of the details
such as support, marketing,

82
00:05:08.241 --> 00:05:13.137
doing it correctly,
getting it up on ThemeForest, and

83
00:05:13.137 --> 00:05:16.810
ongoing support, ongoing updates.

84
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.220
Then you could do pretty decent for
yourself.

85
00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.865
You could have a good side income doing
this, or you could be full time doing

86
00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:28.320
this and making yourself a nice
salary just selling WordPress themes.

87
00:05:29.769 --> 00:05:35.776
Now, this course more specifically is
about how to make money the second way,

88
00:05:35.776 --> 00:05:38.850
with custom WordPress sites.

89
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:45.490
And that is by creating custom
WordPress websites for clients.

90
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.710
So, if you're a freelancer, if you
wanna start a freelance business, or

91
00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:55.190
you work at a studio, and your studio,
they build WordPress websites for

92
00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:00.850
their clients, and
you wanna be a part of that process.

93
00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:06.770
Or if you're a graphic designer and
you want to code the websites

94
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:13.070
that you've designed rather than outsource
them to a skilled developer, or say, for

95
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.840
example, you know how to build WordPress
websites and you wanna get a job.

96
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.150
You want a career at a studio full time.

97
00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.510
That's more so what this course is about.

98
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:28.010
But the bonuses, hey, you could take these
skills you're learning in this course and

99
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.010
you could go start
building WordPress themes.

100
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:36.280
So let me just show you
the jobs that you can get

101
00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.610
by knowing how to build
WordPress websites.

102
00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:47.390
So right here on authenticjobs.com,
there's a lead WordPress plugin developer.

103
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:51.060
Like I said earlier,
in this course at the very beginning,

104
00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:52.590
we're going to be building our own plugin.

105
00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:58.680
So, these guys,
this is a telecommute opportunity, so

106
00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.790
it's kind of, it's not like a you
don't need to be there specifically.

107
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.190
So you can work anywhere from US or

108
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:09.150
Canada in this specific job, and
it looks like an awesome job.

109
00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:12.990
And, they're paying you anywhere for
40 to 70 bucks per hour

110
00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:15.809
based on your experience and
your qualifications, how good you are.

111
00:07:15.809 --> 00:07:17.510
That's pretty good.

112
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:19.810
For a full time telecommute job.

113
00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:23.760
Right here WordPress front and
back end developer.

114
00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:24.920
They need these guys on site.

115
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:33.040
And it looks like they're paying up
to $70,000 a year, or $38 per hour.

116
00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.230
That's also pretty darn good.

117
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:40.960
Senior web designer here on Crop.com,
San Fernando Valley, California.

118
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.650
They're going around 45 bucks an hour
depending on your experience for

119
00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:49.920
a really awesome web design job where you
probably need to know some WordPress.

120
00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.250
And this is just a handful of jobs.

121
00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.600
There's a lot more all over the web.

122
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.799
And this is for
people who are looking for studio jobs.

123
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.460
That's not mentioning
the being of self-employed or

124
00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:07.350
just creating a side business while you're
already self-employed somewhere else.

125
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:08.710
If you're a freelancer you can make,

126
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:11.910
if you're just beginning your
hourly rate's gonna be much less,

127
00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:17.620
but if you're experienced, you have a few
years experience or you're really good.

128
00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:21.470
You could be making anywhere from 60,
70, 90, 100, 150 bucks an hour.

129
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:28.900
And you could be making 75,000 a year,
100,000 a year, 150k a year.

130
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:32.220
I mean, the sky's the limit
depending on how good you are and

131
00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:36.050
how good of a business person you are, but
if you're just looking for some side cash.

132
00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:43.140
If you build a WordPress website,
a custom WordPress website for a client,

133
00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:49.081
it's likely that that budget's
gonna be around 2,000, 3,000 bucks.

134
00:08:49.081 --> 00:08:52.510
Because you wouldn't wanna sell a
WordPress website for much less than that.

135
00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:55.070
It's not the average,
you wouldn't wanna do that.

136
00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:00.250
I mean if you have a big client, you could
be selling a custom WordPress website for

137
00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:04.800
them for five grand, six grand.

138
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:09.610
If you're a graphic designer, you charge
your two, three thousand dollars for

139
00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:12.750
your graphic design work, and then you say
okay, now we're moving to the web design

140
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.800
and web development phase,
that's gonna be another 5K.

141
00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.690
There's a 10K project for you right there.

142
00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:19.660
And I know I'm just kinda
throwing numbers around here.

143
00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:25.470
But there's so much possibility
with increasing your income

144
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:31.290
significantly just by knowing how
to develop WordPress websites.

145
00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:34.560
It's amazing and I hope that excites
you for the rest of the course.

146
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:39.670
I'm gonna see you in the next lecture
where I'm gonna tell you a little story

147
00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:44.610
about how my fear of building
custom WordPress websites

148
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:48.532
cost me roughly $24,000.

149
