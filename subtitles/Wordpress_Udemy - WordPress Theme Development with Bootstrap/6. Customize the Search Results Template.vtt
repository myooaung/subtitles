Hey everyone, welcome back to Boost
Your Income with Bootstrap to WordPress.

2
00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:04.190
Where did my hair go?

3
00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:05.460
DId I forget mention that?

4
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.430
Yep, I got a haircut and this lecture
is called Code the Search Template or

5
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:10.220
something like that.

6
00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:18.920
Let's do it!
[MUSIC]

7
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.111
Time to make this search results
template much, much nicer and

8
00:00:23.111 --> 00:00:24.940
fortunately it is so easy.

9
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.560
Open up that code editor,
make sure you open your search.php

10
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.280
template which is located right here and
then it will look like this.

11
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.990
The template for displaying search results
pages, it's very small which is great,

12
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.650
I like working with small pages and
all we've gotta do is just use our markup

13
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.050
that has already been pre styled,
and we're off to the races.

14
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.480
Things will look absolutely sexy.

15
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.830
So we're gonna take this head
section right here, header tag.

16
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.190
Cut that out, and we're just gonna paste
it at the very top here under get header.

17
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.080
Now we're gonna actually remove
this header tag all together.

18
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.140
We're gonna keep that level one
heading and we're gonna be using

19
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.490
the section tag with the feature image
at the very top of the parallax.

20
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.820
We used that actually in
our previous template.

21
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.460
But we're gonna grab it
from the blog at HTML.

22
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.510
We already have it here, gonna copy that.

23
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.180
Feature image section,
paste it right here.

24
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.000
Now that level one heading,
and here, we're just gonna

25
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.240
take this level one heading that we have
from the search template, and replace

26
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.830
the static one with it so we have
the actual correct level one heading.

27
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.000
All right, and then down here, we're
gonna remove these two tags, section and

28
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.880
main, and remove the closing tags as well.

29
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.069
And then we're just going to start
adding our own tags, very easy,

30
00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:51.572
div class=container, and
then div id=primary also the class=row.

31
00:01:51.572 --> 00:01:55.580
And then down below,
we're gonna have main tag.

32
00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.282
And that's gonna have the id of content,
and

33
00:02:00.282 --> 00:02:04.250
the class of col-sm-8, perfect.

34
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.285
I'm gonna close these tags after
the last end if statement,

35
00:02:10.285 --> 00:02:17.770
aftare main we have our primary,
and then can't forget our sidebar.

36
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.182
Grab the sidebar function, and
it's gonna go right after our main tag.

37
00:02:23.182 --> 00:02:31.390
It's gonna be the a side tag
with the class of col-sm-4.

38
00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.800
Place the get sidebar function
in between there, perfect.

39
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.290
I'm just gonna add a little comment here.

40
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.610
Just to be consistent
with the other templates.

41
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.530
That's great, and then I'm gonna
save this after I tab this in.

42
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.540
Clean up the space here, looking good.

43
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.330
Save that, and now let's go and
see if this works.

44
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.330
Okay, so, kind of.

45
00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.010
We have the layout right here.

46
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.040
Basically we just need to grab
the content for the search and

47
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.129
that looks like in the template we have
a template part called content-search,

48
00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:10.236
so open content-search.

49
00:03:10.236 --> 00:03:11.750
Well looky here,

50
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.490
it looks like we have our pretty generic
article excerpt that we've already done.

51
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:18.920
We've already done this.

52
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.364
So really all you need to
do is go to the content.php

53
00:03:25.364 --> 00:03:30.830
template and grab everything.

54
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.930
Grab all of this copy article to article,
opening tag closing tag.

55
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.280
Copy that,
go back to your content search, and

56
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.660
then replace that article with the one
you've already done and refresh.

57
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.870
Now these search results here are pulling
up for some reason the resources.

58
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.590
And the resources, they have their own
templates which have a grid based layout,

59
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.680
and so
it's kind of messing with our search here.

60
00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.900
Now when I think about it,
these are custom post types,

61
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.190
and we decided to leave their
resources in the search.

62
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.840
But I don't really want that because I
just want this search function to be for

63
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.050
the blog only, for
the blog posts and it's pulling in

64
00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.570
our custom post types, the Resources,
so it's very easy to turn that off.

65
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.020
Go back to your Dashboard.

66
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:25.220
Go to Custom Post Types and
select Manage Post Types.

67
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.610
Edit the resource,
custom post types, advanced options,

68
00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.110
go down here to Exclude from Search, True.

69
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:41.736
Now if I go ahead and update that, and
then I can go back to the site blog,

70
00:04:41.736 --> 00:04:47.378
let's search for code again,
cuz that's where it came up.

71
00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.620
Now it's pulling up a page.

72
00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.360
So you can see here,
it just has resources.

73
00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.490
So that's better than just
one of the resources.

74
00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.140
You can exclude pages from search results,
but this is an okay search result.

75
00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.530
It looks okay.

76
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.390
What about, I'm just gonna say lorem?

77
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.880
Here we go.
So now it's pulling up an actual post,

78
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.370
right here and
it has the layout with all the good stuff.

79
00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.630
And so that is the search results page or
template.

80
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.130
And that's it for
this module for the blog, and

81
00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.670
the entire blog section with all
the templates that go along with it.

82
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.790
And that was really one of the heaviest
parts that we are gonna be dealing with,

83
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.410
because next we just have our contact
page which is really straightforward and

84
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:29.010
really simple.

85
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.750
Like this full with template and

86
00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.120
a contact using a really cool plugin
that I'm gonna introduce to you.

87
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.395
Two lectures a couple of lectures
in the next section, real easy and

88
00:05:39.395 --> 00:05:42.503
then were on to cleaning up the rest and
getting this thing live.

89
00:05:42.503 --> 00:05:47.599
