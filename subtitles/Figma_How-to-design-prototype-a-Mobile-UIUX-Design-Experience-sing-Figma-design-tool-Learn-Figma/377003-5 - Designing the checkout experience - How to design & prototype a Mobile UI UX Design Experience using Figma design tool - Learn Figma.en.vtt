00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640
All right,

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.860
welcome to the next series of videos.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:05.340
So in this video,

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.180
we're gonna cover the check out workflow.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.860
So we've just designed up and prototype the log in and sign up work flows.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.980
We did the shopping workflow,

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.550
and now we're going to get through the check out workflow,

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:19.080
Um,

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.380
and to see what that looks like,

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.580
we're going to go through the prototype here.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.000
So we've already done this.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.460
We have created the sign up in the log in.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.300
You can put your email on your password in.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.210
You've logged in its loading the application.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.810
You have all the boba tea.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.700
This is what we did in the last video we created on the Boba tea,

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.800
um,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.100
flavors here that you can select from if you tap on the regular milk tea here,

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.820
you can see we we made the milk the regular sweet and the medium ice drop down selections,

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.600
the topping selection buttons.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.900
And we've also prototype the X which closes that.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.210
Open it back up.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.720
We made a mobile drop down selection,

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.920
but you see here if you select semisweet,

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.590
it changes the semi sweet.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.020
You can select the large tapioca you can do the ad and then we're going on this video.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.500
We're gonna build out and design up the check out workflow.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.370
So if I tap on the shopping icon,

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:29.610
I'm now experiencing the check out experience where it showing me the application shows me

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.510
my selection,

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:31.050
which was?

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.330
I had my milk tea.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.480
My quantity was one I could edit.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.070
Remove these.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.070
If I want to hear,

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.140
I can close this.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.850
Go back.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.540
And if I'm ready after I see my totals,

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.610
the delivery fees,

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.450
the taxes I could go to the next.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:51.450
You can see that that screen slides in from the left to the right and the back slides back

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.450
.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.250
Well,

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.750
we'll make that prototype transition as well.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.040
You can put in your address these air components that we already made,

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:06.380
so it should be pretty simple and quick to make these press Andone go to the next and again

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.380
,

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.400
If I want to go back,

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.730
I can go back all the way to the beginning.

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:10.700
I can close.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.270
It's a very common interaction pattern that we use in mobile devices.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.050
Get to slide up with the X.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.650
Now I can go into a series of back buttons,

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.680
grab my address.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.850
I can put in my payment information press done.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.490
I see the total I pay.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.150
It's confirming payment.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.410
And then I can see my Boba tea being delivered to me with a series of screens that have the

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.410
,

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.100
um,

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.440
the time duration transition effect.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.890
Now you can see the final screen.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.780
My Boba tea has arrived and I press OK,

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:47.550
got it.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.770
And I'm back at the screen here,

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.550
so we'll work through that in this video.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.210
Let's go back over to our ah figment file that we created here.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.750
You can go into the learning Paige that I have here.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:09.450
You want to start prototyping up what it looks like when somebody clicks or the user taps

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.310
on this.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.190
Check out Icahn here on the tab bar.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.000
So let's go grab from the beginning here.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.980
Let's go grab this loading screen here,

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.260
Command see and come over here.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.000
Command V.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.890
Paste it and let's move it in position.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:28.280
Here,

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.890
let's call this check out.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:31.590
So again,

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.190
just click on the art board,

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.220
click on the layer on the left and type in,

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.050
check out and let's go ahead and remove everything that we have there.

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.200
One of the things we're gonna need for this screen is we're gonna need the X.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.900
So let's grab that X and paste it.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.920
What's tapped to the prototype?

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.910
Make sure that it doesn't have any prototype pre existing prototype links already set to it

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.910
.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:59.600
And it does.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.450
So let's just go ahead and grab that.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.270
Just drag it off and let go.

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:10.260
Now that that X doesn't do anything on the prototype and on the photo final prototype here

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.260
,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:16.410
you can see what we're looking toe design up here is we want to have the check out title,

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.800
the regular milk tea with the pre defined selections,

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.310
the quantity with the ability to add more than one.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.500
Ah,

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.180
and it removed buttons.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.550
And then we want to put in these totals here that we have.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.090
So let's go ahead and design up.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.470
This section here will probably copy and paste thes um,

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:36.650
and make it easy.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.990
But let's start with the check out,

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.750
um,

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.430
tab at the top there.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:47.350
So let's grab this regular fought here lets us copy and paste it here.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.550
Let's make it white.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.850
Let's center it and we'll put it here.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:59.730
Call this check out all right,

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.450
and this was already out of 16 points.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.910
Color style are textiles.

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:05.420
That's good.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.480
Reuse that.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.550
Let's go ahead and center this a bit.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.350
That looks good there,

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.100
all right,

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.460
and let's go ahead and copy this.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.710
Now let's change the alignment from a centered paragraph.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.630
Align alignment to a left,

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.790
A line that looks good.

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:29.570
And let's call this the regular milk tea.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.870
We have 16 point,

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.790
and we also made a 14 point bold Let's go make this a 14 point point.

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:40.090
Bold.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.790
That looks good.

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.070
All right.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.320
And I'm gonna copy this.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.630
I'm gonna hold option click and drag and hold shift.

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.940
Membership keeps things from moving out.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:51.990
Alignment like that.

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.820
I hold shift.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.050
I can no longer do that.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:06:01.080
And let's go ahead and see when I stretch the height of this text box,

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.700
it was defaulting to a middle alignment for the text.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:11.240
Let's do top alignment that just moves it to the top of the text box that looks good and

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.500
the selections that we had for this regular milk to you as we had milk,

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.670
we had a semi sweet,

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:31.190
and we also had the to go back here and take a look medium ice.

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:45.180
And then we also had the large tapioca.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.580
All right,

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.360
let's make these a little bit bigger.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.090
Let's go grab our Let's make this our 19 point.

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:56.290
Yeah,

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:57.050
that looks good.

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:58.530
Um,

00:06:58.530 --> 00:06:59.090
what's do?

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:00.210
19 point light?

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:01.040
Yep.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.250
That looks good There.

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:05.960
And then let's make this the lighter gray color,

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.650
the cold grey that we made.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:08.250
All right,

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:09.300
that looks That looks good.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.080
All right,

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:11.430
this point.

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:14.430
I'm gonna use the command quick key command are,

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:17.350
or go to the shape tool here and go to rectangle.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.560
I'm gonna hold shift,

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:25.020
click and drag and make a rectangle box here in the center.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.250
Kind of like that.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:30.590
We can make this about 60 by 60 here.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:34.500
And let's make this also the cool grey.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.250
So select the cool grey that we made earlier.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:38.240
Um,

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.680
all you gotta do there is click on the four dot sports as Phil.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.840
Here's all our color styles.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:44.300
Cool,

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:44.930
gray.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:49.150
And let's pull back the opacity of this to about 30.

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:50.700
That looks good.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.730
Okay,

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:58.980
let's go ahead and make a text box about the same size of this rectangle.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:07:59.490
Here,

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:01.030
type one.

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:02.240
Let's make this,

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:02.840
um,

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:03.260
white.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.690
You can select our pre existing color styles make it white.

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:09.840
And here's a case where I do want it to be,

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:10.670
ah,

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:12.860
in the centre paragraph alignment,

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.960
but also in the middle of the text box.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:22.840
And let's go ahead and make this the 42 point I will move to a 22.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:23.320
Looks like,

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:23.530
Yeah,

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:25.150
let's go make this 42 point.

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:38.470
I'm also going to copy the regular milk tea and move it over to the right and just type in

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:39.050
Q two.

00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:39.390
Why?

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:40.260
For the quantity.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:44.750
And go ahead and make the text box the same with.

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:48.190
And there you go.

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:50.720
You can see the quantity there,

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:54.240
right?

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.530
Next thing up is you.

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:56.250
Congrats.

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:57.150
The,

00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:00.760
um the X that we made here click and copy it.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:05.580
You're just copying the component and let's go back and reverse this.

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.400
So go back and make it a regular,

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.420
Uh,

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:10.730
not 90 degrees.

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:13.620
And you can see now we have the plus symbol.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:19.240
I'm gonna copy it over here and make it the minus symbol.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.590
Since you haven't clicked anything yet,

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:23.700
the user This is disabled.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:29.670
So let's go make this the cool gray color and pull this back about 20% capacity,

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.880
maybe like 40% capacity.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.670
So that would enable if you were to add more than one.

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:39.180
You can go upto 23 then go back.

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:39.670
Teoh.

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:41.340
2 to 1.

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:44.210
Okay,

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:49.570
and then let's copy this regular milk tea here and let's make a button for the edit.

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:51.280
And since this is tap herbal,

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.400
this is something that you can engage with on the product.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.250
Let's make it the primary action color.

00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:59.290
You can see that here,

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:08.710
and I also want to make one for the remove and to make a little bit of spacing.

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:08.980
Here,

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:11.260
let's our little visual,

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:11.950
um,

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:13.490
hierarchy here.

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:16.560
Let's make a line in between these two.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.310
So I just grabbed the line tool.

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:20.670
You can also quick key that is L.

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:28.470
And let's also make this the cool gray and tone it back to about 20% capacity.

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:28.640
Oh,

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.920
maybe 30% percent opacity there,

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:36.470
right?

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:37.760
Pretty simple.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.550
Check out page that we're building out.

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:44.700
Let's go have some fun and prototype this here.

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:53.560
So if you select the one and the circle and the shopping car icon and do a command G,

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:57.680
which is group or you can right click and go to group selection.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:02.350
Let's go to the prototype tab here.

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:09.430
Now let's drag this little gooey product prototype arm to the check out screen here from

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:11.590
the shopping experience that we have,

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:13.870
we wanted to be on tap.

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:16.910
We want it to be movin here.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:19.600
Move in and we wanted to come from the bottom.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.650
Some moves up.

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:23.310
And now for the X.

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:27.950
Let's go ahead and drag that back to the shopping screen here,

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:32.460
and we want that to be moved out and moved down here.

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:39.130
So it's good of our prototype and let's see what that looks like here.

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:39.760
But a press,

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.670
the play button or the present button,

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:43.560
you may already have the tab open.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:47.400
Just go walk over to that tab and you can see here.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.990
When I pressed the shopping icon,

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:52.290
it slides up,

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:53.650
the screen slides up,

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:55.780
and when I press the X,

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:57.610
it slides down Very nice.

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:05.900
If you want to add more screens to make it to show what it looks like if you added more

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:06.660
numbers here,

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:07.740
press that it remove.

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:09.000
Feel free to do that.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.750
I'm gonna I I just I usually choose not to do that,

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:13.120
Um,

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.410
for these just this more about teaching you the tool.

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:18.150
But you can go do that on your own time if you wanted to.

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:19.690
Um,

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:20.240
this point,

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.830
let's just copy up.

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:22.650
Um,

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:26.450
this amount text from the final prototype,

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:27.390
you can just select it.

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:30.430
Copy it Now that you know how to use the text tool.

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:30.970
Um,

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:33.240
you convey Build this out if you wanted to,

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.140
but let's just go ahead and copy it.

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:36.750
Speed things up a little bit.

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:40.200
Just paste it.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.040
Remember to select the art board.

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:43.930
If you just select within the our board,

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:45.330
see how it paste?

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:45.930
Um,

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:47.290
not in place.

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:53.370
But if you select the art board from the top here and press command v it paste in place

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:54.510
from where you copied it.

00:12:54.510 --> 00:13:02.700
And then we made a line here for this drop down selection.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.120
Let's grab that line.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:23.560
And let's pace that here and give this a section in case you had more than one right At

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:24.350
this point,

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:31.050
what we can do is you want to have an ad or a cancel button that they can the use Ercan or

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:35.130
next and cancel button that the user can engage with at any point.

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:35.850
So if you want?

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:41.640
Just cancel all the things that you go through in the shopping cart experience.

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:47.350
You can have that and we'll have next buttons here that will help us go to the next page.

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:50.390
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna add the add button here.

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:52.450
I'm gonna make it less wide.

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:55.350
I'm gonna copy it over here.

00:13:55.350 --> 00:14:02.370
And I think they're actually the original with might be okay.

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:11.680
Let's probably go on the with here about 1 45 wide.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.660
Now I'm gonna copy it.

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:15.150
That looks about right.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:16.970
Okay.

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:21.180
And what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna I'm gonna detach this component,

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:26.530
so I'm gonna remove it as a component and bring it back to just a design element.

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:27.780
So what you do is you right?

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.550
Click on the button.

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:30.400
Well,

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.740
for select the button first,

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:32.640
and then right,

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.200
click on it and press detach instance.

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.630
And you can see it went from a purple Ah,

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:44.770
boundary box selection to a blue boundary box selection indicating that it's no longer a

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:45.870
pick a component.

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:47.160
Now,

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:51.370
I'm gonna change the text to this button here to next,

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:55.050
and I'm gonna change the text here to this one to be cancelled.

00:14:55.050 --> 00:15:02.650
And what I'm gonna do here is I'm going to grab this back room and I'm gonna add I'm gonna

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:03.670
remove the field.

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:05.930
So see this minus here on the right,

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:07.160
But remove the field.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.450
I want to add another feel.

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:09.790
I just press the plus again,

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:11.650
but I want to add a stroke,

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:13.390
and I want to make the stroke.

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:21.300
The primary color that we had so you can see here has the to I'm gonna move these a little

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:22.150
bit to the left,

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:23.190
center them up.

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:28.610
And now we have a primary button and a secondary button.

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:31.430
So let's go make this secondary button.

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:31.590
Ah,

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:34.080
component so we can reuse it.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:34.460
So again,

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:36.230
I've grabbed the cancel button.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:39.080
I go to the Component Library page here on the left,

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:45.200
and I paste it into that page.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:49.340
I'm gonna select everything.

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:51.120
Go to the diamond icon here,

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.110
the top create components.

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:54.700
And where that says,

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:55.880
primary button,

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:57.750
let's call it secondary.

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:02.920
It was changed.

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:06.050
The were cancelled to just text speech.

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:06.580
And Eric,

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:10.930
let's go back to our learning Paige here,

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:15.780
and let's go place that component that cancel button component into these pages.

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:18.230
So I pressed the assets tab at the top,

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:19.850
left here by the layers.

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:23.490
I can see the secondary button.

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:27.950
Here I click and drag it into the prototype.

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:33.880
Paste it right on top of that cancel button.

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.810
Delete the cancel button.

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:42.040
I selected the art board here at the top press place.

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:46.850
I hope they didn't pay someplace.

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:47.460
One second.

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:50.590
So there we have the cancel button.

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:51.810
I'm gonna copy it.

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:53.400
My pasted in the art board.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:53.670
Usually,

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:57.850
if you don't originally pace this button in the art board itself,

00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:01.260
it won't pay someplace like it like it happened before.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.890
So let me go ahead and move this down.

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:06.620
Good.

00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:06.760
Now,

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:07.170
that's right.

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:08.630
On top of the cancel button,

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:09.400
I'm gonna command.

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:09.880
See?

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.890
And now I'm gonna select that cancel button,

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:15.180
which is not the component and deleted.

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:18.250
And now I'm going to select the art board,

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:19.400
paste in place,

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:26.130
and then change that the text of this component now making it an instance of that component

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:27.000
and calling.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:27.570
Cancel.

00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:33.910
All right,

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:43.070
so let's go ahead and make the cancel button go back to the original shopping screen here

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:47.760
that doesn't have the notification for the shopping cart,

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:52.030
and we were still want the same interaction here.

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:55.430
Toe slide this page down so you can see when I click it,

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:56.750
it slides down.

00:17:56.750 --> 00:18:04.120
We want the next button to go to the next series of pages here.

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:08.760
So if you go back to the layers tab here and we look at the final prototype,

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:13.340
the next series of pages here is to set up my address.

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:15.850
So the the delivery of the Boba,

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:16.900
um,

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:20.450
will end up at my address that I input here.

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:23.150
So we're gonna have the back arrow here,

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:24.460
So let's go back to our learning.

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:25.080
Paige,

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:28.610
let's grab this art board here.

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:34.050
What's hold option Click and drag and hold shift and let's copy this page.

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:37.440
At this point,

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.640
we're gonna grab the arrow icon.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:46.750
So if you go to the design goods that I created over here and grab this arrow icon Press

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:47.210
Command,

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:47.660
see,

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:52.470
and we'll keep the X here for now,

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:57.910
just for positioning of the arrow click on the check out screen that we're on right here,

00:18:57.910 --> 00:18:59.320
the new one that we copied.

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:02.570
Let's go ahead and name this one address.

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:10.700
So I clicked on the art board double clicked on the address layer on the left and I can

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:11.650
change the name.

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:14.340
Gonna paste this in place,

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:17.410
Paste this into the art board,

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:21.010
place it right around position of the X,

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:22.200
copy it,

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:27.720
delete the X press the address.

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:31.950
I art board the top here and paste that arrow.

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:42.620
Now it's called this address here and let's go ahead and remove all of this.

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:43.660
These elements here.

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:46.210
So let's prototype this.

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:50.950
So the next screen here is going to go to the address screen.

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:52.600
But in this case,

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.790
we're still gonna have it be on tap here.

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:58.600
We're gonna move in instead of move out.

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:02.080
Yours might be on instant or smart animate.

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.300
Let's create move in.

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:08.760
And we want this one to slide in from the left to the right,

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:13.760
and we want the back arrow here to move out.

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.960
But instead of coming in from the left,

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:20.610
we wanted to come in from the right so it moves to the right.

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:28.620
So moving in allows this address screen to move in from the left and when we,

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:31.110
when we say move out,

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:36.350
allows this screen that we've selected to move out of the way and we want to go right.

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:38.130
So sometimes you.

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:40.910
If it gets unclear of how these work just met,

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:47.410
make thes selections and then go into your prototype and go play with it in the prototype.

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:53.010
And it helps you to find Hallows Air working for you so you can see the next this is going

00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:54.800
to slide in this address page.

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.210
If I want to go back,

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:58.050
I can go back.

00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:05.180
And it's a pretty common interaction to see this slide up.

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:07.070
See the X go next.

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:11.260
And now we enter a Siris of back buttons and back screens.

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:14.320
Okay,

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:15.000
so at this point,

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.010
we need to put the address information in.

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:21.620
So I'm gonna go back to some of the components that we've already had.

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:22.830
So if you remember,

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:26.970
we we built out on the asset screen here.

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:31.200
We built out some form default components.

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.550
So let's grab that component,

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:40.160
click and drag it onto the art board.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:43.070
There was one of the defaults.

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:47.480
Let's call this one address.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:53.430
And since this application knows my name already,

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:58.800
I've already logged into it and I've signed up previously and give it gave it my name.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:07.120
Let's go grab the focus form filled here and you could see if you if you click on a,

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:12.480
um on a component and we'll take you to that component if you click and drag.

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:14.450
That's how you use it on the art board here.

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:16.050
So already have,

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:21.010
ah input form that I've created that has.

00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:24.400
We've already have the one that is a focus ST input.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:35.320
So let's go ahead and say name here and we will pre populate this with my name and let's go

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.950
ahead and change the text to all lower case.

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:56.570
Right now we have the address field.

00:22:56.570 --> 00:23:02.870
Since this is an application that only works in San Francisco,

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:10.760
we're gonna type in San Francisco and we're gonna make this 30% opacity.

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.080
So that,

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:12.950
um,

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:13.690
actually,

00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:18.890
before we do the San Francisco we need to put the apartment or the sweet here.

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:20.610
Okay.

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:21.490
And now,

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:25.160
since this isn't a application that's Onley used in San Francisco,

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:28.050
let's type in San Francisco as a city,

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:33.140
and let's go ahead and default that,

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:33.620
um,

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:37.150
are make the opacity 30% opacity.

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:38.570
So is disabled.

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:42.080
The dress has to be within San Francisco.

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:46.930
All right,

00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:52.020
and then let's go ahead and see how figment does that gives you all the spacing attributes

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:52.020
.

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:59.970
So it's equally distributing these form fields for us at 20 pixels each and we had the

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:01.810
state California.

00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:10.210
And the next thing we had here was to make sure this is equally distributed here.

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:12.450
We had the phone number here.

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:17.700
All right.

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:18.410
Pretty simple,

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:20.600
since we've already had these components built out.

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:21.700
Um,

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:22.570
I'm gonna double check,

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:23.740
but the final page?

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:23.960
Yep.

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:25.000
Looks about right.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.980
We already have this.

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:28.880
Prototype it up,

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.180
so you can see.

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:31.430
Here's what that looks like.

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:32.230
I go next.

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:33.590
Now we have the address.

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:39.760
I'm gonna copy this address,

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:42.750
holding option,

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:44.950
clicking on the art board and shift.

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:46.650
And I'm gonna press.

00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:52.450
I'm gonna double click on the layer of this art board and just call it a dress one.

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:56.460
All right,

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:57.340
So at this point,

00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:00.830
I'm gonna copy the keyboard that we have from the log in.

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:01.900
Just command.

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:02.350
See,

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:08.760
I'm gonna select the address command V and bought a bang,

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:09.200
but a boom.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.590
We have the keyboard screen.

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:11.930
Now,

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:16.780
let's go ahead and just pre populate all three of these here.

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:17.980
So if you can see,

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:24.750
I have the component for the active input Stay already for these form fields.

00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:32.780
Some just gonna copy this holding option shift and dragging it and just get this over to

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:41.330
the top of all of the phone number and the apartment and the address.

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:42.840
So I'm gonna command See?

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:45.400
Now copy these,

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.560
and I'm gonna delete the apartment,

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:48.590
the phone number,

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:52.980
and I'm gonna go select the art board again.

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:56.850
Command V and place those here.

00:25:56.850 --> 00:26:01.070
So at this one thes that paste in place.

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:02.750
Now I have the address,

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:04.180
my type in the address,

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:05.150
and we're just gonna put,

00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:05.380
like,

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:07.450
111 Aw,

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:08.760
Noboa Street.

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:14.310
And we'll do.

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:23.450
Here was apartment I slash sweet and let's just do 123 for the apartment.

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:25.860
And then we had the phone number here.

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:42.550
Go ahead and grab Aaron Lawrence here and let's do 1112225555 as a phone number.

00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:49.580
Okay,

00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:50.380
at this point,

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:53.420
this go button we need to make this say done.

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:55.820
So if you select the go,

00:26:55.820 --> 00:27:03.620
let's go ahead and change the text back over to Roboto so we can change it and press Ah,

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:06.160
double click into the text box and call it done.

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.870
And What that will do is it won't allow you to move forward.

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:14.000
It will just slide the keyboard down and you can go to ah,

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.080
the next button here and move on to the next screen.

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.500
So this point,

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:19.890
I'm gonna hold option.

00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:26.620
I'm gonna click and drag this mobile prototype or mobile art board and make a duplication

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:27.130
of it.

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:31.860
I'm gonna You can see you see how far how smart figure was.

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:34.280
It noticed that I copied this our board.

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:35.570
And when I let go,

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:42.100
it changed the address from one here to two and notice that I was always numbering art

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:42.600
boards.

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:47.550
So it just automatically started to number incrementally my art board.

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:49.470
Very smart tool.

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:52.460
I'm gonna delete the keyboard,

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:54.750
and now it's prototype this up.

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:56.990
So I'm gonna go back to my prototype tab here.

00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:57.400
The top,

00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:57.880
right,

00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:03.690
I'm gonna click on it and let's go ahead and click on the address,

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:06.020
the apartment and the phone number.

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:06.550
Here,

00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:14.580
let's do a command G or a right click and just group these as one selection and go ahead

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:18.730
and drag the prototype gooey arm to the next address.

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:23.330
One screen and we want on top but we just want instant.

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:24.100
No,

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:24.760
Um,

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:30.310
we don't want any spent fancy stuff happening here at this point.

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:36.560
Let's go ahead and selected the done button here and click and grabbed the gooey arm.

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.230
Click it to the art board,

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:41.390
addressed to and on tap and again.

00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:41.940
Instant.

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:42.780
Nothing fancy.

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:45.270
Okay,

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:47.820
so now what happens if you tap into early in the address?

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:50.060
The apartment or the phone number is?

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:51.240
You get the keyboard.

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:55.370
We're just gonna auto populate it for now in the art.

00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:57.900
But if you want to make individual screens for each one,

00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:59.550
you now know how to do that.

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:02.550
And then if you press don,

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:04.170
it takes a keyboard down.

00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:07.170
Who can move to the next screen here,

00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:11.160
which is in putting your credit card details.

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:13.150
All right,

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:13.370
so good.

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:16.850
I'm gonna copy this address one here holding option.

00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:19.050
I select the art board,

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:21.260
click on it,

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:24.660
hold option to get the double arrow,

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:27.440
click and drag shift or again.

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:28.560
I could just copy it,

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:31.710
and I can command V and it will paste it for me.

00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:33.860
So command seeing command be,

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:37.760
Let's call this one payment and call it one.

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:47.490
And let's relabel the top here to payment and let's go into our prototype tab here,

00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:48.200
right here.

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:55.260
Let's rab the arrow because the arrow now will go to address where before this era was

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:56.760
going to the check out.

00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:00.960
Now the back button and the arrow will go to the payment screen.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.860
So again,

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:04.620
nothing fancy.

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:06.020
We just want on tap.

00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:06.660
Oh,

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:07.150
and we do.

00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:08.710
We want it to move out?

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:08.920
Yep,

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:09.480
correct.

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:11.490
And we want to move to the right.

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:19.620
So let's go ahead and delete some of these here and let's go see what that looks like on

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:23.470
the prototype said I press next hope that didn't work.

00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:26.080
So let's see what happens here up.

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:26.790
We didn't,

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:27.410
uh,

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:29.530
connect the next button to this screen.

00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:31.190
So let's grab next.

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:35.760
And let's grab the prototype gooey arm connected to Payment one.

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:39.360
And we wanted to move in here.

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:40.700
So we want on tap,

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:49.550
move in and we want to come in from the left and then we want the arrow here on move out

00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:52.350
and we want to come out from the right.

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:54.930
So to go back through that,

00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:57.230
here's our check out we got next.

00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:59.120
Here's Theodore s information.

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.950
The phone number Press done.

00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:03.160
I press the next button,

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:05.580
and this page is gonna come in from the left,

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:08.780
is gonna move in from the right.

00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:10.950
You can see that.

00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:21.660
And then this screen here is gonna move out to the right so you can see how that move left

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:21.660
.

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:28.140
Our next button here says this page is gonna move in from the left and the arrow here,

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:34.080
connecting to the address to screen is gonna move out of the way to the right.

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:35.450
And that's what that looks like.

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:36.660
Move in,

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:37.700
move out.

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:41.180
Okay,

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:43.480
let's go look at the payment details.

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:45.000
What we had here was,

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:45.510
um,

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:49.420
we had the address details at the top.

00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:54.760
So let's go ahead and grab the regular milk tea and the sweet semi,

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:55.880
uh,

00:31:55.880 --> 00:32:01.740
the semi sweet and medium ice text here,

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:06.450
let's just paste it directly in the same spot on the payment screen.

00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:18.050
And let's just change this to delivery or deliver to.

00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:23.020
And let's just input the information that we did on the last screen here.

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:24.800
So we have my name.

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:26.210
You have Aaron Lawrence.

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:44.350
We have 111 Boba Street and we have number 111 or 123 for the apartment.

00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:47.220
And we have the phone number,

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:55.740
which was 1112225555 All right,

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:56.150
cool.

00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:57.120
So at this point,

00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:00.270
let's drag up another one of these,

00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:01.060
um,

00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:03.260
form components that we made.

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:07.350
So if we go to the to the asset screens on the left here,

00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:11.760
perhaps go to the asset screens on the left.

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:14.660
Let's grab the form default.

00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:17.990
Pop that on to the art board here.

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:23.790
And this is gonna be name on card.

00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:30.160
I am in a copy.

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:33.760
This one is wells to the 20 spacing,

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:36.170
and this is going to be a car number,

00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:42.750
and then drag.

00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:43.960
Um,

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:44.460
click,

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:44.810
Hold,

00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:45.850
option and shift.

00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:48.950
Copy this card number one here.

00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:53.760
And let's call this one the expiration date.

00:33:53.760 --> 00:34:07.850
And what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna select the line element.

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:13.060
Actually,

00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:18.870
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna grab a rectangle here and just make a black one.

00:34:18.870 --> 00:34:29.690
I can also just click the I drop her,

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:32.680
click the background so it's the same color as the background.

00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:34.580
And just keep that toe.

00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:38.240
Hide this form document here.

00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:42.740
What happens when you create a symbol you have an instance is I can create the start.

00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:44.910
I can change the styles of it Like I can change.

00:34:44.910 --> 00:34:46.860
The color can change.

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:50.750
The graze here can change the styles of that component.

00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:56.800
But I can't actually manipulate it like I can't go into this line here and make different

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.780
widths off the lines.

00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:05.130
I could see it still didn't let me do that.

00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:08.350
So it keeps it pretty true to the component.

00:35:08.350 --> 00:35:10.660
So I'm doing here is I'm just kind of faking it.

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:12.420
You can see I have that long line.

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:18.320
I don't want that line there because I want to put the cvv on top of that.

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:22.260
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna grab this expiration date.

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:26.030
I'm gonna pay someone like,

00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:26.810
right click,

00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:32.670
move this to the front and I'm gonna call this one the cvv.

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:35.960
Just a small field here for three numbers,

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:42.600
and I'm gonna do the same thing.

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:48.250
I'm gonna create a black box here and just layer it over the top.

00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:56.000
I can press I to get the quick key to get the eyedropper and select the background.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.660
And I have the black so you can see I still have the components I'm using,

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:03.980
but I've created space for them.

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:05.540
And that way,

00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:07.270
if I ever want to change this component,

00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:07.880
Master,

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:13.540
I didn't detach these two components and have to come back in and re change these.

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:17.080
Okay,

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:17.420
Cool.

00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:18.640
So at this point,

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:21.020
let's go ahead and put the total that we had.

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:25.040
So we created a total element here,

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:28.890
and we've shown the total here is well,

00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:36.280
which is 9 49 And its best practices before you purchase anything is to see the total in

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:43.200
which your purchasing here to put that centered.

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:44.820
And we had nine,

00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:46.990
I think 49 as the total.

00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:47.450
Here,

00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:51.340
let's go and change this button to pay.

00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:55.200
And now we're in pretty good shape.

00:36:55.200 --> 00:37:03.950
So now that I press the back button and I put all the address information in I press next

00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:06.090
Nam on the payment screen here,

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:08.570
I'm almost done with the payment.

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:10.330
So let's go at Ah,

00:37:10.330 --> 00:37:14.300
let's go populate thes really quick using the,

00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:20.240
um the forms that we created that are at the active state.

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:24.560
And so what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna copy this payment.

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:25.620
Aren't bored.

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:29.620
I'm clicking on the art board holding option and shift,

00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:31.490
dragging it to the right,

00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:33.040
and I've made a copy of it.

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:35.820
I'm gonna go to my assets here.

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:38.360
I'm gonna grab my components that I've created.

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:41.000
Remember this form Focus.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:41.720
Um,

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:43.650
active state that we have.

00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:49.650
I was going to replace all of these here with this component,

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:57.060
so I'm just gonna lay a room right on top of each other for right now.

00:37:57.060 --> 00:38:02.530
I'm gonna grab all four of,

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:02.920
um,

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:03.370
command,

00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:06.530
See my delete these ones here,

00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:14.430
and I'm gonna replace the active ones here.

00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:16.940
Right.

00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:18.190
So you could see here.

00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:22.430
I need to put this form underneath the rectangle,

00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:24.530
so it gives it some space.

00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:31.100
And I also need to grab the rectangle that I created here.

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:37.480
You can see how I do that is I click and drag from the right that selects all the elements

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:39.480
here so I can select more than one element.

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:40.860
Select all these elements.

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:41.510
Really?

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:46.570
I'm just trying to get to these two trying to get to this input form filled and this

00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:47.510
rectangle here.

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:48.950
So now I have those too.

00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:51.400
Now I'm gonna hold shift.

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:56.050
I'm going to click on the title and put component here for the cvv.

00:38:56.050 --> 00:38:59.030
And now I've d selected that.

00:38:59.030 --> 00:39:00.900
And I just have the rectangle here.

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:02.760
So now that I have that selected,

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:08.950
I'm gonna click the rectangle on the layer panel on the left and I'm gonna move that above

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:11.670
this component.

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:15.450
All right,

00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:17.710
so let's go ahead and change these up.

00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:19.890
So we had name on card,

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:23.640
and I'll just use my name for now.

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:27.850
I'm not gonna put my card details in,

00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:28.160
but,

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:28.880
um,

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:36.800
that changed the text here to original case and then we had,

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:40.440
um the card details are the numbers.

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:50.960
So card number and then go ahead and hold option and press the letter.

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:52.580
Eight hit four,

00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:55.100
make four bullets,

00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:56.780
make another four bullets,

00:39:56.780 --> 00:40:04.200
and then just go 1111 It always exposes the one on the left from the last four of those

00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:06.330
digits here.

00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:20.960
I'm going to select the expiration dates and I'm gonna put I would say 01 2020.

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:30.380
And I'm gonna do the cvv here cvv and was 2123 Cool.

00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:31.590
Right?

00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:32.100
At this point,

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:33.460
we need the keyboard also.

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:37.680
So it's just grab the keyboard here that we created for the address art board,

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:40.940
Paste it onto the payment.

00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:42.630
Aren't bird that we have here?

00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:50.870
All right.

00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:52.440
And we're in good shape now,

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:57.110
so let's go ahead and prototype this.

00:40:57.110 --> 00:41:01.130
Just select all of these components that we made here,

00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:05.330
go to the prototype tab.

00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:07.530
You want a group these go ahead and right click.

00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:10.270
Got a group selection or command G.

00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:14.220
And go ahead and arrow this to this.

00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:18.540
Grab the little Aero gooey to this art board here.

00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:21.870
CNC it's connected that art board.

00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:25.200
We don't want anything fancy just on top.

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:25.730
Um,

00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:27.150
when you do move in,

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:28.350
it's just instant.

00:41:28.350 --> 00:41:32.860
And that opens up the keyboard will just pre populate all these form fields.

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:37.690
And then I'm gonna copy this one more time here,

00:41:37.690 --> 00:41:41.330
and I'm going to select the done button.

00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:46.880
I'm gonna drag the little prototype gooey arm to the payment three screen.

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:51.390
And on this interaction here,

00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:57.230
we just want on tap Instant and we're gonna delete the keyboard.

00:41:57.230 --> 00:42:03.920
And then here we have the pay.

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:05.820
But in going somewhere,

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:08.120
we don't want that working right now.

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:14.350
And we also have it here.

00:42:14.350 --> 00:42:17.920
You have choices on your UX here for this.

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:19.530
You could make this,

00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:20.210
um,

00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:25.220
30% opacity until you fill out all the information.

00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:26.400
Once you fill it all out,

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.040
it goes full capacity.

00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:31.950
You can keep it 100% than make air states for these,

00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:36.050
where you get a little like the line turns red and it says,

00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:36.720
um,

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:51.130
you look like something like this and the lines go red indicating that they're still

00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:52.510
information to be filled out.

00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:53.610
Um,

00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:56.680
little things that think about in your UX.

00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:59.760
If you're curious about any ah ux classes,

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:02.920
I have aux class that you can check out two under my name.

00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:03.940
Um,

00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:05.250
but for this case,

00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:06.340
I'm just want to teach you Ah,

00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:10.870
a mobile application experience and how to use stigma to build that out.

00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:13.190
All right,

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:14.000
so let's move on.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:14.760
Um,

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:16.690
we have that prototype.

00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:17.860
Let's go check that out.

00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:21.490
So I click on the names here pre populate,

00:43:21.490 --> 00:43:23.290
have the keyboard press done,

00:43:23.290 --> 00:43:24.930
and now I'm ready to pay.

00:43:24.930 --> 00:43:30.490
So the next thing we want to do here is you want to grab that loading screen that we had

00:43:30.490 --> 00:43:31.030
here?

00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:35.190
Let's go ahead and grab the one that we made here in the beginning.

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:36.260
After you logged in,

00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:39.670
I'm gonna copy it,

00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:42.530
and I'm gonna just pan over to this section.

00:43:42.530 --> 00:43:49.030
Press command V and I've placed art board into my layouts.

00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:50.800
I'm gonna keep the,

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:51.410
um,

00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:53.740
the loader GIF animator gift here.

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:56.260
Just delete the logo,

00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:58.160
and I'm gonna copy up.

00:43:58.160 --> 00:43:59.030
Um,

00:43:59.030 --> 00:43:59.770
actually,

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:01.440
just grab this delivery text,

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:06.940
grab this loading screen and see how it's left the line.

00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:08.330
I want it centered on line.

00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:17.190
Now I just want to center it right underneath that loading gift.

00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:17.600
Now,

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:25.230
I also want to keep the text boundary box the same with of the art board.

00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:31.270
And when I have that and the centered paragraph with that keeps this text directly in the

00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:36.230
center and let's go ahead and change this to submitting payment,

00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:47.710
just like so.

00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:54.200
Okay,

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:55.130
so at this point,

00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:57.540
we can just select the pay button,

00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:03.000
click the prototype we want on top.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.140
Nothing fancy here.

00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:05.090
Just instant.

00:45:05.090 --> 00:45:09.800
Just go straight to submitting payment and let's go see what that looks like.

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:16.410
So you click on the pay and now you're in the screen where it's submitting payment.

00:45:16.410 --> 00:45:19.100
Okay,

00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:22.780
so the finalize our check out workflow experience,

00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:30.050
we want to show the Boba tea in real time being delivered to your address with a series of

00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:34.600
screens and eventually getting delivered here at the end.

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:37.000
Okay,

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:37.340
cool.

00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:45.520
So let's go back to our learning Paige tab here and let's copy up this loading screen.

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:55.350
And let's change the name of this loading screen to delivery and will do delivery one.

00:45:55.350 --> 00:45:58.610
Let's just click outside the art board.

00:45:58.610 --> 00:46:04.340
Just click and drag to select the loading gift and the payment and just delete it.

00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:08.280
And remember,

00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:10.820
we had this map here of San Francisco.

00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:12.440
Let's go grab this map.

00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:13.710
So if you just remember,

00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:15.610
you just click on it already cropped it.

00:46:15.610 --> 00:46:17.230
It's already in the right position.

00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:17.930
Just command,

00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:18.440
See,

00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:22.610
and then go over to this delivery one art board,

00:46:22.610 --> 00:46:27.350
selecting the art board and command v Ill pace right in place.

00:46:27.350 --> 00:46:29.640
All right.

00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:30.710
And the next thing is,

00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:34.490
let's go to our design goods art board over here on the left,

00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:42.590
and let's grab this little Boba icon with the white circle behind it.

00:46:42.590 --> 00:46:48.390
Command see,

00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:52.990
let's copy it.

00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:59.950
Let's paste that somewhere on our application.

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:10.080
Let's say maybe here and now let's go grab the map pin icon here and again,

00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:11.520
like I'd explain in the last video.

00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:13.290
If you want lots of icons,

00:47:13.290 --> 00:47:19.130
just go to the noun project dot com type in map icon.

00:47:19.130 --> 00:47:23.540
You could get a whole bunch of these little map pins that you want or even just type in map

00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:27.490
in and to get a whole bunch of thes here you wanted,

00:47:27.490 --> 00:47:32.060
right?

00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:33.470
So I have one here in the design,

00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:34.470
goods are bored.

00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:36.070
Just go grab that command,

00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:36.530
see,

00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:45.820
and I'm holding shift again as I grant click and drag come over to the final art board here

00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:46.700
that we have.

00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:50.350
Let's place the map icon.

00:47:50.350 --> 00:47:52.960
What's do somewhere will say,

00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:54.640
like somewhere here,

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:55.710
that's fine.

00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:59.050
Okay,

00:47:59.050 --> 00:48:02.010
And then the next time I want to teach you here is the pin tool.

00:48:02.010 --> 00:48:04.010
So that's this little pin section here.

00:48:04.010 --> 00:48:09.330
This is a drawling tool and allows you to create any custom shape that you would like.

00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:13.380
You can see I can just go around and it's sort of like connect the dots.

00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:15.980
I could make any shape connect the dot.

00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:17.170
I can add a fill.

00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:23.490
I'm making Press V to get out of it and select the shape,

00:48:23.490 --> 00:48:29.480
go back to the selection tool and delete it and So what we're gonna do is we're gonna

00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:38.420
create a custom line that follows the street to from the Boba to my map icon here.

00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:40.240
So let's go grab the pen tool.

00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:48.980
Press P click around the boba icon here,

00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:52.440
and then you can see it follows your mouse.

00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:58.200
Go ahead and click again where you see the street and then follow that treat.

00:48:58.200 --> 00:48:59.310
Click down.

00:48:59.310 --> 00:49:08.430
It goes a little bit to the right now click again and then connected to the map icon.

00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:15.080
Let's change this color to the bright purple or the bright pink action pink.

00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:19.420
And let's change the stroke to to cool.

00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:20.980
And if you want to manipulate this,

00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:21.820
you can come in.

00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:24.370
You can grab these point ah,

00:49:24.370 --> 00:49:25.270
anchor points,

00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:26.610
and you can move them around.

00:49:26.610 --> 00:49:29.530
If you select one impressed the lead on your keyboard.

00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:30.410
You can delete him.

00:49:30.410 --> 00:49:33.510
That's how you manipulate,

00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:34.080
um,

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:34.720
that shape.

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:38.380
So next thing we need to add is,

00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:38.940
um,

00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:40.290
a title at the top.

00:49:40.290 --> 00:49:41.580
That just says delivery.

00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:45.600
So it's grab our title from the payment page.

00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:49.340
Click on this art board press delivery are,

00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:49.900
ah,

00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:52.000
paste the payment text.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.420
Let's just call it delivery.

00:49:54.420 --> 00:50:09.620
Do dot dot dot Actually delivering with the i N G.

00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:11.000
Here you go.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:19.670
And now let's create a space here for us to put the text of the time intervals on how long

00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:21.110
this is going to take.

00:50:21.110 --> 00:50:24.160
So just grab a rectangle.

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:29.270
Here you can press are as a shortcut or go to the shape tool,

00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:31.810
and that should be fine there.

00:50:31.810 --> 00:50:32.920
What do we got here?

00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:36.920
About 160 heights and the width of the iPhone?

00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:39.070
Let's go ahead and make this black.

00:50:39.070 --> 00:50:41.790
We can select from our black color styles here.

00:50:41.790 --> 00:50:43.110
Make that black.

00:50:43.110 --> 00:50:47.440
And let's put the arriving time.

00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:51.020
I think we had some big text here.

00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:51.200
Yeah,

00:50:51.200 --> 00:51:00.300
we're using this regular and milk tea setting that was a 42 point and a tool 22 point text

00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:00.300
.

00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:03.540
So let's make the what's grabbed the text tool.

00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:04.280
Do T.

00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:07.180
You can also just type t on your keyboard is a short cut.

00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:11.800
And let's call one,

00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:12.400
um,

00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:14.280
text area arrival.

00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:19.070
Arrival time.

00:51:19.070 --> 00:51:25.560
How much change this toe white so you can see it what center it by doing the paragraph

00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:26.380
center here.

00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:30.170
And let's make this,

00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:30.690
um,

00:51:30.690 --> 00:51:32.770
a 14 point bold,

00:51:32.770 --> 00:51:37.980
and that's also changed the color from a white to the cool gray.

00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:39.770
Kind of like that.

00:51:39.770 --> 00:51:47.400
All right.

00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:49.980
Next thing we're gonna do is let's add,

00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:51.580
um,

00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:53.070
15 minutes.

00:51:53.070 --> 00:51:59.570
Let's go ahead and select this color here.

00:51:59.570 --> 00:52:00.540
Let's make it,

00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:01.120
um,

00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:01.970
let's make it white.

00:52:01.970 --> 00:52:02.460
Not cool.

00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:02.850
