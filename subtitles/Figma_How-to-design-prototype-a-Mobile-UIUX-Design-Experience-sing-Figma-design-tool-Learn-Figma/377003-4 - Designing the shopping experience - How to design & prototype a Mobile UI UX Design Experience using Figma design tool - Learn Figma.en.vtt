X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
All right,

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.190
welcome back.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:12.360
So in the last videos we worked on the log in and the sign up work flows in this video,

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.260
we're gonna cover the shopping workflow.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.380
So let me show you what we're going to do in this next video.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.650
So the last one we worked on the sign up the log in,

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.820
and at this point,

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.110
we left off right here,

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:34.160
which is the loading screen and this next series of videos or this video that we're on

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.860
right now,

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.650
we're gonna build out this workflow of having,

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:39.120
um,

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.210
ability to select a Boba tea drink and added to your cart.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.950
So let me show you that right now,

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.300
we'll also build out this tab bar at the bottom that stays fixed.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:59.130
Meaning it doesn't move as I swiped down and you can see if I click and drag up it.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:05.940
Sigma automatically transitions this as if I was swiping on a mobile device.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.630
Okay.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.990
And at that point,

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.820
the next train out to rebuild this one out is the selection screen.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.640
So you could see we have a transition state where this slides up.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.100
If I tap on the X,

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.240
it slides down as a transition.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.750
So we learned that is well,

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:30.260
and we'll also learn how to create a mobile drop down.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.280
So if I tap on this regular sweet here,

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.050
you can see I have a slide up overlay,

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.830
and if I tap at the top,

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:38.900
it slides down.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.480
And if I tap a selection semi sweet,

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:48.360
you can see it updates the selection where said Regular sweet to semisweet.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:55.450
And then the next thing we'll do is we'll create the active state for the topping

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.360
selections.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.180
So if I click on the large or tap on the large topping tapioca,

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.250
you can see there and I press at,

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.150
and that will add to the cart there.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.050
All right,

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.310
cool.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.970
So let's go ahead and get going.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.220
So let's go back over to,

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.850
um,

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.150
are learning page here that we were on.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.450
You could see this one here,

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.040
and remember where we left off?

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.570
We stitched the log in,

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:25.250
um,

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.350
and the go button here to this load screen.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.550
I'm gonna copy the load screen here.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.900
And so what I did again was,

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.690
um I click told Option clicked and dragged once I got the double arrows.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.740
Is my mouse that copied that are bored and I held shift,

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.590
so it keeps alignment.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.160
So when I don't have shift goes out of alignment.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.100
When I hold shift,

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.850
it keeps it online to the next art board.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.800
I'm gonna,

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.290
um,

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.670
click and drag outside of the art board.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.250
You can see how I'm doing that here.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.770
And that's just gonna select things within the art board.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.560
And I'm gonna delete the boba in the loading.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:16.670
I'm also going to select the status bar here.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.800
I'm gonna command see or copy here,

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.270
and then I'm gonna delete it.

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:28.200
And I'm going to grab this art board zoomed out a little bit here,

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.150
actually,

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.930
Before I zoom out,

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.660
I'm going to create a guide to show me the bottom of my screen.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.550
So if you're not seeing your rulers here,

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.480
you can go to view or your pixels and you could see,

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.290
um,

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.150
where it says,

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.300
show rulers,

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.970
this will give,

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:46.610
you know,

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:47.740
rulers right now.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.120
And if I go view showed rulers again.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.550
I'll see the rulers.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.020
You want the rulers out because you want to be able to drag guides.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.520
So if I'm on if I'm in art board,

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.660
I drag a guide it stays in that art board.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.210
You can see now it's Onley in the art board.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:09.200
If I'm not in the art board and I'm over in just the design area,

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.290
I condone drag a guide and it stays outside of the art board.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.520
So it stays anywhere,

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.570
so I can always see it.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:17.500
I can click it,

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.880
drag it If I want to remove it,

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.470
I can just slide it back up into the ruler,

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.370
and it deletes it.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.750
So this point,

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.040
I want to grab the guide,

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.650
and then I want to select my art board here,

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.770
and I want to make it really long.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.390
Don't worry too much about,

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:33.060
um,

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.210
how long it is.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.110
Just make it pretty long here.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.330
Like I have mine at 2000.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.550
Let's just make it even longer like 2400 pixels.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.600
Okay,

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.450
so that looks good.

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.420
And then I'm gonna paste,

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.110
um,

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.550
the status bar back in.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.140
No,

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.000
I'm gonna copy it from over here.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.450
Paste it from over there.

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.380
Make sure that this status bar has the fixed position when scrolling here.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.230
So we set that up in the last video,

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:08.350
but that's really important.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:12.950
Now that we're going to be able to scroll down and see content here.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.710
Okay,

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.350
so the next thing you want is we want to create that tab bar.

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:24.430
So I have the tab are here over on the design goods.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:25.350
Go ahead and grab it.

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:30.200
Copy it and you can pay.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.390
So outside the art board,

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:32.990
for now is what will create this.

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:38.000
We just want to grab those icons so you can see I have this status.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.500
Um,

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:47.800
this ah navigation bar at the bottom or tab bar at the bottom is set at 375 wide and we can

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.350
make it 8 85 heights.

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.010
Cisco,

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:54.550
grab a square,

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.250
a rectangle here.

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:01.550
And let's just make a rectangle in this art board doesn't matter the size yet.

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.400
Just make it the same with as the art board.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:10.400
So you got 3 75 and then let's come to the height attributes here at the top.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:10.760
Right?

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.990
Let's make that 85.

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.840
Okay,

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:16.150
Cool.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:17.560
So now you can see it here.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.980
Looks pretty good.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.880
Let's go ahead and move that down a little bit.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:28.400
So now it's flush to the bottom of this art board.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.750
So what?

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.340
We want to do now is when you click on it on the design tab,

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.030
see where access fixed position when strolling.

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:40.320
Let's go ahead and tap that and I'm gonna show you what that looks like.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.340
Um,

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:47.980
once we get some content in and how this will stay fixed on the bottom as you scroll down.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:53.150
So the next thing we want to do is let's give this a colored background.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:58.350
So let's go ahead and dio weaken do a little bit of an off black.

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:05.480
So let's go get the blue color palettes and let's get enough where I can kind of see it on

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.050
black.

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:10.250
That looks good.

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:12.180
We could dio um,

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.550
012436 as a color.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:17.880
Or you can just use your best judgment if you want to.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:22.950
All right,

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:25.140
so now you have the tab are let's go.

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:32.360
Put these icons in play someone to grab all three and I'm gonna put them at the bottom.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:36.660
You can see that they are underneath the rectangle.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:42.810
That's because whatever's fixed position in Fig MMA will arrange itself on the top.

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:44.710
You can see the layering system here.

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:47.080
It has labels on this.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.870
Our ports has fixed at the top.

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:53.650
Anything that's fixed will automatically go to the top of the layering arrangement.

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:58.900
Anything that's not fixed will go underneath this scroll title here,

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.850
and this is the rest of the content.

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:06.920
So what we want to do is we want to fix position these icons and you'll see them jump from

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:13.270
the left layering system here up into the fixed layering positions here.

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:19.640
So we're gonna tap the click on the fixed position when scrolling and you'll see they moved

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:24.150
up from the scroll area to the fixed area.

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:27.180
And let's go ahead and make them even further weaken,

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:31.690
Click and drag them in between are on top of the rectangle,

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:33.410
so now they're laying on top of it.

00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:37.350
Let's go ahead and visually make them centered here.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:43.150
That looks good just using my arrow keys on my keyboard,

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:47.380
and now what we want is we want to create an active state.

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:54.280
So let's go ahead and select the profile icon here and the shopping cart icon and let's

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.280
push those back and transparency.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.050
So let's do about 30% here.

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:00.550
That looks good.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:02.290
They're still visible,

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:07.310
but it gives the user and indication of where they're at in this tab,

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:08.270
our system.

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:10.500
So you can see here.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:20.500
We're creating this screen here where this is going to stay fixed and the status bar at the

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:26.590
top will stay fixed and you'll scroll down and see all this content.

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:29.800
All right,

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:30.250
Cool.

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:31.910
So let's zoom out a little bit.

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:35.440
You can delete the rectangle we had here.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.460
Now that we have this tab,

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:42.870
our system in play and let's go grab the first Boba tea drink here.

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:45.150
So this is the regular Boba tea.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:45.890
Just command,

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:46.250
See?

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:46.950
Copy it.

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:49.940
It's already has to say the,

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:53.350
um the with and height for you.

00:09:53.350 --> 00:10:00.070
Just go ahead and paste it in and you'll see sense it's not fixed and automatically was

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:01.550
underneath the status bar,

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:02.170
which is good.

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:03.370
That's kind of what we want.

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:07.610
Let's grab this Boba tea logo here,

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:08.010
Command,

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:08.500
see,

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.250
unless just paste it here.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:20.580
So now you want to change the text of this Boba tea logo to a black text Work says Boba,

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.040
All you have to do here is just triple click,

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:28.650
triple click into it and then hold shift and select the other letters.

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:33.450
Now I have the word bullet Just Boba selected where?

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:33.830
It says,

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:34.450
Phil,

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:35.880
just go ahead and change.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.850
The color was making black.

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:43.530
We can also use our color styles that we made because we made a black here and select black

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:44.200
as well.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:49.730
All right,

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:50.750
that's looking good.

00:10:50.750 --> 00:11:00.120
So the next thing we wanted to add is the text here we had regular and sweet tint of

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.440
caramel and chocolate,

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.150
and we had the price for his Well,

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:08.900
right.

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:10.940
So I'm gonna grab the text tool here.

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:20.700
I'm gonna type in the word regular and again,

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:26.260
you can see out my Texas defaulting Teoh line on the bottom here on the character.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:27.250
Ah,

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:28.960
text dialog box.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.470
Is this piece here that happens Sometimes.

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:34.490
I like to have it aligned in the middle and not on the bottom.

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:35.300
That's good There.

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:47.620
Let's go ahead and make this a Let's do about a 16 point font and let's grab some letter

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:48.640
spacing here.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:49.090
Um,

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:50.270
it's too tight right now.

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:52.660
You can see without letters facing it.

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:57.310
Zalkind of hard to read and you'll see what I mean when you actually give it some letter

00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:57.720
spacing.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.750
Right now it's at minus 2%.

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:06.210
It's right underneath the box in which you can change the width and height of your fun and

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:07.350
let's bump it up.

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:13.470
Let's give it 8% and you could just see how just a little bit of spacing makes it just a

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:20.590
little bit easier to read again on the paragraph alignment we haven't set at centered.

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:22.550
Let's make it a right aligned.

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:25.850
So if I click on the right one on the text box here,

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:28.050
you can see I have it right aligned.

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:30.650
And that's looking good.

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:31.800
OK,

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.470
so like we did before in the last video,

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:35.980
let's create a character style for this.

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:38.660
So now we have a 16 point font.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:44.300
So let's go ahead and create a new 16 point.

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:52.000
Type it 16 point and it's a regular.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:00.460
I believe you regular fun so we can reuse that as we go through this.

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:06.110
All right,

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:11.550
The next thing we want to do is we want to type up the sweet tint of caramel and chocolate

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:11.550
.

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:13.850
So from here,

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:16.360
I'm gonna just copy this same layer.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.850
This text box here again,

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:19.400
I just I pressed,

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:19.750
um,

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:24.560
option shift shift tips that keeps that alignment to the right,

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.850
which is really good I don't want it off like this.

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:28.910
I want to keep it directly aligned,

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:32.580
and let's go type this.

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:33.930
And so at this point,

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:37.060
I actually wanted to be not centered in the box,

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:38.030
but to the top.

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:42.150
So I'm gonna do the alignment from the text property here aligned the top.

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:43.400
There you go.

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.550
That looks good.

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:46.520
Okay,

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:57.480
so we have sweet a tent of caramel and chocolate.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:04.750
Cool.

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:07.180
Right.

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:07.890
So this point,

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:09.550
what's make this text bigger?

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:14.580
So let's detach it from the character textile that we have here.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:19.300
So 16 let's make this probably too big there.

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.420
Let's make it a 22.

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:22.240
That should be.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.160
That should be fine.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:27.590
I'm gonna stretch this out.

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:30.160
So I want three lines yet out looks good there.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.150
And let's go make this a regular,

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:37.950
and that looks fine.

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:39.550
Cool.

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:42.430
So now that we have,

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:43.260
um,

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.800
this at 22 we have the,

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:46.650
um,

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:48.240
the title text here.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:51.880
It's 16 and the description taxed at 22.

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:55.400
Let's make a textile for this as well,

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.010
so we can reuse this now.

00:14:57.010 --> 00:14:58.470
So now we're getting a,

00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:02.250
um a combination of nice textiles that we can use.

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:03.860
We have the 16 point,

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:09.150
we had the 19 points that we set up from the log in pages,

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:11.230
and now we'll have the larger one,

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:12.510
which will be a 22.

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:15.650
So let's grab this and make it a 22 point.

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:21.960
I'm just typing in 22 point and you'll see why do this,

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:22.560
Um,

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:28.280
when we get to the next Siris of Boba Tea flavors because we're gonna type in the flavors

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:32.900
and the descriptions and then we can easily set them exactly like this.

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:39.250
All right,

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:40.170
that looks good.

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:40.900
Um,

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:43.940
one thing we had to was the price tag.

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:48.580
Someone to copy the same regular type fracture.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:52.310
I'll show you why we use some of the character styles and watch Really helpful.

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:54.080
Here's I'm just going to type it.

00:15:54.080 --> 00:16:03.590
Just gonna type for I think it was for 99 and let's say I don't have it aligned here to

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:04.370
this text,

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:08.490
but I do have it right aligned on the paragraph setting.

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:11.980
If I want to create alignment between all three of these elements,

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:13.410
just select all three,

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:17.220
and you can see at the top here I have these alignment icons.

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:19.190
So here's left alignment.

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:22.870
This was centered alignment but I want right alignment here.

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:25.450
Someone to click on the right and you can see it.

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:31.240
It aligned all three of these onto the right now and the 4 99 I want to make it.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.490
Not the 22.

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:33.160
Um,

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.740
but let's see what it looks like in the 19 Bold.

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:36.550
That looks good.

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:37.900
Don't keep it.

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:42.810
The 19 bold and the last thing we want to use.

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:44.190
I'm gonna copy this one.

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:46.260
I'm gonna create the ad.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:53.880
Just just indicate to the user that they can add this to their cart and let's give it the

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:57.270
action color here and while Ah,

00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:59.800
that looks That looks pretty good.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:04.390
All right,

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:04.740
cool.

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:06.220
So what we're gonna do next?

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:06.850
Um,

00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:11.760
let's go ahead and stitch this up so we can see what this looks like on the prototype.

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:12.980
So if you remember,

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:17.810
we had the log in screen prototype log in,

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:21.880
button on the log in screen was connecting to the loading screen,

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:25.550
and the go button on the keyboard would take you to the load screen.

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:28.430
And like we learned in the last video,

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:29.590
the load screen needs toe.

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:33.700
Have a delay so you can't click on any items within the art board.

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:35.590
To create an art board delay,

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:38.600
you have to select the art board in itself.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.150
So I have the loading screen selected.

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:46.750
I'm gonna click and drag the buoy prototype arm,

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:51.760
and you can see now it's connected to the shopping screen.

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:58.070
I'm gonna change this naming of the shopping or the loading screen here to shopping screen

00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:59.080
because we copied that.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.090
And again,

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:03.230
all I did was select the screen here,

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:05.720
got the layer on the left and just tripled,

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:06.810
clicked on the layer,

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:09.950
and I could type in shopping.

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:12.040
Okay,

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:12.430
cool.

00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:21.130
So we just want this tow this interaction here to go away after a certain time duration.

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:23.310
So on the prototype here,

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:28.650
when I select the prototype link I have on tap,

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:30.990
let's go ahead and do after delay.

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:35.490
And three seconds is about right or 3000 milliseconds here.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:37.130
An instant should be fine.

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:39.450
We don't want any smart animation or anything,

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:42.960
all right,

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.150
and then go ahead and press the play button at the top.

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:46.780
And now you could see the prototype.

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:48.700
Here we have the loading screen.

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:50.950
We can just go through the log in,

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:54.460
and you can see when I tapped the log in button,

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:58.960
the loading screen shows up for three seconds and then,

00:18:58.960 --> 00:18:59.180
yeah,

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:03.550
we have the shopping screen with our first flavor above a t here.

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:04.460
You see,

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:06.850
if I click and drag up,

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:13.670
see how the things that are fixed the tab are here and the status bar here at the top,

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:15.900
the settings elements,

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:17.110
those air all fixed.

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:21.950
That's what it means to have a fixed element is that those things are not going to scroll

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:24.550
while all the other content scrolls.

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:27.280
All right,

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:32.450
so let's go add the rest of the flavors of Boba tea that we had here.

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:38.180
So you can see here.

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:39.360
I had the,

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:39.950
um,

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:57.130
the next flavor here and just go ahead and pace that right in place,

00:19:57.130 --> 00:19:58.300
just like so.

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:06.290
And we want a little bit of about a one pixel spacing in between.

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:10.350
So that looks in between the two photos just like that,

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:13.340
Okay.

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:18.180
And then what we want to do here is probably best just to copy this text here,

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:22.340
and you can keep it aligned,

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:24.090
so I'm gonna hold option.

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:27.150
I'm gonna click and drag down and again,

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:28.560
I'm gonna hold shift.

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:29.870
So I'm not doing this.

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:32.160
So you can see as I move my mouse by hold shift.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.990
I can't move my mouse around.

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:37.760
It's keeping all of this this information here aligned.

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:42.760
I just space it kind of midway through to your image here.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:53.630
And I'm also gonna goto object and bring to front here she can see okay.

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:54.930
And on that flavor,

00:20:54.930 --> 00:21:03.160
what we had here was we have a coffee flavored with premium cold brew with black tea,

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:04.480
and it's for 99.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:09.360
So let's go back into our learning tab here.

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.950
And let's change that here.

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:21.620
And let's see here what it said Premium cold brew with black tea.

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:23.150
Type that in.

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:33.570
All right,

00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:35.540
we're the spacing there,

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:43.050
and I want to drop the with to the third line and had the spacing there.

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:45.290
Cool.

00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:46.950
We're getting through it pretty quick.

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:48.290
That's good.

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:50.050
Okay,

00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:51.930
so you can see that these two,

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:52.390
um,

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:53.520
elements fit.

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.450
Everything from the tab are up.

00:21:55.450 --> 00:22:00.960
Let's go grab the next flavored here,

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.950
which is the macho tea flavor.

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:06.320
And I just command see,

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:10.950
copied it and command v paste it.

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:19.260
And I'm gonna go ahead and get it in the right position here There you go.

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:27.910
And I'm gonna copy the same text here on the option.

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:28.820
Click and drag.

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:29.660
Hold shift.

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:31.420
So again,

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:32.470
holding options,

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:33.830
I get the double arrow,

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:35.790
select all these elements.

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:38.290
And if I want to,

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:41.800
I can I can group these to make it easy from a next selection.

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:48.760
So if I just do a group selection here and I hold option and click and drag No,

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:51.350
I have them copied.

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:52.510
And again,

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:53.930
I want to bring them to front.

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:55.570
I right click on them,

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:56.600
bring to front.

00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:07.230
You can also use command option up and down arrows for the quick keys to bring these up on

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:08.050
the layers.

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:11.430
All right.

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:14.560
And let's go ahead and call this one macho.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:14.870
Uh,

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:23.490
and the text on it waas premium cold brew up.

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:24.650
That was the,

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:25.450
um,

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:27.350
the coffee flavored.

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:32.840
So let's go ahead and just change this text tohave a macho t description.

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:44.660
So let's call it premium mata and black tea.

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.760
That should work.

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:57.240
Okay,

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:57.680
cool.

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:00.640
So the next thing we want to add is the final flavor,

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.880
which you can see here on,

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:03.690
um,

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:06.870
the final prototype here.

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:08.310
Up here was the text here.

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:12.010
Sweet Japanese macho t Let's go back and add that real quick.

00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:21.400
So sweets Japanese much,

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:21.850
uh,

00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:25.110
T which is my favorite drink,

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:25.860
by the way,

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:27.080
out of all of those,

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:30.170
all right.

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:33.910
And the last one is the chai Tia's.

00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:34.540
Well,

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:35.550
um,

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:40.590
so let's go grab the chai photo here.

00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:42.170
Just the one with a little bit more.

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:44.640
It's the same as the regular t.

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:47.580
It just has a little bit more of a color to it.

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:52.090
Go ahead and select.

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:53.380
You can see that when I paste.

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:55.130
If I don't have my art board selected,

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:55.970
I just like pace.

00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:58.570
This is not gonna pace in the art board.

00:24:58.570 --> 00:24:59.970
You can second move the art board.

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:01.060
It doesn't go with it.

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:02.630
So always remember,

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:07.480
Teoh selected the art board and then paste when you're in the art board,

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:09.690
I'm gonna move this down.

00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:12.920
I'm holding shift when I move,

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.850
so I don't move the proportions.

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:23.380
It already pasted right in the exact with that I wanted it full with when I moved it down.

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:24.070
Like so.

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:34.890
Okay,

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:35.850
at this point,

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:36.530
let's go ahead.

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:36.790
And,

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:37.230
um,

00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:38.100
copy.

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:40.720
I'm gonna move this up a little bit.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:45.000
Let's copy this text here and again.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:52.640
I'm going to right click and go to bring the front or command option up and down I can go

00:25:52.640 --> 00:26:04.290
up for bring to front and down to bring to back So you can see that And this is the sh i t

00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:04.290
.

00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:11.890
So the description for that is made with Golden Chai tea.

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:14.520
Let's go back to our learning,

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:15.350
Paige,

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:36.450
and I'm gonna type that in made with Golden Chuy T I believe that was also that's 5 99 All

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:36.790
right,

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:38.400
you were getting a little bit more expensive.

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:40.350
Now it's good.

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:42.160
Okay,

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:42.520
Cool.

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:47.910
So now we have those four flavors in Let's go ahead and go back to our prototypes again.

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:50.060
You can click on the play button,

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:51.300
or you could just do the tap.

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:52.900
If you just have over here,

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:55.310
you can also press.

00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:55.950
Um,

00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:59.370
the tab are there the top.

00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:07.430
And now you can see what it looks like to scroll so you can scroll through these flavors.

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:12.350
You can see the line between the coffee and the mata isn't there.

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:13.810
So let's go back and add that.

00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:15.160
But that's looking pretty good.

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:18.810
Let's go back.

00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:19.320
Um,

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:22.990
I'm gonna re select so one thing I do is,

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:27.550
um go ahead and select outside of the art board.

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:34.820
Start your mouse arrow to the right and click and drag over just the elements that you want

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:37.220
to select in the art board itself.

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:43.410
So we just have those flavors just the chai and the macho Now selected a na minha arrow

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:48.670
down to you can see I created that little line there for the macho t.

00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:50.850
Okay,

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:53.220
so again many ways to get to my prototype,

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:56.350
I can press presents or I can click on the tab at the top.

00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:59.010
Let's go tab back to the top there,

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:01.850
and there's on my flavors.

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:02.580
Okay,

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:02.960
cool.

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:05.780
So now that we have the art board here,

00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:07.880
you could see we made it pretty long.

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:12.260
Let's go back and shorten that up now that we have all the content in play.

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:19.460
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna add another guide to not just the bottom of my content,

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:21.600
but a little bit further.

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:28.780
Usually want to give some space for the tab bar so that all the chai the chai tea

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:34.070
information goes above the tab bar so you can see about there's fine.

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:37.440
Just a double check I'm gonna copy this,

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:41.510
nab our and just see.

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:41.810
Yep.

00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:44.680
We could probably move this guide up a little bit here.

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:51.350
We just want it where that chai tea will sit at the very low end of the tab or the swiping

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.350
.

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:52.230
Um,

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:52.380
well,

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:53.800
sit on top of that tab.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.950
Bar that tab are won't hide content that we have here.

00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:58.650
Okay,

00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:01.780
so this is kind of a fig MMA thing that happens here.

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:03.220
It's a little bit of a bug.

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:04.210
Um,

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:09.690
So if I want to stretch this art board with content that's fixed within it,

00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:10.980
you can see what happens.

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:13.610
See how the content that's fixed starts to squish.

00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:18.050
So look what happened to the Boba and the Status bar.

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:21.620
It's a thing that happens with figures.

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:23.010
I haven't quite figured that out.

00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:29.370
So what we tend to do is just click and drag and select all the elements that you have.

00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:30.500
And now art board,

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:31.900
do a command.

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:32.460
See?

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:33.590
Just copy it,

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:35.010
then delete it for now.

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:40.850
Then grab the art board and shorten it to that guide that we made here.

00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:44.090
And then command V.

00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:44.970
Well,

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:46.570
pace back in place.

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:48.050
There you go.

00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:50.170
I'll give you a second to do that.

00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:59.930
Okay,

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:00.950
so at this point,

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:07.700
what's go back to our prototype and we can check how that looks.

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:11.260
So you can see here we have the regular of the coffee,

00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:12.650
the macho.

00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:16.680
And if we didn't add that extra space in the bottom,

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:20.150
the child would end up at the bottom swipe looking like this.

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:22.580
Or even worse case it would hide that add button.

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:25.080
But since we added that additional space,

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:29.290
you can see where just goes right to the top of that navigation bar.

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:30.160
So it looks good,

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:31.850
Nikkan Second,

00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:36.110
swipe up and and figure what gives you that transition of swiping.

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:39.170
So it acts as if I was swiping with my finger.

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:40.130
And if you had,

00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:40.660
um,

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:45.980
if you download the Sigma mirror application on your phone,

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:50.990
you can see why that makes it feel just like a real application on your mobile device.

00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:53.330
All right,

00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:53.420
well,

00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:54.350
that's looking good.

00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:55.200
Um,

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:59.570
so the next thing we want to do here is if I tap anywhere not just the add button,

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:04.800
but anywhere on the milk tea space here,

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:10.730
it's gonna open up the selection motile for the milk regular milty.

00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:16.680
So that's this screen here looks like this.

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:24.760
So let's go ahead and build out this screen here,

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:29.810
and we're gonna work on the drop down as well to the right here.

00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:32.140
So they go back to the learning.

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:32.850
Paige,

00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:36.680
this is gonna be a regular screen size height.

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:39.160
So let's copy the loading screen that we had here.

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:40.500
So again,

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.110
I just held option.

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:44.230
Grab that art board,

00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:46.950
hold shift and drag it over to the right.

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:53.390
That I'm gonna click and drag from the right to select the elements within the art board.

00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:56.870
And now I'm gonna delete that when I pressed elite.

00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:59.930
Okay,

00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:01.740
I want to reuse this photo.

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:03.630
So let's go ahead and press command,

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:04.140
See?

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:08.240
And I'm gonna command V this photo here at the top,

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:14.900
and then you can see here where if I move the bottom up like,

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:15.050
say,

00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:16.740
I want to score shit up like that,

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:21.790
it and mix the perspective of the photo,

00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:22.960
Um,

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:28.580
it doesn't hold the aspect ratio and it interpret lates the photo like that.

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:31.980
And it it really doesn't look good for photos.

00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:35.980
So what we want to do is here is you want to go to the image here.

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:40.350
Click on it and you can see where it says Crop image.

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:45.760
Let's go ahead and do one that says Fit image here.

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.970
Actually,

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:48.970
What's going to fill?

00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:50.110
There you go.

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:55.680
So again we moved from crop to feel and how I got here.

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:57.330
Was he just click on the image?

00:32:57.330 --> 00:33:01.910
Phil here come over to where it was cropped and I put feel,

00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:04.640
and now you can see when I move it up,

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.260
it doesn't give me.

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:10.550
It doesn't defy the perspective of that image.

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:15.030
I want to move the actual image inside of this up.

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:18.470
So if I click on the image again and I double click,

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:19.540
so there's one click.

00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:20.790
But if I double click,

00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:23.720
I get to the crop here at the top,

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:26.420
suppress the crop and you can see it.

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:31.380
Now I can grab the image within that that I've cropped and I can move it up a little bit.

00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:35.070
And about about there should be fine.

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:40.090
Maybe give this a little bit more space.

00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:41.620
So again,

00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:49.950
I it's pre set me back to crop so I can go back now to fill and go back to crop again,

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:55.050
and then just move this up a couple ways.

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:55.760
You can do that.

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:56.680
Okay,

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:57.410
at this point,

00:33:57.410 --> 00:33:57.830
um,

00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:59.750
let's go ahead and have some more fun.

00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:02.350
We're gonna make the prototype section for this first,

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:06.240
but I need to make a close button on the top left.

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:07.990
So when you tap on this,

00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:08.740
um,

00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:15.500
you can close the screen as well and go back to the flavored screen with a shopping screen

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:15.500
.

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:20.800
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna grab a rectangle here you can see have a rectangle and

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:24.370
they click and drag Gonna hold shift open up,

00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:25.140
No holding shift,

00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:32.270
Just click and drag and I'm gonna round out the edges.

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:34.700
So over here I have the corner radius.

00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:35.900
Just press 100.

00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:36.660
It's fine.

00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:42.250
And see how it made it rounded out that selection.

00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:46.020
Since this is an actual element,

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:48.630
we want this to be the actionable color.

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:55.380
So let's go grab our primary action Color that pink and I'm gonna copy this command.

00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:55.720
See,

00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:56.920
I'm gonna click off of it.

00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:01.170
I'm gonna click back on the art board and I'm gonna command V,

00:35:01.170 --> 00:35:02.750
which is a paste in place.

00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:06.250
I'm gonna select the one I just pasted,

00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:12.550
and I'm gonna rotate it 90 degrees and I have a plus button.

00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:18.760
Sonam gonna select both of these and I'm gonna right click when a group,

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:21.470
this selection or you can also command G.

00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:24.550
I'll give you a second to do that.

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:32.930
And now that I have that grouped or that plus button available,

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:35.350
I'm gonna rotate the plus button.

00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:40.160
And now I have the X that I want.

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:49.610
And like anything that we use that's gonna be that we create that's gonna be reused.

00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:52.130
Let's go make this a component.

00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:54.990
Someone of downsize it just a little bit.

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:57.460
That looks good.

00:35:57.460 --> 00:35:59.050
I'm gonna copy it.

00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:03.150
I'm gonna go back to our component library here,

00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:07.180
and I'm gonna pace that here,

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:11.600
move this over a little bit and I'm gonna create the component.

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.990
So I get I pasted it here.

00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:15.230
The little top,

00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:16.010
um,

00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:19.240
diamond icon create component.

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:25.840
And I'm gonna name this close and just put a tax close X like that.

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:29.030
Awesome.

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:35.130
Now let's go back to our learning page here and let's go back to the layer asset.

00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:35.660
Ah,

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:37.130
delayer tab here at the top.

00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:43.790
Let's go to the asset tab and let's grab the X component that we just created.

00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:48.950
And let's put that in place of this X now.

00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:49.490
So that way,

00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:50.800
when we re use this,

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:56.570
we can change it pretty easily from the same area from the master component.

00:36:56.570 --> 00:36:58.240
And it changes on all the art boards.

00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:00.930
Okay,

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:02.010
so let's have the fun part.

00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:04.180
Let's go ahead and prototype this,

00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:05.520
um Ah,

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:08.240
transition here in our prototype.

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:11.480
So it's click on the shopping page here.

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:19.990
Let's go to the prototype tab here and just select just the image of the regular probity.

00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:27.300
Let's go ahead and connect it to than the screen to the right.

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:30.200
Let's actually label this screen here.

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.120
This is says loading screen,

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:33.160
because we copied it.

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:36.340
Let's call this one the selection screen.

00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:42.180
All right,

00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:43.790
so now we have this selection screen.

00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:45.740
So again we have the shopping.

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:47.030
Ah,

00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.680
strain.

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:50.270
Here we selected the regular Boba tea.

00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:55.150
We click the little gooey prototype connector onto the selection screen,

00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:59.540
and now we have the interaction on tap just good.

00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:02.720
And it went to move in.

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:05.240
Sometimes years may just say instant like this.

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:06.170
Um,

00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:09.980
what we want to do is we want to create a move in scenario,

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:11.150
so I'll show you what it looks like.

00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:13.530
We're just instant for right now and weaken.

00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:14.830
Do the X here,

00:38:14.830 --> 00:38:20.740
back the X in the selection screen back to the shopping screen,

00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:22.030
and we could just do it instant.

00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:24.940
Okay,

00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:27.330
so if I tap anywhere where the photo was,

00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:32.300
you can see it just instantly transitions to that selection screen.

00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:39.830
And if I tap on the X than instance instantly transitions to the shopping screen.

00:38:39.830 --> 00:38:41.210
We don't want that.

00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:42.320
We want a transition.

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:46.730
We want this screen to slide up and in the X to slide back down.

00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:53.190
So what we need to do is select the ah prototype.

00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:53.950
So ah,

00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:55.700
gooey line that we just made.

00:38:55.700 --> 00:39:01.340
That was from the Boba tea here and where it says instant.

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:04.230
We want this to have a move in.

00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:06.660
So what it's saying is this screen here,

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:09.490
this new screen is going to move in,

00:39:09.490 --> 00:39:12.680
and then you define how it's gonna move in.

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:15.450
So here we have the slide left.

00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:19.670
You can see an example of that's gonna come in from the right slide left.

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:23.090
We have the slide writes gonna come in from the right.

00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:27.330
We have the slide downwards to come in from the top down,

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:29.760
and we have the one that we want to do,

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:31.450
which is the slide up.

00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:32.480
So this screen,

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:34.720
this selection screen here,

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:39.780
is going to slide up on top of the your shopping screen.

00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:46.280
So now we have that to make sure you have this selected on MoveOn and the,

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:46.710
um,

00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:49.400
specifications for how it's gonna move in.

00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:50.550
Set on up.

00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:53.240
Let's go look at the prototype now.

00:39:53.240 --> 00:40:01.300
So if I tap anywhere where the regular milk tea is that you can see how this slides up and

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:03.130
I think X is still on instant.

00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:08.900
So now we want this screen toe also slide back down by pressing the X.

00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:12.380
It's a lot of times when you do this,

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:14.960
I've seen is sometimes you'll have move in,

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:15.760
selected,

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:22.150
and then you'll have this specifications set on Move down and it makes it look like the

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:23.100
thing that you want.

00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:30.020
But let me show you what happens here to see how it brought the other screen on that

00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:31.080
transition with it.

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:32.580
So let me do that again.

00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:35.830
You click on the regular Boba Tea here,

00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:36.600
it slides up.

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:37.480
That's what we wanted.

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:38.740
That's a good transition.

00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:40.410
But when I pressed the X.

00:40:40.410 --> 00:40:43.720
You can see the screen comes from the top,

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:45.770
the screen underneath at the shopping screen,

00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:47.220
and it slides down again.

00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:48.690
We don't we don't want that.

00:40:48.690 --> 00:40:52.920
We want this to look like it just slides up and then slides down again.

00:40:52.920 --> 00:41:00.960
So that's caused because we have the selection here on the animation defined as move in

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:03.620
when we actually wanted to be a move out.

00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:03.960
It's like,

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:04.900
Get out of the way.

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:12.160
So again we have the regular milk tea selection coming in as telling the prototype to move

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:13.540
this screen up,

00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:21.740
move in and then we have the X button being informed to move out and go down to expose this

00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:22.380
screen.

00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:23.750
The shopping screen here.

00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:31.520
So let's go ahead and look at that side tap on the regular milk tea selection photo slide

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:31.880
up.

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:35.050
And then now that we have the slide to move the move out,

00:41:35.050 --> 00:41:38.860
you'll see it move out and just moves down.

00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:40.460
It doesn't bring the other screen with it,

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:42.230
so move in.

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:45.110
That's up and move out.

00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:48.850
Going down cool.

00:41:48.850 --> 00:41:52.080
That's a really common mobile pattern,

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:53.350
an interaction pattern.

00:41:53.350 --> 00:41:59.010
Is things sliding up with an X and then sliding down with the X as well.

00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:01.480
When it's coming in from the left to the right,

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:03.140
that's usually a back button.

00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:07.090
And we'll have opportunities in,

00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:07.490
um,

00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:13.010
the shopping cart experience to prototype what that looks like with the back button.

00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:16.430
All right,

00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:16.740
cool.

00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:17.800
So at this point,

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:18.370
um,

00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:22.790
we want to add some labels that you're on the regular milk tea,

00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:25.470
someone to copy this regular text here.

00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:26.860
I'm gonna paste it here.

00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:31.310
And I think we said this was 16 point.

00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:34.310
Let's go make this a 22 point.

00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:36.200
Like the regular there.

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:37.230
That looks good.

00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:44.010
I'm gonna copy that and just call it regular milk T.

00:42:44.010 --> 00:42:51.440
And I'm gonna make this one of my break.

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:53.350
Detach this and just make it bold.

00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:55.750
That looks good.

00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:57.880
Kind of center.

00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:58.610
This here.

00:42:58.610 --> 00:43:03.190
If you want to have some real fun with it,

00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:12.100
let's just bump up the milk tea up a whole bunch so you can see I've made it now 32 and I

00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:14.040
have the regular that that looks That looks good.

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:14.830
That's getting there.

00:43:14.830 --> 00:43:17.140
One thing I need to add here is,

00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:19.450
um you can see the word milk tea.

00:43:19.450 --> 00:43:21.710
It has a lot of letting meeting,

00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:22.350
um,

00:43:22.350 --> 00:43:24.330
paragraph spacing.

00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:31.220
So the space in between the word milk and the word T this space here that's called letting

00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:34.700
or line height or paragraph spacing.

00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:35.680
Um,

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:43.220
the reason that is called letting was back in the day when they were doing typesetting.

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:45.650
They usedto have to do it out of metal,

00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:51.130
and they would They would have a typesetting machine where they would cut out individual

00:43:51.130 --> 00:43:51.910
letters.

00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:52.990
And then they would,

00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:53.520
um,

00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:55.740
arrange those letters to make words.

00:43:55.740 --> 00:44:01.710
And they would actually put pieces of lead in between each word here to make the letting.

00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:03.200
That's why it was called letting,

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:05.600
because you had different point sizes of metal.

00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:10.410
So in the world of CSS languages,

00:44:10.410 --> 00:44:12.300
that's called line height here.

00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:15.490
So let's go ahead and make that a smaller line height.

00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:18.300
I'm going to just say 50 as a starter point.

00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:20.620
And then now let's go down.

00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:21.420
So,

00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:22.260
um yeah,

00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:23.910
38 is perfect.

00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:36.070
So now I have this set at 42 of the font size and 38 for the line height and 8% for the,

00:44:36.070 --> 00:44:36.780
um,

00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:38.250
the character spacing.

00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:42.840
All right,

00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:43.480
that looks good.

00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:48.650
I've we've created a little bit of some hierarchy here with the regular font and the milk

00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:49.100
tea.

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:55.990
Since we've created a 42 bold.

00:44:55.990 --> 00:45:00.330
I'm not sure if we'll actually use the font this big going forward,

00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:01.810
but just in case,

00:45:01.810 --> 00:45:03.040
let's go ahead and do it.

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:03.930
Let's make a,

00:45:03.930 --> 00:45:04.300
um,

00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:13.620
a 42 point character style or textile.

00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:17.870
So now we have a pretty good a range of 40 42.

00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:26.250
I need to rename this.

00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:26.790
I typed it.

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:27.590
43.

00:45:27.590 --> 00:45:28.670
It's 42.

00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:29.360
Okay,

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:35.620
so we have 40 to 20 to 19 and 16 is pretty good so far.

00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:40.800
Ever get a range of character styles that weaken and textiles weaken we can pull from.

00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:42.560
All right.

00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:47.930
The next thing that will need to do is we're gonna create these little drop down,

00:45:47.930 --> 00:45:49.720
uh um,

00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:54.130
pieces here for milk and regular sweet and medium ice.

00:45:54.130 --> 00:45:57.570
So let's go into this prototype here,

00:45:57.570 --> 00:45:58.580
or the screen.

00:45:58.580 --> 00:45:59.240
Um,

00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:00.760
selection screen.

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:03.810
Let's grab a rectangle and just make a rectangle.

00:46:03.810 --> 00:46:05.030
Doesn't matter what size it is.

00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:08.740
I got mine set at Let's dio um,

00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:19.290
let's do 3 20 with and 70 65 height should be fine.

00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:20.700
Cool,

00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:23.130
and it has a feel right now.

00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:24.070
We don't want to have a Phil.

00:46:24.070 --> 00:46:25.270
We want to have a stroke.

00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:26.540
So let's remove the fill.

00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:30.050
So if I click on the minus button here on the right,

00:46:30.050 --> 00:46:34.070
you can see minus no more Phil and I wanna add a stroke.

00:46:34.070 --> 00:46:36.290
So I'm gonna press the plus button on the stroke.

00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:38.120
And now I have a stroke.

00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:39.000
But it's black,

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:46.640
but I want to make it white and give it to points again.

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:51.050
Since I've selected White already and I have it set as a character style or color style.

00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:53.170
Let's grab it from the color style here.

00:46:53.170 --> 00:46:58.750
So it's do white here and I'm gonna go step back a little bit.

00:46:58.750 --> 00:46:59.190
Let's do,

00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:00.200
like 50%.

00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:01.520
Yeah,

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:02.290
that looks good.

00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:08.920
All right,

00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:09.590
so let's see,

00:47:09.590 --> 00:47:11.770
we had a 19 point.

00:47:11.770 --> 00:47:13.490
We have the 22 point font.

00:47:13.490 --> 00:47:15.710
22 should be fine for now.

00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:17.790
Let's go grab this regular font.

00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:23.720
Let's make this white.

00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:31.340
And again it's on that right alignment.

00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:32.630
So if I stretch of this box,

00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:34.040
it aligns to the right.

00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:36.310
We want that to be left aligned here,

00:47:36.310 --> 00:47:46.650
and I'm gonna just call this milk and I'm gonna center this box officially.

00:47:46.650 --> 00:47:48.030
That looks good.

00:47:48.030 --> 00:47:51.130
Okay.

00:47:51.130 --> 00:47:52.320
We want to make a little,

00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:52.990
um,

00:47:52.990 --> 00:47:56.810
triangle here to represent the drop down.

00:47:56.810 --> 00:48:02.230
So how to do that is go ahead and grab the polygon.

00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:07.270
I like mine to be a little bit more.

00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:07.620
What?

00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:08.220
Wide?

00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:10.060
You can hold shift.

00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:12.010
It gives you a straight ah,

00:48:12.010 --> 00:48:12.770
triangle.

00:48:12.770 --> 00:48:14.780
I like to be a little bit more wide,

00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:15.550
like minds.

00:48:15.550 --> 00:48:16.970
About 20 by 10.

00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:18.280
Or 20 by 11.

00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:22.430
20 with 11 heights.

00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:23.810
That looks good.

00:48:23.810 --> 00:48:27.620
Let's go grab that primary action color pink that we made here.

00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:32.080
And then we will just want to flip this so it's pointing down.

00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:34.820
All right,

00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:37.180
Cool.

00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:39.810
So that's our milk drop down.

00:48:39.810 --> 00:48:40.680
And,

00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:40.880
like,

00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:43.690
anything we're gonna I'm gonna downsize this a little bit,

00:48:43.690 --> 00:48:45.110
but we're gonna copy this.

00:48:45.110 --> 00:48:48.410
So remember the rules earlier about anything that you copy.

00:48:48.410 --> 00:48:49.610
Let's go.

00:48:49.610 --> 00:48:51.580
Make this a component.

00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:53.510
Someone to copy it.

00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:56.410
I'm gonna go over to the component library here.

00:48:56.410 --> 00:49:01.990
I'm gonna paste it here.

00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:05.580
I'm oppressed a little diamond button at the top here.

00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:11.990
I'm gonna create a component and call this the drop down button.

00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:18.230
Cool.

00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:19.780
So that's the drop down button,

00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:28.840
and I'm gonna change it from milk to just text So give it a more general description.

00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:30.490
It's best practices.

00:49:30.490 --> 00:49:33.350
And once that's done,

00:49:33.350 --> 00:49:36.730
I'm gonna were gonna go back over to our learning page here.

00:49:36.730 --> 00:49:43.260
Let's go over the learning Paige and then see the layers tab that we're on here.

00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:50.190
Let's go to the asset tab and you can see at the drop down button here.

00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:52.280
Click and drag it.

00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:58.040
You could see its purple selection rather than blue,

00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:00.770
indicating that it's a component.

00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:04.980
And I'm gonna put that right over the top.

00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:07.800
I'm gonna command,

00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:08.230
see,

00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:09.950
copy and delete.

00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:13.480
And then I'm a select the milk,

00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:19.430
the drop down icon and the rectangle and just delete him.

00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:22.580
And then minutes select the art board screen.

00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:23.020
Here.

00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:26.480
I'm in a command V paste in place,

00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:30.680
and I have that dropped down component.

00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:36.300
And let's make it an instance by changing the name and now we have the milk here.

00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:39.780
Okay,

00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:40.160
cool.

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:41.550
So here's a little t
