00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.700
All right,

00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.940
Welcome to the next video.

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:08.570
We'll cover fig MMA keyboard shortcuts and we'll dive into figment plug ins and go look at

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:09.880
gooey kits as well.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.130
All right,

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.670
so let's go ahead over to Ah,

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:14.920
the keyboard shortcuts.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.970
So I'm in the design file that you have here,

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.460
and I created a page here called Quickies here.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.230
So go ahead,

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.660
go over too quick keys,

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.240
and I've typed up a list of my favorite keyboard shortcuts here.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.720
These are the ones that I use most common,

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.820
and I'll go through them with you here right now.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:37.660
Um,

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:44.430
so the first set that I use a lot there are tools on the left and commands on the right.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.900
So for tools,

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.550
I use V a lot to get to the selection tool.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.540
This selection tool allows me to select elements and things on the board.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.310
So let's say I'm in the rectangle tool here,

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.690
and I want to quickly get over to a selection tool.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.910
I just press of the and now I'm back over at the selection tool.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.500
I use P to go into the pin.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.400
Tool soapy on my keyboard takes me quickly to the pen tool I could make a selection or draw

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.170
shape like I'm doing right now.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.980
And then If I want to select this shape,

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.640
I compress V and now I'm back over to the selection tool.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:29.020
And I can move this shape around i u Z a lot to get to the the zoom tool to proceed into

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.460
the zoom,

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.050
tool,

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.740
click and drag,

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.360
and I've zoomed in to the area that I clicked and dragged I use Ah,

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.890
they are for the rectangle tool a lot.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.460
So just press are and I can create a rectangle here.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.940
Can I compress V start to select it and oh,

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.480
for the circle tool.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.770
And if I hold shift when I do a circle,

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.270
it will give me a perfect circle by go without shift.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.780
It will make ovals for me,

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.580
and you can see once I create the oval or the circle or the rectangle and automatically

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.550
jumps to the selection tool here,

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.640
l for the line tool.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.480
It's allows me to create lines you can see when I hold shift.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.960
It gives you straight lines when you don't hold shift.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.450
That allows you to do any line that you would like.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.340
So There's the line there.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.760
Sleep that space bar for the hand tool that allows you to move around the art board space

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.260
easy.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.440
And then,

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.980
um,

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.180
I for the eyedropper tool,

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.820
which allows you to select colors.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.670
So let's say I have this rectangle and I want to easily go grab this pink color here.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.650
I just press I on the keyboard.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.390
You'll see it opens up a little circle here that allows you to see the color that you're

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.120
selecting,

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.430
and I'll go and select.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.640
Say,

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.030
this pink here and watch my rectangle.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.150
It turns pink.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.460
So pretty simple tools there,

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.780
um,

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.910
and shortcuts to get to those tools.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.850
The next ones I want to talk about here are the commands.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:01.830
So,

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:02.450
um,

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.130
to zoom in,

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.600
you can do a command plus and then zooms in and then to zoom out,

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.650
you can do the command minus some,

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.620
zooming out,

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:13.400
zooming in,

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.040
zooming out,

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.750
zooming in.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:15.740
It's a lot of time.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:21.760
I'm using those commands with the combination of Z for the pencil saw.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.280
Zoom in,

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.870
select the space that I want.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.490
If I'm too far in,

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:30.740
I'll zoom out or I'll zoom in again and then I'll use the space bar for the hand told to

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:31.570
move around.

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.420
All right,

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.830
so the next one we have here is for text options.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.250
So you can see I have this text here 12 and three.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.250
When I do command shift greater thin,

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.580
that's gonna up size the texts.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:54.490
And if I do command shift smaller than that's going to downsize the texts saw Select the

00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:00.990
123 text here and I'll go command shift less than and you can see it.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.170
It goes smaller,

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.960
some downsizing the text.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.710
And if I do command shift greater thin,

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.770
then it's going to go up.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.600
Size the text so you can see the Texas getting bigger.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.000
Now,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.850
the next thing I do in conjunction with the command shift greater than less than to make

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:27.310
text big is also use option shift greater than a less than to decrease the line height or

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.710
increase the line height.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.040
So you can see now the line height,

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.970
this kind of squished.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.590
I have overlapping words.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.090
So while I still have this selected,

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.580
I'm gonna shift from the,

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.330
um,

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.460
shift command and go to option shift.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:49.290
So I went from command shift greater than less than and now I'm gonna go to option shift

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:54.510
and you can see what happens here is I'm increasing the line height by doing option shift

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:01.190
greater than and then I'm decreasing it by doing option shift.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.100
Less than so.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.860
One more time to decrease the font size and selecting it.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:17.600
And I'm doing command shift less than and I'm decreasing the font size and then to increase

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.520
the line height,

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:24.960
I'm going to go over to option shift while the text is still selected and I'm going to go

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:32.070
option shift less than to decrease the line height and greater than to increase it.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.620
So these four here take a little bit of practice doing it,

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:36.950
but once you get the hang of it,

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.280
it becomes very natural.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.360
Okay,

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.090
The next thing I want to show is,

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:43.610
um,

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:49.940
the command for moving layers on top of each other called bringing forward or below each

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:50.260
other,

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.630
which is called bringing backwards.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.210
So these two commands here.

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.160
So let's say I have these two rectangles here,

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.390
and this is for any layer,

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.980
any shape,

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.650
and he text any graphic element that you're using in fig MMA.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:07.460
If I want to bring this rectangle underneath the black rectangle underneath the pink

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:08.050
rectangle.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.840
All I have to do is select the black rectangle.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:17.200
Do command option and I can go down arrow to bring backwards and you can see it goes below

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.070
the rectangle.

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.870
And if I want to bring in above directing all again,

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.550
I'll just use command option up arrow.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.410
You can see how that works.

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:30.020
I can also do these with more than one shape.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.380
So if I hold shift and I collect and I select both of these rectangles,

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.430
I can also move those up and down.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.160
So let's say I want to bring it below the text here and I can bring them back up.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:50.240
I want to So pretty much about 80% to 90% of the tool usage in fig MMA.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:55.380
You'll be ableto have these sets of quickie commands and that will cover most of their tool

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:56.600
usage that you'll use.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.560
And I've also left them here in this document.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.780
So if you come over to the document here and you see the quick keys,

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:06.190
you'll have these here.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:11.110
Another way to view the quickies in fig MMA is if you go to the little question mark here

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.770
on the bottom.

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:18.230
Where says help and resource is and you click on that and then you go Teoh Quick keyboard

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:19.060
shortcuts here.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:20.760
Just go ahead and click on that.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.230
And then here's all your keyboard shortcuts or quick keys here,

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.010
and you can see for tools.

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:27.820
Here's all the ones for the tools.

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:31.990
Here's all the ones for viewing you have zoom.

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:32.790
Yep,

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:34.060
text shortcuts,

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:35.390
shapes,

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:36.970
selections,

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:40.940
cursors at its transforms,

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:44.480
arranging and component shortcuts there.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:49.830
So if you just want to go under the hood and see what kind of shortcuts figure figment

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:50.700
provides for you,

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:57.490
you can go here by clicking on the bottom rights question mark and go into the keyboard

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:58.590
shortcuts like So.

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:01.860
Another way to see keyboard shortcuts is,

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:03.210
whenever you're in a tool,

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:07.750
let's say I want to look at the rectangle tool or the line tool where the lips tool it

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:09.880
provides short cuts to the right here.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:15.890
So there shortcuts to your frame and your slice tool selection tool,

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:18.190
and it also does the same here.

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:20.540
If you go into the menus Seiken,

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:21.960
select an object,

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:26.260
and I could see all the quickies here on the right So bring the front.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.570
Bring the backwards.

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:33.990
Lock the layer here and same for editing.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:36.770
Undo command Z redo command shift.

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:40.940
See Cut command X copy Command.

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:45.250
See paste command V paste over Selection Command shift B.

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:48.900
So you can also view the keyboards in multiple ways.

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.560
You can see it by the question Mark,

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:55.850
and you can also go into the menus here and the tools and see the shortcuts as you go along

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:55.850
.

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:57.860
All right,

00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:58.070
Cool.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:59.340
So that covers the keyboards.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:03.150
Let's go look at some of the plug ins now.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:09.250
So I created another page here in the Sigma file that you have and this one's called

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:10.350
favorite plug ins.

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:14.570
And these are my four top favorite plug ins that you confined in fig MMA.

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:19.200
So to go find foot plug ins and to go look at plug mints plug ins,

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.710
just go over to the top left.

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:20.990
Here,

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:22.360
go over to your dashboard.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.190
Click on the four boxes here in the top left,

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:26.940
takes you to the dashboard.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:30.050
This is where you have the ability to search projects.

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:32.240
Here you can see your recent projects.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.640
You have your drafts and then you have your plug ins.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.090
here.

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:37.140
So these are all your plug ins here,

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:42.150
and my top favourite four plug ins here are called content.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:42.700
Riel,

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.700
spellchecker,

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:51.090
unspool ash and map sickle so you can see there's some popular ones here there.

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:52.160
These are pretty popular.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.450
These first to the in splash the content riel.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:58.130
You can also search plug ins,

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:01.660
so just go browse all plug ins and you can type in,

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:02.250
say,

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:02.580
map,

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:03.200
sickle.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:03.850
Here,

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:06.150
you can see the one here.

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:08.860
You can also type in spell Checker.

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:11.300
You could see the spell checker here.

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.270
They're pretty easy to install.

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:17.410
So let's just go say I want to install this spell checker while you got to do is click on

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:18.290
Spellchecker.

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:19.900
You can see where it's installed.

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.650
I can uninstall it and then click back on again,

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:24.820
and I've installed it into the application.

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:27.230
Pretty simple stuff.

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:32.040
It's fun to just go around and just house all of the the plug ins that figment provide you

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:32.040
.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.010
There's tons of them.

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:34.360
They're pretty cool.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.670
Let's go look at some of my favorites here,

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:38.680
and I'll show you how to use a plug in.

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.440
Let's go back to the file here.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.640
Just click on your figment class file.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:45.110
I'm in the plug in page here.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.480
Let's go look at content riel.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:51.250
So a lot of these plug ins you you want to select an element.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:58.440
So let's go ahead and grab and make a rectangle here on the top in the menu bar.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:58.640
Here,

00:10:58.640 --> 00:10:59.760
you have plug ins.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.930
You go ahead and click on plug ins,

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:04.960
and these are the ones that you'll you have installed.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.230
So in this case,

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:07.950
let's go look at content riel.

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:10.260
So I click on content real,

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:11.950
and it's opening up that plug in.

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:14.560
And what this does is it provides me.

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:16.640
I'm different types of content that I need.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:20.200
Someone put it text box here,

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:24.850
and it gives me text avatars and icons.

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:26.840
So if I click this text and I want names,

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:31.360
it gives me random versions of names will give me random phone numbers.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.170
It'll give me addresses that I need.

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:35.950
It would give me dates and times.

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:39.250
It will fill with Laura up some if you want just default text,

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:44.850
random generated emails and random generated you RL's as well.

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:50.450
I can also click on this rectangle shape here goto avatars,

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:57.320
and this will give me automatically different photos of people scientists want males say

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.870
females here I can do both male and female.

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:04.050
It just It's just a random selection of photos.

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:06.850
So I'm next a easy if I'm doing a whole bunch of different,

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:07.360
um,

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.660
team boards Right now,

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:14.450
I need different photos of people or social media where I can see I have a lot of people in

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:16.720
photos toe populated my designs.

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:20.300
This makes it really easy to do that next thing,

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:21.600
it also has some icons.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.600
You have to install a font to use the icons.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.520
I don't really use the icons that much again.

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.950
I use the noun project here.

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:30.370
I showed you earlier where if you want any,

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:30.590
say,

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:31.950
a profile icon,

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:33.510
just go to noun Project.

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:38.480
You can download it like I showed you in the past video and drag the scalable vector

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:41.470
graphic into your figment file and you can use that.

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:44.440
All right.

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:49.270
Another cool plug in that I find really valuable is unspool ash.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:50.970
So if you gotta unspool ash,

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:56.640
this is just free photos that you can use So it goes beyond just photos of people here such

00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:00.230
select this square and I could just insert random photos.

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:01.810
It would just give me any random.

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:03.450
That's a really beautiful photo there,

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:05.600
but it also gives me some presets here.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.350
I can have animals,

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:09.190
architecture,

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:11.660
and if I just click again on architecture,

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:14.410
it gives me more architectural options.

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:17.490
Same in nature gives me nature as well.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:19.980
I know populate any shape.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:21.530
So let's say I want,

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:22.320
um,

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:26.930
a circle here that I do portrait.

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:31.560
Give me a portrait view here or space and I can also search stuff.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:38.670
Let's say I want like a tiger and there's some photos of some tigers here.

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:39.250
Pretty cool,

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:41.810
right?

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:42.710
Such unspool ash.

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:48.170
Just a quick way to get a free access to many different types of photos as well.

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:50.220
You can also go toe on splash dot com,

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.860
and they have a library of photos that you can download.

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:55.190
All right.

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:57.160
The next one is spell checker,

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:02.540
so just go ahead and select any typography or paragraphs or written content.

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:08.340
Go to your plug in and just click on the spell checker there and it will.

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:09.820
It will automatically,

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:10.460
um,

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:12.490
spell check anything that you have,

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:13.990
So let me go.

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:15.010
Let's go back over,

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:15.440
Teoh.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.810
Quick keys here,

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:18.340
select all this.

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:27.160
Go do spell checker and now it's loading.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:32.980
It's telling me that I dropper is misspelled or has incorrect spacing on it.

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:34.990
So pretty neat.

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:35.670
Um,

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:38.880
have seven errors here talking about eyedropper tool.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.250
Lets go select the commands.

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:42.710
They'll probably give me some errors here,

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:42.950
too,

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:43.550
as well.

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:46.690
Yep.

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:47.870
Been shown some errors.

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:51.410
What's sad?

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:51.930
Misspelled.

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:54.110
This word would see command.

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:59.150
And I do spellcheck.

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:01.970
Well,

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:03.020
I guess that's a word.

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:03.490
But,

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:03.860
um,

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:04.840
yeah,

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.740
Best case to when you do spell if you want.

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:08.920
Spell checking is used Graham early.

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:13.250
You can copy and paste this into an email and 1/2 gram early.

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:14.280
Check it as well.

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.710
All right,

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:17.090
cool.

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:20.360
The next thing to check on is map Sickle.

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.970
Some obstacles are pretty cool.

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:23.820
One of my favorite plug ins here.

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:25.850
Um so again,

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:28.970
just start with the shape that clear out this year.

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:31.250
Make a rectangle large one.

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:33.980
And this is for anything that you want map related.

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:38.600
So if you want to get away from the normal styling of a Google map and you wanna have a

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.810
more of like a dark theme or like,

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:41.670
theme map,

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:43.080
you can come here to map,

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:43.690
sickle,

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:45.860
click on open map sickle,

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:50.950
and it gives you different styles here.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.450
Suddenly move this a little bit over to the left.

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:56.900
So let's say this is a street style.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:57.950
It's more graphic.

00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:00.550
You can do outdoor style.

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:04.040
Here you do a light style.

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:08.470
I like a dark theme that gives you a satellite.

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:12.180
Here's your satellite plus streets here.

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:14.610
I like the dark theme personally.

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:18.010
A lot of dark theme you can create other with,

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:18.480
Um,

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.460
you can zoom out.

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:22.100
I could get the whole the whole world here if I wanted.

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:26.250
Let's just do the United States.

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:32.700
Many California and I can do different whiffs here,

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:38.490
so let's say 1000 by 1000 If I wanted and I press create map,

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:51.120
it's going to give me a screenshot of that design inside the shape.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:51.480
Here.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.440
I'm gonna get one with lots of streets,

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.880
little lines that be hard toe create.

00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:04.140
Let's say San Francisco here and you can see now I have San Francisco generated.

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:06.230
Within this shape,

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:07.370
it's an image.

00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:09.220
So I go to my feel image here.

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:10.850
I have the image here.

00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:15.760
I can come in and crop this image if I want to buy pressing the crop at the top.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:18.840
And that's map sickle.

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:20.830
So those are my four favorite plug ins.

00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:21.460
I'll leave,

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:22.080
um,

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:23.550
these here for you,

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:25.730
and you could use those and plug them in.

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:26.340
Um,

00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:28.140
and you can find your plug ins here.

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:29.410
Another way to go to your man.

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:32.550
It to your plug ins is if you just click on the plug ins at the top,

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:33.860
going to manage plug ins,

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:36.700
it will take you back to that page that we just visited.

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:38.460
All right,

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:42.220
The last thing is to go look at how to download gooey kits.

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:43.940
So a gooey kit is,

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:44.540
um,

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:49.060
the word you e g u I means graphical user interface,

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:51.760
and figure has a whole bunch of them for you to use.

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:54.450
So if you go to a Google search,

00:17:54.450 --> 00:18:01.080
I have one here for you and you just Google search and download fig MMA gooey kits.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:04.600
My favorite one is this download 49 free.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:05.110
Um,

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:07.370
it's the you i store dot com.

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:08.940
If you click on this one,

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:10.720
it will take you to a link here,

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:13.260
and this has a whole bunch of lets,

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:13.690
you know,

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:14.820
and green Ah,

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:15.260
buttons.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:16.660
here Which ones are for fig?

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:16.940
MMA?

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:18.840
They haven't for sketch vision,

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:20.050
Other design tools.

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:24.890
And let's say you want this coin base Web dashboard here.

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:25.970
This is all free.

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:27.380
You just come in,

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:31.350
press free download it will down low in the bottom left.

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:32.110
Here,

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:33.850
let's go ahead and open that.

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:36.400
When you open that folder,

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:41.020
it gives you P and G's of these designs here.

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:41.650
You can see.

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:44.890
And it has a dark theme in a light theme.

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:47.630
It also gives you this figment file.

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:49.850
So if you want to install that figment file,

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:50.660
um,

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:55.480
do the same thing that we did in the very beginning where you downloaded the Sigma file

00:18:55.480 --> 00:19:00.130
that I provided and you dragged and dropped it into your draft space here.

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:00.860
So I'll show you.

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:06.820
So what you'll do here is this crab this file and just click and drag it into fig MMA like

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:07.440
so.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:11.070
And it will import this file and you can go ahead.

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:11.710
I'm gonna cancel.

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:13.450
It was already have it downloaded.

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:16.840
Okay,

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:17.200
cool.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:25.190
Another thing that you can dio you can also drag and drop sketch files the same way into

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:25.850
fig MMA,

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:31.150
and it will pull in your sketch files with all the designs ready to go,

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:35.130
it won't keep the prototype stitching that you didn't sketch.

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:39.690
But it will translate all of the designs you've done in Sketch in two fig Mahir.

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:44.300
Let's go with the cone boy Coin base Web dashboard.

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:46.290
That was the one we just downloaded.

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:50.050
And you can see I have the light themes here,

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:51.720
and I have the gooey kits.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.020
I can come into all of these.

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:53.390
Aiken,

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:58.450
select the graphic elements within this QE kid.

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:00.600
I can change them up a little bit.

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:01.850
It's a good starting point.

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:05.260
You're looking to start for basic design in this case,

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:05.900
um,

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.950
having a dashboard for coin base.

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:12.220
And it has both the light versions,

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:14.600
and it has the dark versions here.

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:15.960
A swell like you can see,

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:19.690
there's tons of gooey kits here,

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:20.090
um,

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:23.840
that you could go download online and check out and play with.

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.360
But that's how you do it here.

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.920
And they show up on your dashboard here,

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:29.660
like I have on the Web based,

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:30.990
uh,

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:34.260
coin coin base Web dashboard here you just saw.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:35.940
Okay,

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:36.830
cool.

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:39.260
So that's a rundown of,

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:39.810
um,

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:46.320
pretty much how to do keyboard shortcuts and how to use figure out plug ins and download Q

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.880
B kits in the last video will show.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.130
We'll see how to create comments,

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:53.020
symbols that will have some final thoughts and going forward.

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:53.660
Right?

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:54.680
See the last video.

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:55.570
Take care Bye.
