00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320
All right,

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:08.640
welcome back to the final video of how to build design a mobile application using fig,

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.510
my design tool.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.400
So at this point,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.920
we're going to go through how to create comments in the context of a design is pretty

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.910
simple and have some final thoughts and going forward.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.330
Let's go ahead,

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.190
and we're on the figment designed file that you downloaded.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.190
Let's go back to our learning Paige tab,

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.180
where we built out the prototype here,

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.750
and I'll show you how you and your cell,

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.890
you and your teammates other people can share comments based off the design that you're

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:37.750
seeing here.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:44.340
So let's go over here and let's create a couple comments.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.810
So if you see the top left the toolbar here the top left,

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.730
there's a little speaker bubble icon.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:51.930
Go ahead and click on that,

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.450
and that will show comments but also give you the ability to drop a comment.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.980
So let's go ahead and drop a comment.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:00.940
Let's say,

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:01.750
um,

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.800
let's drop a comment on the map here,

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:14.890
and I'm going to write Zoom out the map a little bit,

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:22.190
and I placed a comment there.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:30.280
And so it's nice as you can see that the comment is in context to the design element in

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.830
which I'm commenting about,

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.420
which makes it really easy to understand your teammates when they give you feedback on your

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.070
design at what they're referring to.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:51.140
You maybe go to this line here is like line up the line capacity and without the context.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.970
If you just read a comment that set up the line opacity,

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.420
you wouldn't know what this person was referring to.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.060
But since they have dropped this comment right on the line,

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.020
you have an idea of that that change.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.840
And again,

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.820
let's say that was a change we needed to make.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.640
That's why we have the component library.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:16.630
Here is all you have to do now is go grab this line and what's up their capacity to 40% now

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.630
.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.660
And let's go back to our learning Paige.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.950
And now every line on every single page has been updated,

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:23.880
um,

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:24.880
in that area.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.690
That's why we make those components.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.120
It makes it really easy to make changes like that that come in sometimes through the

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.740
commenting.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.110
Lets go back and say that I want to review my comments again.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.200
All you have to do is click on it and you'll see the comments on and where they exist.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.000
And you'll also see on the right here you'll see a list of you.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.330
Of all the comments that happened here once I've completed a comment or once I have

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.050
completed a comment,

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.580
I can click on the resolve here and that goes away.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.010
That's how you resolve a comment and go away.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.200
Another one I want to make here is Let's just do a test comment.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.590
Here is Aiken.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.880
Tag people by doing the at.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.610
And here's a list of people that I have in my project,

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.170
and Aiken tagged them with this comment.

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.250
So let's see fall.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.220
I can tag myself.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.460
Okay,

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.760
cool.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.680
And I'll go ahead and tag myself here.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.260
And this will notify me.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.590
I'll get an email that somebody has left a comment within my FIG MMA design file.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.460
And so I confined the comments here,

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.330
but I can also see him through email notifications,

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.350
which makes it easy to manage a lot of comments coming in.

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:31.130
Um,

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.610
so somebody leave me a comment,

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:33.440
I'll go in,

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.920
they tag me in it.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.870
I read the comment and I meant resolve or have a conversation with them.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.250
Such pretty much the essence of commenting and how comments work.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.230
You can see them again.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.140
Once you go away from the comment icon,

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.120
they disappear.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.360
So remember that your you won't be able to see them until you click on the comment icon

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.150
here at the top.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.900
That's toe ad and show comments.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.050
And then you can go around and click as many comments as you want to,

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.830
and we'll just final up.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.550
This button is awesome.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.040
Let's do a nice comment.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.860
Well,

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.330
do you like a little emoji here?

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:13.350
Like thumbs up?

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.450
Cool.

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.360
There you go,

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.130
Rights.

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.620
That's comments in a nutshell.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.150
Um,

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.710
and the last thing is just some final thoughts on going forward.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:24.670
So again,

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.170
there's lots more stuff we can cover in Fig MMA.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:32.750
I've covered mostly the basics prototype being and transitions within the prototypes and

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.650
how to design this mobile application here.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.670
I hope you got some value out of it.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.610
My final thought is just It takes practice.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.070
Just continually practice on it.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.620
We did a mobile application.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.020
If you want to do,

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.270
say,

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.360
a Web version,

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.880
I made a new page here.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.930
Call it Web go to your art board here and you can grab a desktop version here.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:59.060
Let's go ahead and do you like a Mac book and you can design out ah website as well.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.380
So that's not only just for mobile applications.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.390
You can do pretty much any screen size here and prototype any user experience that you go

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.850
for,

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.090
um,

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.550
and also going forward.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:15.880
Make sure to download the fig MMA mirror application on your mobile device if you're

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:21.310
especially if you're doing mobile user experiences on this allows you to see the mobile

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.520
screen designs directly on your phone so you can see how they would look on the phone.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.550
That's really important.

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.980
And if you want to stay connected with me,

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.720
you can go to my website.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.490
It's Aaron Lawrence design dot com,

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.490
and you can come here and see links to my work.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.950
You can contact me directly through the site here.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:48.480
You gonna contact very here on the bottom.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.510
You see some of my work and yet going forward,

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:53.420
I wish you the best.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.790
Um,

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.920
I hope this was valuable for you,

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:02.230
and I also have a couple more classes that you can check out on user experience design.

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:09.290
If you just search my name or find some of my videos by typing in you x slash ey design and

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:15.240
you'll see me on another class that further deep dives into the tyre UX process that's laid

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.370
out here where we go through gold,

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.120
make goal setting problems and assumptions We did.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.980
I teach you how to talk to users and customers had a synthesis,

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:31.170
synthesize and theme your insights that you learned you're looking for identification of

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:37.040
user needs and validations and in coming up with experiments to validate your hypothesis on

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:42.500
what you think will work or how you would solve a user need or a problem.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.290
And you'll create an interaction,

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:50.170
model or prototype and how to test that prototype and then how to collaborate with product

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:50.850
managers,

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:53.690
engineers and execute on the designs that you have,

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:59.570
and then a continuation of building and measuring and learning that process of launching

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:03.790
software and learning how to iterating and change to become successful.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:05.370
Okay,

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:05.490
well,

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:06.130
there you have it.

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.830
Thanks again and I hope you the best and I'll see you on the next class.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:10.140
Bye.
