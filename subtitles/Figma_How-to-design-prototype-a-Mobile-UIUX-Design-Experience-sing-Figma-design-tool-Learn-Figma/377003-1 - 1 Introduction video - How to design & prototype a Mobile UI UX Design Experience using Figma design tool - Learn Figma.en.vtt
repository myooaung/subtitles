And last but not least,

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:44.770
I have created a Fichman file for you to download and open within fig MMA that contains all

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:50.210
of the designs that you've seen within the Boba Tea ordering application.

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:56.830
Already there prototype Ready to go that you can use is a safety now or pick apart if you

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:03.700
like to and will use this design file to go step by step and recreate the prototype that we

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.100
saw earlier within the file.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.940
You also have all the assets that you seen ready to go.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.920
I have typed up all the quick keys and I have a list of my favorite plug ins that you could

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.440
use within Fig MMA.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.700
Also use that file to show you the in and outs of how toe work within fig MMA,

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.910
and it will make learning design and learning figure of fun in the sense that will go

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.380
through and create together rather than just a list of videos for you to watch and do on

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.970
your own.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.150
And you can walk along with me as we recreate this whole experience together.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:42.520
This course is great for anybody whose learning design and wants to learn how to prototype

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.920
a user experience or if you're a designer and you already know other tools and want to

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.970
