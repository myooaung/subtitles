X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.930
All right,

00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:02.100
welcome to the next class.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.620
So this is gonna be the fun series of videos where we get to design that mobile application

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:07.620
.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.550
The Boba tea ordering on demand app that you saw in the last video.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.820
And what we're gonna do is we're gonna start with,

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.250
log in and sign up workflow.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.190
And while we're doing that,

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:26.470
we'll learn how to create and use a component library and will also learn how to create and

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.350
share the clickable prototype as well.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.420
Let's go ahead and begin.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.170
Um,

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:41.850
what we're gonna do here is let's go over to the design goods here that you have and what

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.280
you want to do here is if you zoom out this art board here,

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.710
the one that says design goods don't click on the inside your does air clicking on elements

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.710
,

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.390
click on the art board itself.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.840
You can see here this design goods or I can click on the layer here on the left that says

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.850
design goods.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.650
And that's clicking on the entire art board.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.130
Go ahead and click that you can do a command,

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:06.310
see or control.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.730
See if you're on a PC.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:08.280
But command,

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.490
see,

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.450
for Mac or you can go to edit copy,

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:18.110
get over to the learning page here and go ahead and pace that.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:26.060
Copy that again and paste that here so you can see the all the elements that we're gonna

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.460
use for this.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.520
All right.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.380
And the pages that we're going to design here are the figure out of the final prototype

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.720
link.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.250
Here are this Siri's everything underneath this black bar that says sign up and log in.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.850
You can all see right here,

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.680
so don't copy these.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.250
Um,

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.500
I'm gonna bring over some of these elements here.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:55.440
Just so I remind myself what to show you as we continue our journey on building out this

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.210
application.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.850
All right,

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:59.120
let's go.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.910
The final prototype.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.700
I'm gonna show you real quick how this will look in the at the final version of this video

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.700
.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.050
We're gonna do a loading screen with the map.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.000
We're going to do the log in,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.470
sign up tabs just like this.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:20.250
And then we're gonna create these forms here and click on or tap on the email and name form

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.850
tap on the keyboard,

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.570
puts the email in,

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.040
click on the password,

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.590
opens up the password inputs you can't live type in fig.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.380
MMA doesn't have that functionality where I can,

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.510
like,

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.830
live,

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:35.470
type something.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.030
So you're you're sort of prototyping or mocking up what this experience will look like once

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.890
it's developed,

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.660
and then you could type on the keyboard.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.450
But most prototype tools don't have that functionality unless you're using real code.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.390
And so we'll get up to this point,

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.180
um,

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.370
and we'll go ahead and stop there.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.080
Okay,

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.560
so the first thing we're gonna do,

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.930
um,

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.050
that we're gonna learn is how to create an art board.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.950
So go ahead and get over to the learning page here,

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:10.440
and what you're gonna want to do is go to the top left.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.640
Here.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:11.830
There's this tool here,

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.090
which is called the frame.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.580
Click on the frame and you'll see on the right here works as designed.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.300
You'll have a whole list of,

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.050
um,

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.510
art board sizes that you can create easily within fig MMA.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.790
So it has phone has tablets here,

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:31.940
see of iPad.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.550
Mini iPad Pro has desktop.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.650
You're looking a design for a Mac book.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.350
MacBook Pro Surface book.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.590
An I Mac has watched templates here has paper,

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.910
has social media for this case you can.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.750
You can also just click and drag and make any type of art board size that you want.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.450
And you could manipulate the sizes with with and height here.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:01.120
So let's just say I want this art board to be 100 by 100 kind of a smaller art board from a

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.800
zoom in on that pretty simple again.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.950
You could just click here,

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.910
create the frame for our,

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:09.620
um,

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:10.790
any frame that you want.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.740
But for our purposes here,

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.570
I'm going to select these two are boards and delete it.

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.160
We're gonna use the iPhone X here.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.540
So we're gonna go to,

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:20.380
um,

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:28.490
the iPhone 11 pro X and just click on it and you can see it automatically added the art

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.850
board size affiliated to an iPhone X that you have.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:40.190
I can also move this our board around just by clicking on the top and dragging it.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.350
So I'm gonna go ahead and set it up here,

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.520
right?

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.370
And the first thing I want to do in this art board,

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.890
once I have it selected is I want to come over to the feel here,

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.170
and I want to click on the field and I'm gonna make this all black.

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.750
So drag this dot here,

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.700
all the way to the bottom rate.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.520
And what that did is that created the background of this to be black.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.750
You can change it any color if you want.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.870
We're going to use black for this setting.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.700
So this moment you've just learned how to create a man,

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.280
an art board that's specific to an iPhone 11 screen size.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.220
Or you can create any size art board that you would like.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.240
And then we learned how to grab that are bored Here,

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.670
you can see there's a layer,

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:27.470
um,

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.460
on our new art board over here,

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.900
layer.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.010
If you click into this layer,

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.860
we can name it.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.810
Let's go ahead and give this a name.

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:42.620
What say this is the loading screen and you can see here I can change the fill,

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:43.880
so I just click out of it.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.460
Click back into it.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.850
I can change the feel here.

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.390
All right.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:54.830
The next thing I want to show you is how to save or how to create a and save a color to

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.440
reuse throughout this experience.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.780
So we have black,

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.040
which is a hex color.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.980
Um we have it.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:08.160
000000 is the hex tone we're going to do here is we're gonna click on the little four dots

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.010
here that you see,

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:12.490
and we have a thing called color styles.

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:17.400
I already have some here labeled You may not have any right now,

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.100
and that's totally fine.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.140
We're gonna do this together.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.500
So go ahead and press the plus button here,

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.250
see where it says create style.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:29.090
And what that's going to do is gonna create a black color for us to reuse.

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:37.760
So let's call this black and go ahead and press the create style button about obeying bada

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.250
boom.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:45.000
And I have a black style here if I want at this black style,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.750
all I got to do is click on it.

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.650
If I click off into the art board here,

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:53.380
Um and I don't have anything selected on the design tab.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.110
It just shows me my dashboard,

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:57.840
which shows all of the styles,

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.790
including color and textiles.

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:02.420
You probably don't have textiles yet.

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:02.920
That's okay.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.400
We're gonna set these up together.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.100
So if I want to change the black here,

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.780
I just double click on the black right click on the black and then you'll see this little

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:12.750
setting here,

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:18.560
press the settings and I can change this black property and see how it changes already on

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.340
my art board.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.180
So wherever this black color lives,

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:22.820
I have many art boards.

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.860
I can change it in one place,

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.920
and it will change throughout all of the screens,

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.450
which I'll show you here in a minute.

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:32.450
Okay,

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:32.920
so,

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:33.480
um,

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.060
we now have our first screen with the black background.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:43.610
What we're gonna want to do here is to get over to the design good section and grab the

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:44.650
information.

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:49.750
It's the settings and battery and time that lives on your iPhone,

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:52.320
and you can see the tab here.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.300
I got this from the gooey kit.

00:07:54.300 --> 00:08:05.270
If you go to the design page here and you can see all these settings here for the status

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:05.850
bar,

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:07.020
um,

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:11.910
the settings percentage of battery time WiFi,

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:15.380
these all changed throughout your when you're using an iPhone.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.350
I usually just go with the time in the battery at the top,

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:23.080
and it makes it feel more like a riel live application that you're using,

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:28.780
which is the goal of these tools is toe mimic actual software even though it's just screen

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:34.650
designs which allows us to test and learn quickly on an illiterate quickly and then

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:40.670
eventually build out these application experiences with engineers with real code and

00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:44.210
eventually get an application to market and create businesses.

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:46.800
Okay,

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.760
so let's go back to our learning tab here.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.210
I've already created the one that will need.

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:54.730
So just if you click on it here and go ahead and do a command,

00:08:54.730 --> 00:09:00.440
see and go back to your art board here,

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.650
you can see I'm zooming in holding Z,

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:06.410
and then I'm using my space bar again to move around.

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:12.710
Somebody even even zoom in even tighter here with just holding Z clicking and dragging.

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:14.910
And I'm gonna pace this.

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:20.770
Somebody do a command V or you can go to edit paste up to you that pasted that.

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:21.100
Here.

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:24.160
I'm gonna put that into the top here,

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.460
just like this.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:28.350
That should be fine.

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:32.700
You may see this is already on the right.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:33.490
Selected.

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:35.510
It has the fixed position when scrolling,

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:37.680
make sure that box is checked.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:42.210
We don't We don't want this status bar moving around.

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:43.680
We wanted to keep it fixed.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:48.410
That always stays in that position at the top of your iPhones device.

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:52.150
I'm gonna zoom out by doing a command minus here.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:57.180
And the next thing we're gonna do here if you want.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:01.590
If you want to come back to the final prototype tab and just check on what we're what we're

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:02.300
building here.

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:03.090
Um,

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:05.480
we're building out this screen here.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.960
Has the map.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:13.670
Has the status bar has this cool icon this Boba tea has the Boba tea logo and it has this

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:15.490
loading text here.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:18.490
Let's go back to the learning page here.

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:21.600
Let's go grab this map Here.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.820
I have the one that's already been cropped and I'll show you,

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:26.430
um,

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:30.610
how to crop this if you want to get this section here.

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:33.920
So go ahead and grab the image to the left.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:34.390
Here,

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:37.690
you can see there's a crop I called at the top.

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:48.890
Go ahead and click on that and I can pull this in now and I can crop an image you can see

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:57.030
here I've cropped an image press return and it crops it press command Z or edit undo.

00:10:57.030 --> 00:11:02.150
And it goes back to the steps that I've done.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:04.550
If you go command shift.

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.880
See,

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.250
which is redo can see here.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:08.310
And thickness.

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:08.520
Nice.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:09.640
Because it has these,

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.860
Um it has the quick keys here,

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.270
next to your functions.

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:19.110
So as you get so used this it's best to start learning the quickies on.

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:20.700
And you can move through this pretty quick.

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.040
Somebody a command shift.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:23.450
See?

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:26.000
And I've cropped this down here.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.110
Now,

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:31.260
if I also want to move the image within this crop down,

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.250
I can go ahead and click on the crop tool again.

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:37.520
And just by clicking on the inside of my crop,

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.450
I can move this image around.

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:42.830
And if I want to also blow this image up a little bit,

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:45.270
I can grab the corners of this image,

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:46.400
and I can scale it.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.950
Usually when you're scaling,

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:50.760
it's best to hold shift so you don't,

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:51.580
um,

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:53.350
deform your image.

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:55.090
So if you hold shift,

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:57.480
it holds the perspective of your image.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:03.670
Some holding shift right now on dragging my mouse up and down and I'm downsizing and upside

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:03.670
.

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:05.900
He's I'm scaling my image.

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:09.020
All right.

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:12.300
The next thing here is you can see When I went into the crop tool,

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:15.850
it automatically opened up the image functions here,

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:19.050
So let me talk a little bit about that here in a second.

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:26.620
So if I go to the Phil here has the image on this box and I click on it,

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:29.060
you can see I'm in the crop area right now.

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:30.640
I can also change this.

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.910
I can fit the image to that square.

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:34.940
I can feel it.

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.570
So it feels the square.

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:37.510
So I scale it.

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:42.220
It's feeling that space I can tile it,

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.620
which I'd never really use,

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:45.350
but it will tile the image.

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:46.760
So if I scale it down like that,

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:49.750
you can see kind of cool all the tiling that's happening.

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:52.200
Style is kind of like your floor tile.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:52.410
You know,

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:54.180
it's taking ah section,

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:58.340
and it's copying it all the way vertically and horizontally.

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:08.440
I also have some engine image settings here.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.850
Allow me to add,

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:10.470
um,

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:12.000
the color within this image,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.050
and I can pull back the transparency a little bit here.

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:17.620
I never used these,

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:18.450
um,

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:22.030
so I usually tend to stay away from from these.

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:22.590
Um,

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:24.220
let's go ahead and go back.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:25.250
Um,

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:28.890
so if I went back and I wanted to fill this shape of the color,

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:29.340
you can see it,

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:31.460
Fill it with the color would go back to image here.

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:33.010
I always keep it on image.

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:35.560
I never really used tile that often either.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.220
Um,

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:44.510
I usually just set it up to have ah fit and we can go back to our crop if you wanted to

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:45.690
crop this guy again.

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:49.660
Une Zewe to change your images.

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:51.570
Here is if I click on this image,

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:53.140
see where it says choose image.

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:56.410
I can click and I can select another image.

00:13:56.410 --> 00:14:00.590
Let's just say for this case I'm gonna select one of my,

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:01.840
uh uh,

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.650
images here.

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:08.330
Let's go selectable bit t image like that and I have just swapped out this image.

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:09.470
But it's,

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:14.460
um it's being fit and cropped within that space so you can see it's interpolated the image

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:15.060
a little bit.

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:20.180
Okay,

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:23.190
some basic functions of images and cropping.

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:26.050
I'm just going back into the space that we have here.

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:29.260
But for the sake of the design,

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:35.890
let's go ahead and grab this image that I've already cropped and let's go paste it into

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:36.730
this art board.

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:39.070
So if I want to pay something into an art born again,

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:41.850
I clicked the top left which is the art board.

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:42.670
Ah,

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:43.140
Layer.

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:45.010
And I do a command V.

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:48.850
You can see you can go paste Here is well command V.

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:52.570
And there is the map.

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:55.530
Now I want to set this map.

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:56.130
Um,

00:14:56.130 --> 00:15:02.020
below the ah,

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:05.330
you could see it should be below the status bar here,

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:05.900
which it is.

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:11.290
I also want to set the transparency on it down a bit.

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:15.750
So you can see I'm gonna go ahead and move the transparency down.

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:18.990
Let's say about 20% here.

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:19.690
I'm just pressing.

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:20.650
Shift down,

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:22.050
shift up.

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:23.760
If you undo shift,

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:27.200
it gives you the actual ah,

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.070
increments.

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:30.050
And if you hold shift,

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:31.820
it gives you increments to the 10th.

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:33.790
So 2030 40 50.

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:34.280
60.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:35.670
Do 20 here.

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:36.850
That looks good.

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:39.550
Okay,

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:39.750
Now,

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:46.120
let's go grab the Boba tea logo here in all uhm pink.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:48.400
So I'm gonna grab that press command V.

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:52.100
I'm gonna go back over to my art board here.

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:56.520
I'm gonna paste it right into the center.

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.400
You can see it automatically align it,

00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.470
um,

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:03.870
horizontal vertically centered for me or horizontally centered.

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:06.850
And just around there does have to be perfect.

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:07.960
Just like that's fine.

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:14.240
Next thing I'm gonna add for this loading screen is I'm gonna come back over here.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.860
I'm gonna grab this.

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:18.680
Boba Tea illustration here.

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:19.440
Caught command.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:19.790
See?

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:20.950
Copy it.

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:23.500
Gonna pop over here,

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:27.000
and I'm gonna paste it right on top.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.200
Command V second copy is command C and Paste Command V.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:37.370
Next time we'll do is I'm gonna use the text tool.

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:43.780
So the tool here is at the top left That has the tea on it is the textile.

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:44.650
I'm gonna click on it.

00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:49.260
And this is how I can create typography in my application.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:50.840
So now I've clicked on it.

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:56.600
I'm gonna click and drag on the withs of my art board here just like this.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:04.010
And I'm gonna type in the word loading and we do three dots.

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:08.110
I'm also going toe change this,

00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:13.660
Phil here on the bottom toe white so you can see it's loading now.

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:17.330
And let's get into some text attributes,

00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:17.720
um,

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:22.600
and text functions that we can do right now by pressing the feel on the text here.

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:23.360
I can change this.

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:24.660
Any color that I want.

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:26.510
I have the color bar here.

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:31.380
I dragged this Aiken select colors and I can also make transparencies here,

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:37.520
all within this color setting and similar to the colors that ah,

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.680
are the,

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:39.270
um,

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:45.250
the squares that I showed you in the past video where you could make them Grady intel near

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:45.250
,

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:45.820
Um,

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:47.410
you can do that as well as text.

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:48.640
Although I wouldn't recommend it.

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.620
I don't typically put radiance and text.

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:52.110
Um,

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:55.820
most of your design serves communication.

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:56.640
So,

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:57.110
um,

00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:59.160
when your typography ah,

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:02.600
has Grady in Senate and makes a hard to read.

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:07.690
And the goal of typography is Teoh is to read it and help educate,

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:08.440
um,

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:12.020
the person using this application or giving them context.

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:12.810
So,

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:13.060
um,

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:13.350
again.

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:16.730
And don't use the linear Grady ants anything like that for your Texas.

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:17.350
You solid.

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:19.370
I'm gonna use white for now.

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:20.740
Now,

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:21.420
let's go ahead and say,

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:23.040
I want to blow this up a little bit.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.040
I want to make this text size bigger.

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.450
Somebody close.

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:34.790
The Phil here I don't have to do is select the text box that I have and see here where it

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:35.850
says 15.

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:38.550
I can start bumping that up.

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:43.940
Let's make it 18 and you can go down on it as well.

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:46.810
That's how you decrease and increase fonts,

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:48.020
font sizes,

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:50.770
this one below.

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:52.050
It is called letter spacing,

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:54.610
and that's the space in between the letters.

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:55.950
I want to up that a little bit.

00:18:55.950 --> 00:19:02.260
Let's do you like eight there a little bit easier to read when it's spaced out like that.

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:04.620
Okay,

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:06.840
And let's go ahead and set this,

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:07.460
um,

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:10.370
text here to have a transparency to its,

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:11.160
let's say,

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.760
50% transparent.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:14.600
Actually,

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:14.740
no,

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:17.480
it Let's keep it 100 and let's actually pick out.

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:18.980
Agree that we can use.

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:20.760
So whenever we use graze,

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:26.800
I typically like to put a little bit of blue coloring into my gray versus just gray.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:27.660
Um,

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:33.600
the blue coloring helps to add a little bit more modern tone to the application,

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.110
So I'm gonna pick.

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:35.650
Um,

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:38.200
any blue grey like this is fine.

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:40.500
Any blue will work to.

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:42.930
It can be like a cool blue or darker blue,

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:44.350
or even a teal blue if you want,

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:46.610
but just go with the normal blue.

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:50.600
Let's say that a little bit later.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:50.950
OK,

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:53.390
let's do that right.

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:53.910
At this point,

00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:55.260
I want to save this color,

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:57.620
so I want to re use this color.

00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:59.920
So how he did that before is.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:02.090
We click on the four dots here,

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:03.450
the menu for fills.

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:10.400
And we had that little plus here on a press plus And I'm gonna call this cool gray.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.950
You can give it any name that you want,

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:13.550
McCall Mind cool,

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:13.950
gray.

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:17.890
And I'm gonna create this style.

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:21.060
And now I can reuse this style any time I want.

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:22.890
You can see when I click on it,

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:24.580
it has the cool gray color.

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:26.620
If I don't want to use that color,

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:27.200
for example,

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.640
I wanted to try something else.

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:33.360
You click on this detach here and now it detaches it.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:36.090
And I can go back into the normal color setting that we had.

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:37.030
But I don't want to do that.

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:38.790
I just want to keep it as cool.

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:39.660
Grey for now.

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:42.460
All right,

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:42.800
great.

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.660
So we have the loading screen here.

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:52.490
I'm gonna go through my checklist to make sure I showed you everything we went through on

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:53.550
this screen alone.

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:55.440
What we learned was,

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:55.980
um,

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:57.860
some typography settings.

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:01.010
We learned some color how to use Grady INTs,

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:02.450
re sizing,

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:05.300
text and imaging cropping,

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.250
creating color styles.

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:07.890
Um,

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:09.520
and then we'll get into,

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:13.550
um creating some of the components on the next next green here,

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:19.220
I just The next screen we're gonna build out is if you click back on the final prototype

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:19.750
here,

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:20.550
I'll show you.

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:22.660
Is this Boba?

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:26.160
Sign up and log in screen here.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:29.850
Let's go back to our learning Paige here.

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:30.430
All right,

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:32.370
So now we already haven't aren't board.

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:36.210
You can see here that has the black background and some,

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:36.670
um,

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:39.150
and the status bar here a swell.

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:45.500
Instead of creating a another new art board by using the frame tool here,

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:48.890
What we actually want to do is we just want to copy this art board.

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:53.880
So there's a couple ways that we can copy this I can click on the top here.

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:59.150
You can see when you click on the art board at highlights blue versus anything that I am.

00:21:59.150 --> 00:21:59.680
Ah,

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:03.010
want to click on and select within the art board itself.

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:03.590
But in this case,

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:05.450
we want to select the entire our board.

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:06.710
2nd 2nd click,

00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:07.430
I can move on,

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:09.110
move and dragged that our report around.

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:12.170
But I want to copy it so one day I can do is I can do a command,

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:12.570
see,

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:15.880
and I can do a Command V.

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:22.100
And it copies the art board automatically for me and places it right to the right of that,

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:22.790
um,

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:24.530
our board to the left.

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:24.890
Here,

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:29.970
you can see another way I could do this is I can click on the art board,

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:33.430
Hold option till I get the double arrow.

00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:40.000
You can see here the double arrow click and drag it to the right and then let go.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.050
And when I let go,

00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:42.490
I've copied that as well.

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:43.760
So one more time on that one.

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:47.200
I click and hold option until I get the double arrow.

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.700
And when I hold shift,

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:52.090
it keeps this aligned so I can't move.

00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:53.770
You can send moving my mouse up and down,

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:59.730
but I won't let me remove this art board from the alignment where if I undo shift,

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:04.420
I can move it around as much as I want to someone ahold shift because you want your our

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:05.110
boards online.

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:06.940
Do you want to have a clean organized,

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:07.500
um,

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:08.260
layout?

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:09.580
Right,

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:11.470
So now I have the new loading screen.

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:12.700
Let's call this loading.

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:14.810
Let's call this the log in screen here,

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:18.540
so if you just double click over on the layer and you do,

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:19.310
You log in.

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:21.400
Well,

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:27.310
you log in and sign up because it's both All right,

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:27.670
Cool.

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:28.480
So this point,

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.540
let's start removing some things.

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:34.050
So let's remove the boba tea.

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:35.320
Let's remove the map.

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:36.660
I'm going to keep this.

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:37.400
Um,

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:45.540
this loading actually would delete it to start fresh.

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:46.990
Okay,

00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:47.360
Cool.

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:57.070
So let's go ahead and grab the logo that we have here that has the white and see here and

00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:57.730
do a command.

00:23:57.730 --> 00:23:58.160
See?

00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:58.920
Copy it.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:12.240
I'm gonna It's pan over to the other art board that I have here and do a command v All

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:12.410
right.

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:13.160
Just like so.

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:18.480
And the next thing I want to do is I want to grab the text tool here,

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:23.190
and I want to create the sign up and the log in tabs.

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:25.350
So I clicked the textile here.

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:27.460
I'm gonna click and drag to somewhere.

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:28.390
The middle's fine.

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:32.680
I'm gonna type sign up.

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:36.310
I'm gonna do it all caps I just typed with my cap blocks on.

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:42.830
Make this white and you can easily change text here by doing.

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:51.150
You can change the all caps of text here with the text menu at the top by going to original

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:51.510
case,

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:54.640
you can do lower case here or upper case as well.

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:55.500
I want to keep my number.

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:55.940
Case.

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:58.120
All right,

00:24:58.120 --> 00:24:58.330
cool.

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:06.000
So we have signed up here and what I have it is set at Roboto Bold 19 points.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:13.360
Let's go ahead and create this as a character style that we can use and reuse throughout

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:14.550
this application.

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:18.020
So how to do that is similar to how we created the color style.

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:23.630
See a little four dots here on the right in this text dialog box.

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:30.180
I'm going to click on it and already have some textiles and character styles already

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:31.200
created here.

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.760
You may not see him,

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:33.450
um,

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:39.800
but what you could do here is create a new one and let's just call this.

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.660
Sometimes I just name them what they are.

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:49.190
This is a 19 point or pixel height on the right point,

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:51.620
and it's bold.

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:53.660
There you go.

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:56.530
Now why that's helpful is,

00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:58.480
let's say I use the text tool again.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:01.770
The quick Etem command to use to grab the text tool.

00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:02.350
Pretty simple,

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:04.610
his tea and you can see when you hover over it.

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:05.780
It gives you the quickie.

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:07.230
Some of Presti.

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:09.660
If I just type anything again.

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:13.140
So let's say I'm gonna do this outside the art board here.

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:15.280
So I do the text here,

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.410
and I just type in one.

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:25.070
If I create men,

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:25.970
turn this,

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:26.600
um,

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.260
toe lower case as well.

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:31.930
All right.

00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:41.300
And if I select this font and I go into the text here and I grab that attributes that we

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:44.160
created the character style say 19 point bold,

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.550
it's automatically setting up that character,

00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:50.180
and I can change it to white.

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:58.910
And I have the same font size and character and textile as the one that I've created here

00:26:58.910 --> 00:26:59.060
for.

00:26:59.060 --> 00:26:59.760
Sign up.

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:03.660
Right.

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:06.110
So what I'm gonna do is copy this sign up here.

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:07.350
I'm gonna hold option,

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:09.590
click and drag to the right,

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:14.900
and you can see and tell those to meet right in the center.

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:16.110
You can see right there,

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:18.910
and it will snap those that binding box.

00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:25.760
That text box for sign up that I just copied will snap to the the one original one that I

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:26.710
copied from.

00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:33.140
I'm gonna grab both of those and I'm gonna just use my arrow key on my keyboard and just

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:37.880
move those to the left a little bit just so they're both aligned and you can see they're

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:39.210
both centered on the page.

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:41.110
At this point,

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:42.850
I'm gonna type in law again.

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:53.260
And now I'm gonna break this style and make its from the character textile dialog box here

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:58.170
and make it a regular actual.

00:27:58.170 --> 00:27:58.530
Let's Yeah,

00:27:58.530 --> 00:27:59.410
let's make it regular.

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:06.660
I'm also going to change it to about 40% opacity here,

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:08.340
so you can see that.

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:11.850
So one more time I've grabbed the log in.

00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:17.110
I've detached it from the textile that we've had sings to the detached style.

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:17.960
Now,

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:20.000
this allows me to do any fault that I want.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.280
You want to choose other fonts,

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:23.530
you can come in and selective her fonts,

00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:25.500
but we're using Roboto for this case,

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:28.510
and I'm gonna change it to a regular.

00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:31.320
You can even do light if you wanted to.

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.010
Let's go with light.

00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:38.700
I'm going to remove the opacity down to 40.

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:42.260
Maybe do 50.

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:42.760
Now,

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:44.260
that looks good.

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:49.350
Okay,

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:52.750
Next thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna grab the rectangle tool.

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:54.660
So I've got in the top left here,

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:58.010
and I'm going to create a little line.

00:28:58.010 --> 00:29:00.400
So what I did was I grabbed the rectangle tool.

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:09.030
I zoomed in a little bit and I've clicked and dragged and I made a little line here where I

00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:11.570
rectangle here real thin.

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:17.580
Now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna change this color to be this pink.

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:19.420
So what I could do is I want ah,

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:21.980
color that I'm viewing already in my design,

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:25.850
I can try to select it over here trying to match it.

00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:31.740
You can also just grab the eyedropper here and hover over any color you want and click on

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:31.940
it.

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:36.180
And it will automatically make this color for you Another way.

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:42.420
You can add the color here is I can click on this element I can copy and pace.

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:45.160
It's hex value over here command.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:45.580
See,

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:51.950
I can click on this new rectangle that I've created and I can command v press return on the

00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:52.580
keyboard,

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:54.170
and I have the same color.

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:59.160
The way I like to do this is let's let's go ahead and create a color style.

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:04.860
So now that I have the car that I'm going to reuse and this is gonna be an action color,

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:06.600
So this is the color that are buttons.

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:11.510
They're going to be mostly anything that's clickable in the application we want to create

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:13.550
with this primary action color.

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:15.630
So now I have the color.

00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:19.480
I'm gonna go ahead and click on our creates style here,

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:22.570
and C already had one created It's created it again.

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:31.430
I'm gonna call this primary action color.

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:41.000
I'm going to create that one there so you can see this new color that we have here on the

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:41.710
second line.

00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:44.110
Okay,

00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:44.350
cool.

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:48.200
So now we have the sign up and the log in going.

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:50.980
Let's go back to the final prototype here.

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:54.580
Let's go look at the sign up.

00:30:54.580 --> 00:31:00.450
So we had first name last name email password here.

00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:04.710
And this is where we're going to get into the creation of some components here,

00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:07.950
which this is a really important piece toe check out.

00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:10.250
Let's go create these form fields.

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:11.950
Let's go back to our learning here.

00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:17.970
And what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna use the line tool,

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:20.280
So I'm gonna go where I can select the rectangle.

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.220
Just click on it.

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:22.560
You see the drop down?

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:24.270
You see the line tool?

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:26.200
I'm just gonna make a line,

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.410
not edge to edge,

00:31:27.410 --> 00:31:31.530
just kind of within some boundaries.

00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:31.940
here.

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:34.630
Give it some space on the left and the right to the art board.

00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:36.110
If I hold shift,

00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:37.620
it will give me a straight line.

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:39.180
If I do not hold shift,

00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:40.630
you can see it gives crooked lines.

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:42.490
We want a really straight line here,

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:46.400
and I'm gonna go ahead and make this,

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:46.800
um,

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:47.160
white.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:51.390
So let's go ahead and grab white and again,

00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:53.320
I'm gonna make white ah,

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:56.450
color attribute that I could reuse and re select.

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:57.560
So let's just call this white.

00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:59.960
Makes it really easy for me to select this,

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:02.220
right?

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:03.860
So now I have White is a style.

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:05.850
It's too strong for right now.

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:06.910
As far as the color goes,

00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:08.820
let's pull this back in transparency.

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:11.760
Let's make this like 20% here.

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:15.550
All right,

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:18.450
20%.

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:21.850
What's pretty good?

00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:25.850
So now you're getting the hang of it.

00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:26.290
Um,

00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:28.610
I'll tend to slow down a little bit,

00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:28.830
too,

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:29.560
as we go.

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:30.230
Um,

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:36.790
hopefully I'm at the right pace for you to follow along when if you have to pause and kind

00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:38.980
of do it for yourself and come back and press play,

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:39.450
that's fine,

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:39.770
too.

00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:43.460
It's the next thing I want to do.

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:46.690
Here is I'm gonna just copy over this.

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:47.620
Sign up here.

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:49.150
Images click and drag.

00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:50.760
Hold option.

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:56.780
Copy it over like that and see how it's centered.

00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:59.060
Meaning it has a centered paragraph setting.

00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:01.370
Where if I pull this box,

00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:04.100
it's gonna center the text within it.

00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:06.320
I want I left a line.

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:07.890
This so not senator line,

00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:08.760
but left the line.

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:13.220
And how I do that here is you can see the alignment tabs on the right.

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:14.790
If I do the right one,

00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:16.900
it right aligns their center.

00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:18.400
We want left a line.

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:19.240
Yeah,

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:20.100
just like that.

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:20.850
That looks good.

00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:26.860
And let's title this your first name,

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:27.710
all caps.

00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:33.750
I'm gonna center.

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:36.590
I'm gonna decrease the height on a little bit.

00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:42.330
Okay,

00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:43.700
that looks that looks good.

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:45.270
All right,

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:48.450
so now we're gonna we're gonna actually create a component.

00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:50.870
So this is,

00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:51.320
um,

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:58.690
an important piece of how to make designing multiple art boards and applications.

00:33:58.690 --> 00:33:59.520
Um,

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:04.160
really easy and efficient when you want to make changes across more than one art board.

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:06.880
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna copy this,

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:08.160
uh,

00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:13.830
name the text field here and this line when a copy it,

00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:18.980
man C and I'm gonna come over to my page that I created here called Component Library.

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:21.050
And let's go over there.

00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:27.260
I'm gonna paste it here.

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:33.050
You can see you have the first name in the line here.

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:33.980
Now,

00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:34.520
I'm gonna call.

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:38.160
This would go back in where I typed in first name,

00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:40.120
and I'm gonna call it title.

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:46.180
Make sure your text box two scales.

00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:49.280
The fool with you don't want your text box like that.

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:50.200
Um,

00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:53.350
that Why do you want the full with of the line that we have here?

00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:55.190
Okay,

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:57.680
so I'm gonna select the line and the title.

00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:59.790
And here's how we create a component.

00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:04.250
You see this little diamond shaped icon at the top?

00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:05.920
Go ahead and click on that,

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:08.790
and you can see knife selected.

00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:14.800
It's changed the selection from a blue you see here to a purple.

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:18.460
That means that this is the master component now,

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:22.350
So we want to change this name to form.

00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:25.600
We're gonna call it form default.

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:30.290
All right,

00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:34.530
So what we're gonna have is we're gonna have this page that's called Component Library on

00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:35.080
the left,

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:40.900
and that's gonna house all of our components that we're gonna use throughout this design

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:42.160
that we're creating here.

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.780
Okay,

00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:46.370
so I have the component library.

00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:48.440
We have created our first component.

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:50.350
You can see here form default.

00:35:50.350 --> 00:35:52.660
Let's go use this component.

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:58.460
So now I'm on this back to our learning Paige layer here.

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:00.340
If I goto assets,

00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:01.740
you can see a happy here,

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:06.040
and I click and drag this component into my art board.

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:11.740
And you see how it has a purple selection and not a blue selection,

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:13.990
because the purple is my component.

00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:20.440
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna delete the first name that we've created,

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:22.740
and I'm gonna replace it with the component.

00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:24.300
So that's pretty common.

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:27.340
What you do is you you create a u I element,

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:31.710
and when you should create a component is whenever you copy something.

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:34.360
So if I want to copy this and say,

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:34.660
Now,

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:38.250
make a last name at that point,

00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:41.530
I shouldn't have copied this component or this,

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:42.150
um,

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:48.090
this you I form filled here and duplicated it and changed the name.

00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:49.020
At that point,

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:52.600
I should have created a component and started to use components.

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:57.260
So what you don't want to have is you don't want to end up with a whole bunch of forms like

00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:59.730
this that are all individual,

00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:03.100
that you can't change from a master view.

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:05.870
And I'll show you how to do that here in a second.

00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:14.190
So let's go back home in a command Z go back some and again,

00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:16.100
Fig must saving this the whole time.

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:18.960
I could go file and I could say,

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:19.740
um you see,

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:21.040
there's no save here.

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:23.560
I can do a command s,

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.590
which is the shortcut for save,

00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:27.010
and you'll see here.

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:28.120
It says figure fig,

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:31.010
MMA auto saves your work and gives me a little peace sign.

00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:33.350
And they always put different.

00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:33.850
Um,

00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:37.350
I call it like little ah emojis in.

00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:38.470
Whenever you do a command,

00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:38.720
see,

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:39.170
they just like,

00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:41.120
randomly put whatever emotion they want.

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:41.830
We're just nice.

00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:44.330
So they're just letting you know you don't even save your work anymore.

00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:46.040
Like it just automatically saves it for you.

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:47.680
Okay,

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:49.500
so now I have my component again.

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:53.980
What I how I access that was I moved from my layers here to my assets,

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:58.490
and I clicked and dragged my component onto the art board just like so.

00:37:58.490 --> 00:38:04.420
And I want to replace this first name you.

00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:07.380
Why that I've done with the component here,

00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:12.050
and I'm gonna click into this component,

00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:16.440
and I'm gonna change the name title back to first name.

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:21.720
All right,

00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:28.130
so now we have a component when he made that lives in this component library and we have an

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:35.190
instance meaning a child representation of that master component living on this art board

00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:35.690
here.

00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:40.090
So now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna copy this component,

00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:45.140
and now I'm gonna create more instances up it,

00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:47.520
and I'll show you why.

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:53.560
It's important that we stopped and made a component before we copied the original text and

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:55.360
line that we created earlier.

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:57.520
So now that we have first name,

00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:59.530
I'm gonna change this toe last name,

00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:05.240
Do that as well to be a second.

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:15.260
All right.

00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:20.860
And we're gonna copy this again and you can see it's giving me spacing increments here.

00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:24.530
Soc at said 12 There 18.

00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:31.870
It's helping me automatically distribute equal spacing when you hold when you copy that way

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:31.870
.

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:37.390
So when I click and drag and hold shift down that's why I like to copy that way.

00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:38.130
So again,

00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:44.840
if I hold option and I click and drag and I hold shift it keeps it aligned.

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:46.120
And it also helps me.

00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:46.570
No.

00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:46.750
Oh,

00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:52.290
this is 18 pixel spacing from the last component there at the top.

00:39:52.290 --> 00:39:54.260
And that's equal distribution.

00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:55.080
That's what I want.

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:55.830
Great.

00:39:55.830 --> 00:39:59.710
So let's go ahead and call this one email.

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:06.820
And the last one that we had here was password.

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:11.700
All right,

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:12.690
Now watch this.

00:40:12.690 --> 00:40:15.680
This is why it's really important that we made a component.

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:21.360
Let's say that I'm talking to my client or another designer,

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:22.600
and they're like,

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:22.850
Hey,

00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:23.320
you know what?

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:27.630
It's better that we make all this first name text here pink.

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:29.540
I'm like,

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:29.930
OK,

00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:30.510
I you know,

00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:32.850
I'm gonna go ahead and give you that example or go,

00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:34.360
go ahead and change it something.

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:34.580
All right,

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:36.740
let's go ahead and changed all of these two pink.

00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:37.950
In the old days,

00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:42.950
we had a click on one of these here and change each one pink,

00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:46.240
so I had to click and then select first name and changing pink.

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:48.290
Then I have to go back to last name and change a pink,

00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:51.930
and then I have to go to email and change a pink than 30 password and change of pink.

00:40:51.930 --> 00:40:54.420
But when we when we think about setting up?

00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:56.450
Are you y and components like this?

00:40:56.450 --> 00:41:00.500
What I can do now is I can go to my component library over here.

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:03.030
And this is that master component that I created.

00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:04.740
So all the masters live here.

00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:11.190
So I changed this text color here to the pink that we made here like that,

00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:13.830
and I go back to my learning Paige,

00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:14.360
watch.

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:17.130
All of them already changed for me.

00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:20.540
So that's the beauty of why we set components up.

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:26.860
And why we reuse components is it makes editing a component really easy because you do it

00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:28.030
in one area,

00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:33.630
the master component here and you see all of them changed throughout your art boards.

00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:35.550
And let's just say you had many,

00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:37.390
many different art boards like this.

00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:40.460
Imagine having to change all of those.

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:43.450
Okay,

00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:44.820
I'm gonna go back to my component.

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:46.320
I don't want to change it back to pink.

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:47.640
Are just giving that example.

00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:49.800
I want to go back and change this into white,

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:50.950
just like we had before.

00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:51.900
Okay,

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:52.160
cool.

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:56.230
So now we have the sign up page looking pretty good.

00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:57.170
Um,

00:41:57.170 --> 00:41:59.480
all we need to do is add this little,

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:00.730
um eyeball,

00:42:00.730 --> 00:42:05.970
which will show your password if you're typing this or,

00:42:05.970 --> 00:42:06.530
um,

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:10.420
it will also disguise the password as well and the sign up button,

00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:12.610
so I'll show you how to do that.

00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:16.430
All right,

00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:19.470
so let's go create a button pretty easy and simple.

00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:24.720
Just grab a square and let's go ahead and make a square here.

00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:26.180
Any size is fine.

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:27.130
I'm gonna use mine.

00:42:27.130 --> 00:42:28.070
Like I don't know.

00:42:28.070 --> 00:42:33.220
Let's say 200 by snow would say 50.

00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:34.220
No.

00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:34.390
Well,

00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:36.170
this 60 should be fine.

00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:38.310
All right,

00:42:38.310 --> 00:42:39.640
So I have a button here,

00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:43.980
and I'm gonna go ahead and round out all the corners,

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:48.210
so I'm gonna just type in 100 where it says rounded edges.

00:42:48.210 --> 00:42:53.640
And that gives me that pill button here where it has the rounded left and right corners.

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:56.000
You can see fig MMA already,

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:56.360
Um,

00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:58.760
helps me center this button on the art board,

00:42:58.760 --> 00:42:59.670
which is really great.

00:42:59.670 --> 00:43:05.010
And the next thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna grab a text tool here,

00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:08.120
and I'm gonna click within this button,

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:10.100
click and drag,

00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:12.960
and I'm gonna add some text here.

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:19.620
I'm gonna call it sign up and again.

00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:23.580
I want this centered so back to our character,

00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:24.030
um,

00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:25.470
dialog box here,

00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:27.040
press centered,

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:31.170
and we have it centered there.

00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:33.510
I'm gonna change the color here.

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:37.290
I'll give you a second and change the color toe.

00:43:37.290 --> 00:43:40.760
White could see it now.

00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:51.210
And if I want to access,

00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:51.910
um,

00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:57.410
the rectangle underneath it underneath the text.

00:43:57.410 --> 00:44:02.230
I can use the layers on the panel on the left here so I can see I have the sign up selected

00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:02.230
.

00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:05.210
I want to go grab the rectangle underneath it.

00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:08.040
Go grab it here.

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:13.480
If I was also struggling to get that rectangle selected,

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:19.600
I could also lock something so I can right click on the sign up and do you lock.

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:21.760
And now I have locked the sign up.

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:22.860
So now if I click there,

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:24.670
I'm actually selecting the rectangle.

00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:26.140
You can see some change in the color.

00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:31.160
I'm gonna get command C Command Z back that I don't want to walk that text there.

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:31.940
But just so you know,

00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:33.300
you can lock things here.

00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:36.100
Um,

00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:37.570
whenever I select a layer,

00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:38.700
I can also hide it.

00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:42.210
So let's say I just I pressed the eyeball icon here.

00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:44.590
It hides it as well.

00:44:44.590 --> 00:44:50.210
And you can see by having the lock icon next to sign up that I still have it locked so I

00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:51.080
can unlock it.

00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:52.690
And I can do that with every layer.

00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:53.250
Aiken,

00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:57.320
remove the background rectangle like unlock it just by the layer.

00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:57.850
Panelas.

00:44:57.850 --> 00:44:58.110
Well,

00:44:58.110 --> 00:44:59.600
so there's a couple of ways you can do that.

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:02.510
Let's go ahead and select the rectangle.

00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:07.120
And let's make this the action pink that we had before.

00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:09.260
And we're looking good.

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:12.350
Okay,

00:45:12.350 --> 00:45:17.390
So one thing that we're going to do here is we're gonna probably reuse this button a couple

00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:18.000
times,

00:45:18.000
