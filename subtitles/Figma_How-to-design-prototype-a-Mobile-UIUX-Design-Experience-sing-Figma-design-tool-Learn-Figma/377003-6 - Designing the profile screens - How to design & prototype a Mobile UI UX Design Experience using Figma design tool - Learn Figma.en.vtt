00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.850
All right.

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:07.370
Welcome to the fifth video of how to build a mobile application using fig MMA designed toe

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.160
in this video,

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.730
we're gonna cover the ah profile workflow.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.640
So we've already created the log in,

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.960
Sign up shopping,

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.430
check out all awesome stuff and we'll have the video here which be the last video of us

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:23.740
designing together.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.770
Um will wrap up with the profile,

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:27.490
um,

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.450
tab that we built out earlier.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:35.420
We'll also have another series of videos going forward just to talk about other ways that

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.810
you use Fig Mahato.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:42.820
Invite people into your design and collaborate with them how to export assets,

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.810
Uhm and letting engineers inspect your design for code attributes.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.130
We'll talk about fig,

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.580
MMA keyboard shortcuts.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.450
I'll show you some figment plug ins and how to get gooey kits online.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:59.050
And then how to create comments and I have some final thoughts and going forward.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.120
Okay,

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.540
so let's go back into our file here and again.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.800
The screen that we're gonna be building out today is this screen here,

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.860
which is once you get once you tap on the tab,

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.660
are where the profile is.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:26.770
It takes you to the profile screen here I can switch between orders and profile,

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.490
see a picture of my Well,

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.360
it's not really me,

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.450
but some track down online,

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.190
and it has some some my profile information I could edit.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.650
This information can add a photo I can log out as well.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.210
Okay,

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.850
so let's go back into our file here and let's get over to where we left off last,

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:49.830
which,

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:50.340
um,

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.630
was be finished up the check out experience.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:00.500
We have a pretty full fledge prototype for a boba delivery user experience.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.220
Um,

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.090
but let's go ahead and grab the final pieces of this.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.010
So let's grab the,

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.830
um,

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.620
sign up page here and let's copy that command.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.050
See,

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:19.350
let's take that over here to the final edge.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.960
And let's pace that over here.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.180
Give a little bit of spacing,

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.670
and let's rename this as our profile screen.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.640
So again,

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.750
I just selected this screen here,

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.290
and I typed,

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.270
I double clicked on the layer on the left and I press profile,

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.410
which,

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.690
hopefully,

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:40.190
at this point,

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.050
you're getting the hang of copying art boards and renaming them on the left.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:54.920
Another thing I need from this is I'm gonna need this tab are from the shopping screen here

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.920
.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.470
So let's go ahead and select that command.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.950
See,

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:07.220
and let's go ahead and pace that into this profile screen that we have command V and that

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.390
will paste in place.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.710
Let's remove all of the form,

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:12.230
fields,

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.530
the buttons there,

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:20.460
what's remove this logo and let's grab these two tabs and just move them up just a little

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.420
bit about about their okay.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.090
So at this point,

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:32.410
we want to make the active state of this be the profile icon and go back to a default state

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.760
for this Boba tea illustration.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.920
So let's grab the profile icon here.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.240
Let's go to feel we have it already set at White.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.650
Let's make the opacity 100%.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.600
All right,

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.010
cool.

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.160
Next thing we need to do is we need to grab this Boba tea illustration here and what's go

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.270
ahead and just add a feel to it.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.350
What's making all white that defaulted toe white?

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.480
And let's go ahead and make this a 40% opacity,

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.610
actually,

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:10.450
30%.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.850
There you go.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:18.860
Now it's very clear to the user that they're on the profile tap after they tapped on it,

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.300
and that these are default States.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:22.950
And this is the active state.

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.730
So let's go change the sign up and the log in text.

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:28.140
Let's call,

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:35.120
sign up profile and let's call the log in here.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.950
Orders.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:42.510
All right.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.950
Pretty pretty simple.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.920
Okay,

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:51.880
now what we're gonna do here is let's make the space for the photo of that person,

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.250
so just grab the circle here.

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.100
Quickie is also zero,

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.490
and let's make a little circle here.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.390
Okay?

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.500
So I'm gonna have a video in the next series.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.030
Um,

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.480
about 21 or two ahead to talk about figment plug ins.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.840
But you can also get some plug ins right now.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.240
And I want to show you one that I use all the time.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.360
It's called content,

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.830
riel.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:24.120
And how to get to that plug in is if you go back to your dashboard,

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.470
clicking on the four boxes here in the top left takes you back to this screen.

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.230
I remember this is where you can create files.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.300
This is also where you add people,

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.090
which I'll show you in the next video.

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.600
At this point,

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.340
you're on the drafts here.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.450
This is where you can create as many of these art boards as you want.

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.110
If you go to the plug in here,

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.480
you'll see all the plug ins that you can use,

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.530
and you can see this one here.

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.820
It's called Popular to Call Content Riel.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.760
If you click on content riel,

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.150
you can also search for it and press install.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.320
It will install it in your fig MMA,

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.740
all free for you.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:09.000
So why don't you go ahead and install that plug in?

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.750
I'll give you a second.

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.220
It's pretty quick,

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:15.490
too.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.520
Like all uninstall this and install it goes pretty fast.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.350
Go back to my drafts,

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:23.890
and then if you want to get back to your ah class file,

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:25.240
just triple click on that.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.380
We're back at the same thing that we're at.

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:28.600
Okay,

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:34.350
What's really cool about this plug in is I want to fill this with an image this circle.

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:36.890
So at the top here in our menu,

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:38.190
we have plug ins.

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:41.750
Click on the plug in and the one that we just added content.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:42.100
Riel.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.150
Go grab content riel,

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:49.650
and we want to avatar here.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:51.650
So let's go click on the avatars,

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.710
and we could put male,

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:55.800
female or both.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.660
Some put males.

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:01.740
Just click on males and it will pre populate this with any mail that you want.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:02.710
You can click on it again,

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:03.600
and at another one,

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.850
I could just go through it ad as much content as I want.

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:08.790
Pretty pretty cool.

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:12.710
I can also just take text like Let's grab this profile text here.

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.060
You just watch me.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.850
I'll give me names,

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:16.920
phone numbers,

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.190
addresses,

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:19.160
numbers,

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:19.850
dates.

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:24.750
Laura Epsom e mails you RL's,

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:28.230
um so it will pre populate this stuff for me.

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:30.970
So I don't just think of it and type it all up just pretty cool.

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:32.810
All right,

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:33.730
so let me change.

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:34.920
I'm gonna change one more time,

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.960
will grab this.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.800
Grabbed another avatar.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.370
All right,

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:40.600
let's get that guy like that guy.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.120
Okay,

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:42.920
so at this point,

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.860
we have their profile image.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:48.100
And now let's go add the name.

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.840
So it's just copy up this profile text here.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:55.930
Click and drag and hold shift while a and option while you click and drag.

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:56.780
Let's copy it.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.830
It's at a centered lay out.

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:01.500
We want it left a line for right now,

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.450
so it's left online.

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:04.950
It Let's center in a little bit.

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:09.170
And this was the 19 point system.

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:14.030
Let's go back to a think we had 16 regular.

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:14.780
That's perfect.

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:21.980
Let's go grab 16 here and I'm gonna stretch out this text and I'm gonna go back to text

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:23.620
alignment not being centred,

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:24.690
but at the top,

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:25.500
just like that.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:31.740
And I'm a type in my profile information that I used when I signed up.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.040
So it was my name.

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.020
Aaron Lawrence.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.420
You can type yours if you want.

00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:49.420
We had test at gmail dot com and let's go break up Aaron Lawrence into two lines in case

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.500
people have long names here.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:57.050
And let's go ahead and make this the cool gray color here.

00:08:57.050 --> 00:09:00.930
All right,

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:01.640
that's looking cool.

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.380
Let's had a little bit more visual flair.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:04.800
Let's grab a rectangle.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:10.600
You can just do our or you can go to the shape tool here and let's put a rectangle behind

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:11.520
all of this.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.940
So here's my rectangle.

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:21.390
I'm gonna grab it from the layers panel on the left and just click and drag it and move it

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:26.270
behind everything and let's go ahead and change this up.

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:28.750
Let's make it that cool gray color that we had,

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:39.870
and then let's make the opacity on it very low Let's do like That's okay.

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:41.420
Let's actually do another color here.

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:42.550
What's detached that?

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:51.600
Let's go do Let's go do a white and just take it down a 10.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:10:00.730
That still isn't working for me.

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:05.100
Sometimes the visual design You guy kind of go a couple routes.

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:05.770
Um,

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:06.930
so let's grab us.

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:07.060
Ah,

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:08.050
blue color.

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:08.920
There you go.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.040
Now we're getting somewhere.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.440
It should be just very subtle.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:14.790
I'm gonna up the opacity a little bit.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:31.000
You have 35% and we're gonna use something in the middle.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:31.820
Will go about their,

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:32.700
um,

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:37.300
to 54 56 b as a color.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:40.010
It's a background color.

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:44.260
Let's give a stroke to this,

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:44.880
um,

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.320
at this profile image.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.900
So it's at a stroke here.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:48.990
Well,

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:51.630
I'm gonna go with White for right now that I'm a tone it back.

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:52.460
But let's make it,

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:52.930
like,

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:53.750
real thick.

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:54.950
Okay?

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:56.700
I think that I think why it should be Okay.

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.860
Okay,

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:01.480
So now this Texas A looking a little bit small.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.550
Um,

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:04.150
So let's go back and make it white.

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:11.950
Let's give it some more visual hierarchy and let's make it to the 19 point Bold.

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:13.060
Yeah,

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:13.510
like that.

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:14.250
Let's go bold.

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:15.540
Okay,

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:16.480
that's looking good now,

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.130
right?

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:26.110
So next thing to do here is let's go add the function to add a photo.

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:27.500
We won't prototype it up,

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.400
but we'll add the button to do it.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.680
So I have this little camera icon.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.180
Let's also grabbed the edit icon.

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:37.380
Why we're here Over in the design goods Art board.

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:43.650
Let's go back over here and let's pace those into this art board.

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:45.250
But leave these here for now.

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:46.510
Okay?

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:48.360
Lets grab this circle here.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:53.450
You can also just press O on your keyboard and I'm gonna hold option shift.

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:54.340
As I do this,

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:57.480
you could also just hold shift if you hold option.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.750
It goes from the center of where you're clicking.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:01.450
If you just hold shift,

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:03.260
it goes from the left to the right.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:04.590
I'm holding option shifts.

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:11.100
I can go center from where I click and I'm gonna make a little action button to upload the

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:11.760
photo.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.440
Not too big about that big.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.590
And since this is something clickable,

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:24.000
let's go make this the action color and let's go grab this camera icon and let's go ahead.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.110
I'm gonna right click on it.

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:28.840
Bring to front my downsize it a little bit.

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.980
I'm gonna hold shift when I downsize.

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:32.360
If I don't hold shift,

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.050
you'll end up doing things like this,

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:34.740
which isn't good.

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:39.380
You want to keep the perspective of that illustration of the camera.

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:40.400
All right,

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.070
place that right in the center.

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:46.320
I kind of dropped that a little bit.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.600
What's at a stroke?

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.080
What's at a darker stroke,

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.960
Like a three pixel stroke to this?

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:59.750
Give it some separation from the image that looks good that I can tap that camera to get

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:02.650
into my pictures and select a new photo.

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:06.990
If I want to edit any of this information here,

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:08.810
I'm gonna Ah,

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:10.360
I compress the edit icon.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:17.050
Let's go ahead and make that also in action color so you can see the action color here.

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:21.950
I'm gonna copy the orders here.

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:23.560
Left a line,

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:28.790
it I'm gonna change it to 100% opacity here.

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:33.540
And I'm just going to write the word added.

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:34.090
Here,

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:38.860
put it next to that icon and move it down.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.220
Okay.

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:44.410
And that would allow me to go into editing these,

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:45.060
um,

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:46.350
this information here.

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:48.460
All right.

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:52.200
Next thing to do is let's go do the order page here,

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.610
so it's copy this profile page.

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:56.780
Let's go on the left here.

00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:58.350
What's called this order?

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:00.880
And again,

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:06.480
let's go make this text We had profile was 19.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.850
Um,

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:08.930
this text here was,

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:15.990
I believe said at 19 Bolds and let's make it whites.

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:18.350
It is Whites had 100% opacity.

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:25.980
Let's make this profile here 19 point regular or light and let's go make that 50% opacity.

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:31.070
And then let's switch this rectangle over toe orders.

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:41.410
And then let's just delete all of the profile stuff that we did given the background.

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:44.480
And at this point,

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.820
we just want to call out some of the details that we ordered here.

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.180
So let's go grab one of the photos,

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:53.050
this milk tea photo here.

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:59.850
And let's grab this information here.

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:03.650
So I'm gonna grab the photo first.

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:08.370
I'm gonna pace the photo into the order for now.

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:09.470
Just anywhere is good.

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:10.950
I'm gonna downsize it a little bit.

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:17.200
And I'm also going to grab the order information here.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.550
Copy this.

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:26.270
Okay.

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:30.950
And let's go ahead and paste this underneath the order here.

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:42.430
Right?

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:43.930
So let's shake the,

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:45.870
um we'll call it one milk tea.

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:46.250
Here.

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:49.950
Let's take the information that says Milk semisweet,

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:50.610
medium ice,

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:51.700
large tapioca.

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:54.400
And let's just change that to,

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:54.990
um,

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:55.800
quantity.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:05.350
And let's just put one here and let's center that.

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:11.490
Let's center underneath the regular milk tea text here.

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:15.090
I'm gonna make it the same with of the art board.

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:18.500
So I know it's exactly in the center of that art board.

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:22.030
How much of the same thing to the regular milk tea text,

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:24.100
But you can see it has the left alignment.

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:29.980
So let's go to the text area here and what's make it center paragraph alignment.

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:32.650
That looks good.

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:36.480
Okay.

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:40.620
And then what we're gonna do here is we're gonna crop this circle here or this.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:41.330
Ah,

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:42.060
um,

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:45.260
this image here and make it into a circle.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.000
So let's select the image.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.090
If you go toe the top here,

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:52.620
where has your won't your within your height Attributes.

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:55.230
There's the the corner radius,

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:56.150
um,

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:57.750
fields here,

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:02.650
go ahead and press shift and the up arrow and just do it a whole bunch of times.

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:05.990
You can also just type in about 100.

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.790
That should be fine.

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:17.150
Let's make the with on it 1 90 by 1 90 and then let's go ahead and blow this image up a

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:17.700
little bit.

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:23.750
So what you can do here is if you triple click on the image and then go to the crop tool at

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:24.350
the top.

00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:27.580
Now I have it cropped within the circle.

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:32.140
You can grab the image here and hold shift and just blow up.

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:34.390
The image could blow it up like that.

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:41.720
And I'm gonna downsize this circle a little bit.

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.690
I'm holding shift when I downsized,

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:45.100
so I select the corner.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:46.920
Hold shift,

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.190
downsize it,

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:51.160
go ahead and throw it over here.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:54.990
Move that down a bit.

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:58.790
Right?

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:06.430
And we also had a line that we put somewhere here on the check out page.

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:07.820
We had this line.

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.480
Let's go select this line.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:10.370
Just copy it.

00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:16.560
Now let's go back over to this board and we're gonna add this to a couple places.

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:18.350
We're gonna paste it.

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:22.320
We're gonna add it right on top of that image.

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.260
Give it some space,

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.190
but below the orders tab.

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:28.030
So if we have more information on these orders,

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:30.240
it can scroll underneath that line.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:35.470
And we're also going to center this here.

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:39.820
And also add the date someone a copy,

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:50.380
this quantity and make the date Heroes say it.

00:18:50.380 --> 00:19:06.180
0103 1020 and the price of it was a dollar or $9.50 49 cents.

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:19.670
All right,

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:26.350
let's go ahead and make the text white for the total.

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:29.170
And let's go make it 19.

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:29.760
Bold.

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:35.470
All right,

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:37.150
and let's go ahead and grab a line.

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:43.660
Just separate this order here and we can ADM Or down here is we go.

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:45.690
What's cool if we do it this way,

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:47.800
is if we have more orders than one.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:51.470
We could copy these and make them a little smaller.

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:53.020
We can add a whole bunch years.

00:19:53.020 --> 00:20:07.850
We wanted to say this was like a Nord er of three kaput them here.

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:13.150
And let's say the quantity was three.

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:13.990
We could have three.

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:17.020
If it was like six of these,

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:20.390
then we can have six and all have different flavors within it.

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:25.990
So this this design scales tohave that those different variations.

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.710
You don't have to do this.

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:28.490
I'm just doing it second,

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:28.750
See?

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:34.230
All right,

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:34.690
cool.

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:35.330
So,

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:35.860
um,

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.320
there's the order page.

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:37.940
Let's go ahead.

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:39.680
I'm gonna go back a little bit here.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:51.220
Let's go ahead and prototype this So let's go first to the shopping screen here.

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:55.370
And let's grab this profile icon here,

00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:57.660
zoom out.

00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:00.100
You kind of zoom out really far for this one.

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:03.040
Press the prototype tab at the top,

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:03.450
right?

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:11.570
Grab the little gooey prototype arm and go ahead and connect it to the profile here.

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:12.870
At this point,

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:14.270
we want to on tap.

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:15.690
And we don't want anything fancy.

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:16.880
Just just instant.

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:17.450
That's it.

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:28.380
We also want to take this illustration Drink of the Boba and connect that back over to the

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:30.500
shopping page here,

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:32.980
you can see and nothing fancy.

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:34.120
Just instant.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.850
So on tap and instant.

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:42.250
All right.

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:46.390
And one thing we need to do as well I'm gonna copy.

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:47.060
Um,

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:49.450
my copy that order text here,

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:57.490
and I'm gonna make this text the,

00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:02.970
um 16 point regular at 100% opacity.

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:14.650
And make this the pink or action color and just make this log out and let's go ahead and

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:17.940
connect that log out button by zooming out.

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:19.530
He grabbed a little prototype link.

00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:21.540
Or if you just move it to the right,

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:23.260
it will stroll the page for you.

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:24.090
Let's go.

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:27.050
Sent that back to the log in screen here,

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:33.430
Cool and last but not least,

00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:37.520
let's connect orders here to the order screen.

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:42.200
So orders on the profile tab to the order screen on tap,

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.320
and we want smart,

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:44.050
animate.

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:47.860
And then let's do the same for profile.

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:48.950
Ah,

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:53.920
text on the order screen to go to the profile screen on tap.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:54.370
Smart,

00:22:54.370 --> 00:23:02.710
animate and let's go ahead and take a look at that,

00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:10.190
right?

00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:10.330
So,

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:12.710
for back at the shopping screen,

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:14.780
I tap on the profile.

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:19.260
You can see a go to profile here if I goto orders.

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:20.480
The nice,

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:20.900
smart,

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:26.180
animate applied the transition of the rectangle over toe orders.

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:28.290
I do profile Aiken.

00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:29.360
Do log out.

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:34.270
I can click back on the Boba drink icon,

00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:35.450
take you to the center,

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:37.550
and I can log out.

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:39.050
It takes me to a log out screen.

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:40.950
All right,

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:46.670
so that's pretty much a full functional app that we just built out anywhere,

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:50.480
all the way from logging in ordering a boba drink,

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:53.790
using multiple interactions,

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:57.150
adding the drink,

00:23:57.150 --> 00:23:58.620
doing slide ups,

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:01.850
putting the address information,

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:05.260
putting in credit card details,

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:08.950
seeing the loading screens using animated GIFs,

00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:13.400
seeing the transitions of time delays on screens,

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:16.450
getting to a final experience here.

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:22.610
Seeing the Boba tea has arrived and then getting over to your profiles,

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:25.350
your orders and logging out.

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:28.630
All right.

00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:29.050
Great.

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:35.930
So that kind of covers mostly everything that we've done on building out the mobile

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:40.050
application for this Boba tea on demand experience.

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:45.930
I want to thank you if you got it this far for not only purchasing the class and going

00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:46.850
through the class,

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:52.730
but just going along with this with me here and spending the time on learning something

00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:54.900
like this design.

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:56.990
I'm very passionate about design craft.

00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:57.980
It's a great craft.

00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:59.210
If you're getting into it,

00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:01.730
it's honorable court craft,

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:04.880
and it takes time and commitment toe learn.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:05.530
And,

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:05.980
um,

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:07.350
and to develop this.

00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:11.850
So thank you for taking the time out and developing your craft with me.

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:16.010
The next series of videos I'll wrap up here is,

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:16.430
um,

00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:20.120
we're gonna learn a little bit of how to invite others into your board,

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.930
how to export assets,

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:24.350
inspect code and your designs,

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:25.910
keyboard shortcuts,

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:30.970
more of the figment plug ins that you got to see a little preview of recently on this video

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:30.970
,

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:32.570
how to create comments,

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:34.100
final thoughts,

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:38.570
and going forward all really quick videos that joint take a couple minutes to go through,

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:41.250
and you've already completed most of the class.

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:45.190
So just stick along for these last few videos to tie everything together.

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:46.350
Okay,

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:46.480
well,

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:47.190
thanks again.

00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:48.680
I hope you have fun with your prototype,

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:51.380
and I'll see you on the next videos by
