00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.700
All right,

00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.700
Welcome toe.

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.890
How to build a mobile application Experience design using the design tool Fig,

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:07.990
MMA class.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:09.820
My name is Aaron Lawrence,

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:16.880
and I'll be your instructor for the class before we get into fig MMA and building out the

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.070
mobile application that I'll share with you in a second.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.820
I like to walk through the agenda for the class.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.820
So the first video here that you're in right now is the intro to the figment design tool

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.400
and the file walk through.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.450
So I built you a file that you'll download in the class and I'll show you how to set that

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.730
up,

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.450
give you a walk through that file as well as fig MMA,

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.930
and then we can continue to the next series of videos,

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.310
which is how to design the mobile application experience.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:49.100
It's a boba tea ordering experience that are shared with you here in a moment that

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.190
applications broken down into a series of scenarios that are gonna be broken down into a

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.360
series of videos.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.420
So the first video that will have after this one is how to design the log in and sign up

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.170
workflow.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.550
The next video will be the shopping workflow experience.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.090
The next video after that will be the check out workflow experience,

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.450
and the next video after that will be the profile workflow experience.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.600
Um,

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.440
I believe that the best way to learn a new tool and learn designed just get right into it

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.220
and have fun.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.190
So this isn't a video where you're gonna have a bunch of instructions and things to do.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.310
You just gonna follow along with me and we're gonna learn by doing design.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.350
So while we're in these videos on and these scenarios designing,

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.770
you'll use fig mutt toe.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.710
Learn how to create and use a component library.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.380
You'll also learn how to create and share a clickable prototypes that you contest the

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.150
prototype or share it with your team.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.460
You'll learn how to invite others and how collaboration works.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.400
Within Fig MMA.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:58.940
You'll learn how to export U Y assets and also inspect the design for code attributes,

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.450
and you could use those code attributes for engineering.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.580
You'll learn fig MMA keyboard shortcuts.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.250
You learn how to use figure plug ins and how to download gooey kits from online.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.140
You'll learn how to create comments,

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.020
and you'll also have some final thoughts and a going forward will be the last video there.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.090
All right,

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.200
So before I show you the goods and the designs that we're gonna build in this class,

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.350
I just want to talk a little bit about why Sigma has become ah,

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.370
very popular design tool for major tech companies and most the industry.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.180
And the companies using these tools are companies are Sigma Tool.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.630
Are companies like Google Twitter,

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.280
uber Airbnb,

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.870
Microsoft to say a few?

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.180
Um,

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.650
but why fig MMA?

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.580
The one of the great things here is that it's a cloud based file storage application.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.380
So that means that stores all your files in the clouds.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.380
There's no more file management trying to track down the most recent file.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.250
Um,

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.820
you can access these files from any computer via the Internet,

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.980
so it doesn't just exist on your computer.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.180
They exist in the cloud,

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.060
and they're accessible anywhere.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:17.480
My favorite thing about Sigma being a cloud based application is that a auto saves your

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.290
work so you never lose progress in your work.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.120
It's constantly saving your file in the background,

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.080
so you never have the like crash or the application crash,

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.270
and then you lost work.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.810
The other thing,

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.380
what's been heavily adopted throughout a lot of the companies is that it's great with

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.350
collaboration,

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.440
and one of the reasons why it's great is that uses you can view multiple mouses,

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.120
and it makes for real time collaboration.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.180
So if other people are in the tool,

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.610
you can see there mouses in the tool,

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.170
and it makes that it makes it really easy to collaborate with other teammates.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.140
This also makes it easy for engineers and PM's to use.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.860
And it's great because engineers can come into your designs and they can expect them,

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:09.450
and they can grab the CSS code attributes and copy and paste it into their code base.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.510
The other thing does that make Sigma gray is it?

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.400
Does prototyping live in the tool,

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.590
so you don't have to use one tool for designing and another tool for prototyping?

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:21.070
It's sort of,

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.270
ah,

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:23.150
one stop shop for all of that.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.350
It makes that prototype really easy to share,

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.370
and it gives you a clickable link that you can share with anybody in your team or you can

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.140
send it to users and you can do testing with them.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.960
You can watch them go through the link.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.050
You can also download the fig mud mirror application that I'll show you on your phone,

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.950
and you can see your designs that you're creating in real time also on your phone.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.050
It also makes um,

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.800
the creation of components and component instances really easy.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.910
I'll show you that in this class as well,

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:05.550
and it makes creating style guides and character styles and colors for reusing during your

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.080
designs really easy as well.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.810
But I assure you,

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:08.180
uh,

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:14.190
sure you in this class and it makes for dropping comments so other teammates yourself can

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.030
drop comics in the tool in the context of your designs,

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:23.590
which really makes it really easy to see what people are referring to when they're giving

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:24.890
comments to your design,

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:29.150
which also show you in the final videos.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:36.120
It also has endless art board space and page layout and has lots of plug ins that you can

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.710
use to make designing faster.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.040
All right,

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.670
so it's a little bit about why fig MMA,

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.750
Let's go take a tour of the application that we're going to learn in this class.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.510
So I'm gonna go over to the prototype here and we have a loading screen.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.520
It's the Boba tea application experience.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:58.690
And what this does is allow anybody in San Francisco to open up to download this

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:04.590
application and to get Boba tea ordered to them and deliver to them in real time.

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:05.120
So,

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.600
essentially,

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.590
if I want Boba Tea delivered in my office,

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:13.030
I can order a Boba tea and I can have it delivered into my office with in San Francisco

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.460
within 15 minutes.

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.780
So we'll learn in the first video.

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.000
After this is,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.040
we'll learn how to build out the sign up in log in page that you'll see here.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.040
You can see it has a tap system on the top,

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.850
left and right,

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:29.890
and let's go ahead and log in.

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:36.770
Someone put my name or my email my password in Press the log in button fig.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.900
Ma also supports animated GIFs so you can see that little loading spender GIF.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.230
I'll show you that as well.

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:44.470
And then here's the shopping experience.

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:48.080
Here is all of the three Boba or for Boba teas,

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.940
flavors that we have on offer.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.040
Here we have the tab bar here that stays fixed,

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.140
meaning it doesn't stroll with all the other content.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.350
I'll show you how to do that in this class as well.

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:02.760
And let's say I want to order one of these regular Boba tea drinks here.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:08.130
I just have to tap anywhere on this square and it opens up the regular milk,

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:09.370
tea shopping,

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:09.980
um,

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:10.890
settings.

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:13.750
And here I can change the milk if I wanted,

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.890
maybe nondairy milk,

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:17.150
almond milk.

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:21.470
I can also change the regular sweetness here and the media mice.

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:26.800
So in this user experience will change out the regular sweet to a semisweet.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:31.600
So here will also use figment to learn how to create a mobile drop down,

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.760
which is a slide up here that you can see.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.180
And when I click the semi sweet,

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.400
you can see the SEMISWEET has populated now.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.870
So it's really feeling like a ah riel application,

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.490
although it's just your designs.

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:49.240
And this is the things that we do to show engineering,

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.570
how to build out the experience,

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:55.350
the transitions and the little details that we have in our designs.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:58.120
So you can see here I can select my toppings.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.700
The toppings I have on selection are large tapioca,

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.620
small tapioca or lychee jelly.

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.200
I can see the total here,

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.650
and I have the add button.

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:12.690
So let's go ahead and add large tapioca so you can see have added the large tapioca.

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:17.660
I've seen the price go up a bit and I'm gonna go ahead and add this to my cart.

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:22.130
You can see that transition where the screen went down.

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:24.070
We're gonna learn that in this class as well.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:26.870
And I could see now that I've added this to my cart,

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:28.690
I click on the cart here.

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:31.520
I see that I added the one milk drink,

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.300
a run,

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:32.940
regular milk,

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:33.650
tea drink,

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:35.230
and I can edit.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:36.510
I can remove this.

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:38.750
I can also add any quantities,

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:39.510
but I'm good with it.

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:41.290
I just want one drink delivered to me.

00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:43.390
Here's the sub total the taxes,

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:44.320
the delivery fee,

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.320
that order total.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.510
And I'm good to go.

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:47.970
If I want to close this,

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:49.060
I compress the X,

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.120
and it will close it,

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.010
um,

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:53.430
down like that and I can reopen it again.

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:56.690
So your learned these little transition states in this class as well.

00:08:56.690 --> 00:09:00.750
So let's go ahead and do the next and you'll see Ah,

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:01.710
the address here.

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:08.080
I can put the address in my apartment and my phone number press done,

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:14.540
but say I wanted to go back at all.

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:15.850
I can press the back arrow.

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:18.640
You can see that screen slides from the left to the right,

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.620
and you can also see it come in from the right to the left.

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:21.840
Here.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:25.100
Those are little transition details that will learn in the class as well.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:29.050
And I'm gonna go ahead and put in my credit card information here.

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:31.970
Press done.

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:36.230
And I could see my took my order total here at $9.49.

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:41.830
And I'm gonna go ahead and pay and we could see were using that spinner again at seven ng

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:42.400
payment.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:48.780
And you'll see I now seeing the delivery of my Boba tea on the map in real time.

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:49.880
And bang,

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:50.480
it's here.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.400
I can say,

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:52.690
OK,

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:53.170
got it.

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:54.980
And it takes me back to my home screen.

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.290
I want to go look at my profile here.

00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:57.490
Aiken,

00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:59.160
Tab over to my profile.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:09:59.510
I see.

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:01.950
I'm now on the active profile tab.

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:05.130
I can see a picture of myself.

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:06.350
I can add a picture.

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:09.250
I can edit the information here.

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:10.050
Oh,

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:10.490
and by the way,

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:11.480
this isn't a picture of me.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:15.370
That's just a random picture that I have of somebody using a plug in,

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:16.230
um,

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:17.010
in fig MMA.

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:17.670
That's really neat.

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:19.220
It's a plug in called,

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:19.850
um,

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:22.240
content assets,

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.310
that I'll show you how to download and it just pulls photos for you Really easy.

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:28.420
Also,

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.310
there's the order tab here,

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:34.630
and I can see my most recent order was that one regular built milk tea,

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:36.250
the date and the total there,

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:39.450
and I can click back on the mobile.

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:41.440
T ah,

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:41.970
uh,

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:43.680
are the Boba tea icon.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.020
Hear?

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.350
It takes me back to my shopping experience.

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:48.840
I can go back to my profile,

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:49.700
I can log out,

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.850
and I'm back at the log in screen here.

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:52.920
All right.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:53.800
Pretty awesome.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:57.500
So that's sort of the goods that rule go through in this class and learn how to build.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:02.510
But going forward right now is what you'll need to do.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:03.880
If you haven't already is,

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.350
go ahead and go to fig MMA,

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:06.030
um,

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:11.760
sigma dot com and you can just do a Google search like Sigma download and find the figment

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:12.560
download.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:13.240
Um,

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:13.820
U R L,

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:19.890
which is sigma dot com slash downloads and download either for Mac or Windows.

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:21.170
I'm using a Mac,

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:24.240
and most people that do design work here using a Mac,

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.180
um,

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:31.560
so download the local application for your figment file and you'll see here by pressed the

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.050
download.

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:33.950
It shows up on my bottom left corner.

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:35.540
I double click on that.

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:35.960
It will show,

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:39.550
but my applications and you can begin to start using fig mud.

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:40.940
What's really neat,

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:41.100
though,

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.070
also is,

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:42.540
um,

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:46.480
you can also access fig MMA through the Web as well.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:52.450
So you can see here I have the file loaded here on Web and I can go through all the designs

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:54.020
that I just showed you on Web.

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:55.280
But for this class,

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.500
it's best to use the local application,

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.390
so download the local application.

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:02.090
And the best part is it's free.

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:03.220
It doesn't cost you anything.

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.000
Okay,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.070
so go ahead and download the application if you,

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:07.960
um,

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:13.960
haven't already and pause the video and I'm gonna continue on and you can join us after you

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.880
download the fig.

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:16.750
My application.

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:17.970
All right,

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:19.620
Now that you have sigma up and running,

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:23.670
go ahead and download the class file or folder here.

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:27.560
It's called fig MMA file for download And once you have that downloaded,

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:28.520
you can go ahead and open.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.020
It has two things in it.

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:30.710
It has the figure,

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:33.640
a class file that you're gonna open and figment.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.790
I'll show you how to do that here in a second.

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:39.580
And this is the file that we're gonna use for the entire class.

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:40.560
Also,

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:45.940
it has the fonts for the file on the design that we're doing for that Boba tea application

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:46.620
experience.

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:49.240
And it you could see all the fonts here.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.360
This should already be installed in your fig MMA application,

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:53.770
but just in case it's not.

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:54.450
You have him here.

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:56.250
You can stall those on your machine.

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:58.170
Okay.

00:12:58.170 --> 00:12:59.890
Before you open up this,

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:00.460
um,

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:01.470
file here,

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:02.960
I'm gonna go to Fig MMA.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:03.540
Um,

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:06.260
beginning of sigma looks something like this.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:07.950
You land on this page,

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:09.590
you have your drafts,

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:10.620
your plug ins,

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:11.810
your recent your search.

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:12.620
You have your,

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:13.180
um,

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:16.710
your settings here most of time.

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:18.470
I'm going into the drafts here,

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:20.240
and I'm making new art boards.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:23.300
Your your figment application probably like mine because it has.

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.930
I have a lot of files already that I'm using,

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:32.830
but you could do the new file here And that's how you create a brand new working file here

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:33.180
you've seen,

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:34.010
like I've done here.

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:36.050
If you click on entitled Here,

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:38.010
this is how you create a name for it.

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:42.690
You just say name here and now I have a name here,

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:43.740
file created.

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:47.370
I'll get into the inner workings of Fig Mahir.

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:48.210
Um,

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:52.210
but it's best just open up the file that I've created for you,

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:57.180
and we'll go through all of the details and we'll just learn by doing which I think is the

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:58.350
more fun way to learn.

00:13:58.350 --> 00:13:59.690
Okay,

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:05.180
so now that you're here and you have the file,

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:05.770
um,

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:08.490
if you're already in a file within fig Ma,

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:10.440
you can come Teoh this section here.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.410
So come to this.

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:11.920
Um,

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:12.950
I click on the top,

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:14.130
like four boxes here.

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:17.300
My figure application comes to my home like dashboard.

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:17.780
Here,

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:19.900
go on the draft section here,

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:25.820
and what you're gonna want to do is you're gonna want to click and drag this file here.

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:26.280
This figure,

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.220
a class file,

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:33.170
slash boba tea into this space here so you can see highlights blue.

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:38.680
And that's how you'll load up this file and eventually you'll have this figure a class file

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:38.950
here.

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:51.130
I'm going to go ahead and delete the one that I just created called name here.

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:52.180
That's why delete.

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:54.250
So if you ever want to manage this space,

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:56.220
you just right click on different,

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:57.790
um,

00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:59.980
files that you've created within fig mond.

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:01.000
You can delete them,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:01.880
duplicate them,

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:02.900
renamed them share,

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:03.160
um,

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:03.920
copy links,

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:04.470
open them.

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:07.650
You can also just open them by double clicking.

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:10.260
So once you have the figure eight class file opened up,

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:14.550
just double click into it and bang were into the file here,

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:16.320
um good and followed me.

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.350
Let's just go to the final prototype here,

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:22.950
and this will be the good section Teoh to take a look at.

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:26.360
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna zoom out by doing ah,

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:33.010
command if you're on a Mac or control your on a on a PC minus so command minus for me and

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:38.170
I'm already doing some basic functionality within fig mo Just command minus to zoom out

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:40.850
command Plus to zoom in.

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:44.600
And if I wanted also,

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:44.970
uh,

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:45.950
zoom in and out,

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:50.620
I can hold down Z and see how that gives me the my magnifying glass.

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:54.200
And I just click and I zoom,

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.310
click and select click and drag,

00:15:56.310 --> 00:16:01.850
and that will zoom in the art board or this art page to anywhere on the page.

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:04.220
I can command minus again,

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:08.480
and the next thing toe that's important to learn to is if you hold space bar,

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.230
it gives you this little hand,

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:11.220
and this hand,

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.410
if you click and drag,

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:15.580
allows you to move this space around pretty quickly.

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:20.450
So those are some of the fundamentals of really any design tool.

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:25.720
Is your using command minus command plus to zoom in and as you zoom in,

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:31.400
you using the space bar and the hand told to move things around to help position yourself.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:35.460
And then you can hold Z to zoom into places that you want to see more.

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:38.160
Let's say I want to grab that Ah,

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.150
this little arrow icon and I consume back here.

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:43.200
Okay,

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:47.760
so let's go ahead and do a walk through a fig mahir again like you saw before.

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:50.080
If I want to change the name of this design file,

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.560
just click at the top here.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:52.760
I can change the name.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.800
I also have all my layers here,

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.790
which I'll show you how to do that here in a second.

00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:58.440
Um,

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.990
for this page system here.

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:03.550
So what figure allows you to do first?

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:07.300
First off is it allows you to create pages here on the left.

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:08.760
You can see I have the learning.

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:09.210
Paige,

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:15.020
this is where we're gonna go ahead and design out that Boba tea application has the

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:16.320
component library.

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:17.160
Um,

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:17.750
page here.

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:19.400
This is where we're gonna put all our components.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.320
That will reuse.

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:20.720
Are you?

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.610
I components.

00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:23.760
It has the final prototype.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:29.460
This is the actual boba tea application experience that you've just seen already built out

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:29.460
.

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:30.480
Ready to go in fig,

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:30.830
MMA.

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:35.720
Just in case you ever get stuck during the class or you just want to dive into the designs

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:35.940
already.

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:38.120
Haven't see how I've used them.

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:38.970
Um,

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:40.450
that's all there for you.

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:42.410
I have the design goods.

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:47.870
This is a breakdown of all the like icons and photos that we're gonna use for this class

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:48.660
already here.

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:51.160
And I also have the gooey kit.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:52.830
This is the IOS gooey kit.

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:55.440
And this has all of the functions for,

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:55.600
like,

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.760
keyboards for your your iPhone devices.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:17:59.410
Um,

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:00.620
notifications.

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:01.140
All there.

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:02.100
We won't use all of it.

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:03.120
But it's there for you,

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:03.560
um,

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:04.540
for future projects,

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:05.080
if you need.

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:07.850
So what you could do.

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:10.380
Here's let's say I want to create a new page.

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:12.520
This is a new workflow that I want to work on.

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.440
You just click on the plus button here,

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:16.560
and you could see I have a page six.

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:17.680
I'm just gonna call this like,

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:25.050
new page here and now I have a new art space that I can go create all of my designs here.

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:27.880
So let's go ahead and ah,

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.690
delete this page here.

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:31.990
So we're gonna delete this guy here.

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:33.940
You can see I can delete page.

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:35.940
I can rename Aiken duplicate it.

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:38.770
I can also do a new page as well.

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:39.850
We'll just go ahead and delete it.

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:44.660
That's why you add pages and delete pages.

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:46.400
Now that we're in,

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.110
um,

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:49.350
the learning page here,

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:51.290
you can see at the top.

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:52.740
Here we have our tools.

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:54.370
You have the selection tool.

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:56.350
Some move tools from scale tools.

00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:59.300
You have the art board tool here.

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:00.670
It's a frame tool in the slice to,

00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:00.910
uh,

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:02.680
get into these as we do it.

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:03.810
I think it's best when,

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:04.370
um,

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:06.020
just a design as we go,

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:11.440
and I'll talk about these tools Maurin deftly throughout the videos here and show you how

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.020
we use them.

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:14.570
But here's the shape tool to create rectangles,

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:15.490
lines,

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:17.400
circles,

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.870
polygraph stars.

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:20.720
You can also place images.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:25.670
You can also just drag images and just drag him into the fig MMA on DATs.

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:26.310
How you can.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:28.860
That's how I tend to place images in this tool.

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:30.790
You have the pen tool,

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:33.210
which allows you to create any shape that you want here,

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:34.670
which we'll get more into,

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:40.440
um as we use the tool or as we do these series of videos here we have the comment,

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:41.110
um,

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:41.430
tool,

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:41.950
which I have,

00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:42.110
ah,

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:43.280
video towards the end here.

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:44.290
How to use this.

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:47.410
And then we have the same similar settings here at the top.

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:51.670
We have the file here seeking open file from a browser.

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:54.650
You can save this file as ah,

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:59.150
as an actual file so you can get it out of the cloud like I did here,

00:19:59.150 --> 00:19:59.540
Um,

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:01.700
for the documents for this class,

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.700
you can export um,

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:08.060
art boards and you can export the screens as pdf's.

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:12.560
Some basic addict functions like command seat,

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.830
a copy command V to paste.

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:15.880
Um,

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:20.020
and then you have some view areas to view grids.

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:21.770
You can see view layers.

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:22.410
Um,

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:23.690
a lot of stuff,

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:26.060
A lot of like any designed tool you don't they use.

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:27.470
You'll learn all of this.

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:29.070
You just kind of learned the basics.

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:29.650
And,

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:30.050
um,

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:32.020
you'll learn as you as you need to learn.

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:35.950
So I'll show you pretty much 90% of the tool,

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:36.600
um,

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:40.530
that I use and there's still some things within it that I don't use.

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:42.160
I don't find all that helpful for,

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:46.300
but they're there some option settings.

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:49.410
You have some vector settings of you have any vectors?

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:50.830
I've never used this at all.

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:51.660
Just a heads up.

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:53.930
You have some text features here?

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:55.320
Can I never use this here?

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:58.070
I use the text field over here that I'll talk about here in a moment.

00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:00.720
You have a range arranging objects.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.430
I'll sometimes use this,

00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:05.470
but I also use quickies for these as well.

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:09.950
These air how toe like layer objects on top of each other and arrange them.

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:12.200
You have your windows.

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:12.500
Rarely.

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:13.970
Do I ever use this as well?

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:15.240
The plug ins or cool.

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.020
I do use the plug ins a lot.

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:17.470
So,

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:17.850
um,

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:22.370
I have a video towards the end here that just talks about just plug ins I'm and how awesome

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:23.780
they are and then help.

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:26.490
You could just quick search anything here if you wanted Teoh,

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:27.070
um,

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:28.760
like keyboard.

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:30.790
And it will give you keyboard shortcuts here,

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:33.660
which I have a video on towards the end that we'll talk about.

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:35.220
So if you ever get stuck,

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:36.110
you can You can,

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:37.550
ah do the help here,

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:38.740
all right,

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:41.260
And then So let's go ahead and just create a rectangle here.

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:46.140
You can see I've grabbed the rectangle to I clicked and dragged here and you could see the

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:46.860
left column.

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:54.670
Here is a lot to do with my layers and my pages here that you that I have the right column

00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:57.220
here has to do with whatever I select.

00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:00.510
So you can see this is a basic I'm on the art board.

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:03.030
It's showing my background for the art board,

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:04.100
some local styles.

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:05.940
I'll show you how to set these up in the video.

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:10.780
The next series of videos that will do and I click on the rectangle Watch of the stuff on

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:13.470
the rights Gonna change Boone.

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:17.110
So now it's changed to rectangle functions here,

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:19.580
so I can change the width of this.

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:21.650
I'm just holding.

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:22.860
Let's say I want 20.

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:24.480
You can see it's gonna get real small.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.360
Let's go like I don't know,

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:28.090
2000 if we want.

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:34.350
And let's go ahead and make this 2000 as well.

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:35.430
We got a square.

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:36.990
Gonna zoom in on that.

00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:40.610
So I changed the width and height of that square.

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:42.300
Let's say I want Teoh.

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:43.200
Rotate it.

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.060
That's the rotating.

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:48.920
You can also just rotate by just clicking on the side.

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:49.250
Here,

00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:49.590
you see,

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:53.830
when I my hover my mouse over the side of any corner,

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:55.920
I get a rotate tool,

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.470
and if I just click and drag,

00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:59.040
it rotates elements.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:00.560
But if I want to get more specific,

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:03.450
I can click here to rotate and get more specific.

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:12.190
I can also around edges here sick and see if I go up here around the edges and they'll get

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:13.030
more around around,

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:15.450
eventually turning this rectangle into a circle.

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:20.590
If I click into the,

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:21.100
um,

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:22.270
independent corners,

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:25.260
this allows maybe just to round out one corner at a time.

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:30.050
You can see just the top right there is getting rounded and I'll dive Mawr deep into these

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:30.050
,

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:32.940
um features as we continue on with the class.

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:34.490
But I have a feel here.

00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:35.950
I can change the colors.

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:38.860
Say I want to make this blue.

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:41.400
I can change a solid to a Lanier,

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:42.460
which is a Grady int,

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:44.180
and I have two colors.

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:50.440
Let's say I want to change this color here and to maybe something more Ah,

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:53.860
purple And he could see its at 0% opacity.

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:54.900
Here there's in the past.

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:57.110
The slider makes it transparent,

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:58.320
and now we've made it.

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:01.050
A full fledge was kind of a nice color.

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:05.060
I have my document colors here below that you can see as well.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:09.980
And let's say I want to add a stroke like I want to add a black stroke to this.

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:11.320
So here's my stroke.

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:16.700
You can see what I did here was I pressed the plus and I've added a stroke here.

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:22.450
And then if I can make the stroke thickness more here,

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:27.200
you can see I can also do the same thing I did with the feel.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.750
I can change the color of it.

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:30.180
I can change it from solid toe.

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:32.360
Lanier have different radiance.

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:33.150
It's fun.

00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:34.570
Just go play around with these two.

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:38.660
What's I just want a solid here.

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:41.760
I can change the colors here.

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.680
Let's go like a darker blue,

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:45.710
Okay?

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:48.020
And then I have the transparency here.

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:51.580
So if I want to set the entire image transparent,

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:53.300
I can start to move it down.

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:54.580
Eventually it disappears,

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:55.480
Moving back up.

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:59.570
It appears I can do the same thing with my feel.

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:00.340
You can see here.

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:02.550
I'm just making the field transparent.

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:04.050
Pretty simple.

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:07.530
They were just pressing the keyboard down Arrow.

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:08.160
To do that,

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:10.920
you can also type it in.

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:11.510
Let's say I want,

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:11.660
like,

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:14.370
20 you know,

00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:17.970
I'm going to go back 200 I could do the same thing here for the stroke.

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:21.380
Compressing shift down arrow and I'm seeing a stroke.

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:24.160
Go away for the stroke.

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:24.340
Aiken,

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:25.460
do an inside.

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:26.690
I can do a center.

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:32.270
I can also do an outside their pretty simple stuff for the effects.

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:32.550
Here.

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:34.030
You can do drop shadows,

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:34.700
things like that.

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:36.130
So it has a drop shadow here.

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:36.780
Let's go.

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:37.980
Um,

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:38.670
apply.

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:40.870
Drop shadow here you can do in our shadows.

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:42.810
Defaults to drop shadow.

00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:44.570
That's mostly what most people use.

00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:46.820
Let's go make this.

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:47.280
Um,

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:51.130
we'll start with maybe 70% here on the transparency.

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:57.080
Let's make it 40 on the left or the right and 40 on the bottom.

00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:58.510
What's at along?

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:03.160
Blur on it and you can start to see that drop shadow.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:06.380
And if I want to change the drop shadow color,

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:12.170
let's I want to put a little bit of blue in that drop shadow there we got some blue going.

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:15.400
I'm gonna go ahead and delete the strokes.

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:16.240
Aiken delete.

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:22.630
I can press the eyeball and that's just still keeps the stroke by just can't view it and

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:24.700
you compress the minus here and I could just delete it.

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:31.190
So now I just have ah rectangle and I have the shadow applied to it.

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:37.640
I'm gonna go ahead and click on this rectangle and if I do a command,

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:45.610
see or I go at it here and I do a copy and then I go and do a command V or edit and I paste

00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:45.610
.

00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:52.150
You can see that I've just pasted a rectangle here.

00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:57.040
I can also hold option click and drag,

00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:02.350
and I can copy a rectangle here and if I hold shift while I'll do that,

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:03.950
it keeps it in line.

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:08.150
So it's exactly at the same alignment as the one that I'm copying.

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:08.590
Here.

00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:10.720
You can see I can't snap out of this.

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.480
But if I undo shift,

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:13.160
I can.

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:18.790
But let's go ahead and make these all a little bit not aligned here.

00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:26.870
So now I have three rectangles and you can see here on my panel on the left.

00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:32.480
Here is I have get rid of these.

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:33.280
I just pressed.

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:33.730
Delete.

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:38.330
I can select these rectangles just by clicking these layers over here,

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:39.230
which is helpful,

00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:40.530
cause as you start to get many,

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:42.640
many design elements going on your page,

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:45.730
it's nice to know that you can just go select him over here.

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:48.120
I can also hold hold down shift,

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:50.900
and I can select a couple of these.

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:52.550
Select all of them.

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:55.520
What if I just want one and three thin?

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:58.910
I can hold down command and I can just select the one and three.

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:01.730
I can also just click Find the one here.

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:02.560
Uh,

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.030
click on the rectangle itself.

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:04.990
Told shift,

00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:08.750
Click another one And you could see I have these two selected.

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:09.930
Not this one right now,

00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:11.160
Just these two here.

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.050
I can move these two around.

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:18.570
I can hold shift again and unclipped And I just have this one selected.

00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:21.150
Or I could click and drag,

00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:24.590
and I can select all of these just like that.

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:25.530
And I can hold,

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:31.560
shift and click and drag again and see how it uninsulated the areas that I'm clicking and

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:32.120
dragging.

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.930
So those are some pretty,

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:34.400
like,

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.110
really,

00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:37.570
fundamentals of any design tool is,

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:38.160
um,

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:42.880
being able select elements create elements at some color at some,

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.490
stroked at some effects,

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:47.900
being able to select multiple objects.

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:50.210
These select multiple multiple objects.

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:56.000
Another thing that's pretty fundamental to is being able Teoh,

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:02.910
align these So you can see I've selected all three of these and I pressed the alignment and

00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:03.260
bang.

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:04.700
They're all aligned at the top.

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:10.200
I can also even lead distribute them so I can say tidy up here,

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.780
or it's to distribute horizontal spacing.

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:17.350
And it makes equal spacing from left to right and left to right here.

00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:22.890
All right,

00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:26.950
so you can see the a lot of those functions that I just showed you were also,

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:27.360
um,

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:31.090
at the arrange setting up here um,

00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:33.370
object settings up here.

00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:34.620
Let's say I have Ah,

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:36.550
I'm gonna make one of these just black.

00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:41.990
I'm gonna go back to solid and just make a black one,

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:44.550
and then I'm gonna make this one here.

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:50.230
I'm gonna make this one go back to a solid and just make this one.

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:50.910
Um,

00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:53.500
Any colors find by my make it pink for this case.

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:55.200
Now,

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:58.250
you can see my layering here.

00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:00.730
So I have the pink on the top.

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:03.550
I have the Grady in in the middle of the black on the left.

00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:06.600
I want to change any of these layer rings.

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:10.110
I can goto object and I can go to bring to front.

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:12.010
So whatever object I have selected,

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:17.390
I have selected this square I could bring to front and boom were brought.

00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:19.450
We brought that one to the front page.

00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:20.740
If I want to bring it,

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:21.520
um,

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:26.140
let's go ahead and say I want to bring this pink one up now.

00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:27.130
I gotta object.

00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:31.170
Bring to front and I can see that's gone up to the front.

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:31.520
Now,

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:34.140
if I want to send this all the way to the back,

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:37.510
I can go send to back and he concedes to the back.

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:42.350
And if I want to bring it up one I'm gonna bring forward and you can see how I brought that

00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:42.750
forward.

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:47.810
I can also do the same thing by clicking the layers and dragging the layers so you can see

00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:51.260
I'm dragging the layers up and I'm gonna bring the pink all the way to the top here.

00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:54.420
Pretty simple stuff.

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:54.980
Um,

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:57.710
let's say I want to flip this element here.

00:30:57.710 --> 00:30:58.410
What's do?

00:30:58.410 --> 00:30:59.160
Um,

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:08.140
I'm gonna make one of the corners have a different shape here,

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:09.050
and I want to flip it.

00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:10.820
Just go to object,

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:12.180
go to flip horizontal,

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:13.960
and you'll see it'll flip horizontal.

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:16.670
Or I could flip it vertical as well.

00:31:16.670 --> 00:31:18.610
And I have that I can also do.

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:20.600
Their rotating up here is well,

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:26.390
but I like to do the rotating just by putting my mouse over here and rotating it just like

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:26.660
that.

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:29.510
Okay,

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:29.930
cool.

00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:34.220
So that was a little rundown of the basics of fig MMA,

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:35.200
the design tool.

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:40.240
Let's go talk a little bit about the structure of this file that I've given you.

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:43.010
So we have the pages here,

00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:45.150
we're gonna we're gonna create everything in this learning.

00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:45.610
Paige,

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:46.640
here the top left.

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:50.040
We have the component library page to put all our components.

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:52.360
You have the final prototype here.

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:57.190
So essentially this learning page that we have at the top will eventually look like this

00:31:57.190 --> 00:32:02.650
file here broken down into those four scenarios that I've labeled here at the top.

00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:04.550
These are just a square with text on it.

00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:05.280
That,

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:05.830
um,

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:07.800
helps me organize my files.

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.880
So you have the log and file here.

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:12.350
You have the order scenarios here.

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:17.350
The check out here and the profile screens here.

00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:21.220
So those are all in the file there already?

00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:22.100
Prototypes.

00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:30.210
You can see if you click on the prototype tab over here and I click and drag this here.

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:33.170
That's how we prototype our screens together,

00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:36.930
Which I'll show you in the next file or the next video here.

00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:39.240
But you can see it's all here for you.

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:39.870
Um,

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:41.880
but the best way ah,

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:45.000
took to learn this is actually just we're going to recreate this,

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.310
but it's it's a safety net.

00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.950
If you need it,

00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:49.970
I might have all the design goods over here,

00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:54.600
and so already we always we already have everything that you need here is Well,

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:56.970
um and yeah,

00:32:56.970 --> 00:32:58.740
and with without further ado,

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:05.670
I think we're ready to go ahead and kick in to the next section of this video,

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:10.140
which is we're gonna learn how to start designing that mobile application,

00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:10.950
and we'll start with,

00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:13.290
log in and sign up workflow.

00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:14.200
So again,

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:17.600
I want to thank you for taking the class and I'll see you on the next video.

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:18.170
Take care.
