Welcome to the project.
1

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:08,220
In this project, we're going to create an Instagram clone using next js.
2

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,420
And Tailwind CSS.
3

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:17,820
As you can see from the final version of the project, we have two parts in the homepage, including
4

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,490
the header and feed section.
5

6
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:29,440
The header includes the Instagram logo, the search bar, and also the menu with the sign in link.
6

7
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,870
We can authenticate the users here.
7

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,770
Once we click on the sign in link.
8

9
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,340
We are going to be redirected to a custom sign in page here.
9

10
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,040
We can click on the sign in with Google Button.
10

11
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,170
And on the next page we can choose our desired Gmail account.
11

12
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,780
For example, I choose this one.
12

13
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:04,710
Once you're signing with the Google account, a session would be started and the picture of the user
13

14
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:11,850
would be shown in the upper right corner of the website, inside the mini profile, and also at the
14

15
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,650
beginning of this story section.
15

16
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:19,110
Also, we have the ability to like and leave a comment with this account.
16

17
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:27,710
Here on the top right corner, we see an icon, which is for creating a new post by clicking on this
17

18
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:28,370
icon.
18

19
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,520
A modal is going to pop up.
19

20
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:34,670
We are going to use React modal package to create this model.
20

21
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:39,020
Here we can click on the camera icon to upload an image.
21

22
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,980
For example, I choose an image from my desktop here.
22

23
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:49,430
Once we choose the image, we can see the preview of the image instead of the camera icon.
23

24
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,320
We can add a caption here.
24

25
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:55,120
For example, I say next js.
25

26
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:02,780
In this project, we're going to learn how to use Firebase for storage and database.
26

27
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:11,470
By clicking on the upload post, we are going to upload the image into the Firebase Storage first.
27

28
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:19,240
Then a new document is going to be created inside the post collection of the Firebase database.
28

29
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:25,390
You're going to learn how to interact with Firebase a step by step inside the project.
29

30
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,040
The post that we have created is at the beginning of the feed section.
30

31
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,190
Now each post has a header here.
31

32
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,190
An image.
32

33
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,370
Buttons.
33

34
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,680
Caption comments and input box.
34

35
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:45,130
Each person can only like a post once.
35

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,900
The number of likes is shown here.
36

37
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,260
If the post has more than one like.
37

38
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,420
Also the user can leave a comment here.
38

39
00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:01,840
The comments and links are also recorded in the Firebase database and it's going to be fetch.
39

40
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,580
Each time the database is change using useEffect react hook.
40

41
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,130
For example, I write here.
41

42
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,120
Nice.
42

43
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,620
I press enter.
43

44
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,630
Once I press enter.
44

45
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:17,350
The comments would be appeared here in real time.
45

46
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:24,760
If you sign in with another account, we can like the post and change the number of lives into two likes.
46

47
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,920
Let me change the user real quick by clicking on sign out.
47

48
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,970
I can sign out from my account.
48

49
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,660
I click on signing again.
49

50
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:45,550
And here I, I can choose my another Gmail account.
50

51
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,310
I chose this one instead quote with hand.
51

52
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:57,220
Now if I like to pose the number of like would be two likes.
52

53
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,490
Let me leave a comment as well.
53

54
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,400
For example, I say amazing.
54

55
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,980
Always the new comment goes.
55

56
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,230
At the beginning of the comments section.
56

57
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:17,790
On the right side we have miniprofile which includes the user image and the user name which are
57

58
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,180
coming from Google and the user data inside.
58

59
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:29,640
This suggestion here and also inside this story section are created using minifaker.js package
59

60
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:36,120
all the website is styled using only Tailwind CSS version 3.0.
60

61
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:44,220
The entire source code is available in this repository, which you can find inside the resource section.
61

62
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:49,020
You can also have a preview of the project from this URL here.

63

64
00:04:55,290 --> 00:05:02,220
In the next section we're going to install next js and Tailwind CSS and create the beginning template.
64

65
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,410
So here in the next section.
