WEBVTT
1
00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:07.720
All right.

2
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.220
In the last section, we have completed the footer section of our project.

3
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.690
In this section, we're going to work on the pages that we have.

4
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.700
So now when we click on, for example, I'm feeling lucky button.

5
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.300
We go to the.

6
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.010
Page.

7
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.020
Search for slash web.

8
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.660
But the things we see is the 401404 error.

9
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.100
And also we we see that the error is the page could not be fine.

10
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.330
So we need to create this page in the next case.

11
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.440
13 There is a very simple way to create pages.

12
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.240
The things we want to do in this section to create two pages.

13
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.900
The first is the web and the other one is image.

14
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:04.650
So if you have the search for slash image, we're going to have an image as well.

15
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.560
So in next year's 13.

16
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.690
We have an app directory here.

17
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.980
So this page that G6 is the home page.

18
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:26.660
But if you want to have another page, we need to create a folder in this page with that name.

19
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:34.190
For example, if you want to have forward slash search, we need to have a folder called Search.

20
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.870
So we created a folder called Search.

21
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:45.860
And if you want to have, for example, forward slash search for slash image, you need to create another

22
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.300
folder here inside the search called Image.

23
00:01:52.670 --> 00:02:00.680
And then if you want to have the page and see it inside your browser, you just need to create a file

24
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.370
called page dot JS X.

25
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.890
So you can see here we have page X for the forward slash.

26
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.150
Now we have another paychecks inside the image folder.

27
00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:23.900
So if we now create an React functional component with the name, for example, we want to make it unique.

28
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.570
So we just say image.

29
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.290
Search page.

30
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:43.920
Now, if you go to our website and we go to the image page and if we refresh the page, we see the image

31
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:52.180
search page and also the other great things you see that we still can see the footer of our website.

32
00:02:52.200 --> 00:03:01.800
The reason we see the footer is we have the footer inside the layout 36 Gsx, which is covering all

33
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.650
the pages because the layout, the G6 in the root of the app directory.

34
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.310
Covers all the pages under it.

35
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:19.110
So it shows all the children inside it and the footer is inside the body section.

36
00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:29.880
But if you want to have a specific, for example, header only for the image page, we can just put

37
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.950
it inside the image folder.

38
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.550
We want to create a layout and put it in the image folder.

39
00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.740
And all the things we want to do is to add another page called RIP.

40
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.900
So inside the search folder we create another folder and we call it web.

41
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:55.400
And inside the wave, you're going to create another file called page dot G's X.

42
00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:06.030
So let's create a React functional component here, and we change the name of this one to Web search

43
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:07.680
page.

44
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.530
So now we have this page as well.

45
00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.570
Let's check it inside the browser.

46
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.840
Now we go to Web as well.

47
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:24.270
We see web search page and also we have the footer.

48
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.440
That is amazing.

49
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.010
And if you want to have a header both for the.

50
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.020
Image.

51
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:37.320
Page And also for the web page, we need to put the layout inside the search folder.

52
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:43.100
So the layout inside the search folder is going to cover both of the image and the web.

53
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:51.150
So if you want to have something common, go one forward back and create the layout that is there.

54
00:04:52.770 --> 00:05:01.200
So we're going to create another file here and we call it Layouts dot Gsx.

55
00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.390
So this layout, the G6, is going to be exactly like the other one.

56
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:16.220
So I'm going to copy everything inside the other layout that G6 and we put it there.

57
00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:19.960
And inside the search.

58
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.130
Layouts.

59
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.090
But.

60
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.100
This layout.

61
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:32.470
I'm just going to change the name of this layout to search layout.

62
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.790
We don't need footer because we already have the footer for this one.

63
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.590
So I'm going to remove the footer.

64
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.550
And it has the HTML tag.

65
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:44.920
It has the body tag.

66
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:52.780
But the difference is we're going to have a header here, a specific header for these two pages.

67
00:05:52.990 --> 00:06:01.900
So I'm going to create another header and we call it search header, which is common for the web and

68
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.580
this image.

69
00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.650
So search header, let's create this search header here inside the components.

70
00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:21.240
So Search header dot G6.

71
00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.980
Let's create a React functional component with the same name search header.

72
00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:36.960
Now we need to come back to the layout that G6 and import this search header, which is coming from

73
00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.400
the alias component for slash search header.

74
00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:49.800
The amazing things we see now is when we go to the web page here.

75
00:06:50.790 --> 00:07:00.270
Let's see the error of the the globals that says the address is different because we went to inside

76
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:01.770
another folder.

77
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:03.930
Okay.

78
00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:04.770
So.

79
00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:09.510
We can just.

80
00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.670
Go back another folder.

81
00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:17.930
Like this.

82
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.660
Okay.

83
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:24.020
These are not important.

84
00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:26.180
We just need to refresh the page.

85
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.800
Let's see the error.

86
00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:42.270
So the problem is we have not to HTML tag because we have one HTML tag in the layout in the root.

87
00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:48.000
And the layout of G6 is another new one that we have created.

88
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.240
It has an HTML tag too.

89
00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:53.430
So we have two external tags and body tag.

90
00:07:53.610 --> 00:08:02.490
So we just what we can do is just remove this HTML tag we just created there for that.

91
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:05.170
Put a body tag as well.

92
00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:09.010
So actually, we don't need this tape.

93
00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:10.990
So I'm going to delete this one.

94
00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:18.210
Just the one diff that is covering.

95
00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:24.120
Both of the search header and the children.

96
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:31.040
But we still have the body tag because we are under that layout, that G6.

97
00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:33.470
So let's see that we get an error.

98
00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.000
Now that was the hydration.

99
00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:37.720
Error.

100
00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.090
So we just say there is a mismatch.

101
00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:46.210
So if there is something repeated the search, the next case is going to warn us.

102
00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:52.930
So that's a good thing about next is, as you can see, we have search header for the web page.

103
00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.440
Search at the search web page.

104
00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:00.280
And also we have the footer if we go to image.

105
00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:09.160
We have still the same search header, but we have image search page and we have the footer.

106
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:16.270
So that is very simple to create pages and layouts in next year.

107
00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:25.750
But in next year's 12, where the the way was completely different, we we had a.

108
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:31.660
Another folder called Pages, and we didn't have anything like layout.

109
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:35.350
We had to create our manual layout inside the app.

110
00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:40.370
JS So that's a good things about the next 613.

111
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:49.310
So let's add this one to the GitHub and the next section we're going to complete the header search header

112
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:50.000
component.

113
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.450
So now we just add this one to GitHub.

114
00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:59.570
So I'm going to add everything by clicking on the plus sign and inside the commit, I'm going to add

115
00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:04.010
a message, let's say create.

116
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:06.960
For example.

117
00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.560
Search.

118
00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:18.510
Page for web and image.

119
00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:33.370
So let's commit and push it to GitHub and let's go back to our browser and we go to our GitHub repository.

120
00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:37.300
Now we can refresh the page and see the changes here.

121
00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:43.240
So we have created a new command called Create Search page for web and Image.

122
00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:46.680
Let's review what we have done.

123
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:57.300
So we have created a file page that is inside a folder called Image and Search, which is going to create

124
00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:03.480
if page for forward slash search for slash image.

125
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:11.550
And the content is just image search page inside the we inside the search folder, we have created a

126
00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:22.770
new file called Layouts, which is going to be exclusive layout for two pages, web and image.

127
00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:24.110
So which is going to cover.

128
00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:29.190
That's why we put it in the search folder, not in their folder.

129
00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:39.730
And we just created and imported another component called search header header, which is common for

130
00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.080
two pages.

131
00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:44.830
Then we have created another page called.

132
00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:52.880
Before for the Web, and they have created a file called Page six, which is just a text, same web

133
00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.070
page with search page.

134
00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:02.900
And finally, we have created another component called Search Header, that Gsx, which is going to

135
00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.000
be common in two pages.

136
00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:12.500
So you have learned that we if you want something common between two things, you need to create it

137
00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:18.140
in a folder where that is the parent for both pages.

138
00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:25.180
So in the next section, we're going to complete this search header size and we're going to create it

139
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:34.340
similar to the final version with the logo, the search box here on the right side, the menu with the

140
00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:36.290
load assigning button.

141
00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:41.750
And we're going to keep continue creating these two pages.

142
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:48.290
So see, in the next section for the header part of the search pages.
