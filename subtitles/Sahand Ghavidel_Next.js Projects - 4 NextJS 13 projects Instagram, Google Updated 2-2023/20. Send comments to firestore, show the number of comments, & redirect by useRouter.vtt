1
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.720
Alright.

2
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.990
In the last section we have installed and implement React model.

3
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.140
In this section we're going to send the data.

4
00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:17.650
To the database.

5
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:25.480
And we we redirect to the new page, which is for that particular post.

6
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.550
So now, uh.

7
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.230
Let's check our website so far.

8
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:35.570
So now.

9
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.340
We can have a comment, we can write down something.

10
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.050
It's just nice.

11
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.390
And this is going to.

12
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:50.200
Uh, no.

13
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.780
Because, uh, we didn't implement this, sending the data.

14
00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.050
So we want to, when we click on the reply, we want to send the data to the.

15
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.290
Firestone.

16
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.080
Also, we want to close this window after death.

17
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.590
Okay.

18
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.600
Let's go back to Visual Studio code.

19
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.670
Now, one thing I noticed is just when we don't have an image.

20
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:26.790
This dot icon, dot horizon horizontal icon is not at the end and these are not distributed here.

21
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.300
We can easily fix that.

22
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:39.180
We just need to go to Poster J.S. And just after the image for the right side, we have it there.

23
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.520
We just add a flex one.

24
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.930
So and right side is going to occupy all this space.

25
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.370
So now if you check it, go on the right side.

26
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.050
Okay, we fix this one.

27
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.810
Let's go and complete their function sent post.

28
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.330
So if we go back to.

29
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:09.640
Uh, I think we should go to comment model that yes, we created a remember if we create a function

30
00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.720
sent comment.

31
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.440
But we haven't completed yet.

32
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.750
Okay.

33
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:27.190
Here, we want to get the information, send information and add a new document to the database.

34
00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.830
And if you look at the database now.

35
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.310
Well, except for the last one.

36
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:35.360
Hello.

37
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:45.170
Uh, and the other ones we have, this is the document, and each document has some fields, and this

38
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:51.290
document has another collection, which is like, we want to add another collection similar to likes,

39
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.960
but the name would be comments.

40
00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.020
Okay, let's go back to Visual Studio code and here we need to.

41
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.630
Create a wait and talk.

42
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.940
But as we are using it, wait.

43
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:15.130
We need to make this function asynchronous because the attack is returning a promise.

44
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.500
We are getting some data from it.

45
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:24.340
So Ad Dah is going to get a collection.

46
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:32.650
And the collection we want to target is from our TV that we have created inside the posts.

47
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:34.500
Collection.

48
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:44.650
Then we want to target the post I.D. because we want to target the particular post that we clicked on

49
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.690
the chat icon.

50
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:56.290
Remember, we save this one inside the estate here and we are getting it from a cool global estate.

51
00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.800
So we have this information and inside this, we want to create a new collection.

52
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.350
Called comments.

53
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.970
Okay.

54
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.210
And this comments is going to include a few things.

55
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:17.760
For example, we can get the comment itself, which is equal to input whatever inside the input box.

56
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.970
And this input is coming from here.

57
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:27.270
User State It's empty at the beginning, but when we write down, it's going to be updated and we get

58
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:28.830
the final one.

59
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.430
Then we, we can get the name of the person that is writing the comment.

60
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.320
We can get it from session.

61
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.700
That user, that name.

62
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.590
You can get also the username as well.

63
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:56.290
It's going to be phishing that's using that username just to let this happen and let me mute my computer.

64
00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.830
Okay.

65
00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.100
Uh, and then we kind of get that user image.

66
00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.440
Oh, user img for short.

67
00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:05.870
This is coming from session.

68
00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:06.530
That user.

69
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:07.420
That user.

70
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.850
I am not a user I AMG image.

71
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:15.030
J.

72
00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:24.260
And also we can just check, save the time too, which is the time stamp and we can use this server.

73
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.500
Server timestamp function from Fire Firebase.

74
00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.210
So let's import this.

75
00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:36.860
This is from Firestorm.

76
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.210
Let's import at dark.

77
00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:42.310
Collection.

78
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:49.180
And, uh, we have, we have to import TV as well.

79
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.310
I think we have imported before.

80
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.180
Yeah, that's here.

81
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:55.310
Okay.

82
00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.190
That's everything.

83
00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.780
Looks okay now.

84
00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.200
So after we call this function.

85
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.100
We want to close the.

86
00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.010
Close the window.

87
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.560
So we set the open to false.

88
00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:23.140
I didn't ad loading because fire stories very fast when we send only the comment.

89
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:28.930
But if the comment includes the image, we need to add the loading too.

90
00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:36.610
But for now, just for simplicity, we didn't add any loading because it's very fast and we just set

91
00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.470
the input to empty string again.

92
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:39.280
Okay.

93
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.370
Let's try it.

94
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.240
So now let's comment something here.

95
00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:47.610
Uh.

96
00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:49.200
Or just, uh.

97
00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.110
Oh, yeah.

98
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:51.870
Let's do this.

99
00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:52.260
Here.

100
00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.060
Now let's delete it.

101
00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:54.690
And then.

102
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.340
Uh, no, we do not have any comments, actually.

103
00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.920
So let's add a comment.

104
00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:01.070
Just.

105
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.150
We just say nice.

106
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.950
And let's check the database.

107
00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:09.770
For the last one.

108
00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:10.800
This is.

109
00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.750
Hello, maybe this is here.

110
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:14.960
We have another one with the text.

111
00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:15.420
Hello.

112
00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.990
Now we have the comment collection.

113
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.080
Uh.

114
00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:26.060
So we have.

115
00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:30.200
Let me check here.

116
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.610
I write down comment.

117
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.230
It should be comments, actually.

118
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.370
That's fine.

119
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:37.190
Next time you're going to, it's working.

120
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.700
So comment because it's going to be more than comments.

121
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:45.530
Maybe we have more comments in one post.

122
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:46.800
Okay.

123
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:50.510
The comment has a unique ID that is generated automatically.

124
00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.030
Then the comment is saying nice.

125
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:56.360
And the person who write down it's going to be will.

126
00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:03.430
Then we have the time stamp and we have user image and user name and.

127
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:03.800
Okay.

128
00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:08.530
So let's try it again with another account.

129
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:09.460
For example, this one.

130
00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:09.910
Nice.

131
00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.420
Let's add a set.

132
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:16.330
Amazing pic.

133
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.770
Let's look at the reply.

134
00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:23.160
Okay.

135
00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.690
Let's go back.

136
00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:26.990
Uh.

137
00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:29.280
Yeah.

138
00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:34.770
This one has a comments now collection and the unique idea.

139
00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:35.280
Amazing.

140
00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.310
Pick the name the person to write down.

141
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:40.860
Everything is here and the user image.

142
00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:42.890
So that's okay.

143
00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.990
Now in the next step.

144
00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:52.940
We are going to redirect a person to in the to the specific page for that post.

145
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:56.720
We can do that using a router.

146
00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:02.250
And next next year's has a.

147
00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:09.870
Has a hook called use router that we can simply route between the pages.

148
00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:15.400
So let's import that one here inside the comment model.

149
00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:21.250
So under this we can import use.

150
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:23.310
Round two.

151
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:32.640
This is much more simpler than React because in React we need to go to app the G and add the root and

152
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:35.520
manually for each page.

153
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:43.380
But here we just need to create the page inside this folder and then we just use user outer.

154
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:49.830
We don't need to do any extra things or added inside the app that just that's very simple.

155
00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:54.210
So this is coming from Nick's home slash router.

156
00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:58.870
Then we need to initialize this router here.

157
00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:04.390
We just need to just router is equal to use.

158
00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:08.110
Rather similar to the we use for use session.

159
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:10.830
Okay.

160
00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:12.210
We initialize it now.

161
00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:14.670
We can easily redirect a person.

162
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:15.390
So after.

163
00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:18.730
Uh, close the window.

164
00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:22.120
We can redirect the person.

165
00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.790
To the by using push.

166
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.660
And this is going to be dynamic, too.

167
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:37.260
So we add a back tech and this is going to be the post I.D..

168
00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:42.440
Or we can just add a just say posts.

169
00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:44.650
And.

170
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:50.430
Just, uh, we can go to post already.

171
00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.580
Okay, so let's try it.

172
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.810
Now we add another comment here.

173
00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:01.420
And.

174
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.230
Let's refresh.

175
00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:10.040
I think.

176
00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:10.500
Yeah.

177
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:10.990
Know stuff.

178
00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.760
I don't know why this service stopped.

179
00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:16.120
Okay.

180
00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:23.350
So let's try again.

181
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:40.860
Okay.

182
00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:41.910
It's loaded.

183
00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:44.640
And also, we are signed in.

184
00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:47.510
So let's add another comment.

185
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:48.720
We just say.

186
00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.080
Hello World.

187
00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:54.950
The reply.

188
00:11:55.860 --> 00:12:03.450
After the reply we should be redirected to a new page which is post and this is the idea of the post,

189
00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:09.160
but the page is not created yet, so we are getting a four or four error.

190
00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:09.960
That is fine.

191
00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.250
Just for now.

192
00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:15.660
We just redirected this and later we are going to create this page.

193
00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:17.450
So in the next section.

194
00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:21.600
But now the other things I want to do.

195
00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.870
It's just show the number of likes here.

196
00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:29.290
So we can simply do that.

197
00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:33.520
You did it before in the last section.

198
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:43.420
As a practice, I would suggest that you stop this video and just do it based on this.

199
00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:48.130
The one that you previously did for the likes.

200
00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:54.670
Just for the hints you need to use use effects to get the data.

201
00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:05.600
For all the comments and you just need to get the length of their all comments and show it here.

202
00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:09.710
Okay, so stop the video and do it.

203
00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:11.220
Okay.

204
00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:13.370
Now I'm going to do it myself.

205
00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:22.040
But if you have done it congratulation, you can watch the video and see my way of doing okay.

206
00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:26.000
So let's go back to Visual Studio code.

207
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.550
We need to do this one in the post GSA, because actually we did for the last number of plaques.

208
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:35.690
For number of likes.

209
00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:45.650
If you remember, we ve created a piece of state using user state and we called it live.

210
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:47.200
Okay.

211
00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:58.050
And then by using use effects, we got all the likes and we sit there like this function to the snapshot

212
00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:01.490
attacks and the on the.

213
00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:08.970
Curry was the host post that Ayden likes.

214
00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:13.740
And this is going to be similar but instead of likes which are sick comments.

215
00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:18.030
And after doing that.

216
00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:22.580
We just need to go now.

217
00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:23.970
Wee wee.

218
00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:25.440
Inside the.

219
00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:28.970
Heart icon after heart icon.

220
00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:33.560
We just say if the number of likes is more than zero, then.

221
00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:37.000
Just to show the number of likes.

222
00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:37.600
That's it.

223
00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:42.070
So let's do the same things for the comments.

224
00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:49.360
So we just need to first to let's copy this.

225
00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:51.850
It's sort of like.

226
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.970
Well, let's change this one two comments.

227
00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:02.350
This one should be at capital and it's an empty string as well.

228
00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:09.370
And for the we can just copy this virus very similar.

229
00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:11.590
And.

230
00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:15.560
Instead of likes.

231
00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.140
We just have to search for comments.

232
00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:23.050
Then we set the comments.

233
00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:28.010
The snapshot that ducks.

234
00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.090
That's it.

235
00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:37.350
And we go after the chat icon.

236
00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:46.590
Let's, uh, put chat icon inside it, dear first, because we want them to be next to each other.

237
00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:47.280
So.

238
00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:57.780
First they bring it inside this and after this chat icon, we're going to check that if there is any

239
00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:58.590
comments.

240
00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:03.570
So comments that length.

241
00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:06.630
Is greater than zero.

242
00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:09.060
Then.

243
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:12.740
We want to show the number of it.

244
00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:14.750
So.

245
00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.330
You can just add it's been here.

246
00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:24.120
Okay.

247
00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:25.280
We cannot do it here.

248
00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:30.910
So inside this barn, we just say.

249
00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:32.700
Comments.

250
00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:35.950
That link.

251
00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:39.450
And this should be zero.

252
00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:39.710
Not.

253
00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:41.480
Okay.

254
00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:43.530
So let's see.

255
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:45.130
Yeah.

256
00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.960
We have the number of comments here.

257
00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:50.580
This one has one comment.

258
00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:51.960
This one has long gone.

259
00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:53.160
Let's add another one.

260
00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.270
Why don't we write down here just.

261
00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:57.480
Yeah.

262
00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:01.110
Now we have two comments and we're redirected to the post.

263
00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:02.880
Okay.

264
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:09.900
So now we have to let's bring this one next to each other.

265
00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:19.490
But just in the TV added we just flags and we bring them horizontally next to each other using item

266
00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:20.270
center.

267
00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:23.730
And also we can use select none.

268
00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:31.980
So that's number one is not going to be selected like the one we did for the heart icon.

269
00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:34.880
So now they are next to each other.

270
00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:40.640
But this is a little bit bigger the number just we can in the span.

271
00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:43.750
We can change the text.

272
00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:46.870
Uh.

273
00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.590
Let's just make a small Texas.

274
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:49.900
A small.

275
00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:52.850
That's it.

276
00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:55.330
It looks fine.

277
00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:01.400
This one is okay too.

278
00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:03.380
Okay.

279
00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:07.450
So, uh.

280
00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:19.540
So everything is fine.

281
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:25.190
Okay.

282
00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:32.270
Let's add everything to the get up, which has to get at all.

283
00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:37.790
And kids come in with a message of.

284
00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:40.770
Send.

285
00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.690
Comments.

286
00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:50.540
To fire a store.

287
00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.400
And show the number of.

288
00:18:58.680 --> 00:18:59.520
Comments.

289
00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:05.840
Let's remove this and.

290
00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.000
Because we did the redirect.

291
00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:11.170
So I would just say.

292
00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:12.760
And.

293
00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:17.210
Uh.

294
00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:20.320
Redirects.

295
00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:25.720
Using use round to.

296
00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:28.500
Okay.

297
00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:34.330
Let's push everything to kick it and we check.

298
00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.880
What we have done so far.

299
00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:41.690
So we can click on the Tweeter to refresh the page.

300
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:44.150
Now we have 21 comments.

301
00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:53.650
Then last fall he sent comments to firestorm showed a number of comments and direct using user after.

302
00:19:54.080 --> 00:20:02.540
So inside the comment model that yes we have important users out there and also we have imported many

303
00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:04.400
things from fires store.

304
00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:16.380
We initialized the router and we completed the send comment function by just adding the add dock.

305
00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:20.220
And we send the information.

306
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:23.270
Through this collection.

307
00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:32.630
And then we close the window, we set the input to empty and also we redirect the person to the post

308
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:37.550
page, which is in the post post.

309
00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:38.480
Last post I'd.

310
00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:41.790
Then inside a poster.

311
00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:42.420
Cheers.

312
00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:44.460
In order to show the comments.

313
00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:47.940
We have created a new state called Comments.

314
00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:52.170
Then we use user state.

315
00:20:54.100 --> 00:21:08.050
So to use the fact to track the effects and uh, we just got the, all the comments from this post ID

316
00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:14.170
and then we set it into the comments state then.

317
00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:17.250
Uh, we have, uh.

318
00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.530
This is for just fixing that.

319
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:20.650
That horizon.

320
00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:22.940
And also.

321
00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:28.000
We added after the chat icon, we said if.

322
00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:31.670
Their comments is more than one.

323
00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:32.900
More than zero.

324
00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:40.820
Just show the number of them, and then we just bring them next to each other using display flags.

325
00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:42.170
Okay.

326
00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:45.080
That was it for this section in the next section.

327
00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:49.700
I feel that we are ready to create the.

328
00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:53.720
Post the.

329
00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:54.920
Post the.

330
00:21:57.610 --> 00:21:59.260
Page, for example?

331
00:21:59.320 --> 00:21:59.920
No.

332
00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:02.780
If he had a comment here.

333
00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:06.930
We are going to be redirected.

334
00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:16.180
To a particular page for this post which has the sidebar.

335
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:24.310
What's happening and who to follow is similar to the one we created then also.

336
00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:32.120
We are seeing the light in the comments at all at the bottom of this.

337
00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.240
Particular page.

338
00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:37.530
Okay.

339
00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:39.120
Uh, so soon.

340
00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:43.290
The next section for creating this page.
