1
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:04,400
Alright.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,450
In the last section we have completed our website.

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:16,070
In this section we're going to deploy it to the internet and the website we are going to use is Verso.

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,050
So we need to go to Google and we search for Versal.

5
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:28,110
In the search results, we click on the website with the URL virtual dot com.

6
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:32,840
And here this is a free.

7
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,280
Website for your deployment.

8
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:47,310
And then you can just if you have an account, you can just go to the virtual dot com and here, click

9
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:51,120
on the Add New and click on project.

10
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,140
And here, if you are, sign in.

11
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:02,570
And also you are you sign in with your GitHub repository, you can see your GitHub here.

12
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,130
So I can see my IMDB GitHub here.

13
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:11,340
So I can click on import to auto import this GitHub repository to the internet.

14
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,250
So I'm going to click here on import.

15
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,020
So he's asking me for the project name.

16
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:25,700
I just say IMDB clone and the framework I'm using is next.

17
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:26,540
Yes.

18
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,120
So we're going to use the root directory because we don't have an extra root.

19
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:35,330
This is one is going to use the root directory.

20
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:43,340
And also we need to add our environmental variable here, which is coming from if you go to the Explorer

21
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:48,500
section, we put our environmental variable inside this file, dot IMV, dot local.

22
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:58,190
So I'm going to copy this API key and put it as a name and we just copy this one and put it here as

23
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:00,090
a value and we're going to add it.

24
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:07,730
So Versal is going to protect this API key for us and nobody can use it and see it inside the internet,

25
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:11,660
especially if you use it only on the server side.

26
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,670
So actually next.

27
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:17,450
Yes, is actually a backend as well.

28
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:28,730
So even the all the producers and creators of the next year in the last webinar they said virtual next.

29
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:29,000
Yes.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,960
Is a backend actually framework, not the front end.

31
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:41,240
So this is going to do for you something that Node.js four two for us protecting and just nobody see

32
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,030
anything that is happening inside the server.

33
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,600
So now that we have added the environmental variable.

34
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,530
And we just put the project name so we can just click on deploy to deploy it.

35
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:02,370
If there is no error, this is going to take just a few seconds to be finished.

36
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:05,880
And we can see our website online.

37
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:15,220
I already deployed here so you can see it inside the IMDB 100 projects dot com.

38
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:21,940
So if you want to compare your projects and see the final version, but I'm going to show you how to

39
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,580
deploy it again here.

40
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:32,230
And after the deployment, you can also assign a new domain, if you want to, a specific domain or

41
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:35,740
some custom domain, you can do it here.

42
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,050
It's very simple as well.

43
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:44,830
So now I just you can see that we got the congratulation and our website is.

44
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,720
Uh, deployed.

45
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:54,740
So we can just click on here to go to see our website, which is now inside IMDB.

46
00:03:55,130 --> 00:04:04,010
Dash Clone, Dash, Flame, Dash, ETA, dot dot app, which is the randomly created by Verso.

47
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:07,490
So let's test, for example, I go to this page.

48
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:16,640
Yes, you can see it is much faster than the when we we are in the development mode and you can just

49
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,280
go to the about page and then go to the top rate.

50
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,350
Even you don't see this banner.

51
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:28,570
It's very fast is still we can see this is working here as well.

52
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,250
Let's search for something, for example, Wolf.

53
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,690
As you can see, it's super fast.

54
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,040
And yet.

55
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:45,820
So if you want to use, for example, a custom domain name, as I mentioned before, you can add it

56
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,810
here.

57
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:54,520
So, for example, if you click on the continue to Dashboard, you can go to view domains and use a

58
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,510
new domain here.

59
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:04,480
So example, you add the domain here and then you can add the data inside your domain and see it here.

60
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:14,560
So you need to go to the DNS of your domain and then add the domain here to easily deploy it with actually

61
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,880
free sstl.

62
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,230
So also you can edit the domain here.

63
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,780
For example, anything that is available.

64
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:29,720
For example IMDB clone dot Versal dot app.

65
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,970
Let's see.

66
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,030
This is not available.

67
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,740
R&amp;B.

68
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,810
Clone, for example, Dash.

69
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,200
Whatever.

70
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,480
For example, version two.

71
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,340
Okay, now this one is available.

72
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,230
So this is your new address.

73
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:59,220
So whatever is available you can use, but you always get the dot versal if you don't use your custom

74
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,420
domain.

75
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,160
That was it for creating the project IMDB project.

76
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,320
I hope you enjoyed and learn many things.

77
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:15,670
See you in the next project.
