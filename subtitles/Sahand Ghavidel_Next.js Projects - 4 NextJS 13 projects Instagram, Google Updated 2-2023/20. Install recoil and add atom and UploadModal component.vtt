1
00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:14.900
All right, in the last section we have completed with the meaningful file and we got the real information

2
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.170
from the sessions.

3
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.950
We we updated this session to achieve the username.

4
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.390
We've got the image.

5
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:33.120
And also here we updated this story part in this section, we were going to create the model part here.

6
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:44.520
If you click and we go to the final version of the project and we click on this button here at the top

7
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.090
right.

8
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.530
We can see that if window pop up, that's actually we call it model.

9
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.700
And it has some features.

10
00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:06.770
It has the camera icon, but that's when we click it can choose a inside your computer and you can write

11
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.670
your caption and finally upload the post.

12
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:21.160
In this section, we just want to try to because for having this model, we need a stage.

13
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.390
That is global.

14
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:32.040
So for achieving this, we're going to use a package called recoil.

15
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.410
So if you go to our visual studio code.

16
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.210
And we open our.

17
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.400
Our website in the right side.

18
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.750
An index that J.S..

19
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.640
So we have already completed the feed section.

20
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.400
Now we are in the model, so we're going to create a component.

21
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:07.260
Called the upload model here, you just click here and we make.

22
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.050
We put the name.

23
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.280
Upload model 30 years.

24
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.860
We create a reactor functional component using RF C.

25
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:33.000
Now we can delete this react and in scientists return, we just right for now.

26
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.320
Moral.

27
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.510
And you just make it complete upload model.

28
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.410
All right.

29
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.460
So inside index that yes, let's close this extra thing.

30
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.670
So we have focus.

31
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.050
All right.

32
00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.660
Index that yes, we import that upload model.

33
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:15.470
So we can use outer space to get auto suggestion to import it as soon as we do it.

34
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.790
You should see the model at the bottom.

35
00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:21.500
Yeah, upload model.

36
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:29.030
So let's add the recoil as well to our project.

37
00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:40.430
So we go to the we go to Google and we search for recoil J.S. in the search results.

38
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.620
We can see a website called Recoil Genius dot org.

39
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:55.330
Which shows that recall works and think like react at some to your app and get fast and flexible, shared

40
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:56.220
a state.

41
00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.800
So we're going to click on recall notice.

42
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:08.100
And we can see that it's a very simple and minimal and.

43
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.570
Uh, you can watch this one later for yourself.

44
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.140
But we go to it gets us started part.

45
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:26.470
And if we scroll down a little bit here, the installation part, we can see the installation command,

46
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.230
which is npm installed three coil.

47
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.730
So we copy this and we go back to Visual Studio code.

48
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.140
He stopped the server using controversy.

49
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:44.470
It cleared the terminal and the pace, the code.

50
00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:56.090
So as soon as we installed, the installation process was very fast because the package is very small.

51
00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:57.590
Uh.

52
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.780
And it's very light and small, and it's easy to use.

53
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.250
So after the installation, we can see that we have to at the.

54
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.000
Recoil to the root of our application.

55
00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.980
If you remember, we did this one for the recession.

56
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:25.520
We covered our route by station provider.

57
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.380
We should do the same things with the recoil as well.

58
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.780
So we go to.

59
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:43.470
And underline app that, yes, if you remember we did decision provider, we need to do the same things

60
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:44.340
with the recoil.

61
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:57.000
So here at a time, we're going to import something called recoil with a Capital R recoil roots.

62
00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.070
And this is going to be from.

63
00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:03.910
Victoria.

64
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:12.980
So, Dan, we need to cover our application with this.

65
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.640
One is just a recoil brute.

66
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:27.670
We get the closing tag as well, and we bring this fun to the center.

67
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:37.400
Now we covered all our application with recoil and also this is inside this session, so everything

68
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.440
looks fine and nice.

69
00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:47.210
Now we can add the global estate in anywhere in our application.

70
00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:59.620
If you go back to the tutorial of recoil, if you scroll down this, they said, we need to create an

71
00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:04.090
atom and atom actually represent a piece of the state.

72
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:12.580
So for example, if you want to make a state for model, which is, uh, which is in the state, we

73
00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.170
need to create an atom for it.

74
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:23.950
Atom is kind of a storage for your global estate, so any time you want to call or change this state,

75
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:29.500
it's going to get it from the atom and take it from there.

76
00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.700
So we need to create a file.

77
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:42.270
And then we need to put this line of code inside that file, so we copy this.

78
00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:49.620
We go back to Visual Studio code and we create a folder outside.

79
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:57.250
I mean, in, for example, at this level, OK, we create a folder called Aton.

80
00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:08.060
And inside this folder, we create our estate, which we call it model in our case.

81
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.600
So it was just a model at home.

82
00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:16.220
The genius and inside is fast.

83
00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:20.310
We need to import Aton.

84
00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:22.490
First.

85
00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:27.470
From recoil.

86
00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:33.480
Sorry from Notre.

87
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:35.580
Yeah.

88
00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:38.790
And then we export.

89
00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:47.010
A constant cold model of state.

90
00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.980
Remember, we copy this one.

91
00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.030
All right.

92
00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:57.500
Just, uh.

93
00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:08.320
You can copy this or I was writing it, it doesn't matter, you can paste it here after the export.

94
00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:16.120
So instead of ticks, we're going to change the ticks to model.

95
00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:18.400
All right.

96
00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:20.890
So we have model stage.

97
00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:24.610
So the key is moral state.

98
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:28.960
And a default value is false.

99
00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:33.910
In our case, because we want the model to be close.

100
00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:35.590
All right.

101
00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:44.110
So we want to be clear, we want it to be closed as a default, but when we click on the button, we

102
00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:47.080
want to open it so we change it from false to true.

103
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:50.090
So we create the atom.

104
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:59.510
Now we can use it inside the upload model that we have created the component here.

105
00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.440
So inside the components we need to import.

106
00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:05.580
Few things.

107
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:08.070
The first one is.

108
00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:13.000
The item that we have created, the name was Mordo.

109
00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:27.180
This state from the state that's related to a model and it comes from and we go back and if all the

110
00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:36.750
back and we go inside the folder at home and inside the atom, we go to model at home, which is a model

111
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:37.800
atom that is.

112
00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.390
All right, so we have to model the state here.

113
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:52.650
We can use it and we need to use it, we need to creative states here, but we're not using to use the

114
00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:53.130
state.

115
00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:55.080
The normal use uses state use.

116
00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.840
This state is the low level state.

117
00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:06.440
We want to have something called, as you can see here, a state that, uh.

118
00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:11.520
We create a state that is the.

119
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:14.570
General, and it's a global.

120
00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:16.590
All right.

121
00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.740
So in order to achieve this one.

122
00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:27.010
We need to use something called use recoilless state.

123
00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:35.570
Because we're using recoil and we we uh, it's it's going to create us a global state.

124
00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:40.250
So we create a constant and we just say.

125
00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:50.100
We create a state called Open, and we set it open because we want to open and close the model and.

126
00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:54.930
We are going to use U.S recoil.

127
00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:57.400
A state.

128
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:03.980
And we have to import it.

129
00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:12.200
This is going to suggest us that we can click on this and import it at a top, so we're importing used

130
00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:20.690
recoil state from recoil and the initial value is coming from the atom because we will be have to each

131
00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:23.960
time call and check that in our store.

132
00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:28.570
What is the initial state and what is the level?

133
00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:33.530
Because this is a global state, we need to store it somewhere outside the components.

134
00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:39.700
So the initial value is the whatever the model state is.

135
00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:42.460
Is it false or is it true?

136
00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:45.000
But as a default is false.

137
00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:47.830
So no, the open is false.

138
00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:51.370
But the is not defined here.

139
00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:59.380
As usual, we do for users state it's comes from the top level, higher level or top level.

140
00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:01.110
All right.

141
00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:07.400
So here, let's check it this, we check if the open.

142
00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:13.970
If it's open, just the.

143
00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:19.840
H1 tag.

144
00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:24.530
All right.

145
00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:30.170
And just say the model is open.

146
00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:31.940
All right.

147
00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:34.610
Why shouldn't it show now?

148
00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:45.460
And if it's around the server and run there, we should just see the open upload model at the end of

149
00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:45.880
our.

150
00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:48.690
Website.

151
00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:50.390
Let me refresh.

152
00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:58.650
OK, we just think we're just seeing the upload model.

153
00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:04.040
So, no, we need to at the.

154
00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:13.890
Unclear on this button and create that estate in the header as well.

155
00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:20.480
So when we click on this button, we're going to change the open estate to true.

156
00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:25.380
And so we can't see it here under this one.

157
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:27.960
So we go back to Visual Studio Code.

158
00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:30.750
We go to Heterogeneous.

159
00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.320
At the top of the handle that yes.

160
00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:41.870
Just under this import import.

161
00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:48.800
We import a couple of things, so we're going to import.

162
00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:51.310
User Arthur.

163
00:14:54.820 --> 00:15:05.350
No, actually, uh, we use it later, but first we import recoil, used recoil estate because we want

164
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:14.110
to have that the same estate we had here inside the opal upload model, we had the open estate.

165
00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:19.120
The u00a0 could use recoil state.

166
00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.300
We're going to have the same things in the header.

167
00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:30.640
So we're going to control this open and close inside both of the header and open model.

168
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:35.080
That's why we are using actually a global state.

169
00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:36.070
All right.

170
00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:41.860
So in the header that you use, we're going to import this from.

171
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.270
Recoil.

172
00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:51.300
And after this, we need and other things we need at home as well.

173
00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:53.040
We created the atom.

174
00:15:54.290 --> 00:16:00.920
So because we need to specify the initial estimate, which was false, if you remember.

175
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:06.290
So we just say model the stage from.

176
00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.340
Dot dot, dot.

177
00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:13.770
We come back one fuller and we go to add Tom.

178
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:16.730
Uh, folder.

179
00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:23.510
And we just call, uh, we just saw a model actor.

180
00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:25.250
The death.

181
00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:29.890
All right.

182
00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:34.870
And now we can use it, so here first.

183
00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:40.690
Just after this, we don't need this law council log anymore.

184
00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:46.270
So we just here, we create a consent and we call it.

185
00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:48.060
Open.

186
00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:51.510
And set up a.

187
00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:13.620
OK, and then we equal this one to use recoil estate and initial value would be model of state.

188
00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.720
Which is coming from our A-Team.

189
00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:17.440
All right.

190
00:17:17.830 --> 00:17:26.350
So in this case, when we change the open state here, it's going to change in everywhere in our application,

191
00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:30.130
including open upload model 30th.

192
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.210
So here now how we change the open state as a.

193
00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:40.360
Let's refresh our website.

194
00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:42.420
To sign in.

195
00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:49.500
So when you click on this button, which is the plus icon, we want to open the.

196
00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:54.630
Model, so here at the bottom, we have this.

197
00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:59.430
Plus, circle icon, we add.

198
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:02.840
On Click.

199
00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:08.680
And the anklet would be a function that returns.

200
00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:11.810
That set open.

201
00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.000
Sit open.

202
00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:18.590
And we want to set the open to be true.

203
00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:24.240
As you remember, the default one was false.

204
00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:30.390
And now we said it to be true by clicking on this plus circle icon.

205
00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:37.830
For now, you can still see that we don't see that, uh, upload state.

206
00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:47.730
So we can see if the open is true, we get the model is open now, we don't see it because the open

207
00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:48.300
is false.

208
00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:50.430
When you click on here.

209
00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:53.270
We should see a change.

210
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:56.660
So now we can't see the model is open at the bottom.

211
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:58.040
All right.

212
00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:02.180
So we it's working fine now.

213
00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:06.290
And if you refresh the page, it should go back to forth.

214
00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:11.450
You can see every twist that again, the model is open.

215
00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:11.930
All right.

216
00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:16.100
In a next section, the things we do is.

217
00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:19.750
It is the final version of the project.

218
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:21.220
We're going to create.

219
00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:26.740
This model, this is actually not going to create it from scratch.

220
00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:37.060
We're going to use a package called REAC model and we easily can achieve this kind of model and as you

221
00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:42.220
can see, the model is open and the background is kind of

222
00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:51.670
blurry, some blurry just a little bit a little bit lighter.

223
00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:54.440
And the color is different.

224
00:19:54.920 --> 00:20:00.890
And when we click on our side tomorrow, we see this model is close.

225
00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:11.350
So are we going to change the estate of open and they say they've open from false the true by just clicking

226
00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:13.270
this on or clicking outside?

227
00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:22.540
And see, or when we upload the post, we're going to close it too, but we're going to get that later.

228
00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:30.210
First, we're going to create this model using React model package and we're going to achieve this,

229
00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:40.320
uh, closing things when we click outside the model first, we let's push everything to get up.

230
00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:44.650
So we have a friend's for later and we can review the code.

231
00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:48.060
So we just say get at.

232
00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:51.480
And we get comments.

233
00:20:56.340 --> 00:21:02.790
With the message of install recoil.

234
00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:07.590
And and at home.

235
00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:09.360
And.

236
00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:15.460
Upload.

237
00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:21.530
Model components.

238
00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:25.460
All right.

239
00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:30.040
Let's push it to get up and recheck it inside GitHub.

240
00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:32.120
Very clean.

241
00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:43.490
So here we refresh the page by clicking on this install version for or any name you put for your application.

242
00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:45.830
Now we have 20 commands.

243
00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:55.400
It means that we created almost, I think, 20 videos, and the video titles is the same as the comments.

244
00:21:55.940 --> 00:22:03.500
And if you go to the comments now we have the last one is here, which is I made a mistake of writing

245
00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:07.130
install recoil at.

246
00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:14.150
The problem is that the fixing this one is very hot and gets hot, but let it be like this.

247
00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:17.690
But in the title of the video, I'm going to fix this install.

248
00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:23.060
But install require an atom and upload model component.

249
00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:24.920
We click on this.

250
00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:28.940
As you can see, we created model action.

251
00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:33.350
That is inside the Atom folder.

252
00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:42.000
We create a piece of the state, which is model state, and the initial value is false.

253
00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:50.230
Then in the header, we imported recoil to state and model state.

254
00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:54.340
Both from recoil and models at one.

255
00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:05.210
We added an oncolytic inside the plus circle icon, so when we click on the plastic icon, be set to

256
00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:11.130
the open estate to be true as we defined here.

257
00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:22.680
And this is going to be everywhere because we made it globally and we made a component called upload

258
00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.870
upload model that you use.

259
00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:30.780
And here we define the, uh, the states as well.

260
00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:37.470
The reason we defined here because we need to use it here and also in the next section, we're going

261
00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:41.400
to win be install the React model.

262
00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:51.450
We're going to close the, uh, the model using apps set up and false by putting on click on everywhere

263
00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:53.790
in the screen except in model.

264
00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:04.960
So we installed two actually one packages, Rock recalled, probably this one is updated or I don't

265
00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.160
know what happened here.

266
00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:10.370
Was just out of the coma, if so.

267
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:20.130
And also an underlying app that you use, we use the recall route to cover all our applications, so

268
00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:29.070
we have access to the recall listings in everywhere in our application and index.

269
00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:34.500
That just which is our main page after the feed.

270
00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:43.800
We added another section model, which is upload model we've got from the components forward slash upload

271
00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:44.250
model.

272
00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:52.930
Yeah, that was it for this section in the next section, we're going to create the model using recoil

273
00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:56.980
using React model package.

274
00:24:57.490 --> 00:24:58.990
So see you in the next section.
