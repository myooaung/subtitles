1
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:04.290
All right.

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.310
In the last section, we have completed the about page.

3
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.270
In this section, we're going to create the nav bar component.

4
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.740
I just realized something that this page is not aligned with the.

5
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.800
Now with the header.

6
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:30.200
So because the header has some margin in the x axis, so we can simply fix that one by just adding a

7
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.860
more padding of four here.

8
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.200
Now, if we check, there should be in a line now.

9
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.600
For the nav bar.

10
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.050
I just want to show you how this one works.

11
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:54.360
So we're going to create a component called NAV four, and we put it inside the layout Gsx, which is

12
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.210
going to be in all pages.

13
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.000
Then inside the nav bar.

14
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.320
We have a div here.

15
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.290
Let me show it here for you.

16
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.170
So now we have a diff here.

17
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:18.930
And inside this one, we have two components, one for this one and one for the other one.

18
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:29.970
And we're going to pass the information like the title and these parameters here to that component.

19
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.570
So let's go back to Visual Studio Code, and we open the Explorer section.

20
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.260
And we go to layout the G6 and we create the nav bar here.

21
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.620
So we're going to get the nav bar.

22
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.840
It should be here, but we need to create it inside the components folder.

23
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.850
So we go to components folder.

24
00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:05.620
We create a new component and we call it nav bar dot Gsx and we can use RFC to create a React functional

25
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:14.080
component and we need to import this one inside the layout ESX by just using control space.

26
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.430
No, we should see the number in our website, which is here.

27
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.840
You can see it here.

28
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:32.580
And let's go and we pass the parameters inside the nav bar.

29
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.890
So inside the nav for we have.

30
00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.230
We're going to.

31
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:46.660
Have two new components, which is the nav bar item.

32
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.450
And let's.

33
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.990
So we're going to pass two things.

34
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.980
We're going to pass the title.

35
00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.600
Which for the first one is trending.

36
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.690
And the parameter I just call it Prem here.

37
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.880
And the parameter is for for the training is fetch.

38
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:20.660
Trending.

39
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:32.590
So in the final version we have here the title trending, and here the genre is Fetch Trending.

40
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.270
But for the top rated, the top, the title is top rated and the.

41
00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.500
And this genre parameter is fish top rated.

42
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:51.710
So we're going to copy this one and change the title for the next one, which is top rated.

43
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.410
And this one should be.

44
00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.550
Fetch top rated.

45
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:10.180
Okay, Now we need to create this component and get these attributes.

46
00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.760
And we show it inside there.

47
00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:23.510
So we're going to create a component and we call it name for item that is X and we created by using

48
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:24.560
ref C.

49
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.670
Here.

50
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.650
We can get the parameters.

51
00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.100
Which is the we get the title and prep.

52
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.190
And we can show it here for now.

53
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.360
We just say, for example, Etch font title and then.

54
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.560
Let's see and check it.

55
00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.700
These errors is actually not error.

56
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.860
This is just for the production development section.

57
00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.350
In the production, you don't get these errors.

58
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.060
So we have an error saying the nav bar item is not defined.

59
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.320
So we're going to go back to the nav port, the G6.

60
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:17.550
Here and we just import this number item by using control space.

61
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.950
We also import that.

62
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.470
And now we should see the trending and top rated inside the nav bar.

63
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.840
Let's style them here.

64
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.360
So let me bring this one to the right side.

65
00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:36.260
And then we just bring them next to each other.

66
00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.430
I'm going to close the Explorer section so we have more space.

67
00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.750
Now we can style them in real time and check them.

68
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.240
So we can get add a class name here.

69
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.980
We change the display to flags to bring them next to each other.

70
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:58.060
And we just used Justify Content center.

71
00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:59.790
And.

72
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:02.890
To just.

73
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.100
Align them next to each other correctly.

74
00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:12.300
And the.

75
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:17.500
Let's see what we can change here.

76
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.250
So.

77
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.360
And the other things I want to do.

78
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.400
I think that is enough for this one.

79
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:35.510
We just need some space between them so we can add this space inside the.

80
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.560
Debt now for item.

81
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:47.060
So here, instead of title showing the title, I want to add a link here link tag because I want to

82
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.620
link between them.

83
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:56.270
So I'm going to just add a link tag which is coming from next for slash link.

84
00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.680
And this one has a H ref.

85
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.080
The address.

86
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.420
And the address for this one is.

87
00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.140
Forward slash.

88
00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.590
And with the parameter genre.

89
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.580
And this is going to be dynamic.

90
00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:22.860
So we need to add a back take here and at the end so we can have a dynamic parameter.

91
00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:28.530
So the dynamic font, we can add it by adding a dollar sign.

92
00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.900
And this is going to be prem.

93
00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:41.620
And for those who don't know, this backpack is located on the top of the tab key on on the keyboard.

94
00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:45.130
It's not the clone, it's bektic.

95
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.750
So now we get the parameter here.

96
00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:56.430
And inside the link tag we're going to have.

97
00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:58.280
That's a.

98
00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:01.090
Title.

99
00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:06.090
So let's see that we can add this title here.

100
00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:10.650
Now we should see that.

101
00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:17.140
Let's save it and see it here in real time.

102
00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:26.830
So let's refresh the page.

103
00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.210
Now we see the nav bar.

104
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:35.980
So if we click on the trending.

105
00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:45.430
I want to show you, if we click on Trending or top rated, we go to genre for slash fish trending.

106
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:50.080
If you click on top rated, we go to fetch top rated.

107
00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:55.710
So now let's install this nav nav bar.

108
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:59.370
So we go back to Visual Studio Code and we go to nav for.

109
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.270
Let's bring this one to the right side.

110
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:10.350
I want this now board to have two colors, one for the light mode and one for the dark mode.

111
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:18.210
So here inside this div that we have added the Flex and Justify Content center.

112
00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:24.620
I want to add some things for the dark mode, so I'm going to just sit dark in the dark mode.

113
00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:28.730
I want to have the background color gray.

114
00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:32.190
600.

115
00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:39.030
And let's see that we can see the change.

116
00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:46.630
So I'm going to save this one.

117
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:48.030
I refresh the page.

118
00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:56.620
Yes, we have the background color gray and in the light mode, I want to have the background color.

119
00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:59.380
Amber 100.

120
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:12.820
So and then we in the large size and above, I want the text to be larger.

121
00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:21.940
So just use text large and let's have some padding of four pixels.

122
00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:26.470
So this is the now we have.

123
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:29.710
And inside the light mode we have a different color.

124
00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:31.630
Amber 100.

125
00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:38.140
So let's install each of these items inside the nav bar item.

126
00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:40.700
I think we don't need this file anymore.

127
00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.300
I'm going to close this one.

128
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:45.730
So inside the nav item that gsx.

129
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:51.260
We can add the styles inside this link.

130
00:10:51.260 --> 00:11:04.310
So I'm going to open this, add a class name because I want to have a kind of dynamic styling because

131
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:11.990
based on the if this one is selected, I want to have an undergrad on the line too.

132
00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:16.100
So I want to add a dynamic one.

133
00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:19.640
So I'm going to add a back tick here.

134
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:26.060
First, I want to add some margin in the margin of four.

135
00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:31.710
So this is going to add some space between them.

136
00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.820
Let's let's see now we have the.

137
00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:42.570
Cursor to pointer and when we hover over it, I want the color to be.

138
00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:48.190
Amber 600.

139
00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:51.980
Like this.

140
00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:57.270
Okay.

141
00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:58.320
And then.

142
00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:03.790
Let's make the font to be semi bold.

143
00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:15.300
And padding of two, we can add some padding as well.

144
00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:19.800
So we add some more space.

145
00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:22.800
For the underline.

146
00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:27.570
So now we we finish with the common part.

147
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.400
Now we want to add the.

148
00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.290
Dynamic parts for the dynamic.

149
00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:36.050
I want to see if the genre is finished.

150
00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:36.980
Top rated.

151
00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:41.930
I want to add the underline here.

152
00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:49.310
If this one is fetch trending, I want to add the underlying here, so we need to get the parameter.

153
00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:55.380
Uh, from the URL in next.

154
00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:56.020
Yes.

155
00:12:56.650 --> 00:13:05.020
For the components, we need to use something called search programs.

156
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:09.550
And we use the use search from Hawk.

157
00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:13.990
Search.

158
00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:15.640
Prem.

159
00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:27.970
It's called search prams, and it's coming from Nick's forward slash navigation.

160
00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:33.540
And we need to initialize this one here.

161
00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:38.650
So after the exports.

162
00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.100
We can initialize this.

163
00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:45.300
We just need the search params.

164
00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.240
So I'm going to create a constant.

165
00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.730
I call it search.

166
00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:56.520
Prams.

167
00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:02.750
And this is going to be equal to use search programs.

168
00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:05.710
Hook that we got here.

169
00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:12.120
But because we are using Hook, we cannot use this component in server side.

170
00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:16.320
We can do we just have to change it to client component.

171
00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:21.400
So we need to add this client at the top, use client.

172
00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:29.820
K Now we shouldn't get an error.

173
00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:36.120
And then by using this search prams, we can understand the pram here.

174
00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:44.740
So from this use search params, we can get the parameters as genre.

175
00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:47.260
So I'm going to create another constant.

176
00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.600
I'm going to call it genre.

177
00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:52.570
And this is going to be equal to.

178
00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:58.240
This search preamps and it has a method called get.

179
00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:01.420
And we're going to get the genre from that.

180
00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:05.650
Now we can use this one inside the link.

181
00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:10.890
So for the dynamic styling, I'm going to add.

182
00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:15.870
A dollar sign to add a dynamic one.

183
00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:17.610
And then we just say.

184
00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:27.010
If the genre exists, because sometimes you are in the in the home page, you don't have genre.

185
00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:29.260
If the genre exists.

186
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:39.440
And genre is equal to the premium that we are getting from this props.

187
00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:43.680
We want to have the color.

188
00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:47.820
So let's this.

189
00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:51.090
Let's remove this one, this suggestion.

190
00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:58.910
So I want to add some different.

191
00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:03.270
Collar and under underline.

192
00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:06.450
So I want to have it underlined firstly.

193
00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:09.270
Then.

194
00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:17.820
I want to change the underlying offset to be eight, which is the space between the underline and the

195
00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:18.600
text.

196
00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:22.840
You can see here now.

197
00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:33.800
I wanted to have a declaration of four, which is the thickness of the underlying declaration for.

198
00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:37.600
So it would be thicker.

199
00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:44.830
And I want to change the color of the decoration to be amber.

200
00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.190
500.

201
00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:59.030
And also I want it to be rounded.

202
00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:01.070
So I'm just say around it.

203
00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:05.180
Large, large.

204
00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:08.420
So it has a rounded corner after that.

205
00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.210
So I'm going to save this one.

206
00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:14.400
And now.

207
00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:18.270
If you go to training.

208
00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:21.610
We see the underlying is under trending.

209
00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:26.470
If you go to top rated, we see the underline is under top rated.

210
00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:35.640
So we could see it inside the final version, too, so we could manage to have a dynamic styling as

211
00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:35.910
well.

212
00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:39.360
For dynamic styling, we just need to have a back tick.

213
00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:44.850
And inside the dynamic section we added dollar sign and curly braces.

214
00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:48.450
And here we just add our conditions.

215
00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:50.550
We just say if the genre exists.

216
00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:58.760
So if, for example, if you are in the home page and there is no genre, we don't get any underline.

217
00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:05.240
But if the genre is equal to, for example, top trending, we get the online here.

218
00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:08.960
If it's top fetch, top rated, we get it here.

219
00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:12.160
So.

220
00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:20.410
It's also working for the light mode as well.

221
00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:28.060
In the light and dark mode, we have a different background color for the nav bar and if you click here,

222
00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:33.850
we still see this color inside this light mode and dark mode.

223
00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:37.870
So that was it for the nav bar component.

224
00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:42.040
In the next section, we're going to work on the.

225
00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:45.770
Fetching data from the MDB API.

226
00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:54.040
But for now we just add everything to GitHub using contour shift G by clicking on this plot sign and

227
00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:57.940
we just make a message, which is create.

228
00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:05.560
The NAV for component.

229
00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:15.960
And we can click here and click on Commit and push to push it into GitHub and we can check what we have

230
00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:21.420
done inside the GitHub by refreshing the page inside the commits page.

231
00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:25.950
Now we have a new commit create the network component.

232
00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:30.250
Let's zoom this and review what we have done.

233
00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:42.790
So inside the page that is X in the about page, we just added a padding of four inside the layout that

234
00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:52.400
G6 we have imported the nav bar component and add it here after the header and before the search box.

235
00:19:53.360 --> 00:20:02.690
We have created a component called Napa Gsx, which includes another component called Navarre Item.

236
00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:12.860
And we're going to pass two attributes to this component, the title and the program, which is based

237
00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:14.840
on that title.

238
00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:20.750
And we have created another component called Navarre Item, which is.

239
00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:33.030
Client side because we are using some hoax called use search programs and we get the data from the attributes

240
00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:42.870
and we passed here as a props title and pram and we get the parameters of the URL using the use search

241
00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:49.500
params and we get the genre parameter using the JIT method and passing the genre.

242
00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:59.220
Then we're going to return a link which is going to have a title in the middle and the H ref is the

243
00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:06.240
parameter that we get and we pass to the genre and we have added a dynamic styling.

244
00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:13.430
For example, if the genre exists and genre is equal to prem, we're going to have an underline with

245
00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:14.850
a different color.

246
00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:21.240
And yet that was it for the war component.

247
00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:30.420
In the next section, we're going to fetch data from the API to MDB API and show it inside the home

248
00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:35.190
page based on this trending or top rated.
