1
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:07.680
All right.

2
00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:14.380
In the last section, we have completed the signing page of our project.

3
00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:20.770
In this section, we're going to start getting this session data and show it in our website.

4
00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.980
If you look at the final version, no, the version that we are working on, the localhost, 2000,

5
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.450
we want to change the.

6
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.630
This image, the name and also the user name using decision.

7
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:43.300
The first things we need to do to get decision is to wrap our application with decision provider.

8
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.120
We need to go to Visual Studio call.

9
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.650
We go to App Dot J.S..

10
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.990
Inside this.

11
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.000
Yeah.

12
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.060
Inside the pages.

13
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.930
We go to pages and app touches.

14
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.040
And we need to import session provider from next off forward slash react.

15
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.290
So we just bring it in here.

16
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.150
We just say session.

17
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.200
Provider.

18
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.130
From.

19
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.210
And next.

20
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.670
Of.

21
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.280
Forward slash react.

22
00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.040
They should provide.

23
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.530
Okay.

24
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.360
And then we need to.

25
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:50.940
Instead of just getting component and page props, we need to get to things.

26
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:58.680
Instead of just getting page proofs, we get the session here and also we get the page props.

27
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.420
Okay.

28
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:11.910
And now we need to instead of just saying component, we need to wrap this one by decision provider.

29
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.360
So.

30
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.850
And we just make a return like this.

31
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.380
We bring this one inside.

32
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.740
Mm hmm.

33
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.600
Yeah.

34
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.600
We just say session provider.

35
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.970
And we bring this one inside this.

36
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.750
And here.

37
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.330
We add this session, which as a session is equal to session.

38
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.710
Now we can get decision in any pages we like.

39
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:54.210
For example, let me decrease this to size here and then we bring our website on the right side.

40
00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.580
Let's for example, in input section we change this image.

41
00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.610
And to from the image we get from the Google.

42
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:18.950
So for doing that, let's close this app that yes, we close this firebase signing page and.

43
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.590
We just got to input that.

44
00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:23.280
Yes.

45
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.900
And here at a top the import.

46
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.040
U.S..

47
00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.070
Which is a building function from.

48
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.130
Uh.

49
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.040
Next off.

50
00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:47.870
Forward slash react.

51
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.710
Okay, now, first we need to initialize it.

52
00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.510
So we just cast.

53
00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.080
And we can this this truck do it and we get that data from U.S..

54
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.100
And so we should do it like this.

55
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.660
We should just say equal to U.S..

56
00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:19.630
And we don't want to use the name data because we want to just use it as a session just to it.

57
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:20.460
Call it session.

58
00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:21.660
That's better.

59
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.890
But the the things we are getting from your session is data.

60
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.320
So now let's console.log this session and see what's inside.

61
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:38.190
So we just say log and we just say session.

62
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.550
Now let's refresh the page.

63
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.680
We're getting an error saying next.

64
00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.350
And this one is there's a typo here.

65
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:54.060
Now.

66
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.790
We should refresh the page.

67
00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:56.400
Yeah.

68
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.800
Now if you open the console using F12.

69
00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.830
We should see.

70
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.630
We don't get anything here.

71
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:13.020
That's.

72
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.500
No.

73
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.600
Uh.

74
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.590
Yeah.

75
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:19.120
Yeah.

76
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.340
The line fire is said.

77
00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.280
This is not because we are not log in.

78
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:32.170
So because when I when you when you are doing in the development mode when you restart the server you

79
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.650
need to.

80
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:34.140
Uh.

81
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.310
Good.

82
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.850
Uh.

83
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.660
You need to find yourself again.

84
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.360
So we just need to go to off.

85
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:44.700
Sign in.

86
00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.150
I think I made a typo.

87
00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.750
Of.

88
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.010
Sign and that is correct.

89
00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:07.050
Yeah.

90
00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:07.840
Let's check.

91
00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.670
I met a type of year, actually.

92
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.040
Sign in here.

93
00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:18.020
It's wrong.

94
00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.780
So let me rename this.

95
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.480
Sorry about that sign.

96
00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.740
That is correct.

97
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.530
Uh, let's see here.

98
00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.260
Sign.

99
00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.220
That's a 52 page.

100
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:34.830
Now we are in the signing page.

101
00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:38.320
Let's signing with Google.

102
00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.480
Now we are authenticated.

103
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:45.370
Let's open the.

104
00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:47.760
Cancel now.

105
00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.640
Now we are getting an object.

106
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.050
You're getting an object.

107
00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.820
It just gives us that expiry time.

108
00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.410
Which I think it's one month.

109
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:02.660
Then we have the user.

110
00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.030
The user has email.

111
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:08.040
Image.

112
00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:09.940
And name.

113
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.570
So inside input genes, for example we can change the.

114
00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:18.910
This image.

115
00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:20.920
To.

116
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:23.810
Uh.

117
00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.770
It's here instead of sauce.

118
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:30.220
Just a hard image.

119
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.860
We can just get the session.

120
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:35.630
That user, that image.

121
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.840
Now we're getting the image from my account, the Gmail account.

122
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:43.250
Okay.

123
00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:46.000
As simple as that.

124
00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:52.240
But actually, I don't want to see this imposition when the person is not signing.

125
00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:57.070
So if there's no session, so we can do.

126
00:07:58.970 --> 00:07:59.380
Yeah.

127
00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:03.230
Instead of returning directly.

128
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:04.370
Let's open it.

129
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.370
A frac for empty fragment.

130
00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:11.760
And, uh.

131
00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:14.010
Well, no, and we need it on orbit.

132
00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:15.120
Just let's try.

133
00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.430
We just see if this station exists.

134
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.310
Dennis, show the input section.

135
00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:26.970
So we just bring everything inside.

136
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:28.570
That.

137
00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:31.930
Yeah.

138
00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.900
I guess it doesn't work like that.

139
00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.860
You just need to.

140
00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:43.810
Let's close this.

141
00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:45.840
Okay.

142
00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:46.350
Uh.

143
00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:51.190
Now let's let's add the empty fragments.

144
00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:57.660
I know.

145
00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:00.590
We move everything inside.

146
00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:00.980
That's.

147
00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:06.830
No.

148
00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:10.250
It's working now because we are signed in.

149
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.270
We see it.

150
00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:19.020
But if you sign out, we don't need we don't see it, but we don't have any sign up button.

151
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:23.190
We can just say if we click on this icon, sign out.

152
00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:26.920
So we can't just import sign out.

153
00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:33.940
They just say sign out from next off and be added on.

154
00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.190
Click to the image here.

155
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:43.650
And the uncle is just going to call this sign out.

156
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:48.320
So now if we click on here, we should sign.

157
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:52.790
And when we sign out, we don't see the input section.

158
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:54.110
Okay.

159
00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:57.900
All right, so let's.

160
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:01.110
But we don't have any sign in button.

161
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:02.280
No, that's a problem.

162
00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:02.700
So.

163
00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:06.600
But I want to add the signing button inside this sidebar.

164
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:15.660
So if we decrease increase the size I want instead of seeing this tweet and here I want to see the input

165
00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.430
if the person is not signed in.

166
00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:20.310
So let's do this for here to.

167
00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:29.450
So we bring it here and we don't need this input any more.

168
00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.170
Or the signing page.

169
00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:40.820
And uh, let's go to sidebar component here.

170
00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:44.510
In the inside, the components we go to sidebar ideas.

171
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:47.390
Let's do the same things we did.

172
00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.920
So we just.

173
00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:52.150
Import.

174
00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:57.530
U.S..

175
00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:02.500
From.

176
00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:04.420
Next.

177
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:10.960
Of course, react.

178
00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.200
We initialize it here.

179
00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:20.230
You just stay honest.

180
00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:22.080
Data.

181
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:29.190
And we named it to their data session, and we call this one to use session.

182
00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:30.480
Okay.

183
00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.990
Now we can just say.

184
00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:43.290
If there is no session, just don't show.

185
00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:45.040
Uh.

186
00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.200
Like these things, and many prefer.

187
00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:51.500
So let me.

188
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.560
Instead show a button.

189
00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:57.480
Right.

190
00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:58.030
Uh.

191
00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:03.530
I think we can do it inside here.

192
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:05.800
For the icons.

193
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.020
I want to keep their home and explore.

194
00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:16.270
I want to hide these icons from here to here because these are related to the person who is signing.

195
00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:19.810
So, uh, just here.

196
00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:26.290
So after this, the first two, we just say if this session.

197
00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:30.410
Exist if the decision is true.

198
00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.100
If that's true, we want to.

199
00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:40.400
Have these things to bring them inside here.

200
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.160
But we just need to put them.

201
00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:48.330
I think inside the empty fragments before.

202
00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:53.000
Hmm.

203
00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:56.460
So now we don't see them.

204
00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:02.840
And then for the tweet button and menu for a file, I want to completely hide them.

205
00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:11.930
So from here, just say if the decision is true, I want this one to be a ternary operator because I

206
00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:14.510
want to add the another button.

207
00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.940
So we just say if the decision exists, then.

208
00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:23.500
Sure.

209
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:24.400
The bottom.

210
00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:27.850
And this one.

211
00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.650
Bring them inside here.

212
00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:35.370
And then.

213
00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:37.730
Otherwise, I want to see another.

214
00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.630
MARTIN which is a signing button.

215
00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:40.960
So.

216
00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:42.590
Uh.

217
00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.040
We just make your partner.

218
00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:51.510
We cannot do it here.

219
00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.100
Just safe.

220
00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:54.640
But in.

221
00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:59.170
You just say for now, sign.

222
00:13:59.590 --> 00:13:59.820
Yeah.

223
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.110
Save it.

224
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.820
That's the first page.

225
00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.660
You get an error here?

226
00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:21.290
The reason for this error is similar to one we did.

227
00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:25.250
We just need to add an empty fragment to the.

228
00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:27.660
A return section.

229
00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:32.910
So here in the return, we just add an empty fragment.

230
00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:35.770
That's a rule for React.

231
00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:37.140
We need to just return.

232
00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:40.830
One think like one day.

233
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:45.220
Or you can just add everything inside an empty fragment.

234
00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:54.570
So that's for this one, I think should be fine now because the button is just singular to make.

235
00:14:55.700 --> 00:15:02.480
So we are seeing a signing button here and uh, let's just style it first.

236
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:10.400
I want this as the same style as this, uh, Twitter button.

237
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:11.120
Yeah.

238
00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.190
So we copy this on.

239
00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:16.680
And.

240
00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:20.870
We just pasted it here inside a class name.

241
00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:27.050
But, uh, the only difference I want to do is just, uh, make it a little bit smaller.

242
00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:30.680
Like the 36.

243
00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:32.930
Okay.

244
00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.130
Looks okay.

245
00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:41.350
Now, when we click on this, we want to go to the signing page.

246
00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:47.560
So we can in the button be added on click.

247
00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:56.050
And we just need to bring in the signing from Nix of the act here.

248
00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:00.850
Just say, sign in.

249
00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:03.170
And then.

250
00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:07.380
We can use it here.

251
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:09.030
It's just a sign.

252
00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:09.840
Yeah.

253
00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:17.390
This refresh to page.

254
00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.440
Click on signing it.

255
00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.930
Actually, now we are redirecting.

256
00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:33.280
To add default next off pace, but we want to be redirected to our custom signing page I think should

257
00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:34.380
be a problem here.

258
00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:38.050
So let's check this inside Nick's.

259
00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:46.610
Oh, we added the pages, but this one should be capitalized.

260
00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:48.320
It's a camel case.

261
00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:51.050
So now we try it again.

262
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:56.450
Now.

263
00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:57.440
We went to the.

264
00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.210
Our custom signing page.

265
00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:01.650
Let's sign in with Google.

266
00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:06.330
Now we are.

267
00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.160
We are getting all the icons.

268
00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:15.700
And instead of getting the sign in button, we are getting the tweet and the mini profile.

269
00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:22.510
And, uh, the other things I want to do, I want to change the image here.

270
00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:27.280
And also we get the correct name and username.

271
00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:30.070
Okay.

272
00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:34.400
Let's, uh, go to sidebar the J.S..

273
00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.520
And here.

274
00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:42.630
Inside the mini profile.

275
00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:45.010
The the name is hard coded.

276
00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:47.490
Let's change this font to.

277
00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:50.830
We just a session.

278
00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:56.080
Dot user, dot name.

279
00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.960
Now we are getting the correct name, which is code with the hand.

280
00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:11.200
And then for the username, we don't we don't actually have the username that says let me show you again

281
00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:13.090
we buy a console logging.

282
00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:15.100
Let's check the.

283
00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:17.500
Console.

284
00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:22.130
We will counsel logging before in the input section.

285
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:24.780
As you can see now we only have.

286
00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:30.940
In the user section we have name, email and image.

287
00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:41.650
Let's add the user name by just creating our and I want to connect this name together and make it lowercase

288
00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:42.880
as a user name.

289
00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:48.410
And also the other things I want to get is the user ID.

290
00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:56.240
We can get a custom session by just going to a next 30th and add a callback.

291
00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:59.640
So here we just say back.

292
00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:05.780
Or should say, called backs.

293
00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:10.070
And we open a set of curly braces.

294
00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:15.440
And we just use it asynchronous function.

295
00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:19.970
Which is a session.

296
00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:24.800
And this session is going to give us a few things.

297
00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:26.540
We can get the session.

298
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:32.570
We can get a token for the user I.D. and also we can get the user as well.

299
00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:35.170
So.

300
00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:41.610
Now let's create this function.

301
00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:45.280
We just say decision that user.

302
00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:47.920
That's user username.

303
00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:54.580
We want to create the username so we just say this one is equal to session.

304
00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:02.600
That's here this session that user that use that name.

305
00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:06.920
But we.

306
00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:10.760
I want to split this fund first, buy this space.

307
00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.790
So we have two space here.

308
00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:19.610
Actually, we split them by space, and then I want to join them again.

309
00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:23.590
All together.

310
00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:25.060
So with no space.

311
00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:27.200
Then.

312
00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.110
We want to change it to lower case.

313
00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:36.400
Two local lowercase.

314
00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:39.780
Okay.

315
00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:42.640
No.

316
00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:44.560
The username is okay.

317
00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:50.240
Then I want to get the list and make the decision.

318
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:59.300
User I.D. two So we just decision that user there aren't user I.D. is equal to token.

319
00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:00.790
That's not.

320
00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:05.900
So the user ID is coming from this part token.

321
00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:10.220
Well, at the end, we can return.

322
00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:14.550
This session.

323
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:19.070
So this is going to be replaced by the old session.

324
00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:23.000
Okay.

325
00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:23.590
Uh.

326
00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:26.440
We don't need this use of.

327
00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:27.580
I think so.

328
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:29.090
It's session and token.

329
00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.790
Let's let's refresh the page.

330
00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.100
Now we can all be.

331
00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:39.320
Uh, let's sign in again.

332
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:43.520
So we go sign in signing with Google.

333
00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.760
And now we are getting the, uh.

334
00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:51.690
The object.

335
00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:54.420
But the user.

336
00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:56.760
Has more.

337
00:21:56.910 --> 00:21:57.380
Thanks.

338
00:21:58.110 --> 00:21:59.730
We already had email.

339
00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:01.810
Email, image and name.

340
00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:10.460
Now we have the user I.D. and also the user name, which is just we created the name and it's code with.

341
00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:14.280
Okay, let's show this one inside here.

342
00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:17.000
This is hard coded.

343
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:22.190
So we need to make it dynamic based on the.

344
00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:25.950
Person's, uh, name.

345
00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:29.490
So inside this paragraph.

346
00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:33.490
We delayed this one and we just at.

347
00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:36.870
And Jesus X.

348
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:43.830
And we just call this one session dart user.

349
00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:47.730
There aren't user name.

350
00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:49.070
Okay.

351
00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:50.630
That should work.

352
00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:52.580
Now we are getting it.

353
00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:58.560
And also when we click on this image, I want to sign out as well.

354
00:22:58.620 --> 00:22:59.070
So.

355
00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:03.290
Here in the image we added enclave.

356
00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:14.350
And this is going to be signed out, but we need to import it too.

357
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:18.790
So know at the top the import here.

358
00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:22.890
Okay.

359
00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:29.040
Now, if you click on the image which should be signed, I'll, I'll see if we didn't get the image

360
00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:29.340
to.

361
00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:31.180
Uh.

362
00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:35.100
Uh, let me see.

363
00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:48.640
We just make this image dynamic to it that the image should be section, that's user that image.

364
00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:52.060
Okay.

365
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.890
No, it's fine.

366
00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:54.700
Let's try the sign out.

367
00:23:57.490 --> 00:23:59.730
A sign that doesn't work for a reason.

368
00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:01.050
So let me check.

369
00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:03.930
On this Arncliffe.

370
00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:06.620
It's wrong.

371
00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:09.610
So let's try again.

372
00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:13.630
Now we are signing out that signing again.

373
00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:17.560
Okay.

374
00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:20.800
Okay.

375
00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:22.570
It's working perfectly.

376
00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:31.380
So in the next section, Vinnie, we're going to start with the input section and we're going to.

377
00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:39.400
Uh, start uploading our information to the firebase.

378
00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:46.440
And so we're going to use that information to populate this post section.

379
00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:55.650
These are just hardcoded now, but we're going to get them dynamically from fire, fire, actually fire

380
00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:56.160
a store.

381
00:24:56.220 --> 00:25:01.890
So we're going to save our information in fire store and use it later for our posts.

382
00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.810
So see you in the next section.

383
00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:07.200
But before just finishing I always forget.

384
00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:09.180
Let's add everything to get up.

385
00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:12.240
So.

386
00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:18.480
You just make a message for our comment.

387
00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:20.670
And the message would be.

388
00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:24.090
Get.

389
00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:26.880
Physician.

390
00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:31.550
And modify.

391
00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:37.780
Sidebar and input.

392
00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:43.020
Section or components.

393
00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:52.810
So we push everything to get up and let's review to pay to view it.

394
00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.480
Actually, the review is nuts.

395
00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:57.390
It's optional.

396
00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:04.900
You can if you don't want to watch the review, you can just skip and go to the next section.

397
00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:09.380
So let's refresh the page.

398
00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:10.440
We go to Twitter.

399
00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:18.720
Our repository now we have 12 commits and if you click here, we can see the last commit is get the

400
00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:22.050
station and modify sidebar and import component.

401
00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:22.950
So let's click on it.

402
00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:31.290
So inside the input that is being imported, use session and sign out.

403
00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:35.130
And it brought everything inside this.

404
00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:43.000
And we said if this vision existed, just show the input section and for the image.

405
00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:49.940
We just used a decision that used that image and we added and I'll click.

406
00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:54.640
When we click on the image, we are going to be fine out.

407
00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:06.810
And inside sidebar that year we did the same things, importing their use session and etc. We initialize

408
00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:17.300
it here and we just say Show these are menu icons when we decision is excessive and show the, uh,

409
00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:22.200
this tweet button and menu for fall when we have decision.

410
00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:30.540
And we modified the sections to image everything inside the mini profile with the real data.

411
00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:36.180
Then inside apertures, we wrapped everything with a decision provider.

412
00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:38.280
This was the first step we did.

413
00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:40.300
And.

414
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.890
We?

415
00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:46.520
Uh, we fix this error, actually, here.

416
00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:50.750
Signing it was not a camel case.

417
00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:59.750
And also, we created a callback to modify this session, and we created, uh, we have created the

418
00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:05.350
username and also we got the user ID from the token that so.

419
00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:09.960
And that was a minor modification.

420
00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:10.950
Yeah, that was it.

421
00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:12.270
For this part.

422
00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:17.940
In the next section, we're going to start sending the data to the fire store.

423
00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:19.770
So see in the next section.
