1
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:14,730
All right, in the last section, we have completed the comments and the input box of the post component

2
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,640
in this section, we're going to make this ft section responsive.

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:29,070
If you look at the final version of the project, we see that we have actually three columns.

4
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,380
If I show you here.

5
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,180
This is the.

6
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:38,370
S..

7
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,960
And we have three columns.

8
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:48,820
This is the first one.

9
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,470
This is the second one.

10
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,520
And this is the last one.

11
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,090
You can see that this story and the.

12
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:07,020
The post section occupies actually two parts.

13
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:20,680
And all and this part, the suggestion and also the mini profile just covers one one one column.

14
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:25,180
So we have one column here and two columns in the left side.

15
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:28,840
But if you decrease the size.

16
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,500
In some point, which is the medium size.

17
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:42,670
Now, still, we have three columns then when we are a smaller than the medium size, we go back to

18
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:48,730
the one column that's and we just remove this suggestion.

19
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:49,330
Part.

20
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:58,250
All right, we go back to visual studio code, and in order to make the website responsive, we just

21
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:02,300
need to have changes inside the feet that Jesus.

22
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,740
So in the city, yes, we have.

23
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:15,250
In the men's main section at a top, we make the display great.

24
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:25,700
And in the mobile sites, we just say the grid columns are only one.

25
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:32,570
But in the medium size and above, we want to make the grid columns three.

26
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:36,860
So here.

27
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:45,780
The first part, which is this story and the post, the great columns are won at the mobile sites.

28
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:53,690
We don't need to add anything but in the medium size of an above the column.

29
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,630
The column span is to.

30
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,080
So now if you check.

31
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,290
First, we have one caller.

32
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:12,040
And then and after the medium-size.

33
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:19,690
This the total is three, and this part is occupying two columns.

34
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:22,930
Until the end.

35
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,120
But it's all right.

36
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:33,890
It's completely connected to the left side, so we can avoid this fine by just adding Max with, we'll

37
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,850
just say the modern medium-size fix the max with.

38
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,370
Uh, six.

39
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:45,760
Excel.

40
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:54,530
And then we want everything to be at the center, so at the margin IGs photo.

41
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:06,370
So now if when we increase the size, when we pass the six excel, we see that we have some space at

42
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:10,450
the left side for everything in the center.

43
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:23,780
So for this many, many profile fiction just.

44
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,710
We're going to.

45
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:39,200
For the section, we just, uh, we just say a class name and then we just say after the medium-size,

46
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,090
make the column spin one.

47
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:45,500
But before that, we want it to be hidden.

48
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:54,360
So after the media side, instead of being, hey, then we want it to be in line.

49
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,420
Correct.

50
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:03,470
So first, we don't see that section, but after the media sighs, we see this part.

51
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,780
But now it's completely empty.

52
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:13,430
But we are going to create it in the next section for the many poorer part fiction.

53
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:24,830
So, all right, so let's add everything to the guitar by just saying it at and gifts, come it it the

54
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:34,250
message of make the feet thick and responsive

55
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,950
and they push everything to get top.

56
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:56,820
So in the get half, if you go here and refresh, you go to the last command.

57
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,850
Let me zoom a little bit.

58
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:06,600
So we're just at three styles to defeat that.

59
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,870
Yes, we make it.

60
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:17,730
Having one columns when it's in the mobile size, after the medium size or tablet size, we have three

61
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:24,300
columns and it's if the meaningful files section is hidden.

62
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,730
But after medium size.

63
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:36,330
It becomes a one column in the next section, we are going to create the right side there, we start

64
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,180
it a mini profile this section.

65
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,820
So see you in the next section.
