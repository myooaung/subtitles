1
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:07,970
All right.

2
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:17,860
In the last section, we have installed the next year and a tailwind assists, and we've got this template

3
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:18,190
here.

4
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:28,520
In this section, we're going to start adding our own components and make our website the template you

5
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,420
would like to have.

6
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,960
So we go back to Visual Studio code.

7
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:44,820
And we closed this global thesis now, for now, we don't need them, and we just go to the pages and

8
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:51,660
index such as this is the file that we we are seeing here inside the browser.

9
00:00:51,870 --> 00:01:00,150
Let's decrease the size of the browser to see the changes simultaneous tenuously and B to the npm.

10
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:09,620
Rendezvous to have our server running and see the changes in real time.

11
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:16,360
For example, in this index, which is if I change this.

12
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:20,090
Uh, Qualcomm.

13
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,130
To learn is see the.

14
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,400
We see the changes.

15
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:36,660
In real time on the right side, so we we don't need anything except a hit section, hit sections,

16
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:43,290
just a title and the major tech and a link to the favicon that is here.

17
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:51,330
So we don't change them, but we delete all the main section and also the footer.

18
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,800
So all of them.

19
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:06,060
And we're not going to use if salt that contain a kind of this styling in our project, they're using

20
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:12,810
tailwinds to assist, so we delete the home that module that sees this fall completely.

21
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,530
And with the latest section.

22
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,350
As well.

23
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,400
And we it is to import section that we haven't used yet.

24
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,040
All right.

25
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,840
That's completely clean.

26
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:44,960
Let's get some closure to be sure that everything's working perfect.

27
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,380
You can see the hello here.

28
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:59,370
The reason we get this small size in each one is because we're choosing to see this and this stalling

29
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,720
is completely different.

30
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:02,460
All right.

31
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,520
So let's create our components.

32
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,530
And first we check the website.

33
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,530
We have already have the final version.

34
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,210
Now I'll show you.

35
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:23,650
That we have three sections in our projects first section is this one at the top.

36
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:25,940
Which we call it.

37
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,370
Then we have the nafaa, which is this section.

38
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,190
And finally, we have.

39
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:40,250
Uh, like, uh, this result section, which is here.

40
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,300
All right.

41
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,120
So we go back to index search.

42
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:50,540
Yes, and here instead of this low war.

43
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,760
We asked three sections, so let's define it first.

44
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:04,620
So we here we add a comment using contra forward slash and we just say header.

45
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:10,020
And then we have another one called NAV Bar.

46
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:15,690
And finally, we have the results section.

47
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:25,030
So for each of them, we're going to create a component react components, and we're going to just.

48
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:33,380
And export and one with saying like header that or end result, do you usually make the components inside

49
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,150
the components folder?

50
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:44,450
So we go to this package that Jason level and to create a folder called components.

51
00:04:48,650 --> 00:05:00,140
And inside this components folder, we're going to create three, uh, three, uh, GSX files for header

52
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,000
four and the results.

53
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:09,250
So we just click their components and we click here to create a new file.

54
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:14,470
And first file will be Header Dot J.S..

55
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:25,210
And we just can't have a template using underline rf c.

56
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,180
And as you can see, we are getting a suggestion of react functional components.

57
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:40,270
So when we click on this, we get the export default function header and we return an empty diff.

58
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,220
And here we can add.

59
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,200
Each one.

60
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:53,170
Sane head, if you cannot see this hour of see, make sure to install the extension.

61
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:03,090
That we have here is seven React Redux Kraft EULAR, make sure to install this extension to get this

62
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:12,540
kind of, uh, like a quick installation templates without this extension, we don't get this suggestions.

63
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:14,460
All right.

64
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,350
We already created the component just exporting each saying header.

65
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:28,920
So we go back to our terminal and we go to index suggests and we import that header here.

66
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,080
So we just write header.

67
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:40,080
We close the tank and in order to import the header automatically at the top.

68
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:44,490
Let's increase the size so you can see everything.

69
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:52,350
So in order to import it, we just need to click on the at the end of this header and click on.

70
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,810
And we just press conference space when we click Contours Space.

71
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:03,390
We have the auto suggestion thing import header from components.

72
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,140
Slash it.

73
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,550
If you cannot see this one, make sure to.

74
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:14,000
To keep this head of the GSA open on the right side here.

75
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:19,640
So if if we don't have this one here, we don't get that.

76
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,760
Suggestion, as you can see.

77
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,490
So we keep this one open.

78
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:33,860
And here we click at the end and the press on counter space and we click on the first auto suggests.

79
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:43,330
Now in the browser that may increase the size, we wish we can see the header.

80
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:51,820
And let's create the same team for the Nafaa and the results section, so we click here.

81
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,250
Create a new file called.

82
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,480
Now for that.

83
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,420
Yes.

84
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:04,860
And inside this file, we just right underlined of.

85
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,280
We press enter to accept the author's suggestion, and we get a functional component.

86
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:25,190
And the added hitch one here saying that for so we go back to index searches and we import the nafaa,

87
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:32,550
we're just right now for a close attack and we're using contra space to alter import.

88
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:41,820
This is you can see here we imported Heather and Nafaa from components you have for and you can see

89
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,710
it in real time on the right side.

90
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,620
Next, we have the result.

91
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:54,390
So here we click the components and created the call results

92
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,960
that yes.

93
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:08,310
We create the component, uh, and using underlying RF see and here in the diff, right?

94
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,670
And each one.

95
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:17,990
Without saying just results and into index, it's.

96
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:30,450
You just write results and we use contra space to get the auto suggestion and the importance.

97
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:37,980
All right now we have all the sections we need, according to the final version of our project, which

98
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,420
is here.

99
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,130
In the next section, we are going to start with the.

100
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,990
Heather S. And before doing that, we just need to one more time.

101
00:09:54,230 --> 00:10:01,670
Push our website to the guitar, so we stop the server.

102
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,770
We clear this.

103
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:08,810
Let me increase the size a little bit so you can see it better.

104
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:16,930
So now we just need to have it at all.

105
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:24,780
Then be committed with a message, the message will be.

106
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,050
Creates.

107
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,490
Components.

108
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,520
And just to create.

109
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:48,340
Uh, components and create and.

110
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:52,960
Finish.

111
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:57,890
The templates.

112
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,960
So we press into.

113
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,140
And we just finally, we have to just say, get push.

114
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:18,600
Now, everything is uploaded if we go to our repository.

115
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,670
GitHub repository.

116
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,600
I think it's.

117
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:25,670
Yeah, it's here.

118
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:30,460
Yeah, if you refresh the page now.

119
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:41,040
They see that we have three comments, if you click on this, we see that we have to create components

120
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,130
and finish our you made them stick in the finish.

121
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:44,800
That's fine.

122
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,210
Finish the template we click here.

123
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,090
And you see that we created the Hitler Jesus.

124
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,710
Now for that, yes.

125
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,570
Our result that, yes.

126
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:05,500
And inside the index that she has imported all the three sections.

127
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,990
And also we.

128
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,030
We just.

129
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:11,850
At the.

130
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:13,970
Tax here.

131
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:17,540
All right.

132
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:24,620
Yeah, that was it for the templating, our website and the start in the next section, we're going

133
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,330
to complete the.

134
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,330
Heather S..

135
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,530
Here are the top.

136
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:40,510
We're going to get this I am logo and also we're going to create this, get these icons from, you know,

137
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,620
icons dot com.

138
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:47,650
And we're going to like a a solemn bit using.

139
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,330
Taleban CSIS and at this kind of active and hover effect.

140
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,520
So see you in the next section.
