1
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:14,880
All right, in the last section, we have created our server side function, and we got the information

2
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,480
from the TMD database by providing this URL and our specific genre.

3
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:31,320
Then we got this props and send it to the client side here, and we passed this data as a props to the

4
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,570
results that J.S..

5
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,570
All right, here, we map through all the result, and it just.

6
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,180
Shows the title, as you can see here.

7
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,020
So.

8
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,620
Let's run the server MP and Ron Dev.

9
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:02,920
Yeah.

10
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,750
Now we refresh the page, we should get the.

11
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:15,400
Yeah, just getting the trending now, then we get the top rated when we click on top rated.

12
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:22,840
If you if you look at the final version of the projects, we see that in the results section, we have

13
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,810
something like a car like here.

14
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,540
Which are actually.

15
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,600
Responsive.

16
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,210
So when they're small, they're they're in one column.

17
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,610
And then when they get bigger, they get two and finally three and four.

18
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,260
And when we are.

19
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:50,030
And in a very big screen, we have five columns.

20
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:51,850
All right.

21
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,370
And each of these things are something called.

22
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,100
He chopped down like this one.

23
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,370
Is a car.

24
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:10,480
So we're going to create a component called car, which includes the image.

25
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:19,470
Here, the image and this is the overview and we have the title.

26
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,950
And here we have three section to date.

27
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:26,980
And make changes.

28
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,770
Yeah, we have that date.

29
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:37,960
A like button like icon and also we have the, uh, the number of likes.

30
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,840
So let's first recreate the cart component.

31
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,880
We get all this data.

32
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,780
And finally, we we're going to make them responsive.

33
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:54,020
All right.

34
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,440
Let's go back to Visual Studio code.

35
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,530
And.

36
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,920
It create another component called car.

37
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:11,430
So here we click on this, create a card that yes.

38
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:20,980
And it create a component, a functional component using underlying RC, and we click on the first auto

39
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:30,370
suggestion and in the results, J.S. Heap instead of like showing the title.

40
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:34,770
Weakening, we're going to import this car.

41
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,490
First, using counter space being imported.

42
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,720
And we passed this result as a props.

43
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,980
Inside this car.

44
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:53,450
And here in the car, we can't get that one as a props.

45
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:57,770
So first, we're distracted and we just get the.

46
00:03:59,210 --> 00:03:59,870
Results.

47
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,420
Yeah, now we can.

48
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,600
Just like before showing down.

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,090
Inside the head, each one to test tested, this is working.

50
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,910
So results are tighter.

51
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:29,610
All right, we are getting the same same results as before, but with the and other components.

52
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,290
Let's before forgetting.

53
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:42,460
We just go back to this attachÃ©s chase and the ad a key because this is a map, we should provide the

54
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:52,000
key and the key will be results that I.D. because each of these, uh.

55
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,470
Each of them, they have an idea.

56
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:00,720
Let's check them inside their console, in the console.

57
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:07,970
If you open the array, be getting and if you open one of the movies, we see each of them, they have

58
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,060
a unique I.D..

59
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:11,550
All right.

60
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:19,170
So we just use this unique idea as a key, so we don't get error later when we're deploying the website

61
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,520
to Verso.

62
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:29,940
All right, let's go back to Carter Chase and here first we get the image.

63
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,570
So we use the image.

64
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,070
Tag.

65
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,560
Of the next two years, the imported at the top.

66
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:46,600
And as you remember, we have three mandatory.

67
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:55,720
Attributes for image, which is SIRC c width and height.

68
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,520
So for SIRC.

69
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,670
This is going to be the results.

70
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,290
Dots.

71
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,960
Let's check it inside the console.

72
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,730
I show you in a second.

73
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,710
So.

74
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,640
It just right off first, so I'll start it.

75
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,470
Don't get error so we can get the array, so here.

76
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:36,700
If you open, one of them is see that we have a link to the J P T file.

77
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:43,960
This file is the path to the to the image of the movie.

78
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:45,190
All right.

79
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:51,010
So we just copy this back through our path and paste it here.

80
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,540
But this is just the slash.

81
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,960
Dot jpg.

82
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:02,020
But we need a base URL for this one.

83
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,940
The pace you are, l, we just put it here.

84
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,980
Let me just quickly grab it.

85
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:14,230
Uh, so we have a constant called base.

86
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,580
You are out and.

87
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,350
The base you are is just excited to be, yes.

88
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:26,730
Image Dustin be that -- forward slash t four slash p amphora slash original.

89
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:35,880
And after that, this beck tip is going to this backdrop past is going to give give us the image.

90
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:44,630
All right, so instead of just writing down this one at the base, you're out at the beginning.

91
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,950
And we just.

92
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,740
At this festival at the beginning of the backdrop path.

93
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:06,260
Now we are not getting error, but we are getting the same interview we were getting when we were making

94
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:06,860
the logo.

95
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,250
So we have to add this.

96
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:17,780
You are al to the count, to the next touches that next that conflict that yes.

97
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:24,220
So we copy this URL and we go to here to next that conflict.

98
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,130
Yes, and we add it here as the new domain.

99
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:37,210
All right, we saved the file and we need to restart the server because we are changing the config file,

100
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,180
so we just use contrasty.

101
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,890
And.

102
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,790
This clear it is and is just.

103
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:55,240
NPM run dev again to restore the server.

104
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:03,830
Now, we shouldn't get this error, but we are going getting another error for the high 10 with the

105
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:06,530
image because we haven't provided yet.

106
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:15,560
So we just add the width to be that is not important because we are making them responsible later.

107
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:18,830
So we just say with 200 and hide.

108
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:22,420
One hundred.

109
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:28,010
So we don't get error now, and we should get the images.

110
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,230
One by one.

111
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:43,220
So in order to instead of giving the width and height to be precise and calculated, we're going to

112
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:50,600
use something called layout in the image and we set it to be responsive.

113
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:55,640
So.

114
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:00,350
No, we should get the image into full size.

115
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,860
So we've gained the images of the.

116
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:06,880
Our.

117
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,220
Yeah, movies.

118
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,450
So this is for trending.

119
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:16,840
If you click on top rated, you should get the images for the top rated.

120
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:28,180
And as you as you are aware, the image tag inside the next year gives us the some lazy loading for

121
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:28,930
the images.

122
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:38,680
So when we go down, you see that the images under is not loaded yet, and this is going to help us

123
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,260
to have a very fast website.

124
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:50,170
As you can see, when we scroll down the new images loaded, otherwise we just have the images we have.

125
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:54,490
And also, if you go back, you see that the spider is here.

126
00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:00,700
This this is going to this is something called catching in the next year.

127
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,510
So it's when the one time you go in it.

128
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:15,020
In a and we get an image, it's going to be a story somewhere like cash, so it's not going to get one

129
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,400
by one always.

130
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,010
But this cash has some limits.

131
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:24,200
So some of the images, estates and some of them loaded again.

132
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:25,160
All right.

133
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:35,120
So now we have the image, the next thing, as if you check the final version, we have the image,

134
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,410
we have the overview title and date.

135
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,270
And also we have some.

136
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:45,840
Icon and vote count.

137
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:48,510
So.

138
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,940
He go back.

139
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:54,510
Yeah.

140
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,150
Yeah.

141
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:00,060
So now we have let's get other things.

142
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,950
We put them in a death.

143
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:09,980
And the first things we're going to get is the result.

144
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,760
Dot overview.

145
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,920
Which is this one?

146
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:28,830
Each movie has an overview, but we don't want all the overview, we just want the first line of the

147
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,690
overview, so.

148
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:36,100
We just put this one inside paragraph.

149
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:38,840
And.

150
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,300
We can add a style to it.

151
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:56,250
They're using Tillmans assess truncates function of transit class to make this one in just one night.

152
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,060
All right.

153
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,100
Later, we're going to style all of them.

154
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:05,730
But first, you just finish getting all the data us.

155
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,270
So next one is we have an itch to.

156
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:11,890
Which is the title?

157
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,980
And you just say results.

158
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:18,920
The title.

159
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:27,480
So we're getting the title, but I want to show you that we not we're not getting all the titles in

160
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:35,130
some movies, they don't have a title, but they have title in a different way.

161
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,810
So if you go trending.

162
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:40,730
And to some movies like.

163
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,970
I mean, this movie doesn't have.

164
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,360
Results the title.

165
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,450
Or this one?

166
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:55,730
So let's open the console and check the array.

167
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:02,680
So I think it was seven, the seven one seven has a title.

168
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:10,080
Six, if six doesn't have a title, but it has something else called name.

169
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:11,630
All right.

170
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:22,850
So we can see if the result that title exists, show them otherwise show something else, which is results

171
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,470
dot net.

172
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,810
Let's check that we get all the titles or name.

173
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,950
Now we're getting the name here.

174
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,110
And not all the movies has a name or title.

175
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,100
All right.

176
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,760
Next thing we want to get is.

177
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,770
The date of release.

178
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,230
Let's check it again inside the council using if to.

179
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,290
So this array.

180
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,050
They have something called.

181
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,550
Release date.

182
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,840
Or some of them.

183
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,930
They don't have a release date, but they have.

184
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:14,860
Uh.

185
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,120
But yeah, they have.

186
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,490
And yet this one has.

187
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:31,520
I want to find something doesn't have a release date.

188
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:39,650
Yeah, this one doesn't have really the release date, but instead it has 1st air date, so we're going

189
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:45,470
to get either the release date or the first air date.

190
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:51,110
So we just say results don't release.

191
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,270
Dates or.

192
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,910
Result Dutch.

193
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:01,540
The.

194
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,890
First.

195
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:07,920
There.

196
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:10,600
Date.

197
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:21,240
If first air date and this should be fine.

198
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,430
So we are getting the.

199
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,790
Release date for.

200
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,360
Yeah, I think we are getting it for everyone.

201
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,340
Yeah, no, that's correct.

202
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,990
Let's get the.

203
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:42,430
This icon, the thumbs up icon, we're going to get this one from.

204
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,100
Hero icons.

205
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:47,120
So.

206
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,450
Let's import.

207
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:57,980
Yeah, some.

208
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:10,500
Up icon from hero icons, we're not getting it from solid, we get that font for artillery, we don't

209
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,940
want solid icons, OK, so we copy this and be.

210
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,040
After this date.

211
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,620
I'm going to get this.

212
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:29,080
Inside this paragraph, we get the Tom Tom soap icon.

213
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,600
OK, we're getting it.

214
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,750
This is huge.

215
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:42,910
So we quickly add this class name of height of five.

216
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:51,570
OK, after this, we need the vote counts, so we just the results.

217
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:53,310
That's.

218
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,560
Both.

219
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:58,580
Can't.

220
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,120
All right.

221
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:02,750
So we're getting everything.

222
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:12,890
Now that we need, but it's still not as styled in the next section, we're going to start styling the

223
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:17,330
current section and make it responsive.

224
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:22,370
So first, we just add this one to get half.

225
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,230
So we just take it.

226
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:29,360
At.

227
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,750
And we have can't come in.

228
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,700
So we created.

229
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:47,450
Create car components.

230
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:56,300
All right, and you push it to the guitar.

231
00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:01,960
Let's shake it an overview of what we have done, so refresh it.

232
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,890
You go to commits.

233
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,400
And you go to creates cart component.

234
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:15,570
As you can see, we created a car that chase.

235
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:26,370
And we got the image, we imported the image from Nick's image, Tom Tom of Icon from Hero Icons, and

236
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:38,340
also we create the image and we've got the information for the overview title release date and also

237
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:48,900
the vote count and also in result that, yes, we remove the H1 and we added the card component and

238
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:55,050
also in next a conflict that as be at this year as the domain.

239
00:19:55,290 --> 00:20:00,180
So we don't get any errors in the browser.

240
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:08,840
So in the next section, we're going to install this component and makes our website responsive.

241
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,700
So see in the next section.
