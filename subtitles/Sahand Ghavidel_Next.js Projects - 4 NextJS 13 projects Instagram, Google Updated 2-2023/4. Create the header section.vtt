1
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:07.320
All right.

2
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.160
In the last section, we have installed Tailwind CSS.

3
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.440
In this section, we're going to work on the header section of the project.

4
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.900
So let me show you here by drawing.

5
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.590
So we have a header component at a top, which includes the menu.

6
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.920
Which we can show here.

7
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.020
Each menu has the menu has actually menu items.

8
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.940
So each of them is a separate component, actually.

9
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:48.410
And then we have two parts here, the logo and this.

10
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.260
A dark mode button.

11
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:54.850
So.

12
00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:04.470
We are going to firstly create this menu and the logo and we're going to work on the dark menu in the

13
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.150
next section.

14
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.010
So let's go back.

15
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.070
As I mentioned earlier in the first section in the layout, the Gsx.

16
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:23.550
We're going to add the header and other parts, for example, the header, the now for the search box.

17
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.210
And this is going to be consistent in all websites.

18
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:36.000
For example, if you go to the page about we still see the header nav bar and the search box.

19
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.820
So we're going to add the header here.

20
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.870
So we.

21
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.680
First, let's clean this so inside the body section.

22
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.370
We want to add three things.

23
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.140
So we have the children at a bottom, and then we have at a top.

24
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.400
We have the header.

25
00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.980
Then we have the.

26
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.740
Navarre.

27
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.360
And and then we have this search.

28
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.630
Search box.

29
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.060
So now we want to create the header component.

30
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:26.040
So inside the CRC folder, I'm going to create another folder called components.

31
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.020
And inside this folder I'm going to create.

32
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.520
A component called header.

33
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.560
Dot jz x.

34
00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:47.290
And we can now use our C to create a React functional component, as I mentioned.

35
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:56.980
We can use an extension called s7a snippet to create this.

36
00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.500
So when you write on ref C, it's going to create a React functional component.

37
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.760
If you click here, you can see we have a React functional component.

38
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.590
The other things we need to know is in next year 13.

39
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.650
All the components, all the pages are a server side by default.

40
00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.760
If you want to have a client side component, you need to mention use client at the top.

41
00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:33.590
So I'm going to show you later if we have a component that is client side, we're going to create and

42
00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.330
add that tag at the top.

43
00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:45.320
So now let's start the server and the first we import this header inside the layout section I'm going

44
00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.680
to write down here Header.

45
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.310
And this is going to auto import header from components folder.

46
00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:03.030
And this ADD sign is actually the alias that we have added when we were installing the next.

47
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.360
Yes.

48
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.380
The first time.

49
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.170
So they were asking us what alias do you want?

50
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.650
We have added this add sign.

51
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:19.410
So instead of just saying dot dot forward slash to come back to to the previous folder and go inside

52
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.710
this component folder we just write down add here.

53
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:34.620
So now we need to close this component and we start the server to see the changes inside our application.

54
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:43.400
So we use NPM run diff to start the server, and this is going to create a server in local host 3000.

55
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:53.430
So now if you refresh the page here inside local host 3000, we should see our website which has the

56
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.380
let me zoom this a little bit.

57
00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.660
It has the home.

58
00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:06.990
And also we have header at the top, which is coming from the Heather component, which is this Dave

59
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.150
with a heather in the middle.

60
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:20.460
So as I said, we need to have some sections inside the header, inside the final version we see.

61
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.220
We have a div.

62
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.860
The left side is the menu.

63
00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.490
On the right side we have the logo.

64
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.550
So inside the head section we're going to have a div.

65
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.100
One, Dave is the for all of them.

66
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.040
One Dave we have for the.

67
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.200
Menu on the left side.

68
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.330
And we have one, Dave.

69
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.240
For the logo on the right side.

70
00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:04.170
So we have one diff for the all the header, one there for the menu and one there for the logo on the

71
00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:05.130
right side.

72
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.600
And let's create the menu first.

73
00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.640
So for each menu item, we're going to create a component as well.

74
00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:23.640
So we're going to create another component and we call it menu item that Gsx.

75
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.510
And now we're going to create a React functional component using React Ref..

76
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:33.110
See?

77
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.710
So now we have the menu item.

78
00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.910
This menu item, JSX.

79
00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.660
This is going to get a few things here.

80
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.300
So we're going to get the.

81
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.480
Title.

82
00:06:53.870 --> 00:07:01.070
We are going to get the address of the link because this one is just a link.

83
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.610
When you click on this one, you go to the home page.

84
00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.920
When you click on this, you go to forward slash about.

85
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:12.170
So we we have a title which can be home and about.

86
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:14.090
Then we have the address.

87
00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.990
And let's let's bring this one back.

88
00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.270
Address after the address.

89
00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:25.860
And then we have the icon.

90
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:36.450
The icon is actually when you have a smaller screen like this instead of the text, we see an icon.

91
00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:38.850
Like this.

92
00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.520
So we're going to add icons as well.

93
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.120
So I'm going to have the option of getting the icon.

94
00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:52.440
So this information is should come from the header that is X.

95
00:07:52.440 --> 00:08:00.600
So we're going to import that menu item which is going to auto import.

96
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.040
And we are going to pass the data.

97
00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:08.790
The data we want to pass is title.

98
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:11.430
The first title is home.

99
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:16.240
So we're going to write down the home.

100
00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:19.990
Let me just make it a string here.

101
00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:23.050
And for the title.

102
00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.950
Is home and we just make it capitalize.

103
00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:29.890
And for the address.

104
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.590
This is going to be.

105
00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:39.660
Just a forward slash because we want to go to the home page.

106
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:41.410
Dan.

107
00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:43.850
We have the icon.

108
00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:51.710
So we're going to use a package called React Icons to get the icons we need.

109
00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:57.980
So we go to Google and we search for React icons.

110
00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:02.420
In the search result we see.

111
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:07.150
A GitHub repository page.

112
00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:15.490
It's a it's a it's a link, but it's created by the GitHub blogging.

113
00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:24.610
So it's the address is react, the icons, dot GitHub, dot IO, forward slash react icons.

114
00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:30.580
If you click on this, the installation process is very simple.

115
00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:36.870
You just need to have NPM install react icons, dash, dash, save.

116
00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.890
So I'm going to copy this one.

117
00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:45.010
I'm going to stop this server and paste this code.

118
00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.770
This is going to install the package.

119
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:59.410
After that, we can just import the icon we need from the DAT link and also we just put that icon inside

120
00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:01.240
wherever we want to use it.

121
00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:02.200
Okay.

122
00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:05.420
And you can search for the icons here.

123
00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.280
The icons I want to use.

124
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:12.620
The first icon is just the you can search home.

125
00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:14.970
I want to get this.

126
00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:20.460
I feel home so you can just copy this one by clicking on it.

127
00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:27.870
And you go back to Visual Studio Code, I'm going to import that font, so I'm just going to import.

128
00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:38.520
That home I feel home from react icon for slash I.

129
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:46.850
So this is you see I got help from the get sorry the copilot extension.

130
00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:52.320
So because this is from the I.

131
00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:55.560
So we need to have a forward slash I at the end.

132
00:10:55.560 --> 00:11:00.000
Now we can pass this one as an icon here.

133
00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:07.460
So you just write down, I feel home here and pass it as an icon.

134
00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:08.900
Now.

135
00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:11.970
Inside the menu dot icon.

136
00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:16.140
We get the item, we get the title, address and icon.

137
00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:19.020
We can show it inside here.

138
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.190
So I'm going to.

139
00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:23.400
Get these things and show it here.

140
00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:33.330
So all the other things I want to do, we want to put them inside a link tag.

141
00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:38.340
The link tag is coming from the next forward slash link.

142
00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:46.110
This is going to go to that website, to that URL without refreshing the page.

143
00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.830
So this is just the.

144
00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:58.360
And then you can just close this one and this one gets some item here and you can put the text here

145
00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.710
inside the middle.

146
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:08.380
So I'm going to have some paragraph here saying the title, which is home for the first one.

147
00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:12.600
Okay.

148
00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:16.880
And also, this one gets an H ref.

149
00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:19.970
The H ref is just the address.

150
00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:27.280
So the address is forward slash for the first one.

151
00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:31.320
Then also we want to show the icon as well.

152
00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:34.020
So we're going to add the icon here.

153
00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:35.610
So we just say icon.

154
00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:37.830
And close it.

155
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.620
Okay.

156
00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:44.360
Let's see it inside the browser.

157
00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:50.150
So I'm I'm going to bring this one to the left side and our website to the right side.

158
00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:52.190
We are getting an error.

159
00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:56.630
We said that icon unexpected.

160
00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.560
Expression expected here.

161
00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:00.280
So.

162
00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:04.240
Okay.

163
00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:05.920
Let me see.

164
00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:14.640
Let's open this one and let's close the left side so we have a more space.

165
00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:17.940
And also we just need to start the server.

166
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:31.770
So now, after the refreshing the page, maybe we don't get the error.

167
00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:35.500
So I'm going to bring this one to the right side.

168
00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:50.630
The speed of this depends on your computer CPU as well.

169
00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:59.320
Because I'm recording at the same time I get a slower speed, but probably you get the faster refresh

170
00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:00.680
and refreshment.

171
00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.530
And also you can see the website faster here.

172
00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:07.770
So let me bring this one a little bit higher.

173
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:13.760
Okay.

174
00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:21.820
So let's see that we can get the results now.

175
00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:23.410
It's refreshing.

176
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:28.610
Okay, Now we got the icon and also the home at the top.

177
00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:30.220
If you can see here.

178
00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:35.070
I'm going to zoom this one a little bit so you can see it better.

179
00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:38.970
So we got the icon and this one.

180
00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:42.060
Let's stall this one as well.

181
00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:50.790
So for the styling now, in the next year 13, you can install the link directly here.

182
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:58.410
So you can just add a class name and add some tail and CSS classes here.

183
00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:02.030
So.

184
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.470
I just want to bring these two to the next to each other.

185
00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.610
So I'm going to use the flex.

186
00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:18.630
First, I'm going to change the display to flex and.

187
00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:29.110
And probably we don't need actually the flex because we're going to hide this icon when we are in the

188
00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:31.300
bigger screen.

189
00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:33.670
So I'm going to delete this flex, actually.

190
00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:39.250
So the other things I want to do just want to.

191
00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:47.380
Change the and we add some margin in the x axis of four.

192
00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:49.630
So we have some space.

193
00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:54.610
And between the things and also.

194
00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:58.860
When we have a larger screen and above.

195
00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:06.280
So intelligence says you just write down large the double clone.

196
00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:10.420
So this is going to trigger only in the large size.

197
00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:15.310
So in the large size and above, we want a margin X of six.

198
00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:21.000
And when we hover over them.

199
00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:30.880
I wanted to change the color of the text to be amber 600.

200
00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:35.470
No.

201
00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:39.220
If you hover over it, we see the amber color.

202
00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:44.040
Now let's install the icon.

203
00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:49.060
So for the icon, you're going to have a class name.

204
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:56.320
Which is we want to make the icon bigger.

205
00:16:56.330 --> 00:17:02.000
So I'm just going to change the text to be two x large.

206
00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:11.570
And if you want to see what it takes to to X large means you can use contour space.

207
00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:18.140
And this is going to show you, for example, takes two x large means 24 pixels.

208
00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:18.710
All right.

209
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:27.110
So for changing the size of the icons, react icons you can use text to x large and.

210
00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:30.320
I want to make this one.

211
00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.560
So let's see if they have this change.

212
00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:35.400
So let's refresh the page.

213
00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:37.460
You see, the icon is bigger now.

214
00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:43.340
Now, if you want to I want to hide this icon when we have a bigger screen.

215
00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:52.790
So I'm just say for sizes after the small size, which is the mobile size and above, I want to hide

216
00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:57.500
this icon so we can just add hidden, which is display none.

217
00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:04.730
So now if we increase the size, we don't see the icon.

218
00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:09.740
So in the bigger screens, we don't see the icon until in the mobile size.

219
00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:14.610
So we want to do the opposite for this menu at home.

220
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.760
So for the paragraph I'm going to add in class name.

221
00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:28.560
So the four paragraphs we want to hit in that paragraph in the mobile size so we shouldn't see it now.

222
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:35.880
And for the size above the mobile size, I want to change the display to.

223
00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:40.030
In line so we can see that.

224
00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:47.810
So in the ink, the big size, we see the icon for the this text.

225
00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:51.710
But in this small size we only see the icon.

226
00:18:53.990 --> 00:19:04.190
Then I want to add some margin y axis of two and we want to make the text to be as small, which is

227
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:05.630
14 pixels.

228
00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:12.600
So now we have completed the icon ending menu.

229
00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:16.930
Let's add the.

230
00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:23.160
Let's add the logo on the right side.

231
00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:27.150
So inside the header is X.

232
00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:29.340
So we have added one menu.

233
00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:31.010
Actually, let's add another one.

234
00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:39.660
So I'm going to copy this one using Contour Shift Arrow done simply using contour, Shift Arrow done.

235
00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:48.790
And instead of just having home, I'm going to have another one for about the address would be forward

236
00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:50.070
slash about.

237
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:57.090
And the icon I want to use is I just want to search for.

238
00:19:58.580 --> 00:19:59.510
Info.

239
00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:03.860
So let's search for info in the React icons.

240
00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:06.890
And the icons I want to use is the.

241
00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:08.200
This one.

242
00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:12.340
Bees fill in for circle fill.

243
00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:15.730
So let's copy this by clicking on ADD.

244
00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:18.850
And we just paste it inside the icon.

245
00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:25.910
So now inside our website, we should see different icons or we need to import this one as well.

246
00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:28.240
So I'm going to import.

247
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:38.350
Bees fill in for Circle Field from reactor icons for bees.

248
00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:46.290
As you can see, the GitHub copilot is kind of helpful sometimes suggests you some things.

249
00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:51.430
As you can see now, the items actually are on top of each other.

250
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:55.480
We need to just change the display here.

251
00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:00.280
So here I'm going to change the display to flex.

252
00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:04.990
So we're going to bring them next to each other like this.

253
00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:08.390
So let's see.

254
00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:10.370
This isn't okay.

255
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:13.280
Let's remove this.

256
00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:14.090
Uh.

257
00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:21.460
Okay, so we need to add some space between them as well.

258
00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:23.710
So let's see.

259
00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.410
We can add some space.

260
00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:31.490
Between the icons.

261
00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:34.390
So let's.

262
00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:36.920
Save this one.

263
00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:43.420
We should have some space, but we cannot see.

264
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:46.730
We have this space here, the margin x box here.

265
00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:49.790
But it didn't work for the icon.

266
00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:52.340
Let's check inside the menu icon.

267
00:21:54.120 --> 00:22:03.660
So for the link tag, I have added a margin X of four for the large margin X of six.

268
00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:05.610
And.

269
00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:10.870
It didn't work with the icon.

270
00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.890
So let's add something for the icon.

271
00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:19.120
So we add some margin X of four here.

272
00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:23.780
Okay, so for the icon works as well.

273
00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:26.710
So let's increase the size.

274
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:31.890
So it's working for the text to I didn't case.

275
00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:34.240
Yeah.

276
00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:35.410
This one?

277
00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:35.990
Yeah.

278
00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:36.770
Okay.

279
00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:39.500
That was it for the left side.

280
00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:44.450
Now, let's go to the right side here and add the.

281
00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:48.360
Icon v the logo that we need.

282
00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:50.740
So for the logo.

283
00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:55.610
This is going to be a linked tag as well.

284
00:22:55.610 --> 00:23:00.020
So because we want to have a link tag.

285
00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:09.020
And if you want to redirect the person to the home page, so we just say h ref and this is going to

286
00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:14.150
redirect the person to home page and we need to import the link as well.

287
00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:19.700
So we use contour space to import it from next forward slash link.

288
00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:27.150
And here inside the link, I'm going to add an H to tag.

289
00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:32.170
Which is going to have to span.

290
00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:38.120
So one is spam here and another one next to it.

291
00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:46.140
So the first is spam is going to say I am D.

292
00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:47.500
B.

293
00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:54.550
And the second one, which is this one, it's just going to say clone.

294
00:23:55.780 --> 00:24:03.730
The reason I separated them by using a spam because I want to have a different style for each of the

295
00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:05.080
text.

296
00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:08.620
So I'm going to zoom this a little bit so you can see it better.

297
00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:11.010
For both of them.

298
00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:13.800
I'm going to have some styling.

299
00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:20.280
So I'm going to increase the size of the both of them to two x large.

300
00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:27.560
So make them bigger for the IMDB alone.

301
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:30.080
I want to add some.

302
00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:37.620
And I want to make it bold by changing the font boldness to bold.

303
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:48.820
And let's change the background color to be Amber 500, which is similar to the IMDB logo.

304
00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:59.700
And let's change the y axis padding to one and x axis of two.

305
00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:08.850
And let's make it rounded by just seeing rounded large, which is going to add a border radius of eight

306
00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:10.560
pixels like this.

307
00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:14.160
And for styling of the.

308
00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:18.910
Clone.

309
00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:29.550
I want to change the text instead of two weeks large to x large year and I want to make it hidden when

310
00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:37.680
we have a mobile size, but instead add the size of the bigger than the mobile size.

311
00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:44.260
I want to change the display to a slide to in line so we can see it in the bigger screen.

312
00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:48.000
You can see clone, but in the small screen you don't see it.

313
00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:51.570
And for adding a space between them.

314
00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:54.500
There are plenty of ways to do it.

315
00:25:55.050 --> 00:26:04.410
But the simplest way in the IMDB, you can just add them and margin in the right axis of one.

316
00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:07.200
Marching on the right side.

317
00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.970
So we have like this.

318
00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:15.560
And as you can see, the menu and the logo on top of each other.

319
00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:18.170
So we need to change the display here.

320
00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:21.680
So we need to change the display at a top.

321
00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:25.260
That is covering both of them.

322
00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:31.740
We change the display here to flex, so bring them next to each other.

323
00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:34.210
Like this.

324
00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:40.600
Now let's decrease the size so you can see it better.

325
00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:45.840
And then I want to add some space between them.

326
00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:53.760
So I'm going to change the just to FY content to be a space between by just saying just the five between.

327
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:59.280
And we added a space in the x axis of two.

328
00:26:59.280 --> 00:26:59.910
So.

329
00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:04.630
We have some space between them and the wall.

330
00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:06.180
And.

331
00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.320
As you can see here.

332
00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:19.220
But in the I want to limit the maximum width to be six Excel.

333
00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:22.790
So they're going to come here.

334
00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.580
You have some space, but they are not in the middle.

335
00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:34.470
So we can just change the margin x after the small size and above to auto.

336
00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:40.120
So they're going to come in the middle.

337
00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:45.630
And in the mobile, a small size, we just see the logo.

338
00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:49.880
They are not exactly on next to each other.

339
00:27:49.880 --> 00:28:00.170
So we can just add the items center to bring them to the next to each other vertically.

340
00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:03.980
So let's save this and see the change.

341
00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:12.590
So let's now it's not item start, it's item center.

342
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.690
Okay.

343
00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:19.690
Now they are just aligned with each other.

344
00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:23.780
This is equal to a line items center in CSS.

345
00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:26.030
All right, so now.

346
00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:29.300
I think we have done with this part.

347
00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:31.730
And let's see.

348
00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:38.570
So as you can see in this big size, they are just connected to the wall.

349
00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:43.040
We can add some space in the Y axis of six.

350
00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:47.330
So we make them a little bit come down.

351
00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:48.020
All right.

352
00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:48.860
Like this.

353
00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:51.630
K.

354
00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:55.410
It looks okay.

355
00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:00.750
So now we have created the menu.

356
00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:05.250
So when we click on the about, it goes to the about page.

357
00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:11.940
But we haven't created this page yet, so we get an error saying this page could not be fine.

358
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:14.790
So now.

359
00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:22.620
We're going to create actually the about page in the following sections.

360
00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:28.680
But in the next section we're going to create the this dark mode.

361
00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:33.270
So if you just go to the home page or refresh the page here.

362
00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:38.020
And we see that it's still in the dark mode.

363
00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:41.910
When we click on this icon, we see it's a light mode.

364
00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.920
So this is going to stay even.

365
00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:47.980
You go to the different pages, for example, you go to trending.

366
00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:57.190
So this is going to be always in the light mode so you can change it each time you go to different places.

367
00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:05.320
So you can see now it's working now.

368
00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:11.170
So now in the next section, we're going to work on the dark mode.

369
00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:16.960
But let's just first we have complete this section.

370
00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:19.420
Now, let's add this one to the GitHub.

371
00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:27.640
So we're going to open to source control using Contour shift G, and I'm going to click here on this

372
00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:30.250
plus icon to add everything to GitHub.

373
00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:37.360
I'm going to add some message for the command, which is create.

374
00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:40.190
The header

375
00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:52.400
section, and I'm going to click here and click on the commit and push to push everything to GitHub.

376
00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:58.060
Let's go to GitHub and we refresh the page to see the new commit.

377
00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:02.620
And now we can review what we have done in the header section.

378
00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:05.080
So let me zoom this a little bit.

379
00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:09.100
In the package that JSON, you can see some packages added.

380
00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:12.220
We have installed React icons.

381
00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:22.640
So this with this package, we can get a different icon so we could get the home and the info icon.

382
00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:24.330
In the layout.

383
00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:33.560
G6 We have added the header, so we have just first divided our body to header that more and the search

384
00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:42.530
box and we have added the header at a top and we have imported this component from the components folder.

385
00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:51.270
And we have created a new component inside the components folder called Header that gsx.

386
00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:58.210
Which is imported menu item, which is we are going to.

387
00:31:58.630 --> 00:32:04.630
We have created in other components inside the components folder called menu item.

388
00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:08.650
We have imported this one inside this component.

389
00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:17.890
We have imported two icons from React Icons and also we have imported link from next link to add some

390
00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:22.300
links for our menus and also the logo.

391
00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:29.790
So we have divided this section by a div.

392
00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:38.220
Inside the div we have another div for the menu and one day for the logo and a dark mode.

393
00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:49.580
For the menu we have created and added the menu item component and we have passed the title address

394
00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:50.630
and the icon.

395
00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:59.140
And for the logo we have created to Spam to separate the IMDB and the clone.

396
00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:04.720
And we have separately sell them using 12 and CSS.

397
00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:08.350
And also we have added the extra forward slash.

398
00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:13.990
When we click on this icon, we're going to be redirected to the home page.

399
00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:25.020
We have created the menu item G6 files, which is going which is going to create the each menu item.

400
00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:32.580
Each of them gets a title, address and icon, which we are passing from here.

401
00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:42.700
As a props and we get this phone, these three here and we have created a link tag.

402
00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.820
We pass the address.

403
00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:52.420
We have passed the icon here and also we have passed the title here.

404
00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:57.580
And they have hidden the icon in the larger screen.

405
00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:58.120
And.

406
00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:07.190
We just showed this icon in the mobile size and we did the opposite for the paragraph.

407
00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:09.740
Okay.

408
00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:13.320
That was it for the creating of the header section.

409
00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:18.690
In the next section, we're going to work on the dark mode button.

410
00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:20.580
So see you in the next section.
