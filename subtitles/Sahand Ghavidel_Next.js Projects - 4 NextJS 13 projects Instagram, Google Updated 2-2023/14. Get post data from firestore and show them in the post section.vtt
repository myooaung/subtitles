00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:07.670
All right.

2
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.400
In the last section, we have completed the functionality of sending data from this input.

3
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:22.170
In this section, we're going to get the data that we have uploaded to Firestorm and show it inside

4
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.970
this post section.

5
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.640
The only things that I forgot to mention is for the emoji here.

6
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:37.500
I had the plan to add the emoji at first, but unfortunately for the new version of the emoji package,

7
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:46.800
which is emoji marked and it doesn't work for the next year and reacts any anymore.

8
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:55.350
But as soon as I find out that the an alternative or if the new version works, I'm going to add this

9
00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.590
emoji as well for the project in the update section.

10
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.470
Okay, so let's just start getting the data from the firebase.

11
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.460
Uh, so we need to go to Visual Studio code.

12
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.780
And we go to post Sturgis.

13
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.090
If you remember, before we were using the, uh.

14
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.080
If you remember in the poor feta cheese, actually.

15
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.310
We.

16
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.450
We made the dummy data.

17
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.890
An array of posts, but they were all just hard coded data.

18
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:46.570
Instead of these, we want we want to create these posts using the real data from fire.

19
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:53.800
So in order to do that, we need to create a piece of state for post first.

20
00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:03.460
So here at the top, I just create a state and we call it posts and we set.

21
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.820
Post here.

22
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.570
And we call this a use estate.

23
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.380
And the initial value would be an empty array.

24
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.460
So now we can delete this one.

25
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.920
And instead I'm going to.

26
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:21.990
At the.

27
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:31.670
Uh, I'm going to use a stage to each time that someone comes to this page, which is home page and

28
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:39.890
the feed 30th, we can get the data from the firestorm for this piece of information that we need,

29
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:46.610
which is posts like we just write users, they use the effects.

30
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.370
Dos effects is going to take a function and dependencies.

31
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.320
So we add the function first.

32
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.120
Then the dependency here.

33
00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:13.410
So inside a function, you're going to create a constant called unsubscribe.

34
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:21.540
So unsubscribe actually means that we are getting the information from Firebase with this snapshot,

35
00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.290
and we save it to a constant called unsubscribe.

36
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.700
This is just the convention way.

37
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:31.690
To do it.

38
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.620
The function we are going to use is on a snapshot.

39
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.550
It's Hey, we need to import this on a snapshot from Firestone.

40
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.410
Also, we need to import use a state.

41
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.570
From React sort use effects from react.

42
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.190
This is wrong.

43
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.490
We shouldn't bring it from there.

44
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.670
So we need to import.

45
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.240
Use effects and also use a state.

46
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.560
From reacts, right?

47
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:27.600
So on the snapshot gets now been we need to get the query we want to query the fire.

48
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:38.670
So because we want to get the posts and the collection post and we want to order it by its time the

49
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:39.510
time timestamp.

50
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.860
Okay.

51
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:48.810
So we need to add the Kurri Kurri is actually a building function from fire store, so we need to import

52
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:49.800
this one as well.

53
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.260
So we import it already on a snapshot query.

54
00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.630
So in the collection, collection is a built in function too.

55
00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.700
So we import that one to.

56
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.250
So collection takes two things.

57
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.050
The first one is DB, which is coming from the fire.

58
00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.760
Fire.

59
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.070
FIREBASE That is that they have created.

60
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.840
Okay.

61
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.520
So we imported that one too.

62
00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.690
And inside the DB you want to go to a collection called Posts?

63
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.990
After that.

64
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.990
We want to after the query, actually.

65
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.400
You want to order it by.

66
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:47.120
So we use order buy, which is a building function from first or two and the file order by.

67
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.860
I wanted to order it by timestamp.

68
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.890
Which is the field in our post.

69
00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.210
And, uh, I want it to be descending.

70
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.150
It means the new ones comes first.

71
00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.370
Okay.

72
00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.230
So after we got everything.

73
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:17.140
Here.

74
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.870
We we want to get this snapshot.

75
00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:24.870
And when we get it, we get it.

76
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.690
We want to sit the posts.

77
00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:36.990
I mean, the estate we have created here.

78
00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:40.950
This morning we set the post.

79
00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.890
To a snapshot that duck.

80
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.370
So which in this one is.

81
00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.690
A snapshot date.

82
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:53.560
Ducks.

83
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.880
This is the information we get from Firestone.

84
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.220
Let's see.

85
00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.470
We write down everything correctly.

86
00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.030
So.

87
00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:09.310
Where?

88
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:16.010
Query.

89
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.230
Collection DV.

90
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.740
Post order by.

91
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.670
And, uh.

92
00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:31.630
That is fine to.

93
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.920
Snapshots?

94
00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:40.740
That's correct.

95
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:41.910
Okay.

96
00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:44.810
You get in error.

97
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:45.970
Let's check the error.

98
00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:49.970
See.

99
00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:54.830
And one parenthesis is missing.

100
00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.520
So let me check again.

101
00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:01.200
And that's correct.

102
00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:07.620
We just need to return this unsubscribe server just to return this.

103
00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:11.130
Now.

104
00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.900
They say unsubscribe is not defined.

105
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:24.200
I think we don't even need this one because we are returning.

106
00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.400
You just need to return this one.

107
00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:28.630
Delete this.

108
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:39.420
Now.

109
00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.800
He said the snapshot is empty.

110
00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:48.340
So let's check.

111
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.010
I think you.

112
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:57.170
Snapshot.

113
00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:08.800
We need to add another parenthesis because now this one is outside.

114
00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:13.810
This should be inside the Snapchat on Snapchat.

115
00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:14.320
So.

116
00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:19.020
We need to add apprentices that close this one.

117
00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:25.100
And, uh, it's going to be open from here.

118
00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.150
That should be fine.

119
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.290
Now it's refresh to page.

120
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:48.360
On ex expected times, but it was a cluster of severe.

121
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.950
If we check again, you know, we we actually.

122
00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:00.010
Put parentheses here.

123
00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:01.570
And the courier.

124
00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.390
Courier should cover all of this.

125
00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:07.640
And then.

126
00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:10.230
Uh.

127
00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:14.550
This one should be.

128
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:22.360
Sorry to late.

129
00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.620
This is.

130
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:30.320
I think death now should work.

131
00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:33.530
Okay.

132
00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:37.320
It's working now.

133
00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:41.190
So we made the honest stamp shots.

134
00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:49.320
Which is returning the unsubscribe at the remove the unsubscribe because we are returning directly actually

135
00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:55.710
we we can delete this one to the return this phone to.

136
00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.450
Because it's just one thing.

137
00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.170
It should be like it can be like this stuff.

138
00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:05.130
Okay.

139
00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:15.600
Uh, the courier is covering from here to here because we're quoting a collection called Post and Order

140
00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:24.000
by Tom Stamp the sending and this on Snapchat is going to return a snapshot and the snapshot is going

141
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.830
to give us all the posts.

142
00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:34.050
Now we are getting the post, but the reason we are getting like this because it's was hard coded before.

143
00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:38.010
If you look at the post that J is.

144
00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:46.400
We got the information from the Post, but we made it like this post that name post, the time stamp

145
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.390
or something like that.

146
00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:54.830
But when we are getting information from fire as store, we need to just make it like this.

147
00:11:54.830 --> 00:12:00.940
Instead of just seeing posts, we just see post better than that name.

148
00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:03.680
Now if you check, we're getting the name.

149
00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.230
So we need to fix this one for.

150
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:08.390
All the other ones.

151
00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:14.220
So we have the data here for username ifixit.

152
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:17.480
Time is stamped.

153
00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:20.270
We don't torture because the time served is different.

154
00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:28.580
We need to install a package called moment, so we just ignore it for now, for the user image we add.

155
00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:34.550
And what else we have, we have the image here.

156
00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.050
Um.

157
00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:39.170
I think that's it.

158
00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:40.060
It just check.

159
00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:41.160
Yeah.

160
00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:42.820
We have everything.

161
00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:44.730
Except.

162
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:48.730
We don't have the image yet to check again.

163
00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:54.520
The image is as called image actually inside the database.

164
00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:55.300
Okay.

165
00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.820
Now we should see a.

166
00:12:58.930 --> 00:12:59.180
Okay.

167
00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:04.400
Yeah.

168
00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:05.960
The images are similar.

169
00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:07.850
Yeah.

170
00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:10.040
Let's delete the database.

171
00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:12.620
Everything.

172
00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:17.680
Now we post some images instead.

173
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.200
A storage too.

174
00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:23.160
We can delete all the storage.

175
00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:37.080
I have already downloaded some images, so here is a first image I get.

176
00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:42.450
This image recorded.

177
00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:43.200
Amazing.

178
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:47.510
And for this, the icon.

179
00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:53.510
I feel if you add a border to it, it will be very nice.

180
00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:56.210
So let me check.

181
00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.010
And the place we see that image.

182
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:08.940
I think it was.

183
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:13.390
It was here.

184
00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:20.870
And we added a dot icon.

185
00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:23.690
It, uh, not here.

186
00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:30.820
Where was it?

187
00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:34.690
Uh, yeah, it was inside the input note here.

188
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:39.580
So let me search for the X icon.

189
00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:46.740
So I'm here.

190
00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:48.300
So we just.

191
00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:52.470
I feel if I had a border, a very nice.

192
00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.480
Yeah, that looks better.

193
00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.650
And you can remove the.

194
00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:00.300
Shadow to.

195
00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:09.960
And we just change the color of the border to be marked.

196
00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:13.400
Okay.

197
00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:15.410
Looks better.

198
00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:19.570
And then we can bring it a little bit down to.

199
00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:20.980
So we just added padding.

200
00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:22.950
One.

201
00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:31.170
Padding, not padding margin margin of four.

202
00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:33.420
Okay.

203
00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.350
Looks okay.

204
00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:37.320
So we just say amazing.

205
00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.250
And we tweeted.

206
00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:45.240
And, uh, we should see it just after that.

207
00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:46.200
Yeah.

208
00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:48.520
We don't see this.

209
00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:49.340
Amazing.

210
00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:52.310
Let's check in the poster.

211
00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:53.300
Yes.

212
00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:59.110
Before the image we had.

213
00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:03.090
On the name.

214
00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:05.710
What about the ticks?

215
00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:07.690
So let's find the texts.

216
00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:11.730
Let me search for texts.

217
00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.140
Now post the text here.

218
00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:19.710
You just add data here as well.

219
00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:22.080
So we should see the amazing.

220
00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:25.320
Now let's add another image.

221
00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:28.960
This is a bird to survive.

222
00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:29.950
Just say a bird.

223
00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.830
And finally, we add the.

224
00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:44.640
I think the first image was.

225
00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:45.150
Yeah.

226
00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:47.700
Just a nice.

227
00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:48.750
Okay.

228
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:56.620
I think everything looks okay.

229
00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:01.440
But we just need to add that time stamp.

230
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:08.710
So for Timestamp we need to add a package called the React Moments.

231
00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:12.460
So let me search and show it here for you.

232
00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:17.530
You search for a package, calls and reacts.

233
00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:18.850
Moments.

234
00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:24.990
And in the search results, we go to a NPM package.

235
00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:27.910
Called React moment.

236
00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:29.030
Click here.

237
00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:34.230
Uh, before installation.

238
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:40.620
We just need to npn install moment and react moment so we copy this and replaced it here.

239
00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:50.820
They stop the server and paste the code and for usage we just need to import react moment and we just

240
00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:53.550
add it whenever we want to use it.

241
00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:56.340
And we want to use a method called.

242
00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.620
Uh, from now.

243
00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:04.120
So I show you here, the example here.

244
00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:06.130
You want to show it from now.

245
00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:08.410
And this is the format we get.

246
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:15.940
We should convert to this format and the the things we get from fire as store.

247
00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:20.740
So we use a method called to date to do it.

248
00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:22.690
Okay.

249
00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:25.110
I think the installation has been completed.

250
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:28.860
Let's start the server again and we go to that.

251
00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:34.240
Here post a timestamp.

252
00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:37.750
We need to at the moment.

253
00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.730
So just a moment.

254
00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:50.020
They close it and we need to imported react moments since see here the important moment from react moments.

255
00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:56.260
So this one and inside we need to get the.

256
00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:00.760
Post dot timestamp.

257
00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:07.800
But we need to convert this one to dates.

258
00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:11.020
This is a built in JavaScript function.

259
00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:16.240
Then we want to use from now attributes.

260
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:18.420
Okay.

261
00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:24.570
Now, if you check our website, we should see a timestamp vision.

262
00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:26.040
Refresh to page.

263
00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:32.340
Still a service is loading.

264
00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:37.490
Santa cannot read the two date.

265
00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:43.590
Because sometimes it takes.

266
00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:45.790
We need to protect this.

267
00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:48.600
Sometimes it takes time to calm down.

268
00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:52.830
So we just said just in case it is not available, don't use it.

269
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:53.370
So.

270
00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:57.190
Now we test.

271
00:19:59.280 --> 00:19:59.520
Yeah.

272
00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:00.300
That's working.

273
00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:02.490
Just a few seconds ago.

274
00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:10.640
And if you one minute, 2 minutes past this, one's going to show something else.

275
00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:11.780
Okay.

276
00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.350
Now, that was it for this section.

277
00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.390
Let's add this one to the get top.

278
00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:23.930
So we just take it at all and we add a message.

279
00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:28.370
Of.

280
00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:33.550
Get post data from.

281
00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:36.550
Fires tore.

282
00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:39.930
And the.

283
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:43.130
Sure.

284
00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:47.260
Show them in the post.

285
00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:52.770
Six and we push it to get her.

286
00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:57.980
Let's test it.

287
00:20:58.090 --> 00:20:59.190
Let's see what we added.

288
00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.780
So we refresh the page by clicking on this.

289
00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:03.760
Now we have 14 commits.

290
00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:06.860
And.

291
00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:13.080
The last one is get post data from Pfizer.

292
00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.880
I showed him in the post section.

293
00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:24.840
So when he deleted this data we created we have we have created before the dummy data.

294
00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:33.900
Instead, we made a piece of state and we got the data from Pfizer store using use user state use effect

295
00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:34.260
hook.

296
00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:43.170
We used on a snapshot, we carried the collection of post and we sorted by timestamp the sending.

297
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:51.490
And inside input that if you just add a border to the icon for the postage.

298
00:21:51.490 --> 00:22:01.690
Yes, we changed the we added the date data because this is the format we need to get from file store.

299
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:11.470
Then we added a package called Moment React Moment and we use from now attribute to be converted the

300
00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.240
time stamp to date.

301
00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:16.390
Okay.

302
00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:18.760
Yeah, that was it.

303
00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.850
Now we have installed moment and react moment.

304
00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:24.830
But that was it for this section.

305
00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:30.740
So see you in the next video.
