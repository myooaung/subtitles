1
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:07,960
All right.

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,720
Let's start our project.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:18,420
First, we need to install the next year and in the following we need to install Telvin CFS.

4
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,140
So this is the final version of the project.

5
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:30,400
I just keep it here as a reference, so we know that what we are going to do in the next step.

6
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:36,490
So let's minimize this and we go to Google Chrome.

7
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:47,880
This search for next year and in the search result, we click on next year's that all Archie.

8
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,390
So are you going to use?

9
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,480
The next year, the new version, which is twelve point one.

10
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,220
Which includes the undermine ICR and other good stuff.

11
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,260
So we need to go to documentation.

12
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:20,100
And as a I'm supposed to you have already installed MPN and notorious all you have a yawn if you're

13
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,080
interested in yawn.

14
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:22,580
So.

15
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:30,510
And then we need to use this comment line to install next year, so we copy this line of code.

16
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,880
And we open our terminal.

17
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,310
I'm using common prompt.

18
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:44,610
Let me increase the size a little bit, so we paste the link.

19
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,430
And after that, we need to add the name of the project.

20
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:55,400
Or just the first we need to.

21
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:01,270
A specified the folder we want to create, I want to create the project in the desktop

22
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:06,580
and I want to create it in this folder here, of course.

23
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,850
So I see the end to course and I paste the link.

24
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:17,200
And after the link, it would be the name of the project.

25
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,150
Our the practice two times this project.

26
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,820
So.

27
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,620
I named this one, Google.

28
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,680
Version three.

29
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:31,560
So.

30
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:39,050
And after that, I show you here, I really created two projects.

31
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,350
So I.

32
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,450
Press enter.

33
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:55,210
Can you just need to press enter and sometimes is going to ask you to verify and you should just press

34
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:55,800
why?

35
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,410
So we just wait for this one.

36
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,420
No, I was just installing the dependencies like React, React next.

37
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:18,480
And finally, some diff dependencies like installations as length conflict necks.

38
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:24,370
So it's going to take a few minutes.

39
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:34,270
At the same time, if you go to tailwinds CSIS website, the search for Stillman's CSIS and we click

40
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,310
on Tailwind CSIS dot com.

41
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:47,620
Rapidly built modern website, this link was already on the, I think, version three of the hill on

42
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,460
CSF.

43
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,530
We go to get started.

44
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,650
You know, you can see that now the version is.

45
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,160
Three.

46
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:08,790
As we are installing on the framework we need to hear in the installation, we need to create click

47
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,150
on the framework guides.

48
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,430
And here we click on next year.

49
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,300
It's already done the first part.

50
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:29,460
Already installed everything we need to just go to the folder, which is to see the Google version three

51
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:35,490
and we open the Visual Studio code using code.

52
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:38,810
Space Dot.

53
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:47,420
And this is going to open the visual studio code with the folder that is created for next year.

54
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,090
So we maximize this.

55
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,400
We close the gifts, start a time.

56
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:59,320
We opened a terminal using control of Bektic.

57
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,280
We can toggle the terminal.

58
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,310
I think you can use control as well.

59
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:14,440
So here in the terminal, we need to install tailwinds to assist, so we go back to see if this website

60
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,780
here, they're suggesting that first we installed the pyramids.

61
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,740
Yes, this sort of prefix fixer.

62
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:27,830
So we copy this line of code and we go to back to the we closed the terminal.

63
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:28,540
We don't need it.

64
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:33,760
We go to the Visual Studio code and we paste the code.

65
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:45,810
So after this, this is going to take a few seconds just to tell us this, this is a very small package

66
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:47,830
and the.

67
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:56,030
After death, we need to initialize it, so we use this children to assist in it.

68
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:05,660
To initialize the toilets cases and get this some folders that we need like, you know, you just pay

69
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:14,240
attention to here, we get some folders to post cases that config and also Kelvyn that country and we

70
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:21,340
need to change the config files a little bit to tell them that we are using next year.

71
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:30,970
So here they're suggesting that in the content section, you changed the pages and the components to

72
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:35,410
cover the jars and test files tests for Typekit script.

73
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:36,850
So.

74
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:43,320
This installation is OK for both next year and Tavis School.

75
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,250
So we can copy all of them, and we go back to visual studio code and the.

76
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:56,150
Choose everything using Control A and B paste.

77
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:57,840
Here.

78
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,800
So the conflict file is fine now we can close it.

79
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,780
Next is the globals, that's USIS.

80
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:11,630
We need to replace everything inside the next year school boards.

81
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,580
This file?

82
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:24,740
And with these three basic components and utilities, so we copy this and we go to the folder sales

83
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,250
folder.

84
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:34,620
We go to global stats CSIS, and we choose everything using control a delete them and replace the new

85
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:42,330
codes that that this is just enough for the Tillman cases to work.

86
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,430
We don't need to home.

87
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,010
We note that we don't.

88
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,880
We will not know.

89
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:56,640
We don't need the home that module that to this anymore because you're are using Felix's so we can delete

90
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:56,970
them.

91
00:07:59,220 --> 00:07:59,700
Here.

92
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,220
And in the pages, we go to index that, yes.

93
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,420
We can see that there.

94
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:13,000
We have the template of the next year.

95
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,950
We don't need any of them.

96
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:19,180
We just from the main to the future, they're going to delete everything.

97
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,280
For the title, we change it to.

98
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,930
Google version three.

99
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,760
This is tiling removal.

100
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,910
We don't need these to marshals the stealth and the image now.

101
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:47,400
So this is the things we have, and let's just write down something here like, Hello world.

102
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:55,800
And let's start the server using npm run, Dev.

103
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:07,500
This is going to initialize the server on localhost three thousand so we can use control click to go

104
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,040
to the.

105
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,870
Localhost three thousand.

106
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,180
This is going to open it in Chrome.

107
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:19,360
You can see that we're getting a helloworld in Tillmans yourself, a stylus.

108
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:25,960
So that's it for the children's services part.

109
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,410
And installation.

110
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:33,740
For deploying our troops now later, we need to get home.

111
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:35,980
So let's.

112
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:44,440
Just go to get her and we create a new repository.

113
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,700
I sign signing with my account, which is this one.

114
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,150
You're in the top right.

115
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:02,100
You can see the plus sign we need to right click and click on new repository.

116
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,030
So the new repository, which just the.

117
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,530
Put the name for it, I call it Google.

118
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,850
Version three.

119
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:13,490
And the description is.

120
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:23,590
Google Clone using next genius and.

121
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,270
Tailwind, yes, yes.

122
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,680
We just keep it public.

123
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:35,350
If you want to keep it for yourself private, it's fine.

124
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,150
It's up to you.

125
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:44,680
We just click on Create a repository to create our new repository.

126
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:54,060
So these are the common lines we need to do inside the terminal to initialize our GitHub.

127
00:10:55,450 --> 00:11:02,950
Uh, first, we need to hear we stuff the server who was in control, see?

128
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:09,050
So the first step is just initialize the kids.

129
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,550
We just take it and it.

130
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,130
And now we add everything to the.

131
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,970
Geared to using get at.

132
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:24,800
We create a message using Git Commit.

133
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:33,800
And we just say and so next year and and.

134
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:44,120
She insists, and now we need to use the lines here, so.

135
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:57,850
This is going to get remote and in just a sign your ear, which is the URL of the new repository.

136
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,560
So we need to.

137
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,170
Paste this one here.

138
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,690
And then we need to.

139
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,330
Just push it to the original.

140
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,500
We use this line, so.

141
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,560
Yeah, no, we just paste this one.

142
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:26,850
This is the first time you're using the next time we just need to use, get at or get come in and get

143
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:27,240
push.

144
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:36,900
So in the next section, when we add more things, I'm going to add to use it again, and the only things

145
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,110
we need to use is these three lines of code.

146
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:50,330
Now, if you go to our getup now we refresh the page, we can see that we already push everything to

147
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:50,990
get hot.

148
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,450
We already have to come in.

149
00:12:53,570 --> 00:13:01,070
The first one is from the next year itself that is automatically created and this is ours.

150
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:10,970
Which is installed next year and help us to assess the things we did is just installed next year in

151
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,430
the index that, yes, we deleted everything.

152
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,550
We changed the title and we just put.

153
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:18,390
Hello, world.

154
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,220
And in.

155
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:30,260
Some config file be created using cassettes and using telescopes initialization.

156
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:37,610
In global of these cases, we treat everything and replace with this three lines of code.

157
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:45,200
And in conflict that, yes, we've changed the content to include JavaScript and of script.

158
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:51,340
