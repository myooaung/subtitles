00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.630
And welcome back.

2
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.690
This section is going to be a very quick update for our project.

3
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:23.420
When we deployed the project, I forgot to add the number of likes here, so let's do this one.

4
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.710
Let's go to Visual Studio code and just after the.

5
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:40.990
This section just before the caption area, before the buttons in this in the middle of the buttons

6
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.730
and the caption area.

7
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.030
So let's find this section.

8
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.680
So these are the buttons.

9
00:00:52.870 --> 00:01:02.260
And this is the caption, so just after this section, we can add the likes numbers, so we just say

10
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:12.380
if the likes are the last laugh is bigger than zero, then we're going to have that section.

11
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.720
Otherwise we just it's going to be nothing.

12
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.740
So this is going to be a paragraph.

13
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.780
So let me add paragraph.

14
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.390
So we should do it manually.

15
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.310
Doesn't suggest this.

16
00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.780
So let's close the paragraph tank.

17
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.660
Yeah.

18
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:52.220
So in India, it should be just like.

19
00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:01.200
That left, for example, if you have two likes, it's going to be two and.

20
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.790
After the space was just, say, likes.

21
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.580
So this fund should be here.

22
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.910
All right, so let's see.

23
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.970
I still cannot see this chick the problem.

24
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.710
So this is going to be like that length.

25
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.830
And let's add some styling.

26
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.350
So the class name would be font both.

27
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.700
And add some margin at the bottom of one.

28
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.990
This is the last that dance.

29
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.450
So it should work, so let's check again.

30
00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:31.930
You know, this is the final version, actually, we have to check this one out, and let's let's run

31
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:41.800
our application first and we go to localhost three thousand and I'm completely, uh, I'm checking the

32
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.060
final version, actually.

33
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.780
So here we refresh the page.

34
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.270
So you refresh again.

35
00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.870
Sometimes it takes time to load.

36
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.360
I should be fine.

37
00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:10.190
Yeah.

38
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:20.870
So now we like the first post, we see that one likes the second one, too, and it's.

39
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.010
Check for the first one, which has already one life, so it should be.

40
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:30.910
Two likes.

41
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:43.960
This is fine for this, so we need to sign in with another account to check the number of likes, so

42
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.160
we sign in with my other Gmail.

43
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.600
And let's like the first post.

44
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.120
Now we can see that we have two likes.

45
00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.380
All right.

46
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:05.800
So it's working fine, so let's add it to get up so we can see it in the final version as well.

47
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.730
So we just take it at everything and we permit this one.

48
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:22.590
Show the number of the likes.

49
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.680
And we push it to get up.

50
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:36.810
If you wait a few seconds, it's going to update the final version to so in the final version now we

51
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.490
cannot see the number of lives.

52
00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.910
But if you go to where so?

53
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.970
You're.

54
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.770
You go to the homepage.

55
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.330
Now it's updated, actually showed the number of likes.

56
00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.610
And to refresh the final version.

57
00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.090
That's still.

58
00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:09.330
An updated.

59
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.630
It takes a few minutes.

60
00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.900
Let's check the Earth so they can go here.

61
00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.150
Still, you can see now it's just finished.

62
00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:32.710
Yeah, now you can see the number of likes in our final version as well.

63
00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.910
All right.

64
00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:41.520
So that was a short video of an updated our project.

65
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:43.800
Just wait for the.

66
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:51.040
New updates, I'm going to add more functionality to the project, so, Stuart, next time.
