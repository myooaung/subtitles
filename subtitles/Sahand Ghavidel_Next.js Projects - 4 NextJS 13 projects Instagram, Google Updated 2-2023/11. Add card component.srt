1
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:04,130
All right.

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:08,780
In the last section, we have completed the loading effect in our website.

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,650
In this section, we're going to work on the.

4
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:18,490
Card components and make the website like the one in the final version.

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,380
With this card, so I'm going to show you.

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,270
This is just a component.

7
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,710
With the image at the top.

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,650
We have this, uh.

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:41,030
Description of the movie, but is limited to only two lines.

10
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,070
So I'm going to show you how to do it.

11
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:49,970
And also, we have a title here with the release date and also the.

12
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,140
This section.

13
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:56,180
So this is one day and then we have the title and this one too.

14
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:01,280
So we need to create a component for that one and add it to the.

15
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:06,220
Uh, results is that we have created.

16
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:14,590
So if you go back to our website and we go to Explorer section using Contour shift E.

17
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:22,700
So we had a component here and it was called results that gsx.

18
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:34,050
But we just show the title of the movie, but we want to pass this data and create a card component

19
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,430
and add it here.

20
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,310
So I'm going to create.

21
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,540
A car's components here.

22
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:51,020
And we're going to just pass a few things like the key, which is the result.

23
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,910
Dot ID.

24
00:01:54,140 --> 00:02:03,980
And also we have the results we passed, the result which we are getting from the map.

25
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:10,580
And then we need to close this card and we need to create this component inside this folder.

26
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:16,760
So I'm going to create a file called card dot JS X.

27
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,230
And this is going to be a React functional component.

28
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,850
For now.

29
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:28,190
And this is going to get that results.

30
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,400
From here as a prop.

31
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:41,770
So the result is going to be from there and we can just for now show something.

32
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,110
Inside this card.

33
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,370
So we're going to get the results.

34
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:56,410
And here I'm just want to show something like a result.

35
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:58,920
Dot.

36
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,700
So it should be inside.

37
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:08,280
A curly braces so we could just say result dot, for example.

38
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:19,860
For now we just say the original title or ID so I'll come just say result dot ID and let's.

39
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,040
Imported inside the results that JSX.

40
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:34,390
I'm going to use control space at the end of the card name and auto import it now inside our website.

41
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,370
So let's refresh the page.

42
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,510
We see the IDs.

43
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:48,700
So this is going to initialize it.

44
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,830
Something went wrong.

45
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,450
So we.

46
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,940
Which failed.

47
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,160
So let's try again.

48
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,260
So inside the.

49
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,350
Page 36.

50
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,930
So everything is the same as before.

51
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:22,710
We should.

52
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,350
We shouldn't get an error, actually.

53
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,250
So.

54
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,390
Let's try again.

55
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:47,670
Let's stop the server and we use MPN run dev.

56
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,020
Again.

57
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:59,970
And let's see now it's compiled the client and server side successfully.

58
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,880
Let's go to the home page and we refresh the page now.

59
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,270
So we got the error again.

60
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:21,630
Let me pause the video and I'll check the error.

61
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,750
I'll be back when I find the error.

62
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:26,310
All right.

63
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,450
I find the error.

64
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,360
Actually, there was no error.

65
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:34,770
My wi fi had a problem, so I couldn't fetch the data.

66
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:41,060
So now if you go trending, we get these data.

67
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:45,450
So if you go to top rated, you get different IDs.

68
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,750
The things I want to do.

69
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,750
I want to style this phone like a final version.

70
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,530
So we're going to have a great display.

71
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:01,380
So when we when we are in the mobile size, we get only one column.

72
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:08,360
And when we go to the bigger size like a tablet, we get two columns.

73
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:19,720
Then we get three columns in the large and four for the like a big screen and.

74
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:26,740
If we have a massive screen like a TV or something, we get five columns.

75
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,130
So I'm going to show you how to do it.

76
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:35,470
So inside the result is X.

77
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:39,020
We're going to style this.

78
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:47,700
Diff here at a top, and we're going to change the display of this one to great.

79
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,410
So.

80
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,470
Let's add a class name here.

81
00:06:53,610 --> 00:07:00,930
And we just I don't want it to be great in the mobile size, but in the mobile size and above, I want

82
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,780
the it has a great display.

83
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,320
Great.

84
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,280
In the mobile size and above.

85
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:16,450
I want the grid to be to has to have two columns.

86
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:24,700
So we just say great calls, two in the larger screen and above.

87
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:27,250
I want to have a grid.

88
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:31,820
With three columns.

89
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,150
And for the ex large.

90
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:49,350
Let's have a great with columns four and four, the two x large, which is for the like a TV size.

91
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:55,590
We have a grid with the columns five.

92
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,880
And we're going to.

93
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:11,180
Limit the maximum width of this result to six Excel, which is similar to the header section.

94
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:16,670
And also we want to bring it to the center using Amex Auto.

95
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:24,380
And we add some padding in the Y axis of four.

96
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:33,800
So now in our website, we see the results like this, but we're going to replace each of them with

97
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,730
a card with all the information, like the image and other things.

98
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:42,800
But for now, I just want to show you how to make a grid system.

99
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:51,020
So let's go to our car section and fix.

100
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,270
Everything else.

101
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,370
So we get the results.

102
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:02,920
Now, instead of just showing the line, I'm going to work on the.

103
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,430
Other parts of the car section.

104
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:18,600
The first things I want to do is just install the card border and itself.

105
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,410
So we just add a class name here.

106
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,130
So what happened?

107
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,120
He had a class name.

108
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,510
And here we just.

109
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,940
I want this one to.

110
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,850
Change the cursor of the.

111
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:43,720
Mouse to pointer.

112
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,370
So when we.

113
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,600
So we see a pointing hand when we hover over it.

114
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,330
And let's.

115
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:00,320
Add some shadow effect as well.

116
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:08,660
So in the a small size and above, firstly I want to have some padding of three.

117
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:17,490
And I want to have some shadow effect as well when we hover over it.

118
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,900
So when we hover over it, I want to have a shadow.

119
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,910
With the color of a slate 400.

120
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,850
And also shadow.

121
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,260
So that was the color of the shadow.

122
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,280
Now we want the size of the shadow.

123
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:46,200
So the shadow I want to have is the medium size.

124
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:51,650
And also I want to make it rounded.

125
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,720
So rounded, large.

126
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:01,340
And also in the small size and above, I want to have a border.

127
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,480
So after the border.

128
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,810
Let's say, the color of the border.

129
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,490
So I want the border.

130
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:20,060
To be a Slate 400.

131
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,650
And also, I want to have some marching.

132
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,380
Of two.

133
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:33,650
And also let's add some transitions.

134
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:38,720
So we want to have some transition to the shadow effect.

135
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:49,280
So we just choose transition shadow and with the duration of, for example, 200 milliseconds.

136
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:52,160
So now we have some.

137
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,270
Cards for each of them.

138
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:58,990
It has a border, and when we hover over it, we see a shadow.

139
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,240
And the.

140
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,350
Let's refresh the page.

141
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:08,010
And in the dark mode.

142
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,660
Also, we have a shadow.

143
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:13,330
But the shadow is kind of a.

144
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,470
Writer here.

145
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,410
But here we see it like dark.

146
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:22,800
It's the same color, but in the different background color.

147
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,910
You see it like that?

148
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:30,290
So the card is just now a small part.

149
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:36,530
When we have we add the image and other things, you can see it better.

150
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:43,070
So let's go back and let's bring this one to the right side so we can see the changes in real time.

151
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:47,420
So I'm going to make it like a mobile size.

152
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:53,540
And now I want to add some images and etc..

153
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:03,700
So let's delete this result that ID for now.

154
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:09,120
And instead let's add a link tag.

155
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,730
So link tag is going to.

156
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:18,970
As you know, the link tag is coming from the next post slash link.

157
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,670
And this is going to.

158
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,280
When we click on the card, we go to a different place.

159
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:32,060
For example, the H ref.

160
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,210
Is going to be.

161
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,640
So let's create this.

162
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,160
This is going to be dynamic.

163
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,960
So add back take.

164
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,450
And it's going to be.

165
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,710
Movie.

166
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,410
Forward slash movie.

167
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:53,370
Forward.

168
00:13:53,370 --> 00:14:01,070
Slash dynamic route, which is the idea of the movie.

169
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:07,380
So we just say result dot ID and inside the link.

170
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,790
We're going to have.

171
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,840
The image and other things.

172
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,870
So first thing first, I want to add the image.

173
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:26,770
The image we are using the image component of the next JSS, which has some extra benefit and ask some.

174
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,720
You can add a loading effect on other things.

175
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:35,680
So let's close this one for the CRC.

176
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:42,980
Of the image for the source of the image we are going to have.

177
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,050
And.

178
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,280
This URL.

179
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,950
As we get the suggestion.

180
00:14:54,270 --> 00:15:06,380
Htmg bee forward slash TX forward slash p original and can be resolved at back drop path or result that

181
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,370
poster.

182
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,760
Underlying path.

183
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,550
So I'm going to use this one.

184
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,060
This is going to show the image.

185
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:24,480
We are getting an error because we haven't actually use the width and height for the image stack for

186
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,240
the next.

187
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,320
Yes, width and height is mandatory.

188
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:35,040
So for the width I want to use the.

189
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,250
500.

190
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,330
And for the height I want to use.

191
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,410
300.

192
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:54,160
K.

193
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,070
We still get an error.

194
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:57,510
The error.

195
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,050
The other error is this.

196
00:15:59,050 --> 00:15:59,470
U.

197
00:15:59,470 --> 00:15:59,740
R.

198
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,430
L.

199
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,980
Uh, let's see the height.

200
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:06,140
So let's refresh the page.

201
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,450
The other error is this URL image.

202
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:20,820
That team DB dot org is not configured under images in your next configs.

203
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:28,020
So we need to add this URL inside this file next dot conflict that js that we have here.

204
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,360
So I'm going to copy this URL.

205
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:42,160
I go to this next conflict, that is and we need to create some files here.

206
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,390
So after this experimental.

207
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,240
We have the app.

208
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,380
The directory.

209
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,190
True.

210
00:16:55,010 --> 00:17:00,980
After that, we're going to have another thing called images.

211
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:13,530
And this image is going to be equal to a curly braces set of curly braces, which gives us the domain.

212
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:20,270
Domains and we open a set of.

213
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,120
Bracket.

214
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:28,200
And inside this, we're going to paste the link that we have copied from here.

215
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:33,480
So because we have changed a config file, we need to restart the server.

216
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:39,570
So we stop the server and we use NPM run diff to start the server again.

217
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,780
So let's see that we get an error.

218
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:45,580
Or not.

219
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:48,590
So I'm going to close this next conflict.

220
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:52,690
That is, let's close the left side, too, so we have more space.

221
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,830
And let's refresh the page.

222
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,410
It's okay.

223
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:07,220
We are getting the images for now.

224
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,090
Okay.

225
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,370
That's a good sign.

226
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,840
So we get the image.

227
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:15,910
Now.

228
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:23,010
And in the big size we see the images are smaller.

229
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:29,820
Okay, let's add some other effects as well.

230
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,970
So I'm going to show you in the tablet size.

231
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:44,440
So for the image, we're going to add some styling using 12 and CSS.

232
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,350
I'm going to add a class name.

233
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:56,060
First thing first, I want to when we have a small size and above, I want it to be rounded.

234
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,340
Add a top.

235
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,090
So only the top one.

236
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:07,950
I want it to be rounded, but in the large size.

237
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,470
So it's just say around the two large.

238
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,460
And the.

239
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,760
Let's see what else we can add.

240
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:25,900
So when we hover over this card, I want to.

241
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:32,170
This image to be transparent a little bit more.

242
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:39,520
But I want to, for example, in the final version, even I move on this part.

243
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,070
I want the image has a opacity.

244
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:49,570
So the easiest way to do that is to add a group at a top div.

245
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:52,060
We just say group here.

246
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:57,750
And then here inside the image.

247
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:01,590
We just say if.

248
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:12,750
We hover over the group, so we just say group dash hover when this happens.

249
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,090
So change the opacity.

250
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,990
To 80%.

251
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:28,120
So this is going to when we hover over it, we see 80% opacity.

252
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,550
But this is very fast.

253
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,650
So I'm going to add a transition.

254
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,610
On the opacity.

255
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:41,160
With the duration of Tour 200.

256
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:42,490
Okay.

257
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,370
Like this.

258
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:47,250
Even the we are outside the image.

259
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,860
We see the opacity.

260
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:57,280
And also I want to when the image is not there, I want to see a loading effect.

261
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,100
I don't want you to wait.

262
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,070
For example, if you go to the top rated now.

263
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,940
So this is going to let's refresh the page.

264
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:14,890
So as you can see, you just see an empty things.

265
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:18,850
But we want to add this same loading effect here.

266
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:30,670
The simplest way to do that in next year's 13 image tag is to add a placeholder and we need to set the

267
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,350
placeholder to blur.

268
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,620
And then we want to add some blower.

269
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:39,960
They tell you our Al?

270
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,750
And this is going to be.

271
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,580
Uh, that is Spinner.

272
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:51,690
We had this spinner dot SVG.

273
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,250
So now if you refresh the page.

274
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,020
So let's wait until this compiled.

275
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,700
Now, if you refresh the page, we should see the spanner.

276
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,700
In the image.

277
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,880
I'm going to load this one again.

278
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:15,560
You see, before the.

279
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:20,250
The image loads we see as banner.

280
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,160
Okay, this is too fast.

281
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,400
But if you have this kind of.

282
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:37,400
A smaller size, like you have a slower internet.

283
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,040
You can see the smaller in the longer term.

284
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:41,600
Okay.

285
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:46,130
So this is the simplest way to add a spinning effect.

286
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:51,950
And also, if there is no image, we want to have some alternative text.

287
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:55,100
We just want to say the image.

288
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,060
Is not.

289
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,660
Sorry image.

290
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,980
Not find or is not available.

291
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:18,360
The other things I want to do is when you refresh the page, we see that the size of the image would

292
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:23,340
change first and then we see the real image.

293
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,030
So.

294
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,230
Let's see.

295
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,380
And the Internet is off now.

296
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,810
Let's refresh the page again.

297
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,240
I just want to show you the image.

298
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,760
Size sometimes gets smaller.

299
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:47,010
So in order to keep the style and the width of the height of the image, we need to add a style here.

300
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:52,220
So we just write down style here.

301
00:23:53,360 --> 00:24:01,820
And this is going to be we need to add another curly braces here because this inside the react when

302
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:06,380
you want to add this style, you need to have two curly braces.

303
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:10,970
And we're going to just set the.

304
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,750
Max width.

305
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,740
To be 100%.

306
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,140
And we set the height.

307
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,190
To be or to.

308
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:35,790
So in this way, the height is always going to be the same rate, even when we see the loading effect.

309
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,000
We should see the same height.

310
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,100
So let's refresh this.

311
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:54,350
Okay.

312
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:03,650
So now let's go to.

313
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,780
Other part of the card.

314
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,340
I want to have this.

315
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:16,520
Description, the overview, the title and the other parts.

316
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:21,910
So all the other parts is going to be inside it.

317
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:22,440
If.

318
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,050
Which is going to have a padding of two.

319
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,910
And here.

320
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,140
We're going to have.

321
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,490
A paragraph.

322
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:40,360
Scared the.

323
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:47,420
Result dot over view.

324
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:54,470
So we see the overview now.

325
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,580
Let's start this first and then I'm going to.

326
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,280
So let's go find the.

327
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:06,360
As I mentioned, I want to limit this, Tex.

328
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,900
To be only in two lines.

329
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:15,990
There is a way inside the 12 and six called TRUNCATE.

330
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:21,880
TRUNCATE is going to limit this text to one line.

331
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:28,570
But in order to have a tool, two lines, there is another official plugging for Taylor CSS.

332
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,760
Which is called the line clamp.

333
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:35,110
So I'm going to search here on Google.

334
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:38,830
Line clamp.

335
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:44,030
12 and cease.

336
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:53,730
And here you see a GitHub repository saying 12 and 12 and six line clamp.

337
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:57,500
And this is the official explanation of this plugin.

338
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,830
You can check this out.

339
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:03,300
So you can go to the GitHub page.

340
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,740
We can just copy this.

341
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,860
Line of code to install it.

342
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:17,940
So I'm going to copy this, come back to Visual Studio Code and I'm going to paste it inside a terminal.

343
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:28,980
The next thing we need to do is to go to Taylor Configs and we need to add this plugin inside the plugin

344
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,020
section so we're going to copy this.

345
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,390
Require logging.

346
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:43,160
We go back to Visual Studio Code, I'm going to open the Explorer section using Contour Shift E!

347
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:51,680
So let's go to Telvin, that configures and we added inside this plugin, so I'm going to paste the

348
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,320
require this.

349
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:02,470
So if we now run the server again using NPM run dev.

350
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,340
So let's close this.

351
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:11,790
So.

352
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:14,490
And then we changed this.

353
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:19,220
Instead of truncate, we can say.

354
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:21,260
Line.

355
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:27,020
Clamp.

356
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:31,580
And we just add two at the end.

357
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:35,010
So this too is going to be two line.

358
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:39,960
So if you wait a little bit, we see the results on the right side.

359
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,910
So after the compiling.

360
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,970
Uh, let's refresh the page.

361
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:02,580
Now we can see that we have two lines instead of one line.

362
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:04,200
This is going to help.

363
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:11,020
To just have the same card height for every card.

364
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,600
So and then I want to check.

365
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,340
I think is nice.

366
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:23,800
I want to change the text larger, but I feel we just changed the text to be medium would be.

367
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:25,610
Fine.

368
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:34,540
And after that, after the paragraph, I want to add an H to tag.

369
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,290
Just for the.

370
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:47,240
Re title of the title of the movie, which can be resolved.

371
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,600
That title.

372
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:57,730
And if this one is not available, we want to use title that name.

373
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:10,080
And let's style this until this one shows up inside the page.

374
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,990
So the Ford styling.

375
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,880
Let's try it again.

376
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:27,880
Yeah.

377
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,930
Let's see the error.

378
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,790
The title is not defined.

379
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:31,930
Oh, sorry.

380
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,040
I think.

381
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,980
This is a result of title.

382
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,170
This one is the result.

383
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:37,740
That name.

384
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:40,320
I write down the wrong one.

385
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,820
So this should be work now.

386
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,290
Let's try again.

387
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:56,060
Okay, now we can see the title.

388
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:57,500
Let's style it.

389
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:04,010
I want to just keep this title in one line in case the debt is very long.

390
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:15,230
So I just say to Kate to keep it in one line and then we set the text to be large here and we set the

391
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:18,140
font weight to be bold.

392
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,920
So after the title.

393
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:40,280
We're going to have the release date and the vote count.

394
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:42,600
So I'm going to add another paragraph.

395
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:44,740
Inside a paragraph.

396
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:48,100
We're going to have the result.

397
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,990
That release date.

398
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:07,390
Or if this is not available, we're going to have the result that first a air date.

399
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,320
Like this.

400
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,690
And then.

401
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:23,420
We're going to have an icon like the final version.

402
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:25,740
We're going to have the thumbs up icon.

403
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:35,640
So we go to React icons, website, react the icons inside the GitHub repository.

404
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:41,880
You're going to search for an icon called a thumbs up.

405
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,420
Sums up.

406
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:51,490
The thumb.

407
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,120
Thumbs up.

408
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,640
So I'm going to use this.

409
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:02,270
If I thumbs up this one.

410
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:04,960
I'm going to copy, click and copy it.

411
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:09,010
And I'm going to import it at the top.

412
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:12,340
You just say import.

413
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:15,160
Thumbs up.

414
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:21,310
Which is going to be from react icons forward slash f.

415
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:21,790
I.

416
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,600
So now we can add this icon here.

417
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,530
So let's check what we have here.

418
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:40,930
We are getting an error saying that the date is not defined.

419
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,780
Actually, this one should be released.

420
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:47,110
Underlined dates, not released plus date.

421
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:49,840
We need to fix this one.

422
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:57,230
Sometimes you get a suggestion from a GitHub copilot, but you need to check it.

423
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:01,050
One more time and be sure about that.

424
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:09,210
All right, Now we get the result, the release date here.

425
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:13,670
Uh, after the release date, I want to add the.

426
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,220
Thumbs up button.

427
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:21,870
Comes up icon that we have imported.

428
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:26,780
So I'm going to paste that icon here.

429
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,630
And the.

430
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:36,110
After that, we want to see the result.

431
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:44,370
That vote underlying count, which shows the number of thumbs up or votes for this movie.

432
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:50,790
So now let's save this and check it inside our website.

433
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,030
All right.

434
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:02,030
Now we can see the icon and also the number of vote counts, but there are on the top of each other.

435
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:05,450
Let's change the display to flex.

436
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:16,130
So we changed the display to flex, to bring them next to each other inside this paragraph.

437
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,680
And the.

438
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:27,110
We can bring them exactly on the line.

439
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:31,840
By just changing the items center.

440
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:46,980
They are now on next to each other, but they are just connected.

441
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:51,570
So inside the fit thums up, we can add a class name.

442
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:57,900
And first thing first, I want to change the height of this to be five.

443
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:08,410
And then I want to add some margin in the right of one and margin in the left of three.

444
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:14,650
So we have some space before and after these terms of icon.

445
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:25,650
So now you can see the space between the after and before and after of the thumbs up.

446
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,310
So everything is done.

447
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:38,210
The only things I want to add in this section is to remove this scroll ball here, which is going to

448
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:41,920
make our application more beautiful because.

449
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:46,840
For example, inside the about page.

450
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:50,410
When we are in the about page, we don't have the scroll bar.

451
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:57,550
And then when we go to the trending, we're going to have this global, which is going to a little bit.

452
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:03,900
Makes this one move and it's not comfortable for the users.

453
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:10,440
So in many, many websites like a Twitter, Facebook, they remove the scroll bar.

454
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:12,100
Okay.

455
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,710
Now the easiest ways to do that.

456
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,260
Intelligence.

457
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:18,890
Yes.

458
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:20,720
We need to go to.

459
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:27,680
And let me show you inside the Explorer section, we need to go to global stocks inside the.

460
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:31,060
Let's close everything.

461
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:32,950
We need to go to.

462
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:38,190
To the CRC folder app directory and then we go to global search.

463
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:43,530
Yes, we need to add these HTML codes here.

464
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:50,130
So we need to add the HTML because we want to apply this one to the HTML.

465
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,370
We add.

466
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:53,940
Dash.

467
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:55,570
Web.

468
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:58,950
Kit.

469
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:03,270
Underline scrollbar.

470
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,090
This is going to add.

471
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,940
We're going to remove the.

472
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:19,040
We change the display to non to remove the scroll bar and this sometimes this one works for the Firefox,

473
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,500
sometimes it doesn't work.

474
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:27,290
In order to be sure we need to add it to html only as well.

475
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:33,660
Which is why here we need to add a scroll.

476
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,310
A scrollbar.

477
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:46,480
Dash width to be none.

478
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:53,320
So this too is going to show that in all browser we don't see the scroll bar.

479
00:38:53,320 --> 00:39:00,400
So because I have tested sometimes only use one of them, you get you remove the scrollbar only for

480
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,970
example in Chrome, not in the Firefox or other browsers.

481
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:08,230
So we don't see the scroll bar anymore and.

482
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:10,280
Okay.

483
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:16,210
So that was it for creating the cards of the page.

484
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:20,050
You can see that this is responsive in different sizes.

485
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:24,130
We get different number of columns of.

486
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,990
Cards.

487
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,680
So let's add this one to the GitHub.

488
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:31,570
So I'm going to review what we have done here.

489
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:42,340
So we add everything to GitHub and we just name and create a message for this comment and call it add

490
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:45,790
cart component.

491
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:49,870
And we're going to commit and push it to GitHub.

492
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,140
Let's go to GitHub.

493
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:55,000
Our.

494
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:57,460
Let's close this extra website.

495
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:01,270
I'm going to our GitHub repository.

496
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:07,150
We go back to the comment section, I'm going to refresh the page.

497
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:14,390
And this is going to show the new one, which is add card components.

498
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:24,430
And we can just review what we have done here inside the next conflict that we have added, the new

499
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:27,310
domain that we have used for the images.

500
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,250
That was the error we got.

501
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:37,810
So we have to fix it by using the budgets, adding images domain, and then the domain that we are using.

502
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:42,660
Inside the package that JSON became.

503
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:50,010
We can see that we have installed a plugin called Line Clap for tailwind CSS.

504
00:40:50,860 --> 00:41:01,990
Is inside a global that says we have added to command for CSIS to be sure that we remove the scrollbar

505
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:08,590
of the browser by just changing the display to none or a scrollable width to none.

506
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:19,950
We have created a component called Card, which is going to import the image tag from next year's the

507
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:25,380
link tag, and also the icon from React to React icons.

508
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:34,890
This is going to get the result from as a as a prop here and we're going to create a link here.

509
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:41,200
Which is going to redirect the person to this URL.

510
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:43,150
I haven't tested actually.

511
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:48,070
So if you click on this, this is going to redirect us to this URL.

512
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:51,610
Movie four slash the ID of the page.

513
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,170
We haven't created this page.

514
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:55,840
In the next section we're going to create it.

515
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,330
But for now we just redirected the person.

516
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:01,480
If they they they click on the.

517
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,260
A cart.

518
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:12,020
Then we have added the image tag with the source, which can be a back drop path or the poster underlined

519
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:12,770
path.

520
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,950
If this one is available, we use this one.

521
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,930
Otherwise we use the other one.

522
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,840
We set the width and height of the image.

523
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,330
This is mandatory for next year's.

524
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:30,260
If you don't just sit there, wait and hide, you get an error.

525
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:36,980
And also, we have added an extra style for the setting up the max width and the height.

526
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:44,030
We have added a place older, which is going to blow over with this.

527
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:46,060
A spinner.

528
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:54,250
So if we don't see the if the if the image is loading, instead of just seeing the half an image or

529
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:56,380
something, we see a spinner.

530
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:59,650
And also we have added the alternative text.

531
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:05,250
After that, we have added the overview we have.

532
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:12,150
Limit that 1 to 2 lines using this line clamp two which we have installed as a plugin.

533
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:23,170
Then we have added the title and finally the release date, a thumbs up icon and also the vote count.

534
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:25,890
Inside the result of JSX.

535
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:28,560
We have added this card component.

536
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:38,370
We have passed the data here, the results, and also we have made this course to be in the grade system.

537
00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:45,970
So we have we have changed the display to grid and in different sizes like tablet, larger screen,

538
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:47,760
the extra large to excel.

539
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:51,630
We have different number of columns here.

540
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:59,710
Inside the Taleban that conflict that is, we have added this plugin that we have installed like clamp

541
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:02,710
in order to be able to use it.

542
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:04,710
All right.

543
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:07,740
That was it for the creating the cart components.

544
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:16,260
In the next section, we're going to work on the page, the movie page that we get now.

545
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:21,250
An error saying this page could not be fired.

546
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:27,760
We're going to create this page, and this page is going to be dynamic and each time we can.

547
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:34,950
Just get a different information based on the ID that we get from the URL.

548
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,420
So see in the next section for creating the movie page.
