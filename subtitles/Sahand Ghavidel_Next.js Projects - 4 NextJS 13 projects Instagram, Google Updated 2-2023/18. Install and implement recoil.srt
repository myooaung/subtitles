1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:07,760
All right.

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:13,920
In the last section, we have completed the transition effects, the feeding effect to our website.

3
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:20,250
In this section, we're going to add a model pop up.

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:31,610
If we open the if you click on the comment section, we want to open a window at a top that let the

5
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:39,110
users to add a comment to our website or to this post particularly.

6
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:47,150
Uh, in order to do that, we need to add a state, but we cannot add a component level of state.

7
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:53,780
We want to add the global states because we want to add it on top of everything.

8
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,700
Not only this component.

9
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:06,580
In order to do that, we need to use we want to use a package called Recoil.

10
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,910
Recoil is estate management library.

11
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,840
And it's just created for React.

12
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:23,170
And it's let us to easily add global states to our websites.

13
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,840
So let's search for recoil.

14
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:39,840
And the website is Recoil Jazz Dot G, which is a state management library for React.

15
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:41,880
We click on this one.

16
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,930
And in order to start, we can just go to a get started.

17
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:53,250
And we already installed our application.

18
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,430
We need to install recoil first.

19
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,870
And then we need to add it to the route there after two years.

20
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:05,440
We cover our apertures with the recoil root.

21
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:09,990
And finally we need to add atom atom as a piece of state.

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,600
For example, here, as a example, they have a Texas state.

23
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:15,910
They made an atom for it.

24
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,670
Each atom has a key and also the default value.

25
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,260
In our case, we want to have a state that is open.

26
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,370
And we want it to be false by default.

27
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,240
And the name would be open to states or something like that.

28
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:37,960
Okay.

29
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:47,500
And finally, we can get we can get that to state in any component using used recoilless state.

30
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:55,230
And we can change the state using CET that the name of the state that we have created.

31
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,940
Okay, so let's start installing first.

32
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:02,610
We just copy this MP and install recoil.

33
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:08,550
We go back to Visual Studio code, we stop this server and we paste it here.

34
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:21,830
And before going to the next step, let's add the component model component and add it to the index

35
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:22,160
that.

36
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,010
Uh, J.S., let's close these things.

37
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,460
Inside index.

38
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:31,940
The Jazz.

39
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,150
Which is the homepage.

40
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,880
Inside the pages.

41
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,410
We added a section before for model.

42
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:44,670
So we create a component and add the components here.

43
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:51,630
So here, inside the component, we create a component called.

44
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:52,770
We just call it.

45
00:03:53,990 --> 00:04:02,000
Comment model j yes, we use rf c.

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,070
To create a reactive functional component, we can delete this import.

47
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:17,340
Then let's import this and bring it inside the index that just so just here we just say comment model.

48
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:22,920
And we need to import it as well.

49
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:24,500
Okay.

50
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:28,580
Let's just start the server and check it on browser.

51
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:36,190
So let's go back to our website and we refresh the page.

52
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:43,440
Now we should see that probably comes around here because it's after that.

53
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,760
So now we can see the comment model here.

54
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:51,220
This is not going to be here because we want to create a window later.

55
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:58,570
We're going to install a package called React model and replace this one with that components.

56
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,260
But for now, we can see it here.

57
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,400
So we have installed the recoil.

58
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,230
Now.

59
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:14,400
The next step for the recoil is just at the recoil route.

60
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,670
Our wrap our application with recoil route.

61
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:24,150
So we will need to go to after J.S..

62
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,630
Underline underscore after test and recover.

63
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,520
First we import.

64
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,000
Uh, recoil.

65
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,480
Recoiled, Ruth.

66
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,970
From Recoil.

67
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,970
Then we we need to wrap our application.

68
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,690
Just here.

69
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,420
It's fine.

70
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,100
Yeah.

71
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:06,910
So now we can use in every component.

72
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,910
This is all the components in our website.

73
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:15,190
We can use the whatever we define inside the recoil.

74
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,590
Now we need to create the atom.

75
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,870
If we look at the documentation, the next step is create an atom.

76
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,570
An atom represents a piece of state.

77
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,410
So adults can be read from.

78
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,030
And return to from any component.

79
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,730
So we create the atom, but we can use it in all the components.

80
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,990
So we just copy this line of code.

81
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:52,040
Uh, just, uh, example one and we go back to our, uh, application.

82
00:06:52,040 --> 00:07:00,020
We close all the folders and we created outside here in this level, for example, we just create a

83
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,490
new folder.

84
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,050
They call it Aton.

85
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,600
And inside the atom, we create our model atom.

86
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:15,270
So we're just a model atom.

87
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,060
Dot js and we paste a link.

88
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:24,020
Okay.

89
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:28,140
And the state we want to add is model.

90
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,700
So we just changed the text.

91
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,620
Tomorrow.

92
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:41,630
And the initial value, the default value would be false because we want the model to be close.

93
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:48,830
When we are, we just come to our website and then when we want to open it, we press on that like a

94
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,860
comment chat icon and open it.

95
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:58,640
Okay, now we can access to this anywhere in our application, in any component.

96
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:03,440
So for example, comments model, we can have access to it.

97
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:10,430
So if we go to comment model and here we import, you need to import two things.

98
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:19,240
First thing is to use a recoil.

99
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:21,140
A state.

100
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:25,300
So instead of use a state, we used to use recoil of states.

101
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,090
And this is coming from recoil.

102
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:35,730
And because we want to use the model estate that we have created inside the atom folder.

103
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:45,880
So we just get the model estate from where we created and outside this folder.

104
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:53,820
So we come back one folder, we go to it inside the atom folder and we choose model atom.

105
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,930
And here at a top inside our component.

106
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,300
First we create a state.

107
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,020
The name of this state is open.

108
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,240
And set off an.

109
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,870
And with you, we just use.

110
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,100
You use.

111
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,710
This is going to be equal to use recoilless state and the.

112
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:31,670
Even the initial value is coming from the this more at home too.

113
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:35,590
We define it faster, but we don't need to say false here.

114
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,260
We just say model estate.

115
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,870
Okay, so we use this model state.

116
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:51,250
Now we can just show it here, for example.

117
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,100
Uh.

118
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,430
And scientists there.

119
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,210
We added each one.

120
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:05,390
We just first we just set up the comment model.

121
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,410
And under this, we just say if this is open.

122
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,060
Dan?

123
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,890
Just add one.

124
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,450
And we just say.

125
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,770
The model.

126
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,000
Is open.

127
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:31,830
Okay.

128
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,450
Let's check.

129
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:37,370
It should be closed now as a default.

130
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,560
They say item is not defined.

131
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,360
Let's check.

132
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,960
So which file was it?

133
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:57,380
Sorry.

134
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,140
Uh, in moral atom.

135
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:00,390
That.

136
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:00,950
Yes.

137
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:09,220
Uh.

138
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,860
We didn't import ATM, actually.

139
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,550
We just copied this one.

140
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,780
So we need to import.

141
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,520
At home.

142
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,260
From.

143
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,120
Recoil.

144
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,990
This is just a built building function from recoil.

145
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,360
That should work now.

146
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,700
So this refreshed.

147
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:41,890
Uh.

148
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,020
In another era.

149
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:56,020
Invalid argument atom or centre but got undefined.

150
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:57,580
So.

151
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,490
Model stage one of the stage.

152
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,620
Let's shake it again.

153
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:08,800
Yeah.

154
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,190
We didn't export this.

155
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,870
We need to export it.

156
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,630
Yeah, that's a problem.

157
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:18,020
When you copy paste from a website, you don't check.

158
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,590
Okay, so don't copy paste.

159
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,840
Uh, here.

160
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,020
Let's check again.

161
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:29,550
Okay.

162
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,470
That's okay.

163
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,160
It's not showing.

164
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:39,030
This model is open because the default is false if you change the default to true.

165
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,190
We should see it.

166
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,970
The model is often okay.

167
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,260
And but we don't want to do it like this.

168
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:54,560
We want to when we click on this comment, we want to comment icon.

169
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,400
We want to open it.

170
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:57,890
Let me add another.

171
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,930
Small ones, so we can easily click here and open this.

172
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,430
So we want to add on click on this chat icon.

173
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,690
And each time we click on this one, we want to change the.

174
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:17,140
Uh, the open.

175
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:24,350
S estate to true or false depends on the previous estate.

176
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:28,330
So we go back to our post.

177
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:29,420
Yes.

178
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,970
And we just search for chart icon.

179
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,090
Here.

180
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,760
First we add on click here.

181
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:45,360
And this is going to have a function that is going to set.

182
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:52,550
They're open, but we need to create the set open first at a time.

183
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,550
Just leave it like this and be created out of top.

184
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,600
We just a concerts.

185
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,840
Often.

186
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:16,300
Set up an and this is going to be equal to not use a state.

187
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,580
Use recoilless state.

188
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:24,100
Now we need to import recoil a statement from recoil here.

189
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,730
And this is going to take that model.

190
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:32,410
State's death is coming from at home.

191
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:37,680
So we need to import model state from atom to now.

192
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:42,670
Uh, in the chat icon.

193
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:46,270
When we click on the chat, we should open it.

194
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,390
So now we click here.

195
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:49,720
We open the.

196
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:51,740
The model is open.

197
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,550
Okay, but when you click it again, nothing happens.

198
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:57,230
But I want to just say.

199
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:04,370
If the of whatever is open is just do the opposite like this.

200
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:10,250
If the open is to make it false and if it's false, make it true.

201
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:15,890
So now we just can, uh, reverse it.

202
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:19,320
Each time when we click opens, click on.

203
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,130
Okay.

204
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,100
So that was it for the recoil part.

205
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:31,780
In the next section, we're going to install the package called React model and we're going to have

206
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:40,180
a real model with the information of this post and the person can reply, okay, so we just add whatever

207
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:48,160
we did in this repository, in this command to the our repository.

208
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,870
And we just create a message.

209
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,960
We just say install.

210
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,480
Recoil.

211
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,700
Install.

212
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,390
I just say install.

213
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:13,390
And in Parliament require it, push it to get half.

214
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,020
Let's check.

215
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,470
We refresh the page.

216
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:21,920
You go inside the Twitter.

217
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:24,320
Now we have 19 commits.

218
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,440
We have created 19 videos so far.

219
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,100
And the last one is install and implement recoil.

220
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:41,870
So we we created a aton, which is this piece of state inside a folder called Atom.

221
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:47,150
We imported Atom from Recoil and we export mortal state.

222
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,490
The initial value is false.

223
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,520
And the key for it is model states.

224
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,210
Okay.

225
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,180
It should be a unique I.D..

226
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:56,870
Then.

227
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:05,820
We create a component called Common Model that yes, we have imported or used.

228
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:09,990
We call a state to create a piece of the state.

229
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:18,330
And we got the initial value from the atom, which is the model state that we have created inside atom.

230
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:24,240
And we just say if the state is true, sure.

231
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,950
The model is up.

232
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:27,560
Okay.

233
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,490
And so posted GSV added an on click.

234
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:39,880
Two set to open in the opposite estate opposite of its previous estate.

235
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:44,050
So we created the estate using used record estate here.

236
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:50,320
And also we have imported use record estate and model estate here as well.

237
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,510
We have installed.

238
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:54,790
Recoil.

239
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,370
Okay.

240
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:07,400
And then inside, after two years, we wrapped our application with the recall routes because we want

241
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:17,480
to have everything inside the recall in every components and inside index that yes, we just added the

242
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:22,160
component that we have created which is common to model.

243
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:23,000
Okay.

244
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,010
So that was it for this section.

245
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:31,190
In the next section, we are going to create the, uh, model we have.

246
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,000
We are going to install a package called React model.

247
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,050
Okay.

248
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,340
So in the next section.
