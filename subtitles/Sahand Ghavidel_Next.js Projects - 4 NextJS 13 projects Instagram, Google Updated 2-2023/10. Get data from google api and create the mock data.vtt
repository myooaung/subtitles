WEBVTT
1
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:07.780
All right.

2
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.800
In the last section we have completed with the.

3
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.100
Header options in a way that when we click on each.

4
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.410
The taps will go to the relatives and you are out now, we are in the image.

5
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:31.610
Images tab and the search service image, and when they click on all this search tab is empty.

6
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.720
Based on this information into your URL, we're going to fetch data from the Google API.

7
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.630
So we're going to use a server side rendering to achieve that.

8
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:52.560
So it's going to be very fast and it's going to render inside the server that you're going to use Verso

9
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.650
later as a server.

10
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.480
We use this function inside the search to Trace, which is this page.

11
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:14.650
Just at the bottom of the fish, such as we create the server side function, we just need to write

12
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:15.610
export.

13
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:25.560
I think because asynchronous function, if you just sit and sync function and function, which is a

14
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.130
building function for next year, is called server side props.

15
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:42.200
And this is going to gives us context, which if we can get some information like we can get the information

16
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.760
from the URL using this context.

17
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:52.040
This is similar to the router we use for getting the information, but for the server side, the use

18
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.670
context.

19
00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:05.080
And inside the server, we're going to create a constant call data and the data is coming from that

20
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.640
API we're going to fetch.

21
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:15.690
We used to fetch method, but we want it instead of just directly fishing.

22
00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:26.650
We want to wait and wait until we get the results from this API and then we want to send it to the client

23
00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:27.010
side.

24
00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.590
So we're going to fetch the API.

25
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.910
So how we get the API endpoint or the API, you are out.

26
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.910
So we are going to use the Google API.

27
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.730
So let me search for.

28
00:02:48.850 --> 00:03:01.240
Developers, Cooper, so if you search developers Google Earth in the search results, you get a website

29
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.370
with the URL developers dot Google dot com.

30
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.110
If you click on this website.

31
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:24.530
And if you sign in with your Gmail, actually my accounts are in this Gmail, so I clicked on this one.

32
00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.770
So make sure to sign in with your proper tumor account.

33
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:39.520
And then if you scroll down a little bit and you see that all these apps we can use, all these technologies

34
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:46.940
that Google provides, we can check all of them by clicking on view all developer products.

35
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:59.640
And if you scroll down here, you can search for the API or the products, the things we want is the

36
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.480
search.

37
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.040
We just say search.

38
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.800
And we need to find something called programmer, programmer search, programmable search.

39
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:09.120
Yeah.

40
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.520
So in the programmable search engine, we want to create a search engine.

41
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.410
So we use this one.

42
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.930
So we click here on the Explore.

43
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.080
And if you scroll down.

44
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.240
Uh, no, you just click here and the create a search engine.

45
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:32.050
All right.

46
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.870
And here in the left, we have a menu.

47
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:45.330
If this scroll down in the menu, in the Jason API section, we just need to click on using wrist.

48
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.980
No, this is the Jason API, you are out.

49
00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:00.710
And even you have an example here, for example, you get requests.

50
00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.760
And this is the, uh, the URL of the example.

51
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.330
So if you pay attention, we have a query here.

52
00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.030
For example, here we're searching for lectures.

53
00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.920
Then we have something called see that we need to get.

54
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.900
It's a key for CSX.

55
00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.390
This is going to define what types of search we want to do.

56
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:35.400
For example, if you want to do all the websites or you want to just specifically search for a website.

57
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.640
Uh, and then we also need an API key here.

58
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.660
We can get the API key here by clicking on this first.

59
00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.420
We copy this code.

60
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.320
Completely.

61
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:59.790
And we go to visual studio code and inside a Bektic because we need to add a variable later.

62
00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.400
We paste to lick.

63
00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:05.160
All right.

64
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:14.970
And let's we get this API key as well, but we don't want to put our API key inside this search that,

65
00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:20.690
yes, we want to hide it through an environmental variable.

66
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:28.110
So instead of this, we just write we create a variable using.

67
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.150
Dollar sign, Curly Press is.

68
00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:39.580
And then we just a process that MP.

69
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:45.870
And we just say.

70
00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.630
API key, so just say API.

71
00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:07.240
It should be an upper case, and then in our environmental variable, here we add something and that

72
00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.140
API key.

73
00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:13.860
And we're going to get it here.

74
00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:17.160
So here you see the API key.

75
00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.600
Just about the link, just click on this.

76
00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.080
And here you click on Get the Key.

77
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:34.120
And this is going to pop up and gives you the API to you.

78
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:41.240
In the window that is Papa, we choose the projects you are working on.

79
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:47.750
And this is for me, it's the Google version three or whatever you created before.

80
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:54.050
If you remember we created this project, then we needed to for authentication.

81
00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:54.860
So.

82
00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:01.700
If you didn't create any protest, you can create a new project you.

83
00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:07.290
So you choose a proper air project and you click on next.

84
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:17.150
And if you will, if you wait a little bit, we should see the API key found, we can click here to

85
00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:17.840
copy it.

86
00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:26.570
And be done with this fun and we go back to visual studio code and be pasted in front of the API.

87
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:30.410
All right.

88
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:35.950
So after that, the next thing we need is just this six.

89
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:37.660
Yeah.

90
00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:48.700
So we deleted the example until this query, and we create a variable using dollar, so.

91
00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.060
And clearly process and recall this one process.

92
00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.190
That EMV.

93
00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:59.170
That context key or.

94
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:01.680
Six.

95
00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.020
So just take context.

96
00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.870
Key and inside the environmental variable, we're going to.

97
00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:21.730
Paste this on context, key is equal, and let's get it from here.

98
00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:22.990
So.

99
00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:27.520
We go back one more time, one more.

100
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:33.600
Just one time and then we got the API key here.

101
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:37.770
But for getting this, we need to click on this control panel.

102
00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:46.350
All right, we click on the control panel and here we're going to create a new search engine.

103
00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:49.890
I already created two, so I created a new one.

104
00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:02.980
Yeah, it is it is asking you which websites you want to search.

105
00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:07.140
This is actually not important later, we want to tell you.

106
00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:10.690
I just want to search everything.

107
00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:13.600
But just for now, you're at something.

108
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:17.950
For example, call W W W dot Google dot com.

109
00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:19.560
This is not important.

110
00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:22.120
Actually, later we're going to change it, but this is mandatory.

111
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:23.470
You have to write it down.

112
00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:31.060
The language is English and the name of the search engine and just, we call it cool version.

113
00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.810
Three and.

114
00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:37.950
We just click on Create.

115
00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:42.000
After creating, we need to update it.

116
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:50.650
If we can get the quote here, but let's modify the search engine first here.

117
00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:55.030
And this one we click on control panel,

118
00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:01.810
if you scroll down a little bit here, we need to check something.

119
00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:10.300
Some taps for this image search because we want to create the image tap as well, so we click here too.

120
00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.320
So we're going to get the images as well.

121
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:25.320
You can change the region, but just for this example, we we check all the regions.

122
00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.640
Then we have to search the entire web.

123
00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:32.340
This fund, we need to check as far.

124
00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:34.580
All right.

125
00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:35.360
No.

126
00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:41.600
We come back and we get the coat.

127
00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:41.900
Yeah.

128
00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:51.460
As you can see, it's a JavaScript code, but we don't need we don't need all of them, we just need

129
00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:54.130
this six code, so we just copy this.

130
00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.620
You cannot copy just that one.

131
00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:07.130
Just let me copy all of them, and then inside here, I'm going to delete the rest.

132
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:12.040
So delete everything except that quote.

133
00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:14.960
All right.

134
00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:17.220
So everything is fine now.

135
00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:21.740
And for the query.

136
00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:27.830
So we've got the API key, we got the process, we got the context key.

137
00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:37.070
And this is the query is like this is hard coded, but we want this to be the same as the URL term.

138
00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.930
So how we get there, that.

139
00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.110
Then how we get this far.

140
00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:45.640
For example, this hello.

141
00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:52.510
So before we were getting actually, we are getting an error get service side.

142
00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.240
We need to pretend that is not important, we are going to do it.

143
00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:00.550
So we we're getting this, we can get this.

144
00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:01.110
Hello.

145
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:10.240
Before we were using router, for example, we were saying a router that quarry that term that was equal

146
00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:14.140
to hello, but now we are in the service side.

147
00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:20.560
We are not in the client side, so we cannot use the router, but we can use this context here.

148
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:24.610
This contact is giving us a lot of information.

149
00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.040
One of them is this queries.

150
00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:29.620
So let's create a variable.

151
00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:41.880
And the variable is going to be we just use the context and the context is going to gives us the query

152
00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.930
as well, and a query name is tap.

153
00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:46.810
All right.

154
00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:57.180
And then the next thing is, we want to give is just this search type.

155
00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:00.030
And.

156
00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.010
If we look at the.

157
00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:11.510
If you look at the documentation in the Google API, is telling us if you have an image here.

158
00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:19.760
The Google is going to search the images only, so we need to get the information in this search type.

159
00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:25.090
So we can say here we create a valuable first.

160
00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:29.590
We just say if the context.

161
00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:33.380
Query.

162
00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.790
Dot search time.

163
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.870
If this one is exist, it.

164
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:46.530
Then.

165
00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:57.850
I mean, if this one is not empty, you mean, and if this one is not empty, we it means that this

166
00:14:57.850 --> 00:14:58.460
is MH.

167
00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:02.530
You know, that's as simple as that.

168
00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:08.810
So we just say, if this one is empty, you just aren't here, impasse.

169
00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:12.470
Search.

170
00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:14.600
Time.

171
00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:25.490
Equal image otherwise just doesn't put anything in the search.

172
00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:34.930
So now we've got the API endpoint, but now we want to get this on as a Jason fire.

173
00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:39.420
So we just need to after this.

174
00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:47.470
We closed this fund with just say, when the fishing is finished, then.

175
00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:59.550
We get the risk response, and this response is changed, this response as adjacent fast, just the

176
00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:03.530
response is equal to the response that Jason.

177
00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:09.350
OK.

178
00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:18.530
No, we've got the information and data, and we need to know we've got it inside the data, but we

179
00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:21.320
want to pass this on to the client side.

180
00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:27.020
We can easily do that by returning a prop, so we just see a return.

181
00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:31.560
Props.

182
00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.210
And we just call this one result.

183
00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:40.590
Our results.

184
00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:47.050
Equal data, so whatever data you consider is lost.

185
00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:50.640
Now we can get this results in inside this.

186
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:56.550
As a prop, so it is structured and we call it resource.

187
00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:58.250
And now we can console.log.

188
00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:01.670
So we just control our response.

189
00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:05.950
So let's check our consul.

190
00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:11.630
Yes, you can see we have an object.

191
00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:21.050
We are good in an era of saying API, Keith, not valid.

192
00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:28.770
Let me check this, actually, we forgot to restart the server because we changed the environmental

193
00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:29.460
variable.

194
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:31.740
We need to restart the server.

195
00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:33.570
Maybe this is the problem.

196
00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:42.000
So I stopped the server using contrasty and use hand pin Rhonda to start the server again.

197
00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.930
So now we refresh the page.

198
00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:52.420
So.

199
00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:55.900
Now we are getting the results.

200
00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:04.320
And as you can see, this is the result for the hello and we are getting 10 items.

201
00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:13.800
All you see that you getting the title, for example, the song from Adele, which is called Hello from

202
00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.050
YouTube and.

203
00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:24.530
If you open this, the display links you to the format that you are, is this?

204
00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:27.640
And a lot of information we're getting.

205
00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:30.860
And.

206
00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:40.790
If you go to image, we should get a different types of information in image instead of getting.

207
00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:49.220
You can see instead of getting the YouTube, we got the hello from Wikipedia the first one and the formats

208
00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:50.690
file format this image.

209
00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.400
And your ill.

210
00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:56.110
It's here.

211
00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:59.470
So if you copy this font and paste it here.

212
00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:02.230
He should see an image.

213
00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:05.230
Yeah.

214
00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:05.860
Hello.

215
00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:06.910
All right.

216
00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:12.590
So in other things we need to do is to create a mock.

217
00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:14.240
So what Mark is?

218
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:21.620
Because Google for developers, you have only 100 requests a day.

219
00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:28.900
So each time you refresh the page, you're getting a request.

220
00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:33.090
So each time you click on one of them, you get a request.

221
00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:40.540
So because we want to install our website here each time you type something.

222
00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:47.680
In your view, school, for example, I taught this one we could request.

223
00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:57.750
You know, so now we've got an error, but if you type something correctly, for example, if you write

224
00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:58.590
something here.

225
00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:03.840
We are refreshing the page and we're getting the new.

226
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:11.150
Request so we can easily finish the 100 requests a day.

227
00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:13.620
I I believe you can finish it.

228
00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:15.200
Maybe less than an hour.

229
00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:21.620
So instead of doing that, we can create something called mark.

230
00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:24.140
We can copy one of the results.

231
00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:28.100
For example, I search my name here.

232
00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:35.890
So we get a result.

233
00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:36.890
All right.

234
00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:41.090
For my thanks, and I'm going to copy this.

235
00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:43.880
All right, I'm going to copy this.

236
00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:49.340
As an object, you can see you can copy the object.

237
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:55.120
And then we're going to create a file here.

238
00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:57.040
Our site, we call it.

239
00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:02.740
Response to GST.

240
00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:06.780
And.

241
00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:20.290
After the export default, we can paste the object here, as you can see now, we got the response for

242
00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:23.290
the term for handing over to.

243
00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:32.500
And so and then inside the search that, yes, here we create a.

244
00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:37.580
Constantly same mock data.

245
00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:44.520
And we we just said it to be.

246
00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:46.620
True.

247
00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:49.300
And then.

248
00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:53.020
Here we say if the.

249
00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:58.830
Mark, data is true then.

250
00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.170
Get the data from the response.

251
00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:05.750
So we just see a response.

252
00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:09.710
We need to import.

253
00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:16.950
We need to use of control space to import the response.

254
00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:22.840
And otherwise, it was just the Fitch, did it.

255
00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:24.350
No.

256
00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:31.270
Let's go to our website, what happened?

257
00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:34.000
Yeah.

258
00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:39.390
No, we see that we got the result for the first time, yeah, we do.

259
00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:43.940
But if if we search, for example, hello again.

260
00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:51.990
We should get the same result as for the sound day, so you're not requesting any more.

261
00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:53.870
Each time.

262
00:22:54.970 --> 00:23:04.550
So this is going to help us to first be like a style, our website based on this sound gave you the

263
00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:05.200
results.

264
00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:14.360
And then when we finish our styling, we can set this one to false.

265
00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.170
And then we just the.

266
00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:25.880
We get the proper results, for example, now let's refresh the page.

267
00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:30.870
And we open to council.

268
00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:34.290
Now we should get the result for the hello.

269
00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:44.370
So I keep this search, this one true until we finish installing our search results and later when we

270
00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:46.050
want to do the pagination.

271
00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:51.590
We again, make that one false and we get the real data.

272
00:23:52.340 --> 00:24:03.470
So this is my suggestion because I I believe that if you use that real data when you're styling, you're

273
00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:15.800
going to finish your hundred requests in less than an hour and you need to pay for the extra request

274
00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:20.750
we put in your credit card data, et cetera.

275
00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:32.270
So in order to avoid this, always to try to have a mock data and finish everything related to styling

276
00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:38.930
and then change the data to the real data when you're deploying your website.

277
00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:48.630
All right, that was it for the getting the data, let's add this one to our guitar.

278
00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:56.430
So we stopped the server we use kit at to get to add everything to get.

279
00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:03.420
And we used to get comments to add a message and the message would be.

280
00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:11.960
Get data from.

281
00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:19.540
Google API and create.

282
00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:27.000
I create the mock data.

283
00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:32.560
So let's push this on to get help.

284
00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:38.320
And let's review our work.

285
00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:48.850
We go to the GitHub Google version three and we go to the last comment, which is 13, which is created

286
00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:50.380
13 seconds ago.

287
00:25:53.040 --> 00:26:03.420
We just created a response that, yes, we paced the data that is not important, but inside the search

288
00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:04.170
such as.

289
00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:07.540
We created.

290
00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:19.200
And server side function, which is a building function from next year, it's called get server side

291
00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:19.770
props.

292
00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:29.040
We got the information from the URL using contacts and we created it costs and we say if the mark is

293
00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:31.770
true, use them data from response.

294
00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:37.080
But if it falls, fetch the data from the Google API.

295
00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:45.780
With this, you are out and we got the Google API key and also the context key.

296
00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:54.840
And we got the information of the term using context that coded that term, and we say if the search

297
00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:56.550
type is not empty.

298
00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:06.840
Just at the search type, a search type image at the end, then they change the response to JSON file

299
00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:10.290
and we pass it through a prop.

300
00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:16.080
To the client side here and the console.log that.

301
00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:23.200
All right, that was it for the getting the information from the API in the next section, we are going

302
00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:27.850
to create this part about section, which is saying.

303
00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:29.740
At the.

304
00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:39.180
The number of results and also how many a how much time takes to get the results from the approval.

305
00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:40.720
So you see, it's different.

306
00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:51.220
It's not just a nice we should get a different time and different number of results.

307
00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:54.700
So see in the next section for the about section.
