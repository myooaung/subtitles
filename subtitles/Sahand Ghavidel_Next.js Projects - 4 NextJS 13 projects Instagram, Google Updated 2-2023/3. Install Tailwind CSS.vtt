1
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:08.220
All right.

2
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.360
Welcome back.

3
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:15.210
In the last section we have installed next year and we got our first template.

4
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:24.480
In this section, we're going to install Tailwind CSS and add its dependencies to work with the next

5
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.670
year's website.

6
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:37.050
The first thing we need to do is to go to the 12 CSS website so we can go to Google and we search for

7
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.760
12 and CSS.

8
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.300
In the search result, we go to the website with the URL 12 and see dot com.

9
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.880
And here.

10
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.460
You can see the table and see this website.

11
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.350
It's documentation.

12
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.670
And how to get started.

13
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.700
So we just click on the get started.

14
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.040
And install it here.

15
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.750
Inside the installation tab, we go to the framework guide.

16
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:24.070
So the framework guide is when you want to just install the services on frameworks like.

17
00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.160
React or next years and etc..

18
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:33.070
So we click on Framework Guide, and here we click on next.

19
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.850
Yes.

20
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.770
Next.

21
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.390
JJ's the.

22
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.700
So we see it has.

23
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.890
Few steps for installation of Taleban CSIS, which next year.

24
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.680
First, we need to create our projects.

25
00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:00.170
This step is already done with us because we have already installed next year.

26
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.260
The second step is to install Taleban CSIS.

27
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.370
So there are two commands we need to run inside the terminal.

28
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.320
The first one is going to install Taleban.

29
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.480
CSIS.

30
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.080
Host Cease and order prefecture.

31
00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.610
So we need to copy this.

32
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.860
I copy it and come back to the Visual Studio code.

33
00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.400
I'm going to paste it inside the Visual Studio code.

34
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.040
And I press enter.

35
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.050
So this is going to install these three packages.

36
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.690
And the installation process is very fast because when says.

37
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.280
Is a very small package, actually, so.

38
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.180
So let's this one finish.

39
00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:00.270
Until this one finish, we come back and copy the next line, which is going to initialize the tail

40
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:08.640
and CSS and it's going to add a file called tailwind config, which we need in the next step.

41
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.700
To compete complete.

42
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.850
So we go back to Visual City Code.

43
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.250
The installation process is almost done.

44
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.540
So.

45
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.430
Let's decrease the size of the screen so you can see everything in better form.

46
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.640
So the installation process is completed.

47
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.200
Let's paste the.

48
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:44.130
The next code, which is for the next initialization of the tail and CSS.

49
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.200
So I'm going to press enter.

50
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:53.070
This is going to initialize tail and CSS and this is going to add some files here.

51
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.460
So now we have two extra files.

52
00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.380
One is post assistant conflict dodgers and one is Telvin.

53
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.210
That conflict JS.

54
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:12.540
So in the third step of the Tailwind CSS installation, we need to configure our template path.

55
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:20.050
So as we are using CRC folder, we need to scan this folder.

56
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:27.840
With all the files with the extension, JZ, ts, JZ, X, and BTS x.

57
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.780
So this, this is going to do that.

58
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:41.100
So we're going to copy all these things and we come back to Visual Studio Code and we go to Taylor Configs.

59
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.150
Okay.

60
00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.840
So I'm going to delete all of them.

61
00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.110
I'm going to paste this new code.

62
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:58.610
And actually, we don't need these three of them because we are using CSC directory.

63
00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:05.090
We can just delete these three and everything goes inside the CRC folder for us.

64
00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.500
So let's see the next step.

65
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:15.850
The next step is to add the Tailwind directives to our CSS.

66
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:23.270
And if you remember from the last section, we have deleted everything inside the globals CSS.

67
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.210
Now we need to fill this file with these three lines of code.

68
00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.980
So we copy these three lines of code.

69
00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:39.680
We come back to Visual Studio code, we go to Globals that CSS file here on the left inside the app

70
00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.760
directory.

71
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.100
And we're going to paste it here.

72
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:50.130
And this is going to create the base codes, the components and utilities.

73
00:05:53.140 --> 00:06:01.990
And the last step is to just run our website so that this is completed for us.

74
00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:08.800
So let's start the our application using NPN run diff.

75
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:24.790
So this is going to start our server inside the local host 3000 again.

76
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:31.250
And now this is actually created our post files.

77
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:36.720
As well so when we created and initialized and CSS.

78
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:47.450
Now as you can see, the server is started at this URL and the warning is we have enabled experimental

79
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:50.510
features for the app directory.

80
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:57.140
So as this is a better so they're warning us this, maybe there will be some changes.

81
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:02.630
So and also ask us to give us some feedback.

82
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.900
I already gave him some feedback because there are some mistakes in.

83
00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:08.500
This version.

84
00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:15.670
So if you see something and you just give them some feedback, you can go to this URL and give them

85
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:16.630
some feedback.

86
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:23.800
So they're going to use it to release the final version of next GS 30.

87
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.290
So now we go to the browser.

88
00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:33.930
We don't need the 12 and CSS anymore so we can close this tab.

89
00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.120
And this is our website.

90
00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:46.470
You can see the styles is just normal now, but if you refresh the page, we should see the 12 and CSS

91
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:52.080
styling in our website instead of just the normal CSS.

92
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:53.610
Here.

93
00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:59.470
So now the.

94
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.890
Servers is run.

95
00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:04.410
Now we can see if I zoom here.

96
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:12.580
You can see that the the font is changed and this font is related to Telvin.

97
00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:17.930
So let's let's bring this one to the right side and the website to the left side.

98
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:30.400
So I'm going to show you some CSS, some Tailwind CSS basics so you can apply, for example, in pages

99
00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.180
X.

100
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:32.990
Now we have the whole.

101
00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:39.080
So simply for CSS, we just add a class name here.

102
00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:46.740
For example, if you want to change the color of the text, you just say text.

103
00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:52.150
And add a dash, for example, you just change it to the red color.

104
00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:57.220
And this is going to suggest your different red colors.

105
00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:05.290
So so if you wait a little bit or use contra space, this is going to load some suggestions for you.

106
00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:15.970
For example, you can have a very light red color from 50 to the very dark red color, which is 900.

107
00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.160
For example, I choose the 400.

108
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:27.040
This is going to change our website to our this home from black to red.

109
00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:31.280
So this is going to take a while to be applied.

110
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.060
So.

111
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:35.920
Let's save this one.

112
00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:37.880
And you see the change here.

113
00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.180
If you don't see it, you can refresh the page.

114
00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:47.180
Sometimes the auto save doesn't work, so you need to refresh it some.

115
00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:56.570
So now you can see the text is red and also you can see the the classes is hide is hidden for me because

116
00:09:56.570 --> 00:10:02.270
I'm using an extension which is going to hide the text.

117
00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.130
Inside the tape.

118
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:10.660
Because when you when you use Tillman CSS, you probably add many classes here and this is going to

119
00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:12.550
mess up your code.

120
00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:18.730
So in this case, if I'm not using this class name, this is going to hide all the classes.

121
00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:22.240
So let me show you which extension I used.

122
00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:25.470
So let me stop this server.

123
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:33.810
And let me show you the extension I use for my work.

124
00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:42.890
So you can use them or you can get the idea so you can open the extension section using contour shift

125
00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:43.730
X.

126
00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.780
So this is going to open this extensions.

127
00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:51.290
And the extensions I'm using is this.

128
00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:56.320
So the first extension is code is spell checker.

129
00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:59.310
This is going to check your spelling mistakes.

130
00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:01.080
This.

131
00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:04.470
The second one is the GitHub copilot.

132
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:06.810
This is not a free extension.

133
00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:09.240
You need to pay for the subscription.

134
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.660
It's $10 per month now.

135
00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:20.280
And if you are a student and if you can show them your student card, you can get this extension for

136
00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:20.550
free.

137
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:24.300
This is going to help you to fill up your.

138
00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:33.860
Coding and suggest you some coding based on your previous coding and the coding available online.

139
00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:40.850
So this is an AI tool which is going to help you to program faster.

140
00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:51.970
So now the next extension is auto rename tag, which is going to change the closing tag based on your

141
00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:53.200
opening tag.

142
00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:54.500
Yeah.

143
00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:59.000
This extension is called dark, low contrast teams.

144
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.760
These extensions we use.

145
00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:09.740
We can use it for changing the theme of our VTS code.

146
00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:12.800
And makes it kind of dark.

147
00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.470
And it's good for your eyes.

148
00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:21.710
The next extension is is seven React Redux reacts a snippet.

149
00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:23.750
In React Native snippets.

150
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:29.240
This is going to help us to have some template.

151
00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:37.730
For example, if you want to have a React functional component, you can use ref C to get a React functional

152
00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:38.810
component.

153
00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:45.290
So this is just a very helpful, especially when you are using React or next.

154
00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:53.240
Yes, inline fold is the extension I mentioned earlier that is going to hide.

155
00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:57.760
The classes inside the class name if they are.

156
00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:03.990
Especially when you are using CSA, it's very helpful to keep your code clean.

157
00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:10.290
The live server is the extension I use for the vanilla JavaScript.

158
00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:13.590
You don't need to use it for the next year's projects.

159
00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:15.770
The next one is prettier.

160
00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:24.270
Prettier is going to help you to indent your codes and make them clean after saving.

161
00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:28.350
As a format your code easily.

162
00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:37.830
The last one is Tailwind CSS IntelliSense, which is going to help and suggest you some classes related

163
00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:43.410
to tell 11 CSS for example when I write down earlier.

164
00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:50.350
Texts read it suggested me the all the variants of the red colour.

165
00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:53.770
So this is the extension that suggests that these things.

166
00:13:54.500 --> 00:14:00.700
So that was it for the extensions and also that was it for the installation of the tailwind.

167
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:01.540
CSS.

168
00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:09.020
Let's add this one to the GitHub and save this section in GitHub as well.

169
00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:15.470
So instead of just using terminal, we can use contour shift.

170
00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:17.140
Uh.

171
00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:26.160
You can use the for example, you want to open the source control this source control.

172
00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:34.410
So instead of using terminal, you can use contour shift G to open your source control.

173
00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:43.560
And instead of typing, for example, get add dot, forget at all, you can just click here in this

174
00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:44.520
plus icon.

175
00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:52.710
This is going to add everything to get and then you can add a message here which is equal to get commit

176
00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:58.500
dash m and the message is for now install.

177
00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.270
Tailwind CSS.

178
00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:14.240
And we just can click on this arrow icon and commit and push at the same time.

179
00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.160
So this is going to upload everything to GitHub.

180
00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:22.000
Now we can go to our GitHub here.

181
00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:26.580
We go back to the comment sections.

182
00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:28.150
Hmm.

183
00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:35.450
And if you refresh the page, we should see the new commit, which is the install tailwind CSS.

184
00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:39.350
And if you click here, we can review our code.

185
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:48.440
So as you can see inside the package JSON, we have installed some packages like auto prefix for post

186
00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.510
CSS and tail and CSS.

187
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:59.630
And inside the post post the CSS conflict that is this file is created automatically by 11 CSS when

188
00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:00.920
we initialize it.

189
00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:05.940
And later we can add some plug ins to this file.

190
00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:13.090
Then inside the global that CSIS, we have added these three lines of codes.

191
00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:18.350
And inside the page that just I just added some.

192
00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:25.420
I just want to show you the how to work with the classes.

193
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:30.260
So I've added the text with 400 to change the color of the.

194
00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:31.830
Texts.

195
00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:41.510
And also inside the Tailwind configs, we have added these codes which is going to scan everything inside

196
00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:49.640
the S or C folder automatically and create the classes and CSS syntax based on the classes that we have

197
00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.890
at inside these files.

198
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.560
Okay.

199
00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:58.490
That was it for the installation of the Taleban CSS.

200
00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:03.230
In the next section, we are going to create the header section of the projects.

201
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:08.690
We are going to create this part based on the final version that you can see now.

202
00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:14.540
So see in the next section for the header part of the project.
