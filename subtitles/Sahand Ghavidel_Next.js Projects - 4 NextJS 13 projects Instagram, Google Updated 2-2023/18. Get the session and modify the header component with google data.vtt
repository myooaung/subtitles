WEBVTT
1
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:17.970
All right, in the last section, we have finished with the nicks of installation, and we did the part

2
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.070
with the Google as well.

3
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:32.730
So no, we can sign in, but we haven't implemented yet the getting decision and see or hide the meaningful

4
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.700
file or the images when the person is signed out.

5
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:46.080
In order to get the session, we need to first go to visual studio code and we go to.

6
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.040
A file called Underline APT.

7
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.760
Yes.

8
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.940
This is the file that.

9
00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.080
Is it exclusive to next year?

10
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:07.010
It covers everything and all your application at.

11
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.820
For example, here we return all the components and also the oldest styles are coming from here.

12
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:25.780
So if we cover and wrap this application, it means actually we wrapped all our website.

13
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.790
The first thing we need to do to achieve this.

14
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:40.830
And get the session is just the ad this session provided for this file.

15
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.470
So first, we need to import.

16
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.590
Session provider.

17
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:56.750
Session providers camel case for why wider?

18
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.800
And this is coming from Nick's.

19
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.350
Dash off.

20
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.090
Forward slash react.

21
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.890
So we are getting that one now.

22
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.080
And then we need to wrap it around our application.

23
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:32.800
I mean, around this component, so if we bring this one down, we return it by a parenthesis instead.

24
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.000
And here you going to cover this one with decision provider.

25
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.970
So we just efficient provider.

26
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.280
And they closed this.

27
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.820
And they bring this one inside.

28
00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:03.200
And for the opening tag we need to add, we passed the session.

29
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.780
And first, we need to get it, get it from here.

30
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:14.380
So this way we call the page props and we get the session.

31
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:16.600
And the.

32
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:19.240
Page.

33
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.890
Props.

34
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:28.370
So instead of getting all the props that we distracted and get decision and pitch props.

35
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.700
Together and we passed this session.

36
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.370
Here we just a equals, Fisher.

37
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.360
So now we easily.

38
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.220
Let me check this session provider.

39
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.030
Solution, provide a reality check the.

40
00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.970
Yeah, just be careful of this, but this one should be capitalized.

41
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:03.690
And this one to.

42
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:07.960
So now it's working.

43
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:14.200
So now we we covered everything inside our application.

44
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.680
Now we can get decision.

45
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.140
And each page.

46
00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.120
So in order to get it, so for example, we want to get in the header.

47
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.340
In order to do so, we just need to go to yes.

48
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.560
And at a top.

49
00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.790
We import.

50
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.290
U.S..

51
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.310
Something called youth.

52
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.670
From next.

53
00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.290
Dash off forward slash reacts.

54
00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.990
So we got your session here, and then here we can create a constant.

55
00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.340
And we call it.

56
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:14.890
We can we can actually structured and get the data and be equal this one to use session, which is a

57
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:15.460
function.

58
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.250
But it's not actually good to call this one data.

59
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.730
We can call this one session, so we call it to.

60
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:27.660
Session.

61
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.390
All right.

62
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.300
So let's cancel lock session and see what we have inside session.

63
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:37.140
Right.

64
00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.750
Yeah, it's crooked this good here, and uh.

65
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.050
Let's open our consul.

66
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:49.470
Using.

67
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:51.820
If 12.

68
00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.360
No, we don't have any, actually.

69
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:06.710
Session in Hethersett undefined, let's refresh the page.

70
00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.290
Yeah.

71
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:16.040
No, you're getting actually actually, uh, sometimes because, uh, we restart a server.

72
00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:22.120
A decision is not shown and it's actually basically we sign out.

73
00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:28.750
But actually, when you deploy your website and this stuff never happened because you never restarted

74
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.210
your server, your service is always running.

75
00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.770
So make sure to always refresh the page to get the session.

76
00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:43.180
So now we have this session here we open it and see that it has expiration date.

77
00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:46.300
Let me zoom out a little bit.

78
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:51.420
You can see or you can hear me.

79
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:54.750
Yeah, I was almost like this.

80
00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:01.290
Yeah, we have the expiration date, which I think it's about one month.

81
00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.530
The Google provides the Earth.

82
00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.170
Then then you have to use it.

83
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.660
So we are getting my email.

84
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.720
We are getting my haymitch address.

85
00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:22.110
The image that it equals, I upload it inside my Google and also add my name.

86
00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:33.290
And also we have something else called the token that gives me the, uh, my user I.D..

87
00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:37.570
So that no.

88
00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:41.400
Based on this information, we can update.

89
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:44.060
Here, this image.

90
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:53.150
This is a static image I put, but let's make it my Google image, which has a white background.

91
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:56.470
So inside this, uh.

92
00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:08.580
Let's cover this right section, because we want this one to be so in the right section.

93
00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:16.020
So after this dinner and after this home icon.

94
00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:22.250
We we are going to use that session to cover this part.

95
00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:29.000
You just say session, if this session existed, then we want to.

96
00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.720
Show this parts, so we.

97
00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:37.830
Copy this recorded, and they bring it up.

98
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:49.540
But it should be inside empty fragments because of the rules and react components.

99
00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:55.080
So we need to bring them everything inside an empty fragment or a death.

100
00:08:56.690 --> 00:09:07.280
OK, after this, we say if this session is not exist, otherwise, we want to just create something

101
00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:07.670
else.

102
00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:14.290
We just want to have a button that's saying sign in.

103
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.150
And.

104
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.640
OK, let's know, we can see the sign in.

105
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:30.260
Refresh, suppose we should be silent because, yes, last time I sign in.

106
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:31.490
All right.

107
00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.420
So now actually, we are signing, we're seeing the image.

108
00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:44.050
And then instead of seeing these hard coded image, I want to see the image from my Gmail.

109
00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:48.710
So which is inside edition dot user?

110
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:50.480
Dot.

111
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.250
I think image.

112
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:59.300
Now you can see the real image from my.

113
00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:02.130
Uh, Google.

114
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:15.800
So let's make it the mix, add a sign out button as well, so we can sign out and see there is actually

115
00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:24.710
a very easy things that we can do to signing a sign out which we can get from mix of react.

116
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:30.510
So we can bring in two things sign in.

117
00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:35.200
And sign out.

118
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:44.040
So both of them actually easily sign in or sign out us from this session.

119
00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:51.910
So we used this sign in inside the this button that we are.

120
00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.100
We just created.

121
00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:03.090
So we just make it and click and make it function, and the function is going to call that sign in.

122
00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:10.770
Or we can simply remove this one.

123
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:15.500
And also, we don't need the parenthesis as well, because it's unclear.

124
00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:17.510
So both are correct.

125
00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:19.580
You can use both of them.

126
00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:26.910
And for a sign in, I want when we click on the image, I want to sign out, actually.

127
00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:41.030
So here, just the added unclear and similar what we did at the bottom, which is instead of signing,

128
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:43.560
we just say, sign out.

129
00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:45.320
All right.

130
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:47.810
Now we just need to test it.

131
00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:57.350
Let's refresh the page, as I mentioned before, because of restarting this server, we we sign out,

132
00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:00.140
but actually we are signing and we need to refresh the page.

133
00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:02.720
So when I click on the.

134
00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:05.010
My image.

135
00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:06.840
I should sign up.

136
00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:14.850
Now we just see the sign in button and we don't see my image.

137
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.790
So we try again, we do sign here.

138
00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:23.760
It's brings us is actually a wrong.

139
00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:26.530
Hedge.

140
00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:31.640
Bring us to off site in.

141
00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:40.590
Yeah, the problem is why he brought us here.

142
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:50.400
To API, this slash of signing instead of just off sign in because in.

143
00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:54.500
Show you.

144
00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:58.810
In next off that, yes.

145
00:12:59.240 --> 00:12:59.780
Here.

146
00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:09.000
We that's we made a mistake here, we should write sign in with a Capitol sign.

147
00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:12.660
So now we save this file.

148
00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:22.920
We go back to our home page and we click on Sign, and it should brings us to the correct page, which

149
00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.440
we created in the last video.

150
00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:27.180
All right.

151
00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:39.810
Now we are in the signing page, we can sign in with Google because I already had, uh, provided my

152
00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:43.620
information on, I only have one Google account.

153
00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.940
Inside, I got inside my gym directly.

154
00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:53.110
So let let me ask another G.M. accounts.

155
00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:56.680
So we have to actually.

156
00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:03.820
So another email quote, it's a hand at G.M. dot com.

157
00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:08.760
Let me quickly provide.

158
00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:13.020
My password.

159
00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:25.750
Yeah.

160
00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:30.280
So now we have two accounts inside Google.

161
00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.880
So let's try the other one.

162
00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:40.200
So we sign in with Google here.

163
00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.830
And this time I choose the other accounts.

164
00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.440
All right, now, we can see a different image.

165
00:14:52.070 --> 00:15:02.180
So let's modify this mini profile section as well, or just the video is getting too long, so we do

166
00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:10.250
it in the next video and in the next section, we're going to modify this mini profile section.

167
00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:14.000
We get the real user name and the image.

168
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:20.720
And also we're going to end the image at the beginning of this story section.

169
00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:24.440
Like the one we have in the final.

170
00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:25.970
Version.

171
00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:30.580
In the final version, if you sign in.

172
00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:33.910
Uh.

173
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:42.950
For example, with this court, it's a hand we can't see my image here at the beginning of this story

174
00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:46.280
