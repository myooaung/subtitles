1
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:07,830
All right.

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:14,850
In the last section, we have completed the styling of the results related to the web search.

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,810
In this section, we're going to work on the image results.

4
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:24,150
So when we go now to the image part, we don't see anything.

5
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,860
We just see the image search page text here.

6
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,940
We're going to work on it.

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,640
The fishing part is very similar to the web search.

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:44,250
The only difference is we need to add some extra parameters inside the fetching URL.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,280
So I'm going to go back to Visual Studio Code and we just copy whatever inside the page that's inside

10
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:53,970
the web.

11
00:00:54,810 --> 00:01:00,030
We copy this one and we can easily change this one and make it.

12
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,350
So I'm going to copy everything inside this web.

13
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,430
We go to image page statistics.

14
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,340
Select all and paste that one.

15
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:22,860
And here I'm going to change some things like this Web should be image.

16
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,340
And then

17
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,420
the the URL, the difference in the URL.

18
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,960
We just need to add another parameter here.

19
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:44,370
We just say and and we just say search type image at the end.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,080
And then.

21
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,730
The error is completely similar.

22
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:58,520
We still get the items and if the results I mean the data item is not existed, we just say no result

23
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,240
find.

24
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,060
We come back to homepage.

25
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:12,680
But we want to create another component with a different name, and we want to create another format

26
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,840
of results.

27
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:22,910
So here, instead of saying web search result, I'm going to say image search results and then let's

28
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,970
create it and let's change the import.

29
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:30,800
First, this is going to be image search result.

30
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,560
I'm going to create this component as well.

31
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:40,310
So we're going to create a component called image search.

32
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:42,990
Results.

33
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,370
The TSX.

34
00:02:53,460 --> 00:03:01,900
And for now we just say ref c e to create a react functional component so we don't get an error.

35
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,510
Now let's check.

36
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,910
So we see that.

37
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,430
We just say something went wrong.

38
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,630
Try again.

39
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,350
So let's try this.

40
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,080
For example, I search.

41
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:14,840
Hello.

42
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:20,810
And if you remember, we have added like a ten second of wait.

43
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:28,970
So the error is image search result is not defined and the search results.

44
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,440
Image Search Results.

45
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,180
Let me copy this one.

46
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,110
It's fine.

47
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:51,120
I think it's so we have created this one mass search result.

48
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,430
Let's check the imports.

49
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:59,310
So we go to page that G6 are for the import.

50
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,200
I think this one is broken.

51
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,130
So Image Search results.

52
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,180
I hear this one should be image search results.

53
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,020
Okay.

54
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,950
So probably now we should see something.

55
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,590
So let's try again.

56
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:29,600
So we need to wait for 10 seconds because we have added another promise here that takes 10 seconds to

57
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,640
be resolved, which is making a delay before the fetching.

58
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,680
Now the fetching is working, but we just get the image search results.

59
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:43,910
But the things we want to do here, we want to get the results.

60
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,360
Inside the.

61
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,930
This component that we have created in search results.

62
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:00,800
We get the results here as a props.

63
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:11,900
And then we can just as style it here and then we get the desired result that we want.

64
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:22,620
For example, I want to get some for example, let me show you inside the final version.

65
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:27,140
So inside the final version when we go to the images.

66
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,630
We see that our research for some, I think.

67
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:40,240
So it's just a we see the image next to each other.

68
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:44,960
We have the title and we have the formatted URL.

69
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:53,570
And if you look at the terms down here, you see that the URL is different from the formatted URL.

70
00:05:53,810 --> 00:06:00,500
And we could just to that website if you click on that and then we have some shadow effect as well when

71
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,790
we hover over them.

72
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,280
So this is kind of similar to Google.com.

73
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,070
And let's create this.

74
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:17,300
So inside this step, we're going to have another div.

75
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,350
First thing first, we need to create another div.

76
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:29,430
And here we're going to map through the results.

77
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:42,960
So first things first, we just say resolve that items that map and then we get the results here.

78
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,050
So let me close this.

79
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:49,830
Okay.

80
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:57,610
And then.

81
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,880
So we get the results.

82
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:08,710
And then inside this one, we're going to have a diff.

83
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:18,970
And also this one should be grouped because when we hover over it, we wanna see the underline inside

84
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,650
that section.

85
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:25,690
This is similar to the one we did for the other part.

86
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,760
So we need to close this div.

87
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:30,160
Okay.

88
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,850
Very insider's tip.

89
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,060
So we made the group here.

90
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,600
Okay, We need another dip at the top here.

91
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,080
So just made me create another diff.

92
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,850
And this step is going to be inside that diff.

93
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:05,420
Okay, so here I'm going to add some key because we are loop through something.

94
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:09,110
So we're going to add a key which is going to be unique.

95
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,960
And I think the results.

96
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,870
That link is unique.

97
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,380
And then let's.

98
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,590
Let's add something here so we can see inside the page.

99
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:41,810
First, we want to see the image, but the image should be inside the anchor tag or link tag from the

100
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,420
next Edge's.

101
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:48,500
So I'm going to add a link tag which is coming from next for Slash Link.

102
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,120
We're going to close this one.

103
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:57,710
The Edge rift for this one is going to be the result resultant link.

104
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:04,350
K.

105
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:21,670
Now, this actually this link is for the image, but the one that we want to go and see, the image

106
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,010
is result.

107
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:34,720
That image dot context, context, link, context link should be uppercase.

108
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:40,270
So inside this link, we're going to have an image tag.

109
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:47,440
We cannot use the image tag of the next yes, because these links are completely different from each

110
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:47,770
other.

111
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:58,600
And the rules of the image tag for the next year is to be is to add the URL inside the config file because

112
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,980
it's always different.

113
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:06,580
We cannot use that in tag image text, so we cannot optimize the images actually.

114
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:10,510
So the CRC for this one is going to be.

115
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:14,410
Result.

116
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,970
Dot link.

117
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,390
So this is going to give us the image actually.

118
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:32,160
And then the for the alternative, we can just add the title.

119
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:36,540
So we just say results dot title.

120
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:45,390
K So now probably we can see something inside the our website.

121
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,040
So let's refresh the page.

122
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,660
But we are getting the result, the images.

123
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,960
So the sizes are different.

124
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,370
We need a stylus.

125
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:18,390
So when we hover over it, as you can see here at the bottom, so we see the URL, each of them, if

126
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,500
you click, it's a different website.

127
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,940
So the link is actually working.

128
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,380
So we just need to style it, make it smaller and something like that.

129
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:38,920
But before that, I want to add some the other parts first and then we can style all of them together.

130
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:47,500
So we're going to add another anchor tag or the link tag, and then we can just add the title at the

131
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,630
bottom of the image.

132
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,780
Like the final version.

133
00:11:49,780 --> 00:12:01,030
We're going to have the title and also we're going to have the this link, which is display link.

134
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,990
It's different.

135
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,610
So we're going to have two more links tag.

136
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,070
So let's come back here.

137
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:15,750
We can just copy this link tag two more times because the other ones are similar.

138
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,320
They are just link.

139
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:20,590
So I'm going to copy this one two more times.

140
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:30,520
But instead of image in the second one, by the way, I use all shift arrow down to copy like that.

141
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,070
And for the image instead of image.

142
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:37,250
In this next one we're going to have.

143
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,490
There's something else.

144
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:49,340
The link is different because anything we click, we're going to go the same place.

145
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:51,620
So.

146
00:12:51,620 --> 00:13:00,950
But instead of the image tag in the second one, we're going to have an H two tag we just say.

147
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,110
Result the title.

148
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:22,240
And finally, for the last one, instead of image, we're going to have a paragraph with the results.

149
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,930
Dot display link.

150
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:38,480
And you're wondering why I know that display link or title or link or whatever.

151
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:45,920
You can simply console.log the results and check which one is the image, which one is the link, and

152
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,950
then you can just know how to do it.

153
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,620
Uh, it's very simple.

154
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,990
You can just simply castle log here.

155
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,430
I just assume that you know the basics of.

156
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,140
JavaScript.

157
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:04,810
So but in my other projects, I'll show you how to do it too.

158
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:12,710
So here I, you can just use F 12 to go to console.

159
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:22,190
So after refreshing the page and after 10 seconds you should see the console log.

160
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,800
Let's wait a while.

161
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:29,490
Okay.

162
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,580
So this is going to.

163
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:38,670
Hey.

164
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,830
So we're getting an error.

165
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:51,250
So we get the title actually with the display URL, but we get actually the because this is a server

166
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:56,610
side component, you get the console log inside the terminal, not in the browser.

167
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,610
Sorry about that.

168
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:04,780
So here we are going to show you how I choose the display or something like that.

169
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:16,210
So in each result, for example, we have title here, we have H HTML title, we have the link that

170
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:18,010
is going to go to that image.

171
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:22,720
You can see the format is dot jpg.

172
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,340
We have the display link, which is the just the display link.

173
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,110
We have different things.

174
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:35,080
You can, for example, have more things in your image, more information.

175
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:40,390
So as you can see, this is the way you get.

176
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:49,270
So you know that, for example, a title is going to get the title display link shows the display link

177
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,950
and the etc..

178
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:53,650
Kate.

179
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:57,130
So this was for the showing the console.

180
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:59,920
Let's click the delete the console log.

181
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,590
We don't need it and let's close this one.

182
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:07,300
And then we are getting an error here showing the old property is missing.

183
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:13,000
I think this is the solver in our code.

184
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,830
We forgot to add the old property.

185
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:17,800
It's not an important actually error.

186
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,190
We can fix it.

187
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,720
So this is it.

188
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:29,200
Now, we got all the information, the image, we got the title and also the display name.

189
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:32,240
Now we we need to style this.

190
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:36,380
So we wanted to something like a grid.

191
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:41,870
We want to make it display grid and we show in the mobile one columns.

192
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:47,530
In the medium size, we want to see two columns large.

193
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:50,380
We want a three and x, large, four and etc..

194
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:54,880
So we can simply do that by changing the display here.

195
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:04,320
The things I want to do, as I mentioned, because this one goes under this footer, some of them.

196
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:09,460
So we want to have some padding in the bottom of 24 to fix that one.

197
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:12,340
Always in the each page you have to do it.

198
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:23,290
So here at a top div, we're going to have a padding bottom of 24, which is going to remove that x,

199
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:27,160
add some extra space for the footer.

200
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,900
And also we want to add some padding at the top as well.

201
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:38,260
So after saving after 10 seconds, you're going to see the change.

202
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,800
But so for now, we'll just keep continue.

203
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:51,130
So for this step, we want to change the display to create and we want to change in the mobile size.

204
00:17:51,130 --> 00:18:00,070
We want to have the create columns of one for the small size and above.

205
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:08,710
We want to have great columns of two for the large size and above.

206
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:13,180
We want to have the great columns of three.

207
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:22,030
And you, you know, the next one, the X large is going to be the great columns of four.

208
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,530
So in any size we have different number of.

209
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,390
Images inside and in columns.

210
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:38,100
We want to have some padding in the x axis of three and we want to have some space between them.

211
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:41,950
We can just say space x four.

212
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,930
So let's see what we have here now.

213
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:50,410
So we already have this space here for the footer.

214
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,720
So this we can see this one.

215
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:59,470
So we should wait until there is new results.

216
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,750
Come after ten second.

217
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:06,250
So we we have now in the largest screen for image.

218
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:17,530
K in this smaller size mobile size, we only have one.

219
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,580
That's fine.

220
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,380
Then we have.

221
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,160
Two in the medium.

222
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:29,700
In the last we have three and in the x large we have four.

223
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:32,700
Let's search something else so we get some better.

224
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:34,280
Images.

225
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,290
For example, we search for hello.

226
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:42,710
And because these images are a bit long.

227
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,890
So we get a different row here.

228
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,560
So we are getting an error.

229
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,470
Something went wrong.

230
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:54,290
So let's.

231
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,430
Okay, We are getting, again, too many requests.

232
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:16,020
So I'm going to say wait a little bit and try again.

233
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:25,860
So for the rest of the styling, I'm going to stop the server so we don't request too many times.

234
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:31,860
So let's continue styling everything and then we can see all the results together.

235
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,030
I'm going to show you and explain you, all of them.

236
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:40,950
So inside this diff that is having the key.

237
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:45,210
We're going to have some margin at the bottom of.

238
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:47,200
Eight.

239
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:57,960
And this is a group that is fine that they have, but the link tag for the first one we're going to

240
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:06,840
have this one doesn't have any styling, but the link, the image inside it, we're going to set the

241
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,560
height.

242
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:13,730
To be 660.

243
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:21,530
So we set the height of this one to be 660.

244
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:26,900
And when we hover over the group, all these things.

245
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:34,730
We're going to have a shadow of x large.

246
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,420
So this is going to be a group.

247
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:46,670
The width is going to be full and we want to.

248
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:53,460
Make the image to be always in the same aspect ratio.

249
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:56,310
So we just use object, contain.

250
00:21:56,670 --> 00:22:01,110
And then if you want to, some transition for the shadow effect.

251
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:03,150
So I'm going to add some transition.

252
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:11,220
So transition for shadow, we just add some transition to the shadow.

253
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,890
Okay, that's fine.

254
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:14,430
Is fine.

255
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:19,770
So after that, for the next tag we're going to have.

256
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:22,650
Instead of shadow.

257
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:29,820
When we hover over this group, we're going to have the underlined for this tag H two text.

258
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,560
So for the H to tag.

259
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:38,510
Or, uh, let's make it for the link tag.

260
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,460
Actually, not the title.

261
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,130
This can be the same thing.

262
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:43,270
So.

263
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,280
So we're going to add this one to the edge to tag.

264
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:50,060
So when we group, hover it.

265
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,350
We're going to have the underline.

266
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:58,090
K.

267
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:00,590
On the line.

268
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:13,240
And then finally, we want to truncate if if the title is too long, we want to truncate it to one as

269
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:14,570
single line.

270
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:22,550
And let's make the text to be ex large.

271
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:30,280
For the next paragraph, we're going to have similar things.

272
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:39,830
You're going to have the group hover effect, which is going to be underlined.

273
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,850
And then we want to make the text to be gray.

274
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,120
600.

275
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:59,360
Craig So yeah, I think it's finished for the styling.

276
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:03,090
So let's start.

277
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:10,050
Start the server and see what we have done using NPM run dev.

278
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:13,470
So let's see.

279
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,240
So we get an error or not.

280
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,910
So we waited for a while.

281
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,360
Okay.

282
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:25,010
Let's try again.

283
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:29,700
First, refresh the page.

284
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:34,790
Very.

285
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,280
Like this one is in the web.

286
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,180
I want the image.

287
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,950
So we go to the image first.

288
00:24:59,150 --> 00:24:59,360
Okay.

289
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,390
We're still getting the two many requests error.

290
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,680
So I'm going to stop and then come back when the error is gone.

291
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:07,510
All right.

292
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,570
Now it's working.

293
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:12,680
I have waited for a few minutes, so I.

294
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,790
This is the result for next year.

295
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:21,340
For example, if I search for tailwind cease.

296
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,470
First is going to go to the.

297
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:28,350
When we search, we go to the web.

298
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,110
The delay is for the ten second delay.

299
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,010
We have added.

300
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,210
It's it can be very fast, actually.

301
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:40,020
And then if you click on image, this is going to be an image.

302
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:43,260
As you can see, we are waiting for the result.

303
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:50,040
But in the following section, I'm going to add the loading effect like the final version.

304
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,050
So we're going to see a loading effect.

305
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:57,960
So it's going to be more nicer for users.

306
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:06,270
So we are getting the results and we set the height to be 60 for all of them and then this is more beautiful.

307
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:11,820
So some pages or some images are longer, some of them are shorter.

308
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:17,190
And also when we hover over it, we see a shadow effect and also underline for both of them.

309
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:20,220
All right.

310
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,260
So a.

311
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:26,240
KING That was it for creating the image section.

312
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:28,190
Let's add this one to GitHub.

313
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:33,770
I'm going to stop the server so we don't make any requests again.

314
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,280
So we're going to go to the.

315
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:51,640
To add all the changes here in the source control and then we can add it.

316
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,670
Message saying just add image.

317
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:01,490
Results.

318
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:12,240
So let's commit and push it to GitHub and review what we have done inside our GitHub repository.

319
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,520
I'm going to refresh the page to get the new results.

320
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:25,050
Now we have 15 commits inside our GitHub repository and the last one is ad image results.

321
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:34,800
As you can see, we inside the image that G6, we have modified this page similar to the one inside

322
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:39,360
the web page that G6.

323
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:48,510
The only modification we have done is to add the search type equal to image here to get this search

324
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,730
related to images.

325
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:58,950
Then if the result is not okay, you're going to just throw an error and see the error.

326
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:05,700
For example, we had the error of 2 million requests so we could see it inside the console log.

327
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:08,910
It's very similar to the web.

328
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:15,870
So if there is no result, we're going to have a no results find and then we can go to the home page.

329
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:23,700
Then we have changed the also the this component name to image search result.

330
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:31,860
And we have created this component here inside the components folder, which is just the mapping through

331
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:40,410
the results and show it in three parts, the image and two links, which one of them is titled and one

332
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:43,380
of them is the display link for the image.

333
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:53,100
We have used the result link, but for the link that we go to that page, we're going to use the context

334
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,260
link which is inside the image.

335
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:57,620
Right.

336
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,930
That was it for creating the image.

337
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:06,200
In the next section, we're going to work on the pagination of our projects.

338
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,960
So similar to the one in the final version.

339
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,590
We're going to have a pagination next are icon.

340
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:18,350
So when we click on the next, we're going to see the next page.

341
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:23,680
First thing first we see the start is different here inside the URL.

342
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:24,800
Now it's 11.

343
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:31,490
So we got the first ten image, then we get this second ten image.

344
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:41,180
And also we have the previous button after going to the next page and we're going to create this one

345
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,220
for the web as well.

346
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,810
So when we go to the Web.

347
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,570
But you're going to have similar things next and previous.

348
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:55,270
So see in the next section for creating the pagination part of our project.
