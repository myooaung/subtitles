1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:09,050
All right.

2
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:18,470
In this section, we're going to start creating our project and it starts with our terminal and installed

3
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,080
the next genius app.

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,570
So we open the terminal.

5
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,570
We just.

6
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,280
We are going to use a common prompt.

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,400
Or any Trong Terminal app you would like to use.

8
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:40,750
So we click on the comment from let me increase the size a little bit so you can see it better.

9
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,030
And let's check the next year's Web site.

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,050
What we need to do first for installation.

11
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:53,290
So we open the Google Chrome.

12
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,430
And here we search for next year's.

13
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,150
In the results section, we have a website.

14
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:14,970
It's the next year, that --, next year by Verso, so we click on this web site.

15
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:25,300
As you can see, the React framework for production.

16
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:32,550
And we can just start learning or we go straight to the documentation.

17
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,390
In the documentation we have.

18
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:48,950
All the parts like getting started, basic features like page jazz, data, fishing, building services,

19
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:57,240
support and layouts for getting started and make sure that you have all the requirements there.

20
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:02,480
You just need to notice twelve point two twenty two point.

21
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:09,150
Zero or later and macOS or Windows or Linux.

22
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:17,110
Then for creating a next year, and we just need to run.

23
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:27,910
Knicks and trade Knicks app, and for the latest version, we just need to add that latest.

24
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:37,420
So we copy this code and we go to our terminal.

25
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:45,870
And we go to the folder that we would like to create a project, I would like to create a project in

26
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,350
my desktop, so I go to my this sub by city.

27
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,190
Desk top.

28
00:02:53,870 --> 00:03:04,310
And once I'm in the desktop, I paste to code and also after a space, I've specified the name of the

29
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,030
project.

30
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:14,570
So I already made like a seven version of this project for my practice, but I just I write down here

31
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,030
movie.

32
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:20,320
All we have.

33
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,640
Version eight, but you can call it anything you like.

34
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:32,880
So we press enter and we wait for the installation to be finished.

35
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:42,730
As you can see, let me increase the size decreases, so yeah, we're going to install three tanks.

36
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,330
Are you going to start next?

37
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,320
React and react, Dom, because next is based on React.

38
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:56,320
So we need to have these two packages, but NPC's is going to install all of them.

39
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:07,480
And also in this script, we have Div, which runs that the next year under development mode.

40
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:13,990
So in order to run it, we just need to write down npm run dev.

41
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,370
OK.

42
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:25,990
Until this one is installing, let's go to the telephone CSIS website as well, because we need telephone

43
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:31,000
CFS because we are using tailored CSIS for styling our project.

44
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,310
So research tells us to assess.

45
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:42,510
So in the search results, we see Tellement Tillmans cases that come.

46
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,740
And we click on this website.

47
00:04:51,400 --> 00:05:00,490
Rapidly build modern Web sites without ever leaving your HTML in our case, you're not leaving our JavaScript

48
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,800
file because we are using next year.

49
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:08,590
So that's a great feature of this, uh, framework.

50
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:16,480
It's going to help us without needing to leave our code to style our project.

51
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,460
As you can see now here.

52
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,700
The demo that's this writing just in the class names.

53
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,410
And everything is changing based on the class name.

54
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,060
So we need to go to the documentation here as well.

55
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,160
And.

56
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:47,860
This is a like a tutorial for installing televised cases for normal material, but we as we are using

57
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,950
framework and.

58
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:59,430
Like, next year, we just need to go to the framework guides in the installation, and we just choose

59
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,600
next year here.

60
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:11,040
If we look through this tutorial, you see that first, we need to create a project that we have already

61
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,480
done.

62
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:22,310
We just need to do that, create nicks and Nicks app installation and go inside the project folder and

63
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,250
later we need to install.

64
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:30,800
Tailwinds, yes, by this code and also initialize it with this code.

65
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,600
So let's check that it's finished.

66
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,600
Yeah, it's finished already.

67
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:41,330
So we just opened this in the beer school.

68
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:49,520
Uh, the text editor that I'm using and you can open this folder in any text editor you like to use.

69
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:57,980
So we just see into the folder that he created creative movie.

70
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,700
App version eight.

71
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:07,100
And inside this, I just use code space.

72
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,060
Dot.

73
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:18,920
To open the visual studio code to this directory as soon as I enter, we see that the Visual Studio

74
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:24,290
code is open and all the folders and packages are here as well.

75
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,230
So we maximize the window.

76
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,540
We close the Get Started tab.

77
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:37,640
Now, in order to install the turbines, yes, we can use the internal terminal of the Visual Studio

78
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:37,940
Code.

79
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:44,750
Here you can see what for opening and closing the terminal, we can use control tactic.

80
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:54,760
So here we call it, press control back take or also we can open the terminal here from the View menu

81
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,410
terminal.

82
00:07:59,230 --> 00:07:59,680
All right.

83
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,600
Let's clear this.

84
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,790
And increase the size that you can see it better.

85
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,650
And we bring it.

86
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,320
In this corner, and we open the.

87
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,940
Children's to on the right sides.

88
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:25,470
All right.

89
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:34,380
So we already installed this section, and now we need to copy this line of code and paste it here into

90
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,290
terminal we press into.

91
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:43,370
This one is very quick, maybe takes a few seconds to be finished.

92
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:56,970
All right.

93
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:04,720
That's already finished, so we clear the page and buy this line of code.

94
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,470
We're going to initialize the Taleban CSIS.

95
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:19,270
So this is initialization actually creates two files posts CSIS that conflict artists and tailwind.

96
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,320
Uh, that conflict, Duchess.

97
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:30,700
And here for configuring our template for next year, we need to copy this code.

98
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:36,170
And we pasted inside to Tillman that conflict such is.

99
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:41,320
So we go here, let's meet to decrease the size.

100
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,520
All right.

101
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:48,430
So we just delete everything here and paste it here.

102
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:52,750
This is just the mayor saying that we can.

103
00:09:53,950 --> 00:10:04,900
Except all the JavaScript files inside the pages and components that justice for Typekit script, G6

104
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,320
and TSX, and also in the components as well.

105
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:17,990
And we don't have any plug ins yet, and the team is empty as well, so next, we need to copy this

106
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:25,310
three line of code and paste it inside the globals that CSIS, which is in the south folder.

107
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,640
So we open the Stalls folder here.

108
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,120
You can see we have two sisters files.

109
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:42,530
One is the Globalstar thesis that all the templates scores here like a style in the body and everything

110
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,780
that we want to apply to all the website.

111
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:51,380
But as we are using Taleban CCPA, we are not dealing with any specific files.

112
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:55,850
We just delete all of them and paste these three line of codes here.

113
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:07,040
Now, everything has been finished for tailwinds to this part, and we just need to use relative to

114
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,830
run our application.

115
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:13,570
So it's just right down here, NPN

116
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:25,220
let's clear this npm run dev and we press enter.

117
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:32,500
As you can see, the servers this is it started on Port three thousand.

118
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:38,940
And we can have access to the website in this URL HTP.

119
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:47,700
Localhost three thousand, so we in order to open this one, we just you can just keep the control and

120
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,230
click on the link.

121
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:58,050
And now if you wait a little bit to see our website with the Taleban to templates on the right side.

122
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,670
So this is just the template.

123
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:15,130
And in the next section, we are going to completely remove and put our own components and everything.

124
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:25,270
So before doing anything else, I'm going to show you how to use GitHub to push our website through

125
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:28,690
our application to the guitar.

126
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,510
And later, we're going to need this.

127
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:36,050
To deploy our website to traversal.

128
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:42,870
So let's stop the server using controversy and press why.

129
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:46,290
Let's clear this so you can see it better.

130
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,710
And here.

131
00:12:49,860 --> 00:13:01,560
I go to my guitar, so we search, get half here and in the website called Kip get hot dot com.

132
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,830
Let's maximize this and we go inside.

133
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,240
I already have their count.

134
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:18,100
If you don't have yet, how account can make sure to sign up otherwise signing indicator with your username

135
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,600
and password?

136
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:29,200
My username is every day and I just quickly write down my password.

137
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,390
And I sign in.

138
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:43,980
So and the riots and the top rise and the increase the size a little bit on the top right.

139
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:50,500
Here on the plus icon, we click and we click on new repository.

140
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:53,600
And.

141
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:59,270
We are going to create a new repository, and we're just going to name it here.

142
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:02,450
I named the file, we just call it.

143
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,800
Uh, movie.

144
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:14,050
App version eight, but you can call it anything you like, it should be unique in your projects and

145
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,490
the description would be.

146
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:16,740
This is it.

147
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,290
A app.

148
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:28,300
Created by next DOT.

149
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,090
Yes.

150
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,220
And tell.

151
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,540
And CSX.

152
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:41,550
Using I am TV.

153
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,630
Database.

154
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,590
Just quickly fix this.

155
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:53,910
All right.

156
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:54,810
That's it.

157
00:14:55,650 --> 00:15:02,850
We just keep it public or in your case, you can keep it private if you don't want other people to see

158
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:03,420
your call.

159
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:10,290
But, uh, I live it public and we don't need to check any of these things.

160
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,470
You just click on create a repository.

161
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,300
Now here, GitHub suggests some.

162
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:29,550
Codes to push our code to the guitar directly, so we go back to.

163
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:40,790
Fear Visual Studio code, and we just use get in it to initialize, get at and commit our website.

164
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,750
So here we just uh.

165
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,270
You get in it to initialize our.

166
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,620
Kids and we use Kit and two to add everything.

167
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,850
Let's clear this again.

168
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:14,140
And finally, we say get comments because we want to have the message that which we want change we have

169
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,480
done to the project in this stage.

170
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,970
So this is just a.

171
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:26,860
First video and the first the part that I'm going to call it just the.

172
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,150
Install.

173
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:32,540
Next.

174
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:39,280
You know, next year and Taleban CSIS.

175
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:49,340
OK, so now we just need to go back to the.

176
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:51,990
Get her.

177
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,140
And.

178
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,230
This line of code we need to copy.

179
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:08,530
So we need to specify which getup you are l, we want to connect with our application so we can copy

180
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:12,440
this and we go back to the Visual Studio code and we paste it here.

181
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,810
Then we just need to right get push.

182
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:29,160
And it suggests us the first time that we use get push as City Stream Origin Maine, so but the next

183
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,900
time we don't need to copy and paste it, so we use this line of code.

184
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,920
But the next time we just write down, get push.

185
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,250
So I'm going to show you in the next video how we do it.

186
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,580
So if if we now call back to our.

187
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:55,240
Repository and we refresh the page here by clicking on this, we see that our application is completely

188
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,970
uploaded to the get half.

189
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:03,410
And we have to come it's if you click on the comments.

190
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:10,640
This is the initial comment that comes from the next year's application, we didn't do this one, but

191
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,480
it's automatically done and we write down installed next year until next.

192
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:21,710
So here if you click, we see all the changes we have done to our projects.

193
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:30,170
So in the package that Jason, we installed the this is related to Tilman CSIS.

194
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:38,390
We installed these things in the post this conflict that yes, he added this line of code.

195
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:51,140
And in the global south, as we delete everything and we added the Taliban CSIS base component utilities.

196
00:18:52,550 --> 00:19:02,890
Intelligencia says that conflict that we added this codes and finished, so in the next section, we

197
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,970
are going to start.

198
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:08,460
Having our own template and.

199
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:17,720
Remove this kind of the next year template and have our own template based on the final version of our

200
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,290
project.

201
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,310
You can see that in the final version of our project.

202
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,630
We have.

203
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:32,530
Like a header and now four and also the results section, so we're going to divide our code to three

204
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:38,530
parts and start with the header and continue with the NAF bar and the results section.

205
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:45,280
So see in the next section for the templating, our website.
