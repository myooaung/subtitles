1
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:08,150
All right.

2
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:11,780
In the last section, we have completed the comment section.

3
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:19,570
In this section, we are going to deploy our website to where sold by us before going forward.

4
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:26,230
I want to add a transition when we are in the comment section as well.

5
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:36,130
When we delete or we add a new comment, we want to just have some fading effect, fading animation

6
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:36,640
for that.

7
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,750
We did this one for the home page.

8
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,090
So as you can see here, we have a transition.

9
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,250
We can do the same things by copying that section.

10
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,520
For example, in, uh.

11
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,700
I feel it's in fits.

12
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,120
We map through the post.

13
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:09,680
So but we added the animate presence and motion that there to cover this section so we can do the same

14
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,240
things for the comment.

15
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:13,900
Comments as well.

16
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:21,160
So we just copy this animate presence and we go to it.

17
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,080
That's.

18
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:23,530
Here.

19
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:28,570
We pay staff while we cover all of them here.

20
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,270
And we import it as well.

21
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:40,800
We just get the auto import and be imported from framer motion the package that we have installed then.

22
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,400
We just need to copy this circular motion that Dave.

23
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,850
I've put it here.

24
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,290
And also we need to close it as well.

25
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,160
So I caught this on.

26
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:00,940
I put that.

27
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,710
Inside this.

28
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:06,190
Okay.

29
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:13,270
It's just, uh, I have to change the key, because the key here is comment that if we change this one

30
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,860
to comment that idea as well.

31
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,830
So initial values are positive zero.

32
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,890
Then we animate to one and we exit with a positive zero as well.

33
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,550
And also we have a transition of 1/2.

34
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,080
So let's import emotion too.

35
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,410
So we have imported animate presents.

36
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:38,620
Let's import motion as well.

37
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,830
And, uh.

38
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,030
Let's try it.

39
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,730
Let's go inside, for example, at this post.

40
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,920
We can see now the transition.

41
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:58,160
And if we delete this post, we should see it fade away as well.

42
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,100
Like this.

43
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:01,730
Okay.

44
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:02,990
Looks good.

45
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:07,750
So we need to insta deploy our website traversal.

46
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,570
But before that, we need to do the final.

47
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,380
Uh, final commencement.

48
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:20,760
And also we need to add a secret to the.

49
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:26,250
Next off to inside the.

50
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,290
Uh.

51
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:31,800
Yeah.

52
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,610
Next.

53
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,600
No inside the off API off.

54
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,350
No.

55
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:38,400
We have sign in.

56
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,600
That is also.

57
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,170
We have.

58
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,380
Inside API.

59
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,840
Ah, we have next a30s.

60
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,130
We need to add a secret for this.

61
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,590
Otherwise we get an error.

62
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:54,620
Or we can just deploy now on see an error and then we fix it after death.

63
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,290
So because I want you to see the error as well.

64
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,660
So we go to verse all.

65
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,400
We are so dot com.

66
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:11,620
Make sure you sign in with your account and go to your dashboard.

67
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:18,390
Then we need to create a new project.

68
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,740
So this is the our repository.

69
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,860
And we just need to import it.

70
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:35,460
We just call it Twitter, and now we just need to add our environmental variables.

71
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:44,310
Now let's go back to Visual Studio code and inside that dot envy file, we copy.

72
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,210
Our environmental variable valuable and pasted here.

73
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,130
And the key as well.

74
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,890
That's coffee.

75
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,280
The Google client I.D..

76
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,470
Think.

77
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,620
They sit here?

78
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,770
Or do they?

79
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:20,280
And the last one is the client's secret.

80
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,320
See what?

81
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:32,230
Okay.

82
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,360
Let's add this one now.

83
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,320
We can deploy it.

84
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,800
We should get an error because I want you to see the error.

85
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:45,310
If you encounter the same error as you can, you know how to fix it.

86
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,040
Okay.

87
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,170
So it's building now.

88
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,440
If you get an error, we can see it here.

89
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,500
Now it's still installing.

90
00:05:59,250 --> 00:05:59,970
Okay.

91
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,170
So far so good.

92
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,940
Yeah, we got an error.

93
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,380
Inside signing that.

94
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,540
Yes, we missed the key.

95
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,680
Prop for the element.

96
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,060
So first we fix this, then we go to signing that.

97
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:18,690
Yes.

98
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,110
It's just here.

99
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:26,170
If.

100
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,850
Let's see the.

101
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:33,470
Their team.

102
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:35,620
Yeah, we.

103
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:39,820
We did a map, but we need to add the.

104
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,200
Prop here.

105
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,970
We need to add a key.

106
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,990
So the key would be provider.

107
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:56,120
For example, we just provided that name because the provider name is unique.

108
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,870
You can use it.

109
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,970
So let's deploy this.

110
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,490
Let's check the other areas first.

111
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:08,100
If we have other error, we can fix it inside news.

112
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:16,680
That is, we should use, uh, no referrer when we are using at target blanket.

113
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,240
So we need to copy this.

114
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,870
We go to news that years.

115
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:28,160
And here we we use the anchor tag.

116
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:34,830
So we have to add this one too, because we are using Target Black.

117
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:36,430
Okay.

118
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,320
Let's check the next error.

119
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:43,190
Inside widget that yes we use that this.

120
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,060
One.

121
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:48,570
We need to use this one or just delete it.

122
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:51,240
So we go to widget that.

123
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:55,920
Yes, I think I believe it's in there.

124
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:56,820
What's happening.

125
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,530
So we just delete this.

126
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:03,370
Okay, let's see what else.

127
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:08,430
Now we don't have any more errors, so now we can add this one to get half.

128
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,760
And with the message of.

129
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,590
Fix deploy.

130
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:18,860
Man.

131
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:21,550
Errors.

132
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,750
Uh.

133
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:28,740
Okay.

134
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,380
And we push it to get hot.

135
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,730
Now automatically works, so it's going to deploy again.

136
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,320
So we just check here.

137
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:39,780
We go back to homepage.

138
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:46,340
So now refresh the page.

139
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:53,600
We should see the new commitment here, fixed deployment errors if we click on this.

140
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,850
And we go to deployments.

141
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,600
The new deployments is building.

142
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,570
Let's see, we get an error or not.

143
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:09,320
That's easier to fix your errors.

144
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,240
You just wait.

145
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:20,330
And if you see an error, you can check the errors, fix it, and push it to get up again and fix the

146
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:20,660
error.

147
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:26,510
But the error I was talking about the index of and adding the.

148
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,120
Yeah, let's see what's there.

149
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:29,810
Again.

150
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:32,960
Okay.

151
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:33,450
Uh.

152
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,060
Insight idea, Dr. J.S..

153
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,910
Module not found.

154
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,580
Okay.

155
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,360
Let's check.

156
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,500
Yes.

157
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:07,780
I think this comment is capital.

158
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:10,060
This is lowercase.

159
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,460
It should be that prominent probably.

160
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:17,360
Uh.

161
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:33,090
Uh.

162
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:39,390
Let's close everything.

163
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,570
Inside the.

164
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,300
She touches.

165
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:47,650
Yeah.

166
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,530
I think it should be that problem.

167
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,870
Okay, let's.

168
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,370
Add it again and make a comment.

169
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:01,610
Just say two and we push it.

170
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,120
So let's go back to the homepage.

171
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:17,570
No, the new deployment is a start at the 5/2 past.

172
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,450
Okay, well, we see that one.

173
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:29,780
Yeah, I was telling that the next off adding the secret problem is not going to prevent deployment,

174
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:35,900
but when we are going to the signing page, it's it's going to give us the error.

175
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,500
So we'll see in a second.

176
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:41,330
Just wait until the deployment finish.

177
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:48,390
Okay.

178
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:48,870
This one.

179
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,070
I think it's fine.

180
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:52,580
Let's go inside.

181
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,900
And also I want to make a custom domain.

182
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:12,590
So we go to domains that Google that content is my domain this year and I purchased my domain from Google

183
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:23,240
100 just projects this website I want to put it inside this so I go to DNS and I go to manage custom

184
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:30,020
records and I'll add a new record, I want to call it, just to either.

185
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:36,930
And the type would be a and the IP, I use my virtual IP.

186
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,990
You have to use your own virtual IP.

187
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:43,370
Okay.

188
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,460
This time it's fine.

189
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,120
We deployed it.

190
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:51,840
Now let's add that domain here.

191
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,940
So we go to manage.

192
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,780
And the domain is.

193
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,710
Well, let's save this up first.

194
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:04,580
Okay.

195
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,170
Uh, the name was Tudor.

196
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:11,640
That's hundred genius projects.

197
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,900
Dot com.

198
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,430
I added, No.

199
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,100
So probably now we can go.

200
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:28,320
Okay.

201
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,240
Our website is fine.

202
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,590
This background color.

203
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:40,300
Let's open this font in a chrome instead.

204
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:40,840
So.

205
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,950
They shouldn't see that background color.

206
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,480
But the background color.

207
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,970
I was testing for the.

208
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:55,950
We can you can easily fix that and you got a widget and I added this background red color.

209
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:56,970
You can delete this one.

210
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:57,510
That's fine.

211
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,110
So instead we go to crawl.

212
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:04,820
Okay.

213
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:08,400
Now, the error I was talking is here.

214
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:17,520
When we try to sign in, we get an error server error, but we can easily fix that by just going to

215
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:23,040
API off next 30th.

216
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,690
And we add a secret here.

217
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:30,030
We just a secret and this is going to be equal.

218
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:31,880
To.

219
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:40,750
Should be like this process that Ian dear dot secrets.

220
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:46,020
And inside environmental valuable.

221
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,880
Here we add the secret.

222
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:56,600
And this can be anything you just a random things you just put here like this.

223
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,610
And then we need to deploy deployed to.

224
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,630
We need to push it to get up first.

225
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:10,190
So this is the fix.

226
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,280
Secret.

227
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,200
Error.

228
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:19,280
And we push it to get her.

229
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:29,390
Now in the next deployment that happens inside their vessel, that is automatically going to happen.

230
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:35,360
If you go now and inside the deployment, no new deployments is happening.

231
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:37,900
In this deployment.

232
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,540
We shouldn't get this signing error.

233
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,320
But we were going to get another era, just wait for it.

234
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:51,440
That is natural that they said, Yeah, we need to get that error to fix it.

235
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:57,270
So just bear with me and this is going to be fixed as well.

236
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,270
So just wait.

237
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,570
No, the deployment is done.

238
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,760
We go inside.

239
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:09,090
Uh.

240
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:10,290
Let's see.

241
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:12,800
Yeah.

242
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,830
The background colour here is finished.

243
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,380
It's fixed.

244
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,220
We go to sign in page.

245
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,360
I was still getting the error.

246
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:22,680
Let's.

247
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,000
Let's check it inside.

248
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,310
Here we go.

249
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,640
Text time to be applied to the custom domain.

250
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,410
So we have to wait a little bit.

251
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:31,860
Oh.

252
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,830
Oh, sorry about that.

253
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,360
I forgot to add the environmental variable.

254
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,290
So.

255
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,690
We need to come back here.

256
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:47,360
We go to the setting and we go to environmental variables and we add that secret.

257
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:50,670
Uh.

258
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,260
Sorry about that.

259
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,160
I forgot.

260
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:57,890
I added inside the, uh, Visual Studio could not hear me.

261
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,620
Whatever you.

262
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,430
You can write it.

263
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,660
It's not important.

264
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:01,110
It's one.

265
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:09,060
So we add it here and we go to deployment and we click here and we deployed again.

266
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,620
We just redeploy.

267
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,510
And we press redeploy.

268
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:16,040
Okay.

269
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,390
This is going to fix it.

270
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:22,940
I was kind of sure that is going to be fixed by forgot the environmental variable.

271
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:24,590
Okay.

272
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:27,720
Uh.

273
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:38,990
The image here.

274
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,820
I don't know why we cannot see the image.

275
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:51,080
Probably this is for a problem of Firefox is uh, blocking some elements but uh, it's an important

276
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:51,950
thing in the.

277
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,460
Graham.

278
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,110
We can see the image.

279
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:00,790
Okay.

280
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,450
The building is almost done.

281
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,110
Okay.

282
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,590
That's finished.

283
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:08,920
It's ready.

284
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,110
We can check the.

285
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:14,620
Let's go to the Chrome and refresh the page.

286
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,310
Now we try to sign in.

287
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,190
It should redirect us to the correct page.

288
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,040
That's correct.

289
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,720
Now, that's correct.

290
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,930
We should get another error.

291
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:29,790
Now, when we sign in with Google, we get an error.

292
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:34,510
We just say redirect your error mismatch because we changed the URL.

293
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,230
We didn't add it to the error cloud console.

294
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:48,780
So we need to copy this redirect URL, this file until here and we go to cloud.

295
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:50,570
Console.

296
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,870
We go to.

297
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:58,080
Console, that cloud, that Google.

298
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:08,440
Make sure to sign in with your phone with the correct email that you have created the project.

299
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,150
And.

300
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,830
You just select the projects.

301
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:22,590
The project's name was Twitter version four for me, and then we go here in the menu, we go to API

302
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:25,290
and services and finally in credentials.

303
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,970
And Insight credentials.

304
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:39,640
Here we click on edit or client and you should paste the link here inside the redirect URL.

305
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:47,470
So we add it here and also we copy the URL itself and paste it here as well at the top.

306
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,530
Now we go down our savings.

307
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,490
Okay.

308
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:55,360
No.

309
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:55,750
When?

310
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:56,260
Uh.

311
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,120
In our website, we go back.

312
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,780
When we click on sign in with Google.

313
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:06,820
We should go to the signing correct signing page and we click in any.

314
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:08,980
Email.

315
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,090
We want.

316
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,760
Let's test the website.

317
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,560
Let's put a post.

318
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,350
Let's choose the image.

319
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:22,870
Whatever.

320
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,180
We just say hello.

321
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,800
We tweeted.

322
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:32,940
Hmm.

323
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:38,650
And this is going to be uploaded to the fire.

324
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:40,940
Fire.

325
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:42,650
Uh, Firebase.

326
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,440
And, uh, we can delete it.

327
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,490
Probably.

328
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,340
I don't try this on.

329
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:50,360
Okay.

330
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:50,990
It's fine.

331
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:51,500
You deleted.

332
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:53,830
Yeah, that's fine.

333
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,350
Let's write another one.

334
00:20:58,330 --> 00:20:59,320
We don't image.

335
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,310
We can like it.

336
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,830
We can like the other ones.

337
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:06,910
We can add a comment, for example, we just say Nice.

338
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:11,390
We should be redirected to the Post page.

339
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:16,710
We cannot act like we can delete the comment.

340
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:20,190
That's fine.

341
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:24,540
Everything is working okay?

342
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:25,910
Yeah.

343
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,930
That was it for our project.

344
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,600
I hope you enjoyed and learned many things.

345
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,620
Please wait for the update.

346
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,910
I'm going to add more functionality.

347
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:37,830
And also.

348
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:44,820
And in the meantime, you can check out my other projects that I have uploaded before, or I'm going

349
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,650
to add more projects as well.

350
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:52,850
Thanks for your interest and see you next time.
