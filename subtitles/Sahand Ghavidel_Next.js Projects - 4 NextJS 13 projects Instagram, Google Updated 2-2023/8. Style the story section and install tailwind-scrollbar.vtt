1
00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:07.810
All right.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:17.420
In the last section, we have populated the users using many fake hair touches.

3
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.510
As you can see, now we have.

4
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:28.780
And different images and different user names that are populated randomly.

5
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:36.250
If you refresh the page, if you turn on the server and ponder on death.

6
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.390
And then we wait for the server to be.

7
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.690
On.

8
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.690
OK, the service started.

9
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:56.680
So refresh the page now you should see new images and new usernames.

10
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:08.080
All right, in this section, we are going to style this story section based on our final version of

11
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.770
the project.

12
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.530
You can see we have a.

13
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:26.940
Well, let me zoom a little bit, each image has a border wide border and also a red border around it

14
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.550
showing this story.

15
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:39.620
The usernames is limited, and if the user names was too long, it gets three dots at the end or in

16
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.010
other words, we can say they are truncated.

17
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.030
And then.

18
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.670
The background color of this story section is white.

19
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.650
It has some border as well.

20
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.960
So let's start a styling.

21
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:08.740
From this story touches in this story that is inside the image tag, the attack class name.

22
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:21.000
And first, we just change the height to be 14, so make it smaller.

23
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:32.810
And we make it round by just using rounded and rounded.

24
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.010
I want to be full.

25
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.500
So we just say rounded for we can see here.

26
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.280
Let me zoom here as well.

27
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.290
You can see better.

28
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.430
The changes.

29
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.020
All right.

30
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.000
Next.

31
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:59.610
We add that the border divide border first is just by using using it padding of one and a half.

32
00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.150
Pixels.

33
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:16.750
We just at something around there, and now if we add to the border of red, we can see the white font

34
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:17.920
around the image.

35
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.670
And as soon as I did the border, you can see that.

36
00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.330
There is a border around it, but the border is gray.

37
00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.800
This change it to red.

38
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.140
And.

39
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.680
Five hundred.

40
00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.670
So this side of the border is zero by default.

41
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.770
We just change the border to be too.

42
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.060
So now you can see it better.

43
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.910
All right, and then let's add some hover effect.

44
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.820
First, we change, add the curse of Pointer.

45
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.340
So when we hover over the.

46
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:10.120
This story, the user, we can't see a pointing hand.

47
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:20.280
Let's change the hover effect to be a big change this scale.

48
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:26.730
Two hundred and ten percent or just 10 percent extra.

49
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:34.740
The default is 100 percent, which is one hundred and ten minutes, 10 percent extra, you can see here,

50
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.950
but it's very sharp.

51
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:47.430
Let's make it a little bit smaller by adding transition on the transform property, which has the scale

52
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.770
trance form.

53
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:58.280
And we make it to be 200 milliseconds by adjusting duration.

54
00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.010
Two hundred.

55
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.700
Now we have a small.

56
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:10.970
Uh, hover fact.

57
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.770
Let's make it is our.

58
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:13.520
So.

59
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.560
So it goes fast and then goes back a slower.

60
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.290
That's the style, the text, they use their name.

61
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.020
It's decreased the size, a lot of it.

62
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.190
So the text should be.

63
00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.770
We just changed the class name.

64
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:54.930
The techs want to make it a small joysticks extra small excess for extra small.

65
00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:02.370
And then we want the width to be 14 so we can truncate the extra line.

66
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:11.270
So we just say, Kate, when we have more than four months, so this user was bigger than.

67
00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:13.540
14.

68
00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.130
So it's truncated.

69
00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.130
All right, now, everything is OK here.

70
00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:22.020
And the.

71
00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:31.200
We just need to his story is at a Flexbox to be bringing them everything next to each other.

72
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:35.730
So we go to stories that yes.

73
00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:36.750
And.

74
00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.470
Just in this thing that covers this stories that map.

75
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:52.090
We had a class name and we just changed the Flex display flags, so everything comes next to each other.

76
00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:54.870
The outer space between the.

77
00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:10.170
The images by just saying a basics to it's like marching and then we have padding six to push everything

78
00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:11.580
to the center a little bit.

79
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:25.320
Then we have background white, so we make the make it white and we have some marching at the top like

80
00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:25.770
eight.

81
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:33.180
So if I zoom a little bit, we can see the marching at the top at the border as well.

82
00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.560
So we make the border gray.

83
00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.040
200.

84
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:52.370
And we is just say border, so we have border one actually in default border means one pixel border

85
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:53.870
border with one pixel.

86
00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:05.270
So now it's very nice, but it's actually it's going over our page.

87
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:13.610
But we want it to be like a scrollable and finish just here, and the extra B is cruel.

88
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:22.550
For doing that, we just need to act over flow.

89
00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:26.530
Eggs.

90
00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:28.970
It's cruel.

91
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:31.450
No.

92
00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.470
Instead of going outside, we have a scroll here.

93
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.930
So we can go right and left.

94
00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.320
And let's, uh, in a bigger size.

95
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.000
No, it's full size.

96
00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:51.700
Let's add some uh.

97
00:08:54.380 --> 00:09:02.270
Make it rounded as well, because later we want to put it in the middle, we don't want it to be across

98
00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:07.610
all the websites, so we just say rounded seem to have a rounded border.

99
00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:11.270
You cannot see it yet, but when we have a.

100
00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:20.440
The when we put it inside a little bit, we can see the border into the bigger size.

101
00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:29.820
All right, so and then for is, if you go to inside the official website of Instagram, we don't have

102
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:33.180
this is cruel, but actually we kind of scroll it.

103
00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:34.800
We don't.

104
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.030
We don't have this one.

105
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:45.750
In order to remove this, the scroll bar, we can use a package called, Yeah, tailwind a scroll bar.

106
00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.200
We just need to search.

107
00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:55.690
On Google Tailwind as cruel.

108
00:09:58.940 --> 00:09:59.420
Bar.

109
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.220
Here we have an npm package, Tillmann Escrow Bar.

110
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.990
So we call, we click on this.

111
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:18.360
And we can stop it using yarn or npm install it, just copied this line of code.

112
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.830
We stopped the server and we paste the link.

113
00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:29.240
The next thing we need to do is add this plug in to the plug ins.

114
00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:35.500
If you remember, we did this phone for children's services forums, so we just copy this.

115
00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:37.600
This require.

116
00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:45.740
And we go to telling that conflict that this and the added.

117
00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:48.270
Just here.

118
00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:53.880
So now we have to requires forms and a school.

119
00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:57.290
Now we start a server.

120
00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:03.200
So now I'll show you how to remove this scrollbar easily.

121
00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:13.640
So inside this story, such as just here, we can add now a scroll bar.

122
00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:19.520
As you can see, too many new options are added for a Skirboll because of this package.

123
00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:21.800
We just choose a scroll bar.

124
00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:22.160
None.

125
00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:26.930
And in a second, we shouldn't see.

126
00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:29.330
I would just let me refresh the page.

127
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:35.610
Yeah, we don't see any school about animal baths using shift and a scroll bar.

128
00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:39.860
What we can do is we can scroll on the exercise.

129
00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:46.610
If you and a computer, if you are in the mobile, you can use the Touch Bar to go right and left.

130
00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:53.750
Yeah, that was it for this story.

131
00:11:54.340 --> 00:12:04.600
Uh, it started off of this story part, let's uh and everything to get hot and we can go to the next

132
00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:05.100
video.

133
00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:08.120
So we just say get commands

134
00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:12.770
and the message would be.

135
00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:17.000
His style, the.

136
00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:19.320
PC, sorry.

137
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:26.260
S. And and so.

138
00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:29.980
Tailwind.

139
00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:35.050
Scrollbar.

140
00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:46.200
We just push it to get off by using get push ups.

141
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:50.580
Let's go to our top.

142
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:57.170
Refresh the page, and we see now we have eight comments already.

143
00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.630
So stylish story, fiction and tall tale run.

144
00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:14.070
Scrollbar, so you see that in stories that we added Flex and also remove the scrollbar.

145
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:24.090
And in the story that, yes, we make it a smaller, rounded and we added the reporter with the animation

146
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:26.460
using transition.

147
00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:35.260
Yeah, we installed the package called Tillmann Scrollbar, and we added as a plugin inside tailwind

148
00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:36.000
that config.

149
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:36.600
That is.

150
00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:40.740
Yeah, that was it for our for this section.

151
00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:45.900
In the next section, we're going to start with the post section.

152
00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.870
So see you in the next section.
