1
00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:07.720
All right.

2
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.140
In the last section we have installed next year, 13.

3
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.100
In this section, we're going to install 12 and CSS.

4
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:21.460
But before installing the 12 CSS, I would like to change the fabric on of this project.

5
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.480
So if you start a server again using NPM run diff.

6
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.310
And we opened the local 3000.

7
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.470
I think it's already open so we can just.

8
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.140
As refresh the page here.

9
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:51.260
We see that our website doesn't have any fabric on or they should show us the fabric for the versal.

10
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.000
So we want to create a fabric.

11
00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.320
And I want to show you a website for finding the Google fabric icon.

12
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.560
Their website is called The Free.

13
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.950
SVG.

14
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:17.000
SVG is kind of format for the images that can scale without reducing its quality.

15
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.570
So there is a website called Free SPG dot org.

16
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:29.370
If you click on this one and here in the search bar we can search for Google and.

17
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:37.330
In the search result, we can just click on the Google icon, which is an SVG icon.

18
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.700
Now we can download this widget by clicking on the download SBT icon.

19
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:52.800
So here we can just drag the icon that is downloaded, bring it to our Visual Studio code.

20
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.320
First, we need to open the Explorer section using Contour B.

21
00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.240
So let me open it.

22
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.290
This one first.

23
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.740
So we have the Explorer here.

24
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.990
Let's drag it again, bring it here, and we put it inside the public folder.

25
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.080
I just want to change the name of this file to Abercarn.

26
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.510
And inside the head, the G6.

27
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:31.360
We just changed this fabric on IKO to five icon dot SVG and we can just get rid of the previous file

28
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.630
and also these icons that we have here.

29
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.320
Now if you look at our website here, this is the localhost 3000.

30
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.440
You can see the five icon is the Google icon.

31
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.010
So now it's time to install tailwind CSS.

32
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.350
So we just go back to Google and we search for Tailwind CSIS.

33
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.680
And in the search result, we click on tailwind.

34
00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.170
CSIS that com.

35
00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.140
So here you can just click on the Get Started button.

36
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:15.850
And as we are using 12 and CSS and it's as we are using next year and next year is an is a framework.

37
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.990
So we click here in the installation tab on the framework guide.

38
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.950
And here we click on the next JS icon.

39
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:32.080
So as you can see, this is the setting up, Taylor says, in next year's project.

40
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.990
There are a couple of steps.

41
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:42.400
The first step is to create our project, which we have already done by using Create Next App.

42
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:49.270
The next step is to install tailwind CSS and it's initialize it.

43
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.480
So we need to first copy this install.

44
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:59.340
Code, which is going to install CSS, post, CSS and auto prefix for.

45
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.900
So we're going to come back here inside our visual city code.

46
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:10.260
We can stop the server using contrast, see y and we can just paste code here.

47
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:21.290
And after the installing these three packages, we need to come back and initialize table six, which

48
00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:29.030
is going to create some files, the config files inside our Explorer section.

49
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.660
So we wait for the installation to be completed.

50
00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.540
And it's very fast.

51
00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.480
And then let me clear here.

52
00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:45.860
After the installation, we're going to paste the initialization of Taylor CSS.

53
00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:53.680
This is going to create some files here, which is processes that config that is and Telvin that conflicts

54
00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.440
us.

55
00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:01.970
And if you look at the documentation again, in order to use it, we need to configure our template

56
00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:09.080
paths in next year's piece as we are using App directory and also as RC folder.

57
00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.600
We need to add these folders inside the Tillman that conflicts us.

58
00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.190
So I'm going to copy all these things inside the tail when that conflict.

59
00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:27.500
JS We can come back to the Visual Studio code and we go inside the Telvin config JJ's.

60
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:38.340
And we're going to delete everything and paste the new code that is having the app directory and also

61
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.750
the CRC directory.

62
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:54.640
No terminal system is able to scan all the files with the extension tests, JST JS, X and RTS X inside

63
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.190
all these folders that is here.

64
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:07.370
And they're going to scan all the classes and convert the classes to CSS syntax for us automatically.

65
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.960
So after that, we have another step.

66
00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.970
The next step is to add the relevant directives to our CSS.

67
00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.160
We have a global CSS file.

68
00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:28.230
We need to add these three lines of codes which is going to add the basic tailwind config and styling

69
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.340
to our base components and utilities.

70
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:38.700
So we're going to copy this and we go back to Visual Studio Code and we go to global CSS, which is

71
00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.770
in the app directory.

72
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.980
Are we going to paste this one here?

73
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:54.420
Now if we start the server again using NPN run dev, we just can use the up arrow.

74
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.410
To find it.

75
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.020
So I'm going to.

76
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:09.110
So we just use empty and run this and we go back to our website.

77
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:17.330
And if you now refresh the page, you see that the the home is going to be in a different font, which

78
00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.900
is the font that Tillman CSS uses.

79
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.510
So as you can see now, we are using tail versus CSS.

80
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:30.920
So in order to be sure that you see us is working, you can see that font is different.

81
00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:35.480
And also we can just show you how to use certain CSS.

82
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.970
In a very quick example.

83
00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:46.790
If you go to the page that G6 inside the app directory and bring the VTS code on the left side so we

84
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:49.010
can see the changes in real time.

85
00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:52.640
So I'm going to close the Explorer section using Contour B.

86
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:55.690
So let me increase this size.

87
00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:04.510
So here inside the diff, if we for example, if want to change the color of this text, we can just

88
00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:08.680
just write down text and we just say, for example, red.

89
00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:10.120
And

90
00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:21.250
if we just wait, we get some suggestion from the Tilman CSS IntelliSense extension, which is showing

91
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:24.010
us the different red colors here.

92
00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:28.600
So for example, if I choose text red 600 we get.

93
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:30.980
This red color.

94
00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.440
So if I remove the.

95
00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.300
Zoom level here.

96
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:46.780
You can also increase the size of the text by just saying text, for example, 3xl, And if you want

97
00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:50.620
to know what three XL means, you just need to.

98
00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:55.730
Use counter space at the end of the code and it shows the font.

99
00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:58.260
Font detail.

100
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:11.120
For example, text three Excel is font size 1.875 rem, which is 30 pixels and line height 36 pixel.

101
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:18.780
So any, any time you don't understand a table with CSS class, you just use contour space.

102
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:23.100
For example, here you get the definition for this class.

103
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:30.360
So the tell us this is going to add these classes, these classes, and this syntax is for us automatically.

104
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:32.100
All right.

105
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:35.460
That was it for installing the tail one CSS.

106
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:43.440
Let's add this one to the GitHub the second time we are using and we want to add our command to the

107
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.400
GitHub, we don't need to stop the server and do it manually.

108
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:54.300
We can use alter shift G to open the source control.

109
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:56.940
For the Visual Studio Code.

110
00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.010
And here you can see all the changes that we have done.

111
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:03.720
For example, we have modified these two files.

112
00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:05.230
We have.

113
00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:09.700
I think this is for Entourage.

114
00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:13.330
So this is these new files are created.

115
00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.750
These files are deleted.

116
00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:20.140
As you can see, it has a delete and these files are modified.

117
00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:26.890
So if you add if you want to add all the changes, you just click here on the plus side.

118
00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:36.070
And here at the top, you just write down your message as a comment, which is, for example, install

119
00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:46.660
tailwind, CSS, and you can click here to commit it or you can just click on this arrow icon and click

120
00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:53.590
on Commit and Push at the same time, which is going to push all the changes inside the GitHub that

121
00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:54.040
we have.

122
00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:58.060
And we could if you go back to our GitHub repository.

123
00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.540
We just click here to see the.

124
00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.310
All the changes.

125
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:11.330
Now we see that we have three commands, and if you click here, we see that the the newest commit is

126
00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.250
installed tailwind CSS.

127
00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.930
Let's review what we have done inside this section.

128
00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:24.340
So inside the J, you can see we have installed three packages related to Taylor.

129
00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:30.590
CSS called out of prefix for post CSS and Taylor CSS.

130
00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:39.980
Then inside the proposed CSIS, that conflict that is this file is created automatically by Taylor and

131
00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:40.910
CSIS.

132
00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:43.450
And then we have.

133
00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.130
Deleted.

134
00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.100
As you can see, went to the bin.

135
00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:58.270
So we we have deleted a file on that IQ icon, but we have added a new icon called Fabric on SVG.

136
00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:00.160
Then.

137
00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:11.340
Uh, we have deleted three SVG files here and also inside the globals that CSS, we have added these

138
00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:12.900
three lines of code.

139
00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:22.330
We have changed the fabric on address inside the G6 and inside the page.

140
00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:23.380
The G6.

141
00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:28.690
We have added some example related to tail and CSS.

142
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:32.510
And finally inside the Telvin that conflicts.

143
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:39.370
As we have updated this file to include the RC and app directories.

144
00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:46.540
All right, that was it for installing the tailwind CSS for our project.

145
00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:51.940
So in the next section, we're going to work on the header section of our project.

146
00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:58.380
I'm going to show you how we can have a header and add it to the home page.

147
00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:00.160
So see in the next section.
