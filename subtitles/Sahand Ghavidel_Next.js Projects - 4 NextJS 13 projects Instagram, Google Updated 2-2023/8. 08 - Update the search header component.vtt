1
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:07.660
All right.

2
00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:14.710
So in the last section, we have completed the creation of two pages, image and web.

3
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.250
And also, we have created this search header component.

4
00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.770
In this section, we're going to complete this search header component.

5
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.320
We're going to create this logo.

6
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.350
And the right side and the search box, because this is a client side component, we're going to create

7
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.570
it in a separate section.

8
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.940
So I'm going to show you how to you want to create this one.

9
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.630
So this is going to be three parts.

10
00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.430
So we're going to have a header component here at the top.

11
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.960
Heather.

12
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.800
Tagg.

13
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.950
Let me show you.

14
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.350
So we have a header tag at the top, and then we have three separate places.

15
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.600
One is this logo.

16
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.370
Then we have this

17
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.410
input which is going to be in this size.

18
00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:17.590
And also later we're going to add this one at the end, which is a div, including two icons and a button.

19
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.350
So let's go back to Visual Studio Code and we start doing that.

20
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.000
So we need to go to search header dot G6.

21
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:38.890
Let me close all of them so we know and then we go to Explorer section, we go to SRI folder App Directory

22
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:46.000
and then we go to search and here we go to we have just created the layout.

23
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.390
But the things you want to do is this components called.

24
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.280
Uh, search header.

25
00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.450
So we had home header.

26
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:05.340
Now we have search header, which is a little bit different because it has a logo on the left side and

27
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.080
the input in the middle.

28
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.050
So first things first, I want to change the div to a header tag.

29
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.490
So this is good for the SEO purposes.

30
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.890
And here inside this one, we're going to have a div.

31
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.140
The reason we want to have a div, I want to show you why we want to have extra div inside the header

32
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:44.290
because these two sections, the options are inside the header, but they are in a different role.

33
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:52.750
So we need to have it there one day for the top and one day for the bottom and one header tag that is

34
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.510
covering all of that.

35
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.550
So we're going to have an extra div here.

36
00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.210
And inside this we're going to have three things.

37
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.100
First, a link tag going to showing that image.

38
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.120
So I'm going to add a link SAC, which is coming from the next first slash link.

39
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:16.800
The link tag.

40
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.260
Inside the link tag, we're going to have the image.

41
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.280
But first thing first, I want to add the edge shift so we don't get an error.

42
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:32.610
So the Edge strip is going to be the home page forward slash and the link tag is going to have an image

43
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:33.450
tag.

44
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.470
So this is coming from the next DJs as well.

45
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.790
This is going to coming from the next photo slash image.

46
00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.830
Let me close this and let's fix this one.

47
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.230
So the width of this image is going to be.

48
00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:08.670
Hundred and 20 under 20 pixels and height is going to be.

49
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:17.590
40.

50
00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.650
And

51
00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.930
the CRC for this one.

52
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.810
Is going to be the same as CRC that we have used for the home search.

53
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:43.050
If you remember, we in the home search, we have the mystery inside the app directory, inside the

54
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:49.640
page that GSA we have, we have the image of the Google Day.

55
00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.570
We have we can use the same.

56
00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.220
One here, so I'm going to copy the link.

57
00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.040
So I'm going to come back to home search.

58
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:07.290
I'm going to sorry, not home search this search header and inside the CRC.

59
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.880
I'm going to paste that link.

60
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.990
So let's see that we can see it inside our website.

61
00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.410
Okay.

62
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.070
Now we see the image, the Google image.

63
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:21.260
The, uh.

64
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.500
Let's just, uh.

65
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.610
Let's see that.

66
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.630
Looks.

67
00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:27.230
Okay.

68
00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.510
So after this logo we're going to have.

69
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:40.950
It did, including the search.

70
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.980
Box component, which we are going to create now.

71
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:55.270
So we go to components folder and we create another component called Search.

72
00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:59.590
Box.

73
00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:04.790
The TSX.

74
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:13.670
And this is going to be a big functional component saying search box.

75
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.100
And we need to just import it here.

76
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.740
Just use the contrast base to import it.

77
00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.960
So let me close this on a little bit.

78
00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.770
Now we should see the search box here as well.

79
00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.990
Let me zoom it so you can see it better.

80
00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:32.760
So we have the logo.

81
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.440
We have the search box.

82
00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.940
After the search with search box is going to be completed in the next section.

83
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:49.980
But just let me make the right side as well, which is going to be a div, including two icons and a

84
00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:50.740
button.

85
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:57.720
So the icons we want to use now let's go to the React Icons website.

86
00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:59.520
Again.

87
00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:06.150
So the y course I want to use is the first one is sitting.

88
00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:12.790
Sitting and it's called sitting three lines.

89
00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:17.860
Three.

90
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:20.080
Line.

91
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:23.780
So.

92
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.640
Let me search for it.

93
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.360
So it's called search sitting three lines.

94
00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.650
Let me find it here.

95
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.570
Or sittings through life.

96
00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:44.870
It said things.

97
00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:45.630
Three.

98
00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:46.190
Yeah.

99
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:46.560
Okay.

100
00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.610
So it's called setting tree line.

101
00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:53.940
So we're going to copy this one.

102
00:07:55.550 --> 00:08:05.870
We go back to our website and we just put it as a component tag and we need to import it as well, which

103
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:12.740
is we can simply import that one from React Icons forward slash.

104
00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:14.770
Ah, I.

105
00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:22.480
So we can see it now inside our website, probably, yes.

106
00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:26.710
This icon, the next icon I want to add.

107
00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.270
So before.

108
00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:42.150
I want it just because it has the same class of the the next one.

109
00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:49.380
We can just use the tailwind CSS custom class to add it later.

110
00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:53.370
So let's add the next icon as well, which is.

111
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:56.300
Great icon.

112
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:59.130
So I'm just going to search for great.

113
00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:03.650
And the one I want to use is great dots.

114
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:06.750
This one.

115
00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:12.080
So if we just put it here.

116
00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.650
And this is going to come from.

117
00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:34.940
React icons forward slash t p not t are close enough so tb great darts from react icons for slash TB.

118
00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:40.340
So let's see that we can see it here.

119
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:40.930
All right.

120
00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:48.830
So both of them, because they have the same styling, I'm going to use the table scissors, custom

121
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:51.890
styling to style it first thing first.

122
00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:58.100
Let's add the button as well here and just complete this.

123
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.360
H HTML part.

124
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:14.340
So we're going to have a button which is going to say sign and and let's let's now bring the website

125
00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:17.490
on the right side so we can see the changes here.

126
00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.760
And let's bring this one on the left side.

127
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:26.960
Let's close this left section so we have more space.

128
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:28.890
Let's decrease the zone level.

129
00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:34.760
So let's style this tool buttons first.

130
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:45.440
So I'm going to just add a class name by saying, for example, header.

131
00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:48.350
I can't.

132
00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:55.860
So let's copy this one and add it to the other one as well.

133
00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:02.640
So now we can just create the custom 12 and CSS class for this one.

134
00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:07.620
So I'm going to go to.

135
00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:22.850
Close that CSIS and inside the Global SAT CSIS, I'm going to add this custom one, which is Heather.

136
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:27.740
Dash icon.

137
00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.450
It was icon or icons.

138
00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:38.390
Yes.

139
00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:43.150
And we're going to apply the changes.

140
00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:52.100
So the classes we need to add is first thing first.

141
00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:53.900
We want to change the.

142
00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:58.080
Background color.

143
00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:00.840
So the background color.

144
00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.570
First we make a trance.

145
00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:03.780
Parents.

146
00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:15.490
And then when we hover over it, I want to change the background color to be.

147
00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:22.930
So let's see.

148
00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:28.360
So the background color is going to be gray.

149
00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:29.760
200.

150
00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:39.330
And then we're going to have a padding of two.

151
00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:43.750
We're going to change the text size to be.

152
00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:58.520
For Excel, which we make it rounded full to be a circle and we add a cursor to be pointer.

153
00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:00.920
So when we hover over, it's all over it.

154
00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.570
We see a pointing hand.

155
00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.010
So let's see that that is enough or not.

156
00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.780
I think death is fine.

157
00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.670
So for both of them, we use the same class.

158
00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:21.770
So let's style the button now.

159
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:24.780
So let me close the global set CSS.

160
00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:32.410
And for the button, I'm going to add some class name.

161
00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:39.790
The first class I want to add is background color to be blue 500.

162
00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:46.150
We set the text to be white.

163
00:13:54.520 --> 00:14:02.440
Dan, We added padding in the x axis of six and padding in the Y axis of two.

164
00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:07.300
We set the font to be medium.

165
00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:12.710
And we make it around it.

166
00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:22.130
Pronged IT media as well.

167
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:32.390
And when we hover over it, we want to change the brightness to be 105.

168
00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:41.520
Brightness.

169
00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:54.940
To be 105.

170
00:14:58.490 --> 00:14:58.720
Yeah.

171
00:14:59.400 --> 00:14:59.610
Yeah.

172
00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:01.200
You see the brightness?

173
00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:04.890
And we want to have a shadow as well.

174
00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:08.610
And so when we hover over it, we want to have a shadow

175
00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:11.760
medium.

176
00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.930
And we want to just add some transition.

177
00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:20.140
We can change.

178
00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.670
Add the transition to everything like transition all.

179
00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:27.620
So we have a transition for the brightness and the shadow.

180
00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:38.230
So we have completed the this to a styling and the button.

181
00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:45.910
So the things we want to do now, we want to bring them in next to each other so that we don't want

182
00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:47.680
them to be on top of each other.

183
00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:53.320
So what we do now is to.

184
00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:56.130
Create the.

185
00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:03.130
At the top inside this div that we have.

186
00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.180
First thing first, I want to keep it always at a top.

187
00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:13.890
So I want to change, to change it, to be sticky at the top.

188
00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:21.270
So we just say sticky top zero and we change the background color to be white.

189
00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:31.740
And for the dev that we have here, we're going to change the display to flex and we set the width to

190
00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:35.370
be full with the padding of six.

191
00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:39.550
This is going to push it a little bit inside.

192
00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:51.700
And the other things we want to do is to create the items center and justify between.

193
00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:56.920
So this is going to have a space between them.

194
00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:00.340
And bring them next to each other vertically.

195
00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:02.560
So this is similar to like this.

196
00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:06.410
But as you can see, we have a space between each part.

197
00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:08.920
The search box, this one and this one.

198
00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:12.700
But I want the search box to have all this space here.

199
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:16.410
So we can do simple things.

200
00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:19.230
We can go to this search box in the div.

201
00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:22.720
We can change the flex to be one.

202
00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:27.610
But this is going to take all this space until here.

203
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:28.720
Okay.

204
00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:37.540
Now, these buttons actually are next are not next to each other on top of each other.

205
00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:46.010
For the buttons in this step, we're going to change the first thing first bit.

206
00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:53.110
I don't want to see them in the mobile size because when we have a smaller screen, this is kind of

207
00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:55.090
messy if you have all of them.

208
00:17:55.090 --> 00:18:00.730
So I'm just going to make it hidden when they're in the mobile size.

209
00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:05.700
Let me decrease the zoom level.

210
00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:10.910
So this is the normal things you see in a mobile size.

211
00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:17.620
We don't see them, but in the in the in the tablet size, I don't want to see them too.

212
00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:27.550
But in the medium size and above above the tablet, we can just change the line flex so we can see them

213
00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:29.740
in the big screen.

214
00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:32.680
But in the small screen we don't see them.

215
00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:34.700
Okay.

216
00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:41.120
And then I want them to be to have a space between them.

217
00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:48.080
So we just change the space X to to have some space and.

218
00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:51.810
Let's see.

219
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:53.250
Okay.

220
00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.570
I think we should see the space between them.

221
00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:03.820
For the button.

222
00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:05.100
We don't have a space.

223
00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:08.650
Let me just add some space here to.

224
00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:18.590
Okay, so here we have padding and.

225
00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:30.850
For the button, we can simply add some marching left of two forks up.

226
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:35.290
Could.

227
00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:46.200
So this is okay in the mobile, medium size and less.

228
00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:49.300
We see we don't see the icons.

229
00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:50.540
Okay.

230
00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:51.310
That's it.

231
00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:54.870
So the other things we want to add is these options here.

232
00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:59.020
So just I want to create this component first.

233
00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:10.720
So here at the bottom of this div above the closing header tag, we're going to create this option.

234
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:13.690
So we're going to call it search.

235
00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:17.470
Heather.

236
00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:23.250
Search for other options.

237
00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:29.810
Okay.

238
00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:32.210
And then we're going to create this component.

239
00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:38.690
So I'm going to copy the text, open the Explorer section, and inside the component, I'm going to

240
00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:43.630
create that file, which is the name with the JSX.

241
00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:49.280
So I'm going to use the RFC to create a React functional component.

242
00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:57.350
And inside the search header, I'm going to import it using control space here.

243
00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:03.710
So now we should see it in our website search header option.

244
00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.750
So that was it for now.

245
00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:14.240
In the next section, we're going to complete this search box in one section and then the other section

246
00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:16.970
we're going to create this search header option.

247
00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:23.960
So let's add everything to GitHub using contour shift key, we add everything using this plus icon,

248
00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:33.650
and then we can create a message which is going to be create or update.

249
00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:40.410
Steer search.

250
00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:46.080
Header component.

251
00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:52.790
Okay, let's push it, commit and push it to GitHub.

252
00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.130
And let's review what we have done inside the GitHub.

253
00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:59.160
So we go back to the home page.

254
00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:02.960
Now we have eight commits in our GitHub repository.

255
00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:08.690
The last one is updated search header component.

256
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:10.430
And the.

257
00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:15.480
As you can see, inside a global search.

258
00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:18.100
Yes, we have added a new.

259
00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:21.640
A costume class.

260
00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:25.750
Sing a bit the name header, dash icon.

261
00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:32.320
And then we have created a component called Search Box, which is going to be completed in the next

262
00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.070
section.

263
00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:36.550
Then we have a search header dot gsx.

264
00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:40.300
We have imported couple of.

265
00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:42.740
Things like image and Link.

266
00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:50.570
From next we have imported search box two icons from React Icons and also the search header options

267
00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:51.500
component.

268
00:22:53.660 --> 00:23:01.700
We have added everything inside the header tag which is going to be sticky at a top and we have a div

269
00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:11.750
here which is going to be covering the top section and then the bottom section which is going to be

270
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:13.490
a search header option.

271
00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:20.850
Then we have added a logo by adding an image tag inside a link tag.

272
00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:29.130
Then we have added the search box to icons and finally a button saying Sign it.

273
00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:35.580
Then also we have created the search header option as well so we can have it inside this header, but

274
00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:39.330
we're going to complete it in the next and following sections.

275
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:48.330
So that was it for creating the and completing and updating the header is header of the search pages.

276
00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:54.990
And the next section, we're going to complete this search box, which is going to be a client side

277
00:23:54.990 --> 00:24:04.200
component because we are going to add some unchanged event listener and click submission and submit

278
00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:05.240
event list.

279
00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:14.010
And then also we need to add some we need to get the data from the search term using some hooks.

280
00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:19.980
So see you in the next section for this part of our project.
