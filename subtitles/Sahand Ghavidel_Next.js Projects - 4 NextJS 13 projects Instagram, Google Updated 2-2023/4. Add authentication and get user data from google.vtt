00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:16.410
All right, in the last section, we have completed the Heather part, except with the user image and

2
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.730
authentication in this section, we're going to complete this part.

3
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.080
If you look at the final version of the project here.

4
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.040
We have an image that is coming from the Google.

5
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.500
Authentication.

6
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:41.280
With this hovering effect, and if you click on the image, we are going to sign out and instead of

7
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:48.960
the image, we see a button saying sign in when we click on Sign In.

8
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:59.190
We are going to redirect to a pay to a page with this address off signing, which we are going to create

9
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.260
in this section.

10
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.400
In this page, we have the Google.

11
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.840
Logo, a text and also a button saying sign in with Google.

12
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.560
If you click on this button.

13
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.730
We are going to redirect to accounts that Google.

14
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.240
And Google is going to ask us.

15
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.330
To choose an account so we can choose any icons.

16
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.780
Now let me choose this one code with the hand.

17
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.240
Just look at the image.

18
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.580
The background is yellow.

19
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:50.620
So as soon as we did well, we have this image instead of the previous one, and we are authenticated.

20
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.530
So this image is also coming from Google as well.

21
00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:02.590
The data in order to do the authentication, we are going to use a package which is created for next

22
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.630
year and it's called next off.

23
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.980
So if we search for this next of.

24
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.850
Let me search it here.

25
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.680
I just stood here, we just searched next.

26
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.560
Off

27
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:35.300
in the search results, we have to click on next dash off 30th dot org.

28
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:38.660
So we click here.

29
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:49.940
This is actually a very powerful stuff, and it's created exclusively for next year.

30
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.670
You can play with the live demo with the there.

31
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.810
They show you how it works.

32
00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:04.150
But let's go to get started and we installed that in order to install this.

33
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.910
The.

34
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.030
Package, you're going to use the version for we need to go to.

35
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.190
Upgrade guide.

36
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.510
Version four.

37
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.890
And.

38
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.670
If you're using NPN, you need to you need to use this line of code or you don't.

39
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.530
You need to use this.

40
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:32.970
I'm going, I'm going to use the NPN, so I copy this line of command.

41
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:38.580
I go back to the Visual Studio code and paste it inside the terminal.

42
00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.470
So this is going to take a few seconds to finish.

43
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.550
So in the meantime, we got to get getting it started again.

44
00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:00.170
And as you can see, they said we need to add an API raft.

45
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:09.310
So then in next years, there is a folder called API and Blueprint, because this is internal API.

46
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:19.620
Up next, yes, this is kind of like a backhand or exclusive for next year, which is the good things

47
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:27.180
about next year over react inside this API folder we need to create.

48
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.990
A folder called off.

49
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:39.320
And also a file called Bracket Dot Dot Dot next off 30th.

50
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:47.970
So we go back to Visual Studio code, as you can see, the installation has been completed.

51
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:57.810
We need to go to the Pages API and here we are going to create a folder called off.

52
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:07.770
And inside this folder, we're going to create a file called Dothat that leaks off.

53
00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.370
And we close the bracket and we just said that Jesus.

54
00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.720
We have a template here saying us where we can copy this template.

55
00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:28.880
I'm going to explain it, so we copy this and we're going to Visual Studio code and paste it here.

56
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:36.790
The things we do is we imported Knicks off from Knicks off.

57
00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:43.040
So which is a function, a functional component?

58
00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.380
Then we have to it according to our interest.

59
00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.560
We need to get the provider.

60
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.780
They have different types of provider like Facebook, GitHub, Google and etc..

61
00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.180
We're going to use the Google.

62
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.920
This template has the, uh, is created for GitHub.

63
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.900
So let me change the GitHub to Google.

64
00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:18.400
So let me increase the size, so here instead of GitHub provider, which is we just have to say Google

65
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.120
provider.

66
00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:25.450
And this is coming from next it off forward slash providers Google.

67
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:38.900
So here in the providers, we need to change this GitHub to to Google and instead of GitHub idea and

68
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.560
GitHub secret, we should have Google.

69
00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:44.860
Client I.D..

70
00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:58.750
And Google client secrets, I'll show you in a minute how we get these, uh.

71
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.860
Google client secret.

72
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:07.580
All right.

73
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:17.240
So this is coming from environmental variables, process that in be so because we need to protect this

74
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:17.540
one.

75
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:25.310
So the public people, when we are there visiting our website, they cannot have access to these IDs

76
00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:33.260
and secrets because they can use this, use it and finish our codes or misuse it.

77
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.410
So we need to hide these credentials.

78
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:45.880
So we need to create a file here in the roots called.

79
00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.700
Dot, EMV, dot local.

80
00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:56.370
And all the environmental variables is going to be inside this.

81
00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.070
So we have two environmental variables.

82
00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:00.660
One is Google.

83
00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:09.290
Client I.D. and we have Google.

84
00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.430
Client's secret.

85
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:16.720
All right.

86
00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:25.780
In order to get these things, these credentials, we need to go to Council Dot Google.

87
00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:33.650
So let's go to here and I'm going to search for a.

88
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.720
Sorry to cloud.

89
00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.000
We search for cloud.

90
00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:43.720
Google or Google Cloud?

91
00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:52.510
If you scroll down a little bit after the advertisement, we have clout that Google dot com.

92
00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.070
So we go there.

93
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:02.470
And, uh, make sure to sign in with a proper account.

94
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:08.220
This is my Gmail account I already signed in after signing.

95
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:11.300
Let's go to console.

96
00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:18.080
And after council, let me assume it a little bit.

97
00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:27.620
You can see that it's already chosen one of the projects that I practiced before it, that that is.

98
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.430
Cool, version two.

99
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:38.160
We need to create a new project for our self, and we call this project.

100
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:40.820
You cannot use the word Google.

101
00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:44.460
It's against Google's terms of service.

102
00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:48.070
So even they don't allow you to use the word Google.

103
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:50.520
So instead, I'm using the word go.

104
00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:58.950
So just bear in mind that you cannot use the word Google and we just say create.

105
00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:03.580
So now we have the project.

106
00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.190
It's creating now, so already finished.

107
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:09.260
So we go inside the Google.

108
00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:12.150
Three, version three.

109
00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:16.110
And here.

110
00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:25.420
We go to this menu navigation menu and we click on API and services and you go to credentials.

111
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:41.520
As you can see, we don't have any configuration or of consent, is it remember to configure your off

112
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.320
consent screen?

113
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:49.410
So first, we need to fix this one, so we click on configure a screen.

114
00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:54.030
This is the screen that people come and should sign in.

115
00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:03.470
Uh, we just need to choose external because we want everyone to use our application later.

116
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:05.330
So we say create.

117
00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.910
And the name of the application was just a.

118
00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:16.970
Google's version three, I choose my email.

119
00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:23.090
We don't need a logo, but if you want for your website, you can add a logo here.

120
00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:24.830
So it's going to appear here.

121
00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:34.400
When someone sign in and a domain just for now, we use that as tips.

122
00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:40.310
So, Rick, just let me copy this.

123
00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:43.670
Localhost three thousand.

124
00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:49.870
And the email address is my email address.

125
00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.090
So if we click save and continue.

126
00:11:58.510 --> 00:11:59.380
So this is.

127
00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:03.100
And nothing important is just to save and continue.

128
00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.980
And we don't need any test users, we just say.

129
00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.460
And finally, we go back to our dashboard.

130
00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:19.240
No, the pages, OK, we just go back to credentials and.

131
00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:25.040
Here on the top, now we create the credentials we click here.

132
00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:32.110
The credentials we want to create is of client I.D. because we want to sign in people.

133
00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:34.480
So if you choose this on.

134
00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:38.800
We choose that application tie.

135
00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:40.480
It's a VVIP application.

136
00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:47.330
And the name is just the Google version three.

137
00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:59.690
The origin is a localhost three thousand four redirect just for now, we put the localhost two thousand

138
00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:00.170
by later.

139
00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:01.340
We have to change this.

140
00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:09.980
I show you how in a second because we have to create our page and then if we fix this one we have,

141
00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:11.690
we can come back and fix this.

142
00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:13.460
So we create this.

143
00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:17.820
This is going to give us some credentials.

144
00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:22.230
Now we have we have your client ID and client's secret.

145
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:33.160
So we can copy the client I.D., we go back to the visual studio code into the dots EMV, that's local

146
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.050
and we paste it here.

147
00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:39.070
Then we come back.

148
00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.100
It's already gone, but you can get it.

149
00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:49.820
Here you can go here and get the client I.D. and classic secret here.

150
00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:52.430
So we copy this on for clients secret.

151
00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:55.780
And we go back to.

152
00:13:56.790 --> 00:14:01.470
But EMV that local and replaced with you after doing this.

153
00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:06.290
We can't keep continue for our next off.

154
00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:12.830
So we are you have a good client identified six so we can close this file.

155
00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:16.800
This one as well global thesis.

156
00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:20.420
So the next step?

157
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:24.730
Is to create the signing page.

158
00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:37.010
But we should tell the next of where is the address of the sign in place, if you remember for our final

159
00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:38.090
version here?

160
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:40.940
The actress was.

161
00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:46.420
If we sign in the address, first off signing.

162
00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.870
So we need to tell this next off this address.

163
00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:55.990
So inside the next hour, 30 years after the provider.

164
00:14:58.210 --> 00:14:59.530
We just need to.

165
00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:06.980
Put the pages and we call this page.

166
00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:18.010
We just say this is the case for sign-In, but this is a sign it is like a camel case and it's equal

167
00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:18.520
to.

168
00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:19.980
Off.

169
00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:30.570
Forward slash sign and but this is not camel case, just remember how to do this and out of forward

170
00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:31.590
slash here as well.

171
00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:40.770
This is this is going to be outside to provide.

172
00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:44.020
So here still, we are inside the floor.

173
00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:45.240
All right.

174
00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.070
So we have the pages.

175
00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:48.810
Now let's create the page.

176
00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:51.300
So we.

177
00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:54.200
Just the.

178
00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:01.180
Inside the pages, we create a folder called Off.

179
00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:06.690
This is inside pages, it's not inside the API, so this is different.

180
00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:11.310
And then we create a file called sign in.

181
00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.010
30TH.

182
00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:24.960
Let's create a reactor functional component here.

183
00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:35.250
And now we let's test that these website that existed or not, this can be a case if you can make it

184
00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:36.360
quick, if it's fine.

185
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:43.500
So now in our web site, let's first turn on the server.

186
00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:52.340
Using NPR around there, we go to our local host to tell the.

187
00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:13.110
So we should see the page here, if you add it forward slash or.

188
00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:17.220
Forward slash sign in.

189
00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:22.680
We should see the pitch now we're just saying sign it.

190
00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:26.330
Let's work on this page for now.

191
00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:29.920
Just create the logo and the signing.

192
00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:32.240
So.

193
00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:37.890
We can have the header at the top simply by just adding.

194
00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:43.230
Heather here was just say, Heather.

195
00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:50.030
We import this component, Heather, that is so important.

196
00:17:51.220 --> 00:18:01.600
Now, if we go back to our Web site, you see we have the header in this page simply, we added, then

197
00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.950
we need a couple of things we need to get.

198
00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:06.550
We can't get rid of this bill.

199
00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:07.510
We don't need that there.

200
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:09.090
And.

201
00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:16.920
We just create a death here and inside this there, we need to get the providers.

202
00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:23.710
As you remember, the next US is going to give us some providers like Google provider here.

203
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:27.670
So how do we get this information off the Google provider?

204
00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.820
The it's very simple.

205
00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:35.590
We need to just use if function to get.

206
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:38.180
These providers here.

207
00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:43.230
But we're not going to use a normal function.

208
00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:53.550
This is a server side rendering function that this is exclusive for the next two years, so we just

209
00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:55.080
need to write export.

210
00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:10.770
And export, this is a scene cryonics finance function and B it's called get server side.

211
00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:12.610
Props.

212
00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:22.160
This is exclusive for next year, and this is going to render this part, this function inside the server,

213
00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:25.770
not the user's browser.

214
00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:34.160
So this is going to helps the user to get the information faster because most of the servers are are

215
00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.990
very good and very, very fast.

216
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:47.300
So first, this function is going to execute inside the server and the user is going to see the page

217
00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:48.660
after this one comes.

218
00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:49.820
So it's very fast.

219
00:19:52.150 --> 00:20:00.340
So we just need to create this function, and this function is going to gives us the providers we asked

220
00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:07.480
for the providers from the function inside the next year next.

221
00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:17.110
So next off, next off provides us with a function called kit provider can see the suggestion.

222
00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:24.850
But this is going to be after a way because we want this to get these providers first and then we pass

223
00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:27.310
it to the client side.

224
00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:36.370
So how we get we pass it to the client side by just returning, it is a return it as it props.

225
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:42.260
So we just return it here and we call it props.

226
00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:49.390
And this is going to be the providers, the destruction.

227
00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:58.750
All right, so we get the gas providers here and we can achieve this profits at a top here in the client

228
00:20:58.750 --> 00:20:58.960
side.

229
00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:00.120
This is the client side.

230
00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:01.390
This is the server side.

231
00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:10.680
So we get the information in the server side and we pass it through a props to the client so we can

232
00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:16.820
get the props here, but let's structure it and we just get the providers.

233
00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:20.620
You get all the providers here.

234
00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:31.830
For why there's and we need to import this one and this is going to come from next off of we didn't

235
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:34.980
get the suggestion, so we need to import it manually.

236
00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:38.220
So this is going to be the import.

237
00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:41.770
Get providers.

238
00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:44.600
From.

239
00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:46.920
Next.

240
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.400
Off forward slash react.

241
00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:52.020
This is the address.

242
00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:04.070
So inside this debate, we're going to look through all the providers, we only have one providers,

243
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:10.940
but this is the procedure and this is going to help you later to add more providers this fall.

244
00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:18.860
So we're going to look through it using this to just say object.

245
00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:31.790
Objects that object to value because we want to get the values and we want to look through the providers.

246
00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:35.560
So we just provided that map.

247
00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:40.090
And this is going to gives us each provider.

248
00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:46.260
So if we just the.

249
00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:49.100
Returned directly.

250
00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:52.270
And Div here.

251
00:22:55.750 --> 00:23:03.010
And, you know, you just have to bear in mind if any time you use map, you should provide a key.

252
00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:12.850
Otherwise you get an error and maybe you don't get an error when you're doing it inside your development

253
00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:13.330
mode.

254
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:19.720
But in the production, when you're deploying it inside the bear, so you would definitely get an error.

255
00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:22.750
So we just add the key here.

256
00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:28.210
The key is going to be provider that name, which is always.

257
00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:36.250
Unique because we are getting, for example, Google Facebook Guitar, and the name is always unique.

258
00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:39.130
All right.

259
00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:43.220
So this is going to gives us.

260
00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:45.620
So let's get the image first.

261
00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:47.780
We add the Google image.

262
00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:57.740
We just add an image and the source will be, uh, we just search an image here for Google.

263
00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:03.100
The image.

264
00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:08.300
And this is fine, we just get the image from the Wikipedia.

265
00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:10.970
Just need to.

266
00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:13.910
Copy the image.

267
00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:14.650
Address.

268
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:17.360
And pasted here.

269
00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:24.630
Let's see.

270
00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:27.920
Yeah, we got the image here.

271
00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:30.050
This is the sign in page.

272
00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:32.310
All right.

273
00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:41.190
But this is kind of weird, the source.

274
00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:47.790
Check again.

275
00:24:56.790 --> 00:25:01.030
I hear we should copy not there, so we copy the image from here.

276
00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:05.010
Copy images here and be pasted.

277
00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:07.410
And this is the correct.

278
00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:11.940
That was a little bit weird, but it was showing the image.

279
00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:15.240
So this is the image we have.

280
00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:23.170
The alternative is Google logo.

281
00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:34.730
And later, we're going to style it first, let's finish this, uh, after this, we add a paragraph.

282
00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:40.200
And which is saying this website.

283
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:42.830
Is.

284
00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:46.510
Creative.

285
00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:56.230
For learning purposes, the reason we add this.

286
00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:07.460
The reason we add is because this is actually we're copying someone's website without any permission,

287
00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:15.290
so uh, but if you want to have a fair use, you shouldn't use it as a commercial.

288
00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:18.530
We just need to say this is for learning purposes.

289
00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:22.610
Otherwise maybe you get, uh, removed.

290
00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:25.830
Or anything's happened.

291
00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:32.190
So just for safety, you just add this one to your website, always.

292
00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:38.090
If you're doing a column like a Google on Instagram on, et cetera.

293
00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:41.690
So after this paragraph.

294
00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:54.140
We add a button, so we just say button and the buttons is going to say, sign in with Google, but

295
00:26:54.140 --> 00:27:00.980
we don't want to just write Google, we want to get this name from the provider.

296
00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:06.500
Wow, so we just need to write down this and we copy this one.

297
00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:13.080
The key here, we just provided that name, which is going to be a Google.

298
00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:14.010
All right.

299
00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.550
You see, now we have Google here.

300
00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:30.920
So now if you click here, we should redirect to Google, but uh.

301
00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:36.930
Let's see now we haven't finished yet, so.

302
00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:43.170
So the things we need to do is just to wrap everything inside our website with the.

303
00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:57.290
Provider as well, so, uh, you know, all the website is covered inside a file called Underline App

304
00:27:57.290 --> 00:27:57.950
that you use.

305
00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:05.990
If you go to this file, you see that anytime you have a request to the website is going to come from

306
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:07.640
this website and all that.

307
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.530
Even the solver here.

308
00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:14.600
So this is wrapping all the application and they call it my app.

309
00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:18.890
We have the similar things inside the reactor as well.

310
00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:23.360
And we call it after James and here we call it underline app that yes.

311
00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:33.080
So we need to wrap this application with the index off provider and we call it decision provider.

312
00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:40.370
So this system provider is going to make a decision based on your signing situation.

313
00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:46.280
If you are signing and you've got the token from the Google.

314
00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:54.230
So all your application has this create efficient so you can you are authenticated, basically.

315
00:28:55.280 --> 00:29:01.790
But if you find out you're going to be going to destroy that token, there is no solution.

316
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:09.380
So here we need to import something called solution provider with the capital.

317
00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:11.470
Session.

318
00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:16.480
Provider.

319
00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:20.110
And this is going to come from.

320
00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:34.060
Next off, forward slash react similar to one we did previously for providers, fish and provider here.

321
00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:37.270
And this is going to wrap the application.

322
00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:45.460
So here, instead of returning directly to component, we open a parenthesis here.

323
00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:49.780
It bring this one inside.

324
00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:55.980
All right.

325
00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:00.740
And we're going to cover this decision, right?

326
00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:07.460
So we're close to this one.

327
00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:12.450
And we bring this one to the center.

328
00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:15.680
Sorry about that.

329
00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:17.660
All right.

330
00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:28.160
But this is should have this session, so here with just this session is equal to session and this session

331
00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:30.230
is coming from the to here.

332
00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:38.230
So we're going to distract this structure, this, uh, page props, we call it.

333
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:40.940
This is going to give this decision.

334
00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:47.750
And also, if the page itself, the page prop.

335
00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:56.900
So instead of just saying the beach profits, you get the decision on Page four of us together, so

336
00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:58.160
we have both.

337
00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:06.320
And if this decision is true, all our application is authenticated and if it's false or they are not.

338
00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:12.710
So this is fine now, let's try it again here.

339
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:16.730
So we're going to this refresh the page.

340
00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:28.480
We didn't come here actually from the sign in, we came directly, actually, we have to go to our home

341
00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:36.730
page and here we should add a button call sign in and from that signing and when clearly lack the we

342
00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:38.800
have inside the final version.

343
00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:44.200
Inside the final version, if you go to the home page, actually.

344
00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:51.390
And when you click on signing, we don't go.

345
00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:57.990
Just to that off and sign it, we have a call back, you are a lifesaver.

346
00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:00.270
So if you need to create a callback, you are.

347
00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:09.910
So we and here when we click on Sign In with Google, we go to Google because Google needs this callback

348
00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:10.360
as well.

349
00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:11.650
All right.

350
00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:16.420
So let's create this button and other things as well.

351
00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:16.840
So.

352
00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:28.740
In our application, which is here, we only write down user here, but inside the user that yes, now

353
00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:30.530
we should have a signing.

354
00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:33.720
If someone is not authenticated.

355
00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:37.040
So here we need to get a few things.

356
00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:40.190
Let's remove this react.

357
00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:42.840
We need to import.

358
00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:46.780
Three things from next off.

359
00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:55.420
One is the U.S., because we want to get the decision, we want to be sure that someone is decision.

360
00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:56.680
Is it true or false?

361
00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:59.630
Because we want to be sure that someone is authenticated?

362
00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:06.220
Then we have something called sign and which is a building function for next off.

363
00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:10.210
And also we have something called find out.

364
00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:12.540
All right.

365
00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:18.660
So we have the signing sign out this the function we're going to use and we have.

366
00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:23.630
This is coming from the Knicks of Forest reacts.

367
00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:33.270
So we did a different OK.

368
00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:45.280
So in order to get the session here after the before they return, we create a constant which gives

369
00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:49.270
us the data from this.

370
00:33:51.550 --> 00:34:02.290
Not from the this is equal to U.S., so we are getting that data from the U.S., we called this data

371
00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:06.130
session instead of saying data that doesn't make sense.

372
00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:08.260
We just call it fishing.

373
00:34:10.490 --> 00:34:11.000
All right.

374
00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:21.810
And here, instead of returning user, we just say if a person is authenticated, so it means that if

375
00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:23.220
this decision is true.

376
00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:26.960
Then return.

377
00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:33.310
Return this.

378
00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:35.440
Otherwise.

379
00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:38.630
Return something else, look, so.

380
00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:42.530
Otherwise we want to return if signing.

381
00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:48.440
So here, let me remove this all.

382
00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:52.040
OK.

383
00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:59.290
And this is just create empty fragments.

384
00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:04.710
And inside this, we create a button.

385
00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:07.700
All right.

386
00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:11.830
We create a button and we call it sign in.

387
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:15.360
All right.

388
00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:20.370
So let's see that it's working or not.

389
00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:24.970
This return should return something as far.

390
00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:28.090
So here we turn.

391
00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:31.310
And empty fragments as far.

392
00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:38.610
This one, we just say sign out for now.

393
00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:42.710
I'm going to fix it later.

394
00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:47.660
Okay, let's see that we're getting anything.

395
00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:53.850
We should get a sign in here, but this signing doesn't go any better now.

396
00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.550
So we add it on.

397
00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:57.330
Click here.

398
00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:02.960
These aren't clear, he's going to call this function, design and function.

399
00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:07.490
So we're going to use this signing to really go to this signing page.

400
00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:13.490
So now if we click this on this signing, we're going to redirect to this page.

401
00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:14.600
All right.

402
00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:18.300
Which has to call back the oil as well.

403
00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:22.340
And now if you click on the sign in with Google, we should redirect.

404
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:24.850
No, it's still you cannot go.

405
00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:29.720
We should actually define the callback URL as well.

406
00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:32.660
So inside this signing, duchess?

407
00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:42.560
If you remember, we created a button with just sign in with Google, but we didn't at any sign in ability

408
00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:45.750
here, so we need to add on click here.

409
00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:51.860
And this unclear is going to return a function.

410
00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:54.460
That is going to.

411
00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:57.400
Call this sign.

412
00:36:58.270 --> 00:36:58.720
All right.

413
00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:02.150
Signing function from the.

414
00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:05.590
Next off, we need to imported.

415
00:37:07.090 --> 00:37:07.860
So.

416
00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:14.970
And that's.

417
00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:20.080
Now, let's put it at the top.

418
00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:27.370
So here we are importing gift providers and we need to import signing as well.

419
00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:34.720
So just to sign in and let's change this signing to the lower case that doesn't make.

420
00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:38.160
Called this function instead, so.

421
00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:41.720
Or you can call this anything else.

422
00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:48.460
So, uh, here we call this function sign in.

423
00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:55.690
But the issue is signing the bill to the provider that should be the provider.

424
00:37:56.170 --> 00:38:02.350
We just said provided that I.D. and the callback, the URL.

425
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:09.750
The callback you are is equal to forward slash, which is the homepage.

426
00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:19.230
So when the user is authenticated by Google, we need to come back to the local or homepage.

427
00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:21.390
So let's try this again.

428
00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:25.380
So I'm going at actually a step by step.

429
00:38:25.650 --> 00:38:28.530
You know, that's all the what's happening here.

430
00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:38.130
So when now we click on sign and it could well, we should go to the Google account of Google, but

431
00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:39.690
this is going to gives us an error.

432
00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:46.430
If you remember before that, it didn't define the here.

433
00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:49.010
We didn't define the redirect our.

434
00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:51.920
So we need to copy this.

435
00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:53.700
All right.

436
00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:57.060
We need to copy this, we go back to our.

437
00:38:58.670 --> 00:39:09.620
Credentials, which was the application we are working on, we added this off to client IDs and.

438
00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:12.570
Here in the.

439
00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:16.690
Redirect, you or else we need to change this.

440
00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:22.130
To the one that we got from Google.

441
00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:22.770
All right.

442
00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:23.940
We saved this.

443
00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:32.090
And now if you try to sign in again.

444
00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:41.740
They try to sign, you know, we went to the correct position that is asking us an email or something.

445
00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:44.380
So I just write down my email.

446
00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:54.080
Which is, say, quote with a hand at Gmail dot com.

447
00:39:57.370 --> 00:40:00.040
I quickly write down my passport.

448
00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:20.920
All right, now, we need to be redirected to the local street house and instead of seeing sign in things,

449
00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:29.460
sign up because here we are defined inside the user that yes, if the person is sign in, just return,

450
00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:30.060
sign up.

451
00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:33.750
But let's create this button and make it.

452
00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:36.840
Instead of the button, we get the image and show it here.

453
00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:43.560
So you just delete this and create an image.

454
00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:50.100
And this source is actually fiction.

455
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:56.370
The user and the decrease to.

456
00:40:57.890 --> 00:40:58.520
Sound.

457
00:40:58.640 --> 00:40:58.940
Yeah.

458
00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:02.690
Session that use it, that image.

459
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000
I can refresh the page, we should see my energy.

460
00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:12.090
All right.

461
00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:18.390
So now the image is fine, but we want to when we click on the image, we sign out.

462
00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:24.870
So we added on click here inside the image.

463
00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:28.050
I'm clicked with the.

464
00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:31.830
Capitalists see.

465
00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:37.750
And this is going to call this sign out function.

466
00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:42.760
So just a sign out, which is a building function from next year.

467
00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:51.400
Now we should be signed and there isn't a show sign out because we're in a deployment mode.

468
00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:57.310
So because we are always saving and the something happening.

469
00:41:57.430 --> 00:42:01.440
But in the production mode, we shouldn't get this problem.

470
00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:04.750
But if you refresh, you'll see that you're still signing.

471
00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:08.740
So now if we click on the image, we should sign out.

472
00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:09.460
All right.

473
00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:11.170
Signing again.

474
00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:16.340
So let me add another account, so we be sure.

475
00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:25.820
So instead of just having one account of another account, I just called, I choose and my other email.

476
00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:33.320
And a passport.

477
00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:35.960
Yes, with my passport clipped, the.

478
00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:43.300
And I think this icon is going to ask me to verify with my tablet.

479
00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:49.300
Let me get my Typekit real quick and sign in.

480
00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:55.940
So this is the only one time happens and the next time you are sign.

481
00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:56.610
All right.

482
00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:00.420
OK, so.

483
00:43:01.890 --> 00:43:09.870
Yeah, now I'm signing with a different account and Google, it's close to Google, so let me sign in

484
00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:19.650
with my another account, which is for her and you should see different image, which is has it doesn't

485
00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:20.970
have any background color.

486
00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:33.670
So let me solve this a little bit, so the image we had a class name, the art is just user rich.

487
00:43:35.550 --> 00:43:37.020
And we had a class name.

488
00:43:38.490 --> 00:43:42.010
We just decreased the size a little bit.

489
00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:46.950
We just say it's 10 and we add it with 10 as well.

490
00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:54.290
And you make it a circle, they it rounded full.

491
00:43:58.010 --> 00:44:02.930
We added padding because I want to add a background color.

492
00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:06.440
Just add the background color of gray.

493
00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:08.510
Two hundred.

494
00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:18.380
But this one we don't want to I don't want to have this all the time when I hover over the image, I

495
00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:20.240
want to have the background color.

496
00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:22.180
All right.

497
00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:31.780
So let's change the cursor to be pointed, so we see a pointing and then B hover over the image.

498
00:44:34.210 --> 00:44:34.630
All right.

499
00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:39.430
And I want to add a little bit, the background covers the image as well.

500
00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:44.530
So when we have an image with the background, we can see the background gray color as well.

501
00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:46.510
So we added padding up one.

502
00:44:48.310 --> 00:44:50.560
So now it's like this.

503
00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.720
Let's try the other image.

504
00:44:59.470 --> 00:45:00.070
This one.

505
00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:05.070
Yeah, that's nice, too.

506
00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:10.920
And let's install the sign in button as well, which is this one.

507
00:45:12.830 --> 00:45:13.280
Here.

508
00:45:16.010 --> 00:45:21.260
So we add a class name, the class name is going to have a background.

509
00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:24.610
Color of blue.

510
00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:27.660
Five hundred.

511
00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:35.740
But they want I want the text to be white, so you can see the text.

512
00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:44.220
And let's add some padding to the x axis.

513
00:45:45.410 --> 00:45:46.700
Of, uh.

514
00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:52.500
Six and then in the way of.

515
00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:53.870
To.

516
00:45:57.730 --> 00:46:00.890
Let's make the effort to be a little bit bold.

517
00:46:01.010 --> 00:46:03.240
We just see in font media.

518
00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:08.420
And we add around that corner.

519
00:46:10.610 --> 00:46:12.920
We just see a rounded median.

520
00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:22.960
This year, and let's add some of the hovering effect when we hover, I want it a little bit brighter.

521
00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:26.910
So we just say hover.

522
00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:28.920
It's easy to do it.

523
00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:36.060
We just and the brightness of 100, for example, five five percent brightness.

524
00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:39.450
That means zooming at events, you can see it's.

525
00:46:41.090 --> 00:46:46.310
Yeah, and also, I want to add some shadow as well when we hover over the elements.

526
00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:51.720
So we just to hover shadow.

527
00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:56.440
A very small shadow like medium shadow would be fine.

528
00:46:57.650 --> 00:46:58.610
You see the shadow.

529
00:47:01.730 --> 00:47:02.180
All right.

530
00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:11.300
So this is a signing, and let's establish this this page as well, the logo and this one, everything.

531
00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:12.980
So we go back to.

532
00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:20.010
Signing that, yes, the page for the image, we had a class name.

533
00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:26.650
We just say width of 50 52.

534
00:47:30.590 --> 00:47:31.910
That's fresh this.

535
00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:45.250
And we just the object cover to prevent this threat stretching the page is starting to look.

536
00:47:47.090 --> 00:47:47.570
All right.

537
00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:50.940
Object cover, not all.

538
00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:57.900
So this is fine for the paragraph.

539
00:48:00.730 --> 00:48:01.840
We just make it.

540
00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:04.780
We just change the text to be a small.

541
00:48:07.610 --> 00:48:08.210
All right.

542
00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:09.830
Make it Italy.

543
00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:18.660
So it's just be a little bit italic and margin y of 10.

544
00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:26.180
And so we have a bit of a space between the logo and the button.

545
00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:29.820
Then we make the takes center.

546
00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:42.040
In order to bring the logo and button to the center, we just added Flexbox to just display Flex to

547
00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:44.650
the upper dev here.

548
00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:46.930
We just say.

549
00:48:48.130 --> 00:48:48.670
Uh.

550
00:48:51.010 --> 00:48:53.950
Here we just said the flags.

551
00:48:54.310 --> 00:49:01.690
We changed the display to flags, but the flex direction should be column because we want them to be

552
00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:09.460
on the top of each other and in order to bring them to the center, we just use items center.

553
00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:13.510
You see the everything Pulitzer Center.

554
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:18.500
And let's bring them a little bit down, we added emerging.

555
00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:22.550
Top of 40 here.

556
00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:27.600
So that's fine.

557
00:49:27.810 --> 00:49:32.310
Everything is fine, except this button, let's make this button like a Google button.

558
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:35.640
So we add a class name.

559
00:49:50.370 --> 00:49:51.270
We want to end.

560
00:49:53.370 --> 00:49:55.830
You want the background color to be.

561
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:59.060
Read four hundred.

562
00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:04.590
And we want it to be rounded but large.

563
00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:07.080
All right.

564
00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:13.080
But we want the ticks to be white.

565
00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:19.710
And finally, we when we just added padding, so we have a space.

566
00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:26.990
And let's add some hover effect here, too.

567
00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:31.160
So when we hover over it, I want the red color.

568
00:50:32.430 --> 00:50:33.990
The background rate corner.

569
00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:44.650
To be instead of the four hundred I wanted to make it five hundred, so a little bit doctor.

570
00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:47.350
Like this?

571
00:50:52.170 --> 00:50:54.720
Yeah, that was it for the authentication part.

572
00:50:55.910 --> 00:51:01.010
So if you refresh now, we have a sign out that sign in.

573
00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:12.000
They see that it's working now in the next section, we're going to start with the body section if you

574
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.620
look at the final version.

575
00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:17.620
You go to the home page.

576
00:51:20.330 --> 00:51:26.180
They see that the in the next section, we're going to create this parts there we get.

577
00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:30.650
We show the logo, the input and these buttons.

578
00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:33.950
Before we're getting, let's add our.

579
00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:41.820
Get job like a push, everything together, so you stop the server using controversy.

580
00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:46.080
We just get at everything using it at.

581
00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:51.630
We had a comment with a message of.

582
00:51:54.330 --> 00:51:56.880
And often.

583
00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:00.920
Taxation.

584
00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:04.730
And two kids.

585
00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:08.260
User data.

586
00:52:09.890 --> 00:52:10.700
From who?

587
00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:17.230
Then he captioned the.

588
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:21.830
OK, authentication.

589
00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:26.140
And we push everything to get up.

590
00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:31.840
So let's that's what's happened to the here.

591
00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:34.600
Yeah, I just made a mistake here.

592
00:52:34.690 --> 00:52:35.450
Got pushed.

593
00:52:35.450 --> 00:52:36.040
No gift.

594
00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:37.650
All right.

595
00:52:37.690 --> 00:52:40.210
Let's review what we have done here.

596
00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:50.340
So now we have four comments, and the last one is add authentication, I get user from Google.

597
00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:59.450
So we create we modify the user duchess file, so we added a condition.

598
00:52:59.730 --> 00:53:04.400
We just say if the person is authenticated, so show the.

599
00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:09.830
Like an image with a sign out ability.

600
00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:15.290
And also, if the person is not authentic, I just show a button saying sign in.

601
00:53:17.010 --> 00:53:22.740
Then we have we covered everything in the insult, insult kicks off.

602
00:53:23.610 --> 00:53:28.350
He covered it and the application with the system provider.

603
00:53:30.370 --> 00:53:39.670
We created a file called Nix A30s, and we got all the providers we the providers we used was the Google

604
00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:40.360
provider.

605
00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:43.330
We created the page address here.

606
00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:50.880
And we created a page called Sign In Inside a folder called Off.

607
00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:54.940
That is just a logo.

608
00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:59.400
That paragraph and assigning to Google.

609
00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:06.240
We got the information from the providers using server side function.

610
00:54:07.550 --> 00:54:14.390
And that's it, that's it for the things we did, but uh, yeah, it was big things to do.

611
00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:16.640
But that was it.

612
00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:23.030
So see you in the next section for the body part of our project.
