WEBVTT
1
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:08.180
All right.

2
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:14.600
In the last section, we have completed the pagination of both pages, image and web.

3
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.990
In this section, we're going to work on the loading effect of our website.

4
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:28.700
So if you look at the final version, and for example, if you search something by clicking on, I'm

5
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.900
feeling lucky.

6
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.700
You can see it loading effect here.

7
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.630
And then we see the results first for the web.

8
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:45.740
And then if you click on Image, we're going to see the another form of loading effect for images.

9
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.260
So next year, 13 actually introduce a new.

10
00:00:52.220 --> 00:01:03.980
A filing convention for loading effect, which does not need any estate or using the user set or use

11
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:04.670
effect.

12
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:13.880
React Hulk So I'm going to show you inside the their documentation which is inside better that next

13
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.700
JS dot org for slash docs.

14
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.920
And if you go here on the left side, scroll down a little bit.

15
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:31.010
I think we can find the loading here inside the file conventions.

16
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.040
So we, I have introduced you to layout page error.

17
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.930
And to hit the other one is loading.

18
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.850
So we're going to have a loading DOJ's file, which is going to be.

19
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.230
Add service component.

20
00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.080
And this is going to use a system called suspense from the React.

21
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:08.740
So if you create this file and put it inside the folder, it's going to automatically detect the waiting

22
00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.800
for the page until it gets ready.

23
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:19.630
And then as shows this loading, for example, this text instead of that.

24
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.750
But you can create your skeleton and other formats of loadings.

25
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.880
So I'm going to show you how to create it using Tailwind CSS.

26
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:39.110
So let's create this file inside these two folders as we want.

27
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.220
We want to have different loading effects for the image and web.

28
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.930
We're going to create two files.

29
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.910
So first one is for the Web.

30
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.330
We're going to call it loading dot gsx.

31
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.010
We create a React functional component here.

32
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:07.560
And we just say here, loading for now and then for the image, we're going to create the same file.

33
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:17.060
I can copy this file, put it here using keeping control and put it here to the because the naming and

34
00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.650
everything would be similar.

35
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:28.220
Now, if you look at our website, let me see that we start the server first using NPM and PM.

36
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.470
Run did.

37
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:43.750
So let's see that we can get the lowering effect, just the text that we have created now.

38
00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.600
So let me just.

39
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.820
First go to the home page and then you're going to search something.

40
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.310
So we are now in the home page, for example, our search.

41
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.190
Hello.

42
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.250
And then this is going to go to the website.

43
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.580
As you can see, we are seeing the loading.

44
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:19.090
Now and after 10 seconds, which is the waiting for the results, we have created a fake 10 seconds.

45
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.260
Wait here.

46
00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:21.790
We get the result.

47
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.500
And if you click on image.

48
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.920
We're going to see the loading effect as well.

49
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.800
So so it's working.

50
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.450
The system is working.

51
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.690
Now.

52
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.790
We just have to create the loading effect for each of them separately.

53
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.830
So first, we can start with the web.

54
00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.780
So I'm going to stop the server for now.

55
00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:57.320
So I'm going to stop the server to don't exhaust the API key request.

56
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.130
So we go back to loading the gsx.

57
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.740
Inside the Web folder.

58
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.270
And here we're going to create some empty divs.

59
00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.850
And we're going to animate them using Tailwind CSS.

60
00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:23.360
So we're going to have first we have an empty fragment and inside this we're going to have.

61
00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:25.400
One dip.

62
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:35.890
Which includes, as you can see, we are getting some suggestions, but I want to make it some different

63
00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:36.520
way.

64
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.530
So another div.

65
00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.410
So the things we do here.

66
00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.150
Is to have a different width.

67
00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:54.190
And if you look at the final version and we go to all each of them has different width and height.

68
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:55.990
So it represents the.

69
00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:04.090
So if you if I refresh again, so the height is are different and the width of difference.

70
00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:10.240
So we can see it's represents the same structure of the results we get.

71
00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:18.400
So we're going to have, for example, for the first one, we're going to have a 2.5 height.

72
00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.790
And the background color would be.

73
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.810
Gray.

74
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.500
So the background color is actually the same for all of them.

75
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.390
So let me and create the common parts.

76
00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.900
Copy them and then just change the things we need.

77
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:45.050
For example, this one is the common one is background Gray 200.

78
00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.580
And then we want to make it rounded.

79
00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:50.020
Fold.

80
00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.080
So we we're going to have a rounded in the corner.

81
00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:56.610
And then.

82
00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.470
We're going to have.

83
00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:08.730
A margin bottom of 2.5.

84
00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:22.050
So and now we're going to just copy this file and then just we change the height of this one for each

85
00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:22.500
of them.

86
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:32.730
So I'm going to copy this font three more times using all shift arrow done for the first one, I'm going

87
00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:42.000
to just set the height to be 2.5 and then the width to be 48.

88
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:49.680
For the second one, I want to set the height to be 3.5.

89
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:56.120
But I want to set the width to be.

90
00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.120
360

91
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:04.460
pixels.

92
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:11.410
Okay.

93
00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:15.940
And then here we're going to have.

94
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:22.220
With of.

95
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:31.830
560 pixels.

96
00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:36.390
And finally, for the last one, we're going to have

97
00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:45.450
the weight of 530 pixels.

98
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:54.890
Okay, let's start the server and check what we have already.

99
00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:06.470
So, uh, let's see, the server is okay.

100
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:09.080
We just, uh, refresh the page now.

101
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:16.980
We see that here.

102
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:21.390
But some of them went under that top.

103
00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:26.010
So I'm going to just add some padding as well.

104
00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.230
For the top one.

105
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:35.990
I want to add some margin in the x axis of two.

106
00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:42.050
Padding in the top of ten and we set the maximum.

107
00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:51.040
With to B six excel for the large screen and above.

108
00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:54.970
I want two padding in the left of 52.

109
00:09:55.870 --> 00:10:02.890
And also I want to make the animate animate pulse.

110
00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:09.640
So animal pulse actually just like increase and decrease the.

111
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.650
Uh, color of this one.

112
00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:15.470
So make it like an animation.

113
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:23.250
So let's refresh the page and see it so we can see it like the animation here, But I still cannot see

114
00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:25.260
the two at the bottom.

115
00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.510
Here, let me check why.

116
00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:34.830
So here that the last two, we didn't set the height actually.

117
00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:38.700
So the height for this one is two.

118
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:45.630
For the last one, the height is two as well.

119
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:47.760
So now we should.

120
00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:49.720
See it.

121
00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:51.610
Let me refresh the page.

122
00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:53.830
Now you can see it like that.

123
00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.210
It's pulsing.

124
00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:59.230
And also it has it in the small size.

125
00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:00.460
It's like this.

126
00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:18.630
So a small size is actually goes a little bit outside so we can maybe fix this one by.

127
00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:24.630
Instead of words we just say Max with.

128
00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.220
I can hear.

129
00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:38.410
So let's test it again.

130
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:43.170
This.

131
00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:44.340
Refresh the page.

132
00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:52.740
I can now they are inside because the Mac the maximum they go to the year and are different inside the

133
00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:54.540
larger screen.

134
00:11:54.810 --> 00:12:05.550
So the simple things now we can do we just copy this one like three four more times so we can have a

135
00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:07.080
just a different.

136
00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:11.520
And so this one I'm going to.

137
00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:15.230
Just let me make it small.

138
00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:18.850
So I'm going to copy this, dear.

139
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:24.580
For example, two more times using all shift arrow down.

140
00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:32.560
So now if we refresh the page, we should see three of them on top of each other, similar like this.

141
00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:36.730
So because that is enough for loading effect, I think.

142
00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:40.570
Kate.

143
00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:47.430
So let's stop the server now and create the one for the.

144
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:49.860
Image.

145
00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:51.620
Okay.

146
00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:56.240
That one would be very similar and easy to.

147
00:12:56.790 --> 00:13:03.450
So here for the image part, we're going to have similar things, but instead we're going to bring them

148
00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:04.440
next to each other.

149
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:12.090
And the width for them would be similar, similar size.

150
00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:24.740
So we're going to have this similar things like we have an empty fragment or because we want to bring

151
00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:27.420
them next to each other, we can just keep this there.

152
00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:36.560
And inside this step, we're going to have three separate places.

153
00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.090
So we're going to have a diff here.

154
00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:44.900
And inside this there, we're going to have three divs.

155
00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:58.400
The first step is going to be with the height of 48 because we want to display like an image.

156
00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.650
So it's a big height.

157
00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:11.200
And then the weight is going to be similar 48 and we're going to have some margin at a bottom of four.

158
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:22.270
And also, we want to have the background color gray 200 and also we want to make it rounded video.

159
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:29.990
K So that's it for this one, the first one.

160
00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:33.440
Uh, let me copy this one.

161
00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:35.600
I'm going to change it.

162
00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:41.300
So the next step is going to be the height of.

163
00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:44.390
Two instead.

164
00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:51.510
The width would be similar, but the margin bottom is 2.5.

165
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.060
And everything else is the same.

166
00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.840
And then we're going to have.

167
00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:09.860
The next one, which is voted for the title of the image and the description.

168
00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:18.050
The double is a title and this is a description or something like a display link, you can say.

169
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:21.500
So this one width would be a little bit smaller.

170
00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:29.450
44 and then four the margin bottom.

171
00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:31.560
That is fine, 2.5.

172
00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:32.840
Height is two.

173
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:34.610
So everything else is okay.

174
00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:36.260
And then.

175
00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:43.000
So we're going to have.

176
00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:46.050
Just.

177
00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.820
And we just add the anime.

178
00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.720
Animate pulse here.

179
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:53.730
See the effect.

180
00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:57.750
So let's start the server again using NPM run dev.

181
00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:03.030
Now we can test the image after the server is ready.

182
00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:08.040
So now we just go to the image part.

183
00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:12.970
So we.

184
00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:14.860
We see it like this.

185
00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:25.460
So it looks like it because we need to have three next to each other and then see it like that.

186
00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:29.450
And then we didn't add actually the margin padding at the top.

187
00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:41.630
So here inside this step, we're going to have the padding at the top too, with the ten margin in the

188
00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:44.270
x axis of two and also.

189
00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:52.860
Uh, we can just bring it a little bit to the right side in the in the larger screen and above by padding

190
00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:55.080
left of 52.

191
00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:03.000
And also, we can set the max width here to be six Excel two.

192
00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.540
So now let's test it again.

193
00:17:06.570 --> 00:17:08.430
We refresh the page.

194
00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:11.490
Okay, Now we can see it.

195
00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:13.710
It's like this.

196
00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:16.580
Okay.

197
00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:21.250
And after 10 seconds we can see the results.

198
00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:28.300
So what we want to do is to copy and paste this one, three, two more times.

199
00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:29.500
One, two.

200
00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:37.090
And then here we just changed the display to flex, to bring them next to each other.

201
00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:39.790
Let's see what we have.

202
00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:51.960
So there are next to each other, but they are connected so we can simply add a space X of four.

203
00:17:58.250 --> 00:17:58.450
Okay.

204
00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:05.550
But in the mobile size, they're also still next to each other, which is going to one of they have

205
00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:08.130
to be on top of each other.

206
00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:15.540
So I'm going to say make this one flex column.

207
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:24.210
But for the small size and above make to make this flex to be real.

208
00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:29.410
Now let's see what we see inside the mobile size.

209
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:31.140
Let's refresh the page.

210
00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:37.930
Now we see them on top of each other, but the space X actually is making them a little bit weird.

211
00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:41.170
So we're going to remove the space X.

212
00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:48.430
So we just set this space X for the small size and above.

213
00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:54.860
Okay, let's see what we get now.

214
00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.030
Okay, now they're on top of each other.

215
00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:09.790
Uh, actually, we don't see them here because we need to add some padding on the, uh, padding in

216
00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:14.980
the bottom of, for example, 42.

217
00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:18.100
So we add some space here, too.

218
00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:18.880
So I'm going to.

219
00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:23.960
Refresh the page again now.

220
00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:27.140
Okay.

221
00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:36.400
Let's wait a little bit.

222
00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:39.650
I think the result didn't applied yet.

223
00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.060
Padding at a bottom of 42.

224
00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:44.200
So let's see.

225
00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:11.320
So for the mobile size, actually, we can just show one of them.

226
00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:19.950
We don't need to show three so we can make this one actually hidden for the mobile size.

227
00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:27.960
But in the mobile size and above, we can make them inline flex.

228
00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:33.630
So let's copy this one and put it for the last one too.

229
00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:36.450
So let's test it now.

230
00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:45.070
Okay, now we just see the one image loading in the mobile.

231
00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:48.010
But in the big size.

232
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:48.760
Okay.

233
00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:50.350
It's a little bit miss.

234
00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:51.010
Now, here.

235
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:56.910
So let's see what's happened here.

236
00:20:58.050 --> 00:20:58.560
Okay.

237
00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:00.540
They became inline flex.

238
00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.490
That's a problem.

239
00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:16.950
You know, I think instead of just adding it to the both of them, I'm going to cut this one and also

240
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:19.350
I'm going to delete for the second one.

241
00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:22.200
Sorry about that.

242
00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:26.220
This is just I'm doing it now.

243
00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:28.590
I haven't think about it before.

244
00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:36.360
So let's bring it bring these two inside another div and then I just add this hidden here.

245
00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:40.410
So now let's test it again.

246
00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:47.090
It's working, but we just need to add some space between them here.

247
00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:49.080
So that is easy to do.

248
00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:57.330
So in this small size and above, we're going to have some space between them, for example, for.

249
00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:03.310
So now let's test it again.

250
00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:04.510
Okay.

251
00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:09.280
Now it's working for the larger screen and is for the small size.

252
00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.020
We just see one of them.

253
00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:14.920
Okay.

254
00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:17.900
All right.

255
00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:21.230
So that was it for creating the loading effect.

256
00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:23.840
And also.

257
00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:29.380
And we have created this one for the web and the image.

258
00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:33.410
So and also you can see that we try an error.

259
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:39.670
You can create anything you want in the Web, as I did for the image loading effect.

260
00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:49.400
So now we can just stop the server for now, we can add this one to GitHub using contour shift G.

261
00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:51.760
We can open the source control.

262
00:22:52.060 --> 00:23:01.510
We can click here on the plus icon and add everything to GitHub using just creating a message first,

263
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:13.660
which is add loading effects for web and image.

264
00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:16.780
Pages.

265
00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:22.670
So we're going to commit and push it to GitHub.

266
00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:27.380
So let's go to go GitHub and review what we have done.

267
00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:33.320
So we're going to click on the Google clone here, so we're going to refresh the page.

268
00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:43.340
Now we have 17 commits in our GitHub repository, and the last one is add loading effects for web and

269
00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.230
image pages.

270
00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:52.400
So as you can see, we have created a new file called Loading JSX, which is going to work

271
00:23:55.370 --> 00:24:03.290
inside the next Yes, 13 as a substitute loading effect for the same page inside this.

272
00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:12.230
So we have just added a couple of empty div but with different height and width and with the background

273
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.740
gray.

274
00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:20.870
And also we have added the animate pulse for making it animated like a skeleton.

275
00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:27.940
And then for we just this is for the EMS.

276
00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:32.390
So we inside the mobile size, we just see these.

277
00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:37.880
The first one, but in the larger screen, we see three of them.

278
00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:54.440
And for the web, we just created three paragraphs on top of each other, each including a four lines

279
00:24:55.460 --> 00:25:05.450
and with different width and height, which is represents the structure that we have inside the web.

280
00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:10.820
So that was it for this part.

281
00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:13.970
We have just completed.

282
00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:17.300
Our website.

283
00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:22.970
In the next section, we're going to add deploy our website to virtual.

284
00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:28.770
Now I'm going to show you how to do it simply using a virtual dot com.

285
00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:30.680
So see in the next section.
