1
00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:07.720
All right.

2
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:13.450
In the last section we have completed creating the header section of the home page.

3
00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:21.370
In this section, we're going to create the search box section in the middle of the home page.

4
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.690
As you can see, we have a Google logo here at the top.

5
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:27.940
Then we have.

6
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.230
A search box.

7
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.560
And also we have two buttons saying Google search.

8
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.210
And also I'm feeling lucky.

9
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.970
So in the search box, we can just write down our keywords.

10
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.620
And when we press enter.

11
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.390
For example, I write down nice.

12
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:55.220
And if I press enter, this is going to redirect me to another page, which is in the search for slash

13
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.670
web.

14
00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.830
And then we have the search term at a top saying nice.

15
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.390
And also so this is going to redirect you this way.

16
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:15.050
So this one happens by pressing enter or also if you click on this button, does the same way that we

17
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.130
press enter.

18
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.180
So we're going to add the submit button here.

19
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.990
And also we create this behavior.

20
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.620
When we press enter, we're going to submit the form as well.

21
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:34.670
And also we have another button which is saying, I'm feeling lucky when we click on this one.

22
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.740
Just pay attention.

23
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:36.220
It.

24
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.450
It's going to have a spanner in the middle until we get the random word.

25
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:49.460
So we have we we need to add this spanner and this is going to redirect us to the same page search web

26
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.090
search term, the the term that is created.

27
00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:01.330
So we're going to learn how to create these random words and also how to redirect person to the different

28
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.720
page and also how to add these forms.

29
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.890
And also in this section, we're going to learn what's the difference between the client side and the

30
00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.270
server side because.

31
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:21.960
As we are using the form here with the UN Submit event listener and also on click event listener here,

32
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:28.890
we cannot use these components in server side as the rule rules of next JS.

33
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:39.300
So we need to separate these inputs and also these buttons, and we create them as a client side.

34
00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.350
So I'm going to show you how to do it.

35
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:52.240
So let's go back to Visual Studio Code, and we're going to add this section inside the page that Gsx.

36
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:53.590
Here.

37
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.270
As you can see, we just have the home header for now.

38
00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.300
So I'm going to have the body section here.

39
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.700
So I'm going to just say body.

40
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.690
So that was the header.

41
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.900
Let's add this on to.

42
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.030
It's just right down here.

43
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.570
So we have the header.

44
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.540
And body, then the footer is going to be inside the layout.

45
00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.080
So the body is going to be a div.

46
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.880
With, uh, two things an image and the home search.

47
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.540
So I'm going to have an image tag.

48
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:47.220
So the image we want to use is the image tag from next forward slash image, because we want our image

49
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.600
to be optimized.

50
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.010
Next year gives us the ability to optimize our image in different sizes.

51
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:59.070
For example, if someone is watching our website inside his mobile.

52
00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:10.340
It's going to see the lower quality of the image, which helps them to see the website faster.

53
00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:16.240
So this is the image tag features of next year.

54
00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.130
This is coming from next photo slash image.

55
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.710
So this image has its a closing tag.

56
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.100
So let's close this one.

57
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:37.830
And this image tag has some things like width and height, and these are mandatory.

58
00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.270
We need to use it.

59
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.870
So the width I'm going to use for the image.

60
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.170
Let's find the image first.

61
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.790
So let's add this one.

62
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.970
So we have the width and the height.

63
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.130
Uh, the height I want to use is 100.

64
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:07.450
So before the source, I want to search for something inside Google, for example, I search Google.

65
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.180
And I inside the image part.

66
00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.680
I want to find an image with the.

67
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.010
Transparent background.

68
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.520
So I go to tools, color and transparent.

69
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.900
So this image is from Wikipedia.

70
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.480
I want to use this image so we can click on the image.

71
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:34.360
And here, right click and click on copy image address.

72
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:45.100
And we come back here and inside the CRC, we're going to add this link that we have copied.

73
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.270
This is which is from the Wikipedia.

74
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:59.740
Now, if you look at our website, we get an error saying that this is a upload that Wikipedia dot org

75
00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:06.550
is not configured under image images in your next dot configs.

76
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.500
So we need to go to next conflicts and add this URL.

77
00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.870
So this is the rule of next JS.

78
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:22.750
So we need to copy this and we go back to Visual Studio Code and we go to next conflicts and here after

79
00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.900
the experimental, we can add that here.

80
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.550
So we're just going to say.

81
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:30.290
Domains.

82
00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.650
And this domain stuff.

83
00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:43.930
Firstly, first things first we need to say images, and then inside the images we add a set of curly

84
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.110
braces and add the domain.

85
00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.550
As you can see, we get suggestions from.

86
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.810
Co uh, GitHub copilot.

87
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:57.300
But the, the address is going to be the Wikipedia that we have copied.

88
00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:04.020
So when we have a change inside the config file, we need to restart the server to see the changes.

89
00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:11.610
So find the change in next that configs restart the server to see the changes in effect.

90
00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:13.770
So I'm going to stop the server here.

91
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.540
It started again using NPN run dev.

92
00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:24.710
So now we should see our image inside the website.

93
00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.060
So let's let's refresh the page.

94
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:37.330
So we see the image here now and the size is 300, 200.

95
00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:47.690
So the things we want to do is to bring it to the center by just adding something here inside the div

96
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:48.650
that we have added.

97
00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:59.210
So I'm going to change the display here to flex and as I want the image and the input to be on top of

98
00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:09.920
each other, I change the flex to column and let's bring it to the center horizontally using item center.

99
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.960
And we can add some margin at a top of 24.

100
00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:17.890
So now we should see the Google here.

101
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:26.310
Now I'm going to add the input at the bottom Here is the input, as I mentioned, is client size.

102
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:34.790
We're going to create another component separate for them so we can keep this page client side and we

103
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:37.010
can just have that part.

104
00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:47.620
And so this we keep this page server side and we just change the component that we're going to add client

105
00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:47.910
side.

106
00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.600
So I'm going to add that one.

107
00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.910
So I'm going to call that one home.

108
00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:54.330
Search.

109
00:08:56.530 --> 00:09:00.730
And we this we need to create it inside the components folder.

110
00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:03.190
So we need to create this one.

111
00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:08.380
I'm going to call it home Search dot Gsx.

112
00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:11.990
Let's create it using RCV.

113
00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:12.770
See?

114
00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:16.520
And let's bring it inside here.

115
00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.080
I'm going to close this one.

116
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:25.040
So let's order imported using contour space when we click here.

117
00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:30.980
Uh, it's going to come from the components forward slash home search.

118
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:34.040
So we should see the home search here.

119
00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:36.440
Now, let's.

120
00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:41.470
Continue and create this place.

121
00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:45.280
So inside the home search that gsx.

122
00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:48.080
So we're going to have.

123
00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:53.260
If form here for the return.

124
00:09:56.450 --> 00:10:04.580
So instead of this year, I'm going to have a form or we can just put it inside an empty bracket so

125
00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.440
we can add the form here.

126
00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.750
So let's add a form.

127
00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:14.770
So we don't need an action for this form.

128
00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:22.260
And inside the form we're going to have some icons and answers and inputs.

129
00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:24.850
So I'm going to show you in the final version.

130
00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:35.200
So we have an icon, magnifier icon on the left side, and we have a mic icon on the right side.

131
00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:39.300
So we're going to have these things here.

132
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:43.970
So I'm going to go to React Icons again.

133
00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.650
So we're going to search, React icons.

134
00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:54.840
So we have used the React icons for creating an icon in the header section.

135
00:10:54.840 --> 00:11:02.250
So we're going to use it again for creating that search and the magnifier and the microphone.

136
00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:06.120
So I'm going to search for search.

137
00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:11.810
The one I want to use is this eye line search.

138
00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:14.630
I'm going to click on it to copy it.

139
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:16.580
Let's come back here.

140
00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:20.990
And inside the form I'm going to add that icon.

141
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:23.540
But we need to import it as well.

142
00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:28.220
So I'm going to go at the top and just say import.

143
00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:39.550
This icon from react to icons for slash I because this one is started with I.

144
00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:44.200
We should see the magnifier now inside our website.

145
00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:49.210
This is very small so we can just add some classes here.

146
00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:52.820
So I'm going to add some class names.

147
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:59.560
This change the text to be ex large, the size of the icon to be ex large.

148
00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:03.820
We change the colour of it to be gray.

149
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.720
For example, 500.

150
00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:11.750
Then after that, we can just.

151
00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:16.910
I'm going to add some margin at the right side of the tree.

152
00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:25.230
After this icon, which we can see now here, we're going to have our inputs.

153
00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.910
So I'm going to have an input.

154
00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.410
The type would be text.

155
00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:35.220
So I'm going to just press enter the type is text and.

156
00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:40.410
So we need to add some things here to track the changes.

157
00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:43.670
But for now we just leave it like that.

158
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.990
And after that, we're going to have.

159
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:49.400
In other.

160
00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:55.910
Icon, which is a microphone icon.

161
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:58.070
So I'm going to search for microphone.

162
00:12:58.840 --> 00:12:59.050
So I'm.

163
00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:00.430
Just say, Mike.

164
00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:05.000
And the one I want to use is B is Phil.

165
00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.230
Mike?

166
00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:07.470
Phil.

167
00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:08.750
This one, the first one.

168
00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:16.340
So I'm going to click on it, copy the tag, and here I'm going to paste it inside here.

169
00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:25.700
So we need to import it at a top, which is coming from, as you can see, we got the suggestion from

170
00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.470
the GitHub copilot.

171
00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:35.900
So as you can see, as we code more, we get better and better suggestion from GitHub copilot because.

172
00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:41.200
They they understand our code of what this code is about.

173
00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:48.370
And they're going to search the Internet and find a similar code that suggests for us.

174
00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:55.510
So I'm going to get this suggestion, which is importing this file from the React Icons folder slash.

175
00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:03.970
So at first you don't get too much good suggestion from GitHub compiler, but at the end of your code

176
00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:06.160
you're going to get all the suggestions.

177
00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:07.120
Very nice.

178
00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:11.620
So let's style this as well.

179
00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:16.270
So we're going to add just the text to be large.

180
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:21.790
Okay, So now we see the.

181
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:25.040
Icon.

182
00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.270
On top of each other and the input is in the middle.

183
00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:32.210
So we can style this one simply.

184
00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:37.550
By styling this form actually.

185
00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:41.030
So this form we can add a class name for it.

186
00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:46.120
We can change the display to flex and bring them next to each other.

187
00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:50.660
We can set the width to be full 100%.

188
00:14:51.050 --> 00:15:03.470
We set a margin top of five and we can bring this one to the center using mix photo and we can just

189
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:06.110
set the maximum width of this.

190
00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:08.570
Form to be.

191
00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:15.030
Always 90% maximum.

192
00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:17.270
This is for the mobile size.

193
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:22.130
We always get 5% to the lot left and right.

194
00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:26.500
So.

195
00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:32.950
Let's see what we have done here.

196
00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:37.280
So still you can see it like this.

197
00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.430
We can add some border to it.

198
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:46.970
And we set the border color to be gray.

199
00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:48.720
200.

200
00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:53.470
So now we have a border.

201
00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:55.630
You can see that now the form.

202
00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:59.030
And his resume, as you can see it better.

203
00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:05.210
So you can see that we have a border, we have the input, we have that one as well.

204
00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:08.750
So let's continue to for a styling.

205
00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:18.260
So we're going to have some padding in the x axis of five and padding in the Y axis of three.

206
00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.550
So let's.

207
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.850
So you can see we have some space around it.

208
00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:31.450
And also we want to make it rounded.

209
00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:35.930
So I'm going to check change the rounded to be full.

210
00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:38.530
Like that.

211
00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.080
So this is going to add around it here.

212
00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:47.860
And when we hover over it, I want to have a shadow effect.

213
00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:49.780
So I'm going to say shadow.

214
00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:51.590
M.

215
00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:52.190
D.

216
00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:53.120
For example.

217
00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:55.400
So one.

218
00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:59.870
Now, when we hover over it, we should see a shadow on the red.

219
00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:06.640
So this is going to happen when we hover over it.

220
00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:09.460
And also, we want to have some transition.

221
00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:12.950
On the shadow.

222
00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:23.010
So now when we hover over it, we see a smooth change.

223
00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:26.400
So now we have the icon here.

224
00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:31.420
Let's make this input in fully sized theater.

225
00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:31.960
So.

226
00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:35.120
The input is not that nice.

227
00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:39.460
So we're going to have some class name for the input.

228
00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:48.490
I want to make it flex grow, which is going to help to get all the screen from the left to the right

229
00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:49.960
like this.

230
00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:55.150
And the next thing I want to do is to.

231
00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:05.410
When we focus on it, when we click on ADD, I want to remove that outline, which is not very beautiful,

232
00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:05.800
actually.

233
00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.010
So I'm going to say outline now.

234
00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:15.370
Okay, let's decrease the size.

235
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:27.390
And also for the form we have for the hover effect is shadow.

236
00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:35.020
I want to have it when we focus on the inside the this form as well.

237
00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:39.950
So when we focus within.

238
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:43.760
The first one.

239
00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:48.560
We want to have a shadow effect as a shadow medium.

240
00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:53.720
So now when we click on the form, we see the shadow as well.

241
00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:57.060
As you can see, even we don't hover over it.

242
00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:59.130
We see the shadow still.

243
00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:02.430
So we have added the shadow.

244
00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:05.460
Let's create it a little bit responsive.

245
00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:06.000
So.

246
00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:16.540
In the mobile size, we have 90%, but after the mobile size, we want to set the maximum width to be.

247
00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:19.250
Ex large.

248
00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:28.160
And the for the larger screen, we want to set the maximum width to be two x large.

249
00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:33.650
So now this is for the x large.

250
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:37.080
So for the mobile, we have 90%.

251
00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:46.560
And then after the mobile maximum, we have this one this size and for the larger screen we have a larger

252
00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:49.020
input.

253
00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:55.810
The other things I want to add is we have added the marching top.

254
00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:57.540
Actually, this one, we made a mistake.

255
00:19:57.550 --> 00:20:07.000
This is marching to MT five, which is going to add some space between the icon and the input.

256
00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:15.030
So the next thing we want to do is I think we have finished with this part.

257
00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:17.480
So let me check it real quick.

258
00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:21.350
So we have finished with the form section.

259
00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:28.880
Now we want to start creating the buttons at the here at the bottom.

260
00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:33.080
So we add a button here.

261
00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:36.150
We just add a button?

262
00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:41.940
Now, first we added this, so we want to bring the button next to each other.

263
00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:47.130
So I'm going to add a diff here and inside the diff we're going to have.

264
00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:50.750
The first button, which is.

265
00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:52.870
Google.

266
00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:56.430
Search.

267
00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:03.240
And then we're going to have another one.

268
00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:05.970
So I'm going to copy this one.

269
00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:11.430
And this is going to be I am feeling lucky.

270
00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:27.060
So this is just make this one capitalize.

271
00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:29.310
So.

272
00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:33.350
Just chip.

273
00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:41.570
So now we should see two icons next to each other.

274
00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:43.100
So let's sell this one.

275
00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:49.070
Let's bring them here so we can see the changes in real time.

276
00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:56.690
So I'm going to close the left side using contra B.

277
00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:02.030
So these buttons because they have this similar.

278
00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:10.440
As styling, as you say, from the final version, they have the same hovering effect background color.

279
00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:19.260
So we're going to create a custom tailored CSS class, which we can use for both of them.

280
00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:31.650
So we can go to let's open the Explorer section using Contour shift E and we can go to 12 and 12 and

281
00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:32.460
file.

282
00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:34.440
Oh, sorry.

283
00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:44.160
We we go to Globus at CSIS here, we can add our custom one, and I'm going to call this one.

284
00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:56.150
So let's say I want to call this one bit and we just add that BTN and here we can just say apply.

285
00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:05.050
So this is actually going to have to be inside.

286
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:14.360
So now we can just add the classes we need.

287
00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:22.810
But this one is it needs to be inside something called layers.

288
00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:26.800
So I'm going to say layer components.

289
00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:32.240
Components.

290
00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:36.880
And inside this one, we're going to have our bits.

291
00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:39.980
So I'm going to bring this one at a top.

292
00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:46.760
So button and the apply we want to add is background color.

293
00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:49.850
The background color I want to use.

294
00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:53.120
Is the.

295
00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:55.280
This color.

296
00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:03.230
You can just I've got it from the real Google.

297
00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:05.360
So it's af8.

298
00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:07.910
If nine.

299
00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:09.290
If a.

300
00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:18.110
So the simplest way to get the colors you want, for example, if you go to google.com, not this one.

301
00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:19.400
The real Google.

302
00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:33.610
If you go to Google.com, there is an extension called color picker for Chrome.

303
00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:35.220
If you install this one.

304
00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:42.900
And then you can just click on the pick and go to any position you want.

305
00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:47.460
For example, this background color, if I click on it, it shows me.

306
00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:52.990
Their colour saf9fa so you can simply.

307
00:24:53.920 --> 00:25:01.480
For example, clone a website using this extension and get exactly the same color.

308
00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:06.520
So now let's come back to our website.

309
00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:08.590
I bring it here.

310
00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:21.780
So if you want to add a custom color, you just need to add a bracket and add the color code of the

311
00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:24.060
color inside here.

312
00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:26.660
And we just say pkg to this color.

313
00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:36.690
And now if we add this class to these two buttons, so I'm going to use to all the cursor using alt

314
00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:44.280
and we just write down class name and we add that BTN class here.

315
00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:47.220
We should see the background color now.

316
00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:52.750
So we can see the background color is different.

317
00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:55.570
Now let's continue aside in this BTN.

318
00:25:56.310 --> 00:26:01.470
So the next one is I want to make this rounded medium.

319
00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:05.920
We want to text to be a small.

320
00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:09.720
With the color of gray.

321
00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:12.030
800.

322
00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:23.980
So when we hover over it, I want to have a ring, actually.

323
00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:27.010
I want to have a ring of one.

324
00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:35.570
And also when we hover over it, I want the ring to have a color of gray.

325
00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:37.840
200.

326
00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:45.720
When we focus on Ed, when we focus on it, I, I want to remove the outline.

327
00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:49.350
So we just say outline none.

328
00:26:50.350 --> 00:27:00.370
And when we active when we click on it, I want to have the ring to be gray 300.

329
00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:10.600
So the other things are when we hover over it, I want to have a shadow effect.

330
00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.620
Of the medium.

331
00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.040
The reason you don't see it, we need to complete it.

332
00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:19.150
And then you see the.

333
00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:21.490
Otherwise you get an error always.

334
00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:26.740
And also, let's set the width to be 36.

335
00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:36.440
And hi's to be ten and we add some transition to the shadow effect.

336
00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:41.480
So as we finish it, we shouldn't get an error.

337
00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.260
So let's refresh the page.

338
00:27:58.330 --> 00:28:00.100
So that is.

339
00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:01.990
I think it's okay.

340
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:05.340
We need to save this long.

341
00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.430
We are still getting an error to see.

342
00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:10.270
It's an error.

343
00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:13.570
So the error is.

344
00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:23.510
The width 35 does not exist.

345
00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:29.330
This one, I think at 35 we don't have 36.

346
00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:31.280
Probably it's a correct one.

347
00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:34.120
So now probably.

348
00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:36.430
Yeah, Now we can see the button here.

349
00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.220
They have the hover effect.

350
00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:44.610
So we can close this global access.

351
00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:48.730
And we come back to our website now.

352
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.020
I want them to be next to each other when we.

353
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:55.650
Now.

354
00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.410
When we are in the mobile screen.

355
00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:06.550
I want them to be on top of each other and in the small size and above, I want them to be on top of

356
00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:07.230
each other.

357
00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:16.780
So I'm going to have some classes here for this div that we have, so I'm going to make it slacks and

358
00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:19.840
for the mobile size I want them to be on top of each other.

359
00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:22.030
So I just add flex column.

360
00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:27.880
So now we should see them on top of each other.

361
00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:29.320
If you wait a little bit.

362
00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:32.950
Let's refresh the page.

363
00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:35.320
So now they're on top of each other.

364
00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:40.940
So we need to have some space between them.

365
00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:44.720
I just say space y too.

366
00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:51.140
And in this small size and above, I want to remove that space.

367
00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:51.580
Why?

368
00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:54.850
Because it makes a problem with the sizing.

369
00:29:55.630 --> 00:30:00.390
So we have it in the mobile size and the mobile size and above.

370
00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:03.160
We don't have this is that one.

371
00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:05.500
And in the mobile size and above.

372
00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:08.110
Instead we have a space X.

373
00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:10.360
Off for.

374
00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:18.290
And finally, we have justify.

375
00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:28.780
Center to bring them horizontally and vertically in the at the same position.

376
00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:31.360
So I'm going to refresh the page.

377
00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:37.230
Okay, Now we need to change actually the flex.

378
00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:43.750
So in the SME and above, we want the flex direction to be rolled.

379
00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:45.610
So there are next to.

380
00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:48.590
All right.

381
00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:50.590
So we see them like that.

382
00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:59.440
So the only things we need to do is to just add some margin at a top of, for example, eight.

383
00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:05.000
So we have some space between this button and these inputs.

384
00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:07.870
So.

385
00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:08.170
All right.

386
00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:11.920
So we have completed these things.

387
00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:14.840
Uh, let's decrease the size.

388
00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:15.370
So.

389
00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:17.580
Okay, They're looking okay.

390
00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:20.910
When we have a smaller screen, they are on top of each other.

391
00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:25.470
So when we have a bigger screen, they are next to each other.

392
00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:33.840
The next thing we need to do, we want to add some functionality because now we cannot submit the form

393
00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.550
or anything like that.

394
00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:43.890
So we need to add some event listener to the form and to be able to submit the form.

395
00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:48.750
So here inside the form, let me increase the size.

396
00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:53.190
So we have added the class.

397
00:31:53.400 --> 00:32:01.470
We can add an click and actually on submit event listener.

398
00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:14.340
So on submission, when we press enter, we want to trigger a function called handle submit.

399
00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:18.470
And we need to create this function here at a top.

400
00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:21.140
So I'm going to create a function.

401
00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:24.500
I call it handle submit.

402
00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:32.620
And also we want to use that prevent default to prevent the default behavior of the form submission,

403
00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:34.300
which is refreshing the page.

404
00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:39.820
So now the we should get an error.

405
00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:45.130
As you can see, we don't see anything because we have added the on submit.

406
00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:47.410
Event listener.

407
00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:53.380
We cannot use this component any more in the server side.

408
00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:56.030
We need to change this on to client side.

409
00:32:56.030 --> 00:33:01.580
So we need to add the client use client at the top.

410
00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:04.940
So this one should be client side.

411
00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:07.220
So let me refresh the page.

412
00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:07.760
Now.

413
00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:08.480
Let's see.

414
00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:10.460
Now we don't have an error.

415
00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:15.050
And also when we write something, a press enter.

416
00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:21.920
This is going to submit the form, but it's not going to see anything because we haven't completed this

417
00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:24.950
submission for.

418
00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:27.290
So now.

419
00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:31.940
We just say we have a some

420
00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:35.510
first thing first.

421
00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:37.070
We need to add some.

422
00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:39.550
As states here.

423
00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:47.090
So we just create a constant and we call it input.

424
00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:54.290
And we use use a state react hook to create a piece of state called input.

425
00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:57.980
Input is the this is the variable.

426
00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:03.110
This is the function to change this variable.

427
00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:06.260
And the initial value is an empty string.

428
00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:09.470
We need to import the user state from React.

429
00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:12.170
Now.

430
00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:17.980
Or we need to change this one when we are changing the input.

431
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:25.990
So inside the input we want to have some something called an unchanged event listener.

432
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:33.870
So we're going to have an on change here which is going to track the changes inside this input.

433
00:34:33.890 --> 00:34:39.920
So this is going to let me complete this one.

434
00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:43.910
So this is going to get something called event.

435
00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:51.590
So E and whatever it is, we want to set the inputs.

436
00:34:54.130 --> 00:35:02.980
So any changes happened, you want to track and this E is e dot target dot value.

437
00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:07.540
So we want to target the we want to get the value of the input.

438
00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:13.050
And set it inside the input variable that we have created here.

439
00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:21.720
And also we need to change the value to so we have a value here which is going to be that inputs.

440
00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:23.460
So now.

441
00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:28.560
If we change something here.

442
00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:36.750
We we can see it inside that piece of the state that we have created here called input.

443
00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:39.600
No, we can have a condition.

444
00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:40.920
We just say if.

445
00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:43.800
There is no input.

446
00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:47.380
Just return.

447
00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:52.510
So if it is empty or if there is a space.

448
00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:58.930
So how we know that there is a space so we can just use a function called trim.

449
00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:00.910
So I'm going to trim everything.

450
00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:05.950
And if there is a space or something, we're not going to submit the form.

451
00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:08.110
Otherwise.

452
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:17.580
We want to redirect the person to the page, a search page so we can use something called.

453
00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:19.630
And react.

454
00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:25.900
Sorry, the router from the next year so we could import.

455
00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:30.880
A hole called use router.

456
00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:39.000
Which is coming from next forward slash navigation.

457
00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:44.430
Before we were getting the use router in next 12.

458
00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:52.800
From next forward slash router, but in next 13 we get it from next navigation.

459
00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:56.880
So we need to be careful about that.

460
00:36:57.090 --> 00:36:59.880
And now we need to initialize this router.

461
00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:09.030
We just say router is equal to use router and now here we can just use router that push and send the

462
00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:10.380
person to the page.

463
00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:14.310
We would like to be redirected.

464
00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:20.580
So this page you want to redirect them is for slash search for slash web.

465
00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:31.560
And here instead of query, I want to say search term and whatever input is we use for that.

466
00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:35.460
So now let's test it.

467
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:36.910
So now what?

468
00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:45.000
For example, if I write down hello and press enter, I'm going to be redirected to this page for slash

469
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.240
search for slash web.

470
00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:50.530
A question mark.

471
00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:53.060
Search term equals Hello.

472
00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:59.870
Of course, this page is not existed yet, so we are getting an error page.

473
00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:05.380
Could not be fine, but we're going to create this page later inside the inside the course.

474
00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:13.070
So I'm going to first think first we have created this enter enter ability.

475
00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:19.190
Whatever we enter, we submitted, but this button is still doesn't work.

476
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:26.450
So if I click this one, this is not going to read submit the form so we can just go back to our Visual

477
00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:31.220
Studio code and we go to the first button.

478
00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:34.560
Which is related to the.

479
00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:42.800
Google search and here we can add on on click event listener.

480
00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:49.420
Which is going to trigger the same function that we have created.

481
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:50.390
Handle.

482
00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:51.980
Submit.

483
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:58.400
So when we click on this button, this is going to trigger this function.

484
00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:02.680
Here dysfunction.

485
00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:06.280
Okay, so let's try it again.

486
00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:08.740
So we just say, for example, nice.

487
00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:11.140
I click on Google Search.

488
00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:17.890
This is going to be three have the same behavior as pressing enter.

489
00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:18.730
All right.

490
00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:25.370
You can add the same things for this icon or other anywhere in the page.

491
00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:28.290
You can add on click and call that function.

492
00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:30.140
That is fine.

493
00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:36.250
The next thing we want to do is to work on this.

494
00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:38.320
I'm feeling lucky button.

495
00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:48.040
So when we click on it, we want to produce and get in a new vocabulary and we search that vocabulary

496
00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:52.000
and redirect the person to that particular search term.

497
00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:58.630
So we need to add an event listener to the button as well.

498
00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:03.340
So this the first button we have added the handle submit.

499
00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:07.390
The next one we want to do is just add some.

500
00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:16.740
Uh, on click event listener here as well, which is going to trigger another function which called

501
00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:20.410
which is called random search.

502
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:25.970
So we need to create this function at a top.

503
00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:30.170
So here we're going to create another function.

504
00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:32.870
As you can see, we are getting this suggestion.

505
00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:38.840
So this is going to redirect the person to another place.

506
00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:47.120
So first thing first, we need to request and get the random vote from an API.

507
00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:53.150
So the API I want to use is called random.

508
00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:57.540
At Random World API.

509
00:40:57.550 --> 00:41:07.060
If you search random word API in the search result, you see a website with the URL, random word api

510
00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:09.490
dot heroku app dot com.

511
00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:21.600
And here you can see you can just all get all the words or you can get a single word by just adding

512
00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:27.330
this URL, random word, dash API dot oracle dot com for slash word.

513
00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:33.420
So if I copy this one, I paste it inside the browser.

514
00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:35.340
We I get it.

515
00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:36.660
Random word here.

516
00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:42.030
You can see each time I refresh the page, I get a different word.

517
00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:53.370
The reason I see it like this, I have an extension called, uh, I think JSON formatter.

518
00:41:53.640 --> 00:42:00.390
You can install this extension which is helping you to see the JSON files.

519
00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:02.240
Like the otherwise you see it like that.

520
00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:04.590
If you see it like that, that is fine too.

521
00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:08.190
So each time we refresh, you get different world.

522
00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:12.090
So we're going to use this API.

523
00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:15.140
I have already copied this one.

524
00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:19.050
I'm going to come back here inside my this function.

525
00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:20.970
Let me close this function.

526
00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:31.410
So we're going to create create a constant called response.

527
00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:37.750
And this is going to be equal to a weight.

528
00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:44.330
So our weight actually helps us to wait until the response comes from that API.

529
00:42:44.350 --> 00:42:52.210
So I'm going to fetch the API from the address that we have copied, which is the HTTP forward slash.

530
00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:56.650
Add random load API for slash war.

531
00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:59.020
Let me make this one correctly.

532
00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:00.610
Okay.

533
00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:09.540
As we are using a weight, we need to change this function to be asynchronous.

534
00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:11.510
So I'm going to change this function.

535
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:14.690
So we're going to await for this one.

536
00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:18.980
And after that we're going to win the response column.

537
00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:25.190
So we just say then when the response calls, we want to convert the response.

538
00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:29.190
Two JSON file.

539
00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:31.470
So we just say raise.

540
00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:33.550
Forward slash.

541
00:43:34.650 --> 00:43:35.220
And sorry.

542
00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:41.730
We create a function and which we get the response and convert it to JSON.

543
00:43:42.210 --> 00:43:44.280
And also we want to.

544
00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:47.010
Get it.

545
00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:48.960
And then we just say that.

546
00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:52.110
Then we get the data.

547
00:43:55.870 --> 00:43:58.330
We get the data, we get the first one.

548
00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:07.120
I'm sure they they send you one only, but in case of if they send you more than one, you can just

549
00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:09.760
get the first inside the array.

550
00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:11.110
That is fine.

551
00:44:11.110 --> 00:44:12.700
So we got the data.

552
00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:22.520
We want to say if there is no response, return, if, for example, if there is a mistake of.

553
00:44:22.850 --> 00:44:26.180
If the Internet is broken.

554
00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:27.230
So we want to return.

555
00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:30.740
We don't want to submit or redirect the person.

556
00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:34.280
Otherwise, we want to push the person to this URL.

557
00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:37.040
Search for slash web search term.

558
00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:39.110
That response.

559
00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:40.210
Okay.

560
00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:43.700
And so let's try this.

561
00:44:46.090 --> 00:44:51.550
So now if we click on Unfeeling Luckey, we are going to be redirected.

562
00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:54.270
So let's see.

563
00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:57.240
Let's refresh the page now.

564
00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:00.130
Let's try it again.

565
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:06.660
So we have we are redirected to this URL and the search term was jars.

566
00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:13.620
If we try again, we should be get we should get another word.

567
00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:15.120
As you can see, it's working.

568
00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:23.520
But because we are waiting for a response and if the internet is speed is slow, we need to wait for

569
00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:26.310
the response a little bit and then we are redirected.

570
00:45:26.310 --> 00:45:32.790
So this is going to be a little bit uncomfortable for the users in this kind of situation.

571
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:38.460
Mostly developers add some loading effects, so I'm going to add some loading effect here.

572
00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:47.190
So when we press the button, we see a loading, a spanner, and when the vocabulary came, the the

573
00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:53.340
loading is going to be finished and we are redirected to the next page.

574
00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:58.680
So I'm going to add some loading state of a piece of state here.

575
00:45:59.910 --> 00:46:02.610
So I'm going to create a loading space.

576
00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:05.340
So I'm just call it loading.

577
00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:14.820
Or because this is a specific for this one, I'm going to say, let me delete this or I'm just say random

578
00:46:15.810 --> 00:46:18.900
search loading.

579
00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:23.840
And this is going to be.

580
00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:27.230
So this is search.

581
00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:32.430
Okay.

582
00:46:33.110 --> 00:46:34.490
Random search floating.

583
00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:37.250
And this is going to be false by default.

584
00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:44.900
And when we call this function, we want to make this one.

585
00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:49.410
We want to set the.

586
00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:55.390
The random search loading to true when we call this function.

587
00:46:55.630 --> 00:47:04.290
But when we got the response and finish it, we want to set the loading to be false like this.

588
00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:07.510
We just set the random search loading to false.

589
00:47:08.050 --> 00:47:14.050
Now we want to use this piece of state to control and add this spinner.

590
00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:23.170
So instead of just saying I'm feeling lucky, only we want to add a condition here, so I'm going to

591
00:47:23.170 --> 00:47:25.180
add a condition here.

592
00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:28.990
So this is going to be like that.

593
00:47:31.650 --> 00:47:36.020
So as you get this suggestion, this is similar things you want to create.

594
00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:38.220
So random search.

595
00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:46.780
If this random search loading is true.

596
00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:51.510
So now we want to get something.

597
00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:54.810
We want to get an image with this banner.

598
00:47:56.380 --> 00:48:01.120
So we're going to create an image and the source will be an X banner.

599
00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:02.920
So I'm going to create a spinner here.

600
00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:09.460
So let's go to and we want to get the spinner.

601
00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:16.270
I want to use an SVG spinner, so I'm going to use a search for loading IO, which is a website that

602
00:48:16.270 --> 00:48:19.660
gives you free SVG loading effects.

603
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:24.070
So you need to go to loading dot IO and here.

604
00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:31.320
We can just choose these kind of icons which are which are free, but the others are.

605
00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:32.850
You need to pay for.

606
00:48:32.850 --> 00:48:35.370
I'm going to choose the free one like this on.

607
00:48:36.010 --> 00:48:40.750
So we need to set this some make it a specific for this one.

608
00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:46.140
Uh, first thing first, I want to make it transparent.

609
00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:50.400
And also, I want to change this truck to be five.

610
00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:53.130
And let's change the color.

611
00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:56.550
To be, for example, this color.

612
00:48:57.210 --> 00:49:04.020
So now, when you are happy with your spinner, you can just click on the SVG and click on animate it

613
00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:05.310
to download it.

614
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:10.010
So we click on the free download to download it.

615
00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:13.520
We click on download and now we have the file.

616
00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:20.540
We can just drag it to our file and bring it to the public folder next to the fabric SVG and then we

617
00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:24.650
can just change the name of the file to be a spanner.

618
00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:27.680
So we can close this one.

619
00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:34.430
And here inside the CRC we can add this spanner that SVG.

620
00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:40.070
So this one should be, I think should be forward slash.

621
00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:46.420
Now that is okay because it's inside the public folder.

622
00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:47.900
You just need to write down.

623
00:49:48.930 --> 00:49:51.300
And a spinner.

624
00:49:52.310 --> 00:49:59.310
Dot SVG and the alternative text can be loading dot, dot, dot.

625
00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:01.880
Okay.

626
00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:05.990
And then we can just install this one a little bit.

627
00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:13.880
I'm going to add a class name, set a height to be six, and I want to bring it to the center using

628
00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:15.920
text center.

629
00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:23.770
So now if we check our website, let's make a condition, finish the condition.

630
00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:32.990
So after this, if the random search loading is false, we want to have this text here.

631
00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:38.960
I'm feeling like I'm just going to bring it here inside.

632
00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:42.980
Are we getting the suggestion here to.

633
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.400
So the first one.

634
00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:51.160
So let's see.

635
00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:52.270
What's the error?

636
00:50:56.350 --> 00:50:59.010
Oh, we didn't close this here.

637
00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:01.090
Okay.

638
00:51:05.710 --> 00:51:08.190
I think this is shouldn't be.

639
00:51:08.770 --> 00:51:12.790
So when we have a random search loading through, we have the image.

640
00:51:12.790 --> 00:51:15.580
Otherwise we have I'm feeling lucky.

641
00:51:17.230 --> 00:51:18.900
So let's make this fun.

642
00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:27.850
I'm feeling like, okay, now if we check our website.

643
00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:31.050
When we click on I'm Feeling lucky.

644
00:51:31.050 --> 00:51:32.580
We should see this banner.

645
00:51:33.370 --> 00:51:36.460
And we get redirected to this page.

646
00:51:36.670 --> 00:51:44.590
But as you can see, we see this banner in the beginning of the button, so we can fix this one by adding

647
00:51:44.590 --> 00:51:47.980
some styling here.

648
00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:52.340
So the style we have.

649
00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:58.670
So we have added the text center here, which is going to help to bring it to the center.

650
00:51:59.030 --> 00:52:01.220
And the button.

651
00:52:02.650 --> 00:52:07.150
Should have some extra classes as well.

652
00:52:07.450 --> 00:52:10.630
Beside the BTN, we can use the flex.

653
00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:18.730
And items center to bring everything to the center and Justify Condon Center.

654
00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:23.300
So this one brings the everything to the center horizontally and vertically.

655
00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:26.280
And.

656
00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:29.910
Let's see that it came to the center.

657
00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:32.890
Okay, now it's in the center.

658
00:52:32.890 --> 00:52:36.910
But another problem is when we click, we can click it again.

659
00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:40.000
So this is going to make a problem.

660
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:45.580
So we want to disable the button when the loading effect is true.

661
00:52:45.850 --> 00:52:49.120
So we can add some condition here.

662
00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:51.280
We just say disable the button.

663
00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:55.510
When the.

664
00:52:56.350 --> 00:53:00.240
Random search loading is true.

665
00:53:00.250 --> 00:53:04.750
And then we want to install the button for the disable as well.

666
00:53:04.750 --> 00:53:07.660
We just say if the this is disabled.

667
00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:15.520
Just add the opacity to be, for example, 80%.

668
00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:19.450
So this is going to decrease the color of the button.

669
00:53:19.450 --> 00:53:21.610
So let me zoom this one.

670
00:53:21.610 --> 00:53:23.500
You can see it better.

671
00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:25.530
So when we click on ADD.

672
00:53:27.330 --> 00:53:32.910
They see the spinner and this is disabled and we are redirected to the different page.

673
00:53:38.550 --> 00:53:41.540
I think that's it for creating the body section.

674
00:53:41.550 --> 00:53:47.160
Let's add this one to GitHub so we can review what we have done.

675
00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:50.220
I'm going to stop this server using Contour C.

676
00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:52.540
Now all.

677
00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:53.290
We didn't need it.

678
00:53:53.290 --> 00:53:54.000
Actually, I want it.

679
00:53:54.010 --> 00:53:57.100
You can use a source controller using contour shift G.

680
00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:07.680
Okay, So we can click here on this icon to add everything to GitHub and we can create a.

681
00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:14.380
Message saying ad body section.

682
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:23.960
So we can just click here and click on Commit and push to push everything to get up.

683
00:54:24.170 --> 00:54:27.590
So let's go back to our GitHub and really refresh the page.

684
00:54:27.590 --> 00:54:33.980
We should see now five commands, which is the the last one is at body section.

685
00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:43.490
Let's review what we have done here As we have used a page, an image from Wikipedia, we have added

686
00:54:43.490 --> 00:54:45.620
the domain inside.

687
00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:49.220
The next conflict is this is the rule of next.

688
00:54:49.250 --> 00:54:50.020
Yes.

689
00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:56.360
So we need to add any foreign and external URL.

690
00:54:56.360 --> 00:55:02.470
Inside this section we have added and a spinner inside the public folder.

691
00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:07.340
So we just got it from this website loading that I Oh.

692
00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:13.560
And inside the glow was that CSS.

693
00:55:13.570 --> 00:55:19.630
We have added a custom Tilman CSS class, which is called BTN.

694
00:55:20.110 --> 00:55:24.640
So we have used this BTN in two buttons, so simply.

695
00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:29.430
Inside the page that is X.

696
00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:37.050
We have added an image for the Google using the image component of next year.

697
00:55:37.050 --> 00:55:43.590
And also we have added another component called Home Search because this home search is client side.

698
00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:52.350
We have made it separately in a different component so this page can stay to be set aside.

699
00:55:54.210 --> 00:56:02.010
So we have created a component called Home Search dot Gsx, which is client side, as I mentioned.

700
00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:09.780
And we have imported user stage used router and some couple of icons from React icons.

701
00:56:11.610 --> 00:56:14.310
We have initialized router here.

702
00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:23.490
And we have created a piece of state called input to track the changes inside the input, the search

703
00:56:23.490 --> 00:56:24.330
input.

704
00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:31.350
And also we have created another piece of state for tracking the loading effect inside the button.

705
00:56:31.650 --> 00:56:33.180
I'm feeling lucky.

706
00:56:34.290 --> 00:56:41.370
We have created a function called Handle Submit, which is going to firstly prevent the default behavior

707
00:56:41.370 --> 00:56:44.190
of submission, which is refreshing the page.

708
00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:53.000
Then if the input exists, we are going to push the person or redirect the user to this URL search for

709
00:56:53.010 --> 00:56:57.210
a web search term which we are getting from the input.

710
00:56:58.470 --> 00:57:06.820
We have also created another function which is in synchronous for creating the random word.

711
00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:10.170
We get the random word from this API URL.

712
00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:14.610
And we redirect the person to this URL.

713
00:57:14.610 --> 00:57:20.400
And also we have set the loading effect through at the before the phishing and after the phishing,

714
00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:22.080
we set it to be false.

715
00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:31.230
And finally, in the return, we have created a form which is going to resubmit and trigger this function

716
00:57:31.230 --> 00:57:32.460
and will submit.

717
00:57:32.490 --> 00:57:40.740
We have added an icon here, an input which is going to track the changes inside the input using an

718
00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:42.840
unchanged event listener.

719
00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:47.920
And we have added another icon for the microphone.

720
00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:52.210
And finally, at the end, we have added two buttons.

721
00:57:52.210 --> 00:57:59.920
First, which is going to submit the the form using this button Google search.

722
00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:08.390
And we have another button for I'm Feeling Lucky button, which is disabled when the random search loading

723
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:09.260
is true.

724
00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:16.130
Also, we have added another click event listener which is calling another function random search.

725
00:58:17.340 --> 00:58:20.010
And we have added a condition here.

726
00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:27.510
We just said if the random random search loading is true, we want to show this image.

727
00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:30.210
Otherwise, we want to see this text.

728
00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:31.560
I'm feeling lucky.

729
00:58:32.370 --> 00:58:37.530
So that was it for creating the.

730
00:58:38.980 --> 00:58:39.700
Our.

731
00:58:40.380 --> 00:58:41.940
Body section.

732
00:58:41.940 --> 00:58:46.710
In the next section, we're going to work on the footer of our project.

733
00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:51.180
If you look at the final version, we see the footer at the bottom.

734
00:58:51.300 --> 00:58:55.410
It is always at the bottom in any any zoom level.

735
00:58:55.410 --> 00:58:56.670
It's always in the bottom.

736
00:58:56.670 --> 00:59:04.200
So I'm going to show you how to create a footer that always stay at the bottom, bottom of your page

737
00:59:04.290 --> 00:59:05.780
no matter what.

738
00:59:05.790 --> 00:59:13.770
And also, as you can see, this footer is common between the whole page and also for the.

739
00:59:14.570 --> 00:59:16.430
Page related to the results.

740
00:59:16.430 --> 00:59:25.700
So we're going to add this footer to the layout of the home page, which is going to be common in all

741
00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:26.180
pages.

742
00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:35.510
So I'm going to show you how to use the layout feature of next JHS 13 to have such a system that, for

743
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:38.120
example, this footer always stays there.

744
00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:43.490
And also the other things you see that we see the country that I'm here now.

745
00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:46.910
Now under travel in Vietnam.

746
00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:49.880
So you see the Vietnam country.

747
00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:53.180
So I'm going to show you how to use an API.

748
00:59:53.790 --> 00:59:58.020
To get the country of the user that is using your website.

749
00:59:58.020 --> 00:59:59.910
I show their country here.

750
1:00:00.120 --> 1:00:04.370
So if you refresh the page, you see first we have the United States.

751
1:00:04.380 --> 1:00:09.120
But when the fishing is done, we get the country of the person.

752
1:00:09.660 --> 1:00:14.070
So see in the next section for the footer part of the project.
