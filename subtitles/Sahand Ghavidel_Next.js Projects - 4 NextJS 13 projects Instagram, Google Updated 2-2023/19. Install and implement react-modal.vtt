1
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.150
All right.

2
00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:16.250
In the last section, we have completed the installation of a recoil, which is a state management for

3
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.670
React.

4
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:27.620
Now, when we click on the chat icon, we see that, uh, we added this, the model is open.

5
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.860
He added the state of open.

6
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.710
Well, globally inside the recoil.

7
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:35.280
Okay.

8
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:42.500
In this section we are going to install react models and we are going to have a model like the final

9
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.980
version.

10
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.060
Let me show you the final version that's here.

11
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:54.740
Now, if you click on the chat icon, you see a model pop up.

12
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.010
And if we click on outside.

13
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.760
It's going to close.

14
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.850
And also, we have a close button here as well.

15
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.860
And then we have the information of the person who posted this.

16
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.380
Plus the post techs.

17
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.980
Then we have an input here similar to the input that we have.

18
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.230
Here so we can, uh, like, uh, get the.

19
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.830
Quote from this part.

20
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.140
And also at the end, we have the reply instead of tweet.

21
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.650
So when we write down something, we can reply.

22
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:44.380
And this is going to be added to the comment section and you're going to be redirected to a new page

23
00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:45.790
with all the comments.

24
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:47.220
Okay.

25
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:48.280
Uh.

26
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.090
Let's install react model.

27
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.320
Let's search react model.

28
00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.770
Uh, let me close everything.

29
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.020
Just go to Google.

30
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.960
Oh.

31
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:05.440
They just.

32
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:08.380
Uh.

33
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.770
React model.

34
00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:21.890
And we in the results section we see a website NPM just dot com package react model.

35
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.320
And if you click on this.

36
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.020
Yeah, we got to be.

37
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.640
As you can see, it's a very popular package.

38
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.600
Almost more than one and a half million installation every week.

39
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.400
And we have to install that.

40
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.710
Yeah.

41
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.940
Installation.

42
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.890
Uh.

43
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.500
Here.

44
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.660
And then we have the API document.

45
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.660
First we need to install it using this.

46
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.150
Then we have a example here.

47
00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.300
The only thing we need to do is to wrap.

48
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:08.800
Everything with this model component that we can import from a React model then.

49
00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:18.860
Where we if we have a state of open so we put the open here when the open is true, this model is going

50
00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.270
to be pop up.

51
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.840
Then if it click outside, we need to set the open to be false.

52
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.410
This is the case for clicking outside.

53
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.020
We don't need to touch anything else.

54
00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.310
We're going to add our own style using children's.

55
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.920
Yes.

56
00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.750
So let's copy this app install and we go back to Visual Studio code.

57
00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.720
We stop the server using controversy and we paste the code here.

58
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:55.350
So, uh.

59
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.650
The installation has been completed.

60
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:09.280
Let's just start the server again and inside the comment model that we have created.

61
00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:11.780
At the top.

62
00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:24.350
We need to import uh, we just imported directly modal modal non model from React.

63
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.760
Moral.

64
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:34.140
Okay, Dan, we just need to wrap everything there.

65
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:40.380
So we just delete this one and then see if the open is true.

66
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:50.010
Then let's add a practice this year, and inside this parenthesis, we just have this model of components.

67
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.640
Okay.

68
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.430
And we just add something like ah1 saying comment.

69
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:01.670
Model.

70
00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.560
Um.

71
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.250
As here I mentioned, we need to add the EAS open.

72
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.450
This is going to be camel case and is open.

73
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.160
It should be equal to open.

74
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.690
So when the open is true, the model is going to pop up.

75
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.500
So let's test this in our browser.

76
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.480
Let's go to our website, this refresh to page.

77
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.770
Now, we shouldn't see this part because.

78
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:35.250
We remove it.

79
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:40.260
And now if you click on the, uh, chat icon.

80
00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:42.450
Oh, we get it.

81
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.440
And your models?

82
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.000
I write down model again.

83
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.840
Just should be model.

84
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.700
Model.

85
00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.260
Model.

86
00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.660
Okay, let's change this.

87
00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.480
So let's try again.

88
00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:06.960
Right now we can see the model here, but this is it a little bit big.

89
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.700
So the things I do is just let's add some styling to it.

90
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:22.480
So we go back to here and we just add a class name and the style we want to add.

91
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:33.160
Firstly, we want to limit the max with to be large and we just say width to be 90%.

92
00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.590
This is for the mobile screen.

93
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.530
Then, uh.

94
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:51.650
Well, let's just make it position absolute and bring it to the top 24, which is, uh, 96 pixels from

95
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:52.100
the top.

96
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:59.020
Then from the left, I want it to be in the exactly in the center.

97
00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.750
So we just say left 50%.

98
00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:07.240
But this is going to bring the edge of the the left edge to the center.

99
00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:15.220
So in order to bring this center to the center, we just need to add translate x.

100
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.850
This fund should be at -50%.

101
00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:23.440
Okay.

102
00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:28.330
And let's change the background color to be white.

103
00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:34.890
Let's add a border of two and make it rounded.

104
00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.530
And let's make it a rounded x large.

105
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.050
And let's add a shadow of.

106
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:43.750
Mm hmm.

107
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.070
Medium.

108
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:46.780
Two.

109
00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:48.230
Okay, let's check.

110
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:53.050
Now let's refresh the page.

111
00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:58.480
Yeah.

112
00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.950
It's a bit big.

113
00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:04.520
Let me see.

114
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:08.450
Uh.

115
00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:15.700
I think Max with I made a.

116
00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:17.670
And Max.

117
00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.200
Max with.

118
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.670
I know just right now, Max.

119
00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:22.410
Sorry about that.

120
00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.790
Now it should work.

121
00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:25.110
Yeah.

122
00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.250
This is the size.

123
00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:32.270
And when we add more things, it's going to be bigger as it.

124
00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.120
Because if you want to have an input inside.

125
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.200
But just for now let's add height to.

126
00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.690
So just say height 300 pixels.

127
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:45.480
But we're going to remove this later because we don't need it.

128
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.180
We want it to be dynamic.

129
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:47.750
Okay.

130
00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:50.580
Uh.

131
00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:58.890
And then let's add that on close on request close as well.

132
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.450
So on.

133
00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.840
Request clothes.

134
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.500
This is going to be a function.

135
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:14.550
And, uh, their function is going to set the open to be false.

136
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:18.360
So now by clicking on outside.

137
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:23.670
We can close it like this anywhere outside.

138
00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:27.140
Okay.

139
00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:36.230
Uh, let's change the border color to it's, uh, looks a little bit on the border is a bit thick,

140
00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:38.840
and now let's change the border.

141
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.270
Color to be gray.

142
00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.430
For example, 400.

143
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:46.740
Maybe.

144
00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:01.530
Let's make it to Honduras.

145
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.910
I think this is the default border.

146
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:07.470
We are getting.

147
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
I think this is just, uh, for this browser.

148
00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:17.970
Uh, let's continue.

149
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:19.110
Completed.

150
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:21.430
And later, we think about that.

151
00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:21.840
Okay.

152
00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.180
So no.

153
00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:26.200
Uh.

154
00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:34.730
Let's continue at the closing button so we can add that on to.

155
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:36.460
Okay.

156
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:39.860
Let's go back to Visual Studio code and.

157
00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:51.100
We need to add a icon, which is a that we already use before.

158
00:10:52.150 --> 00:11:01.300
So now inside is more or less additive and this is just going to add a padding.

159
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:03.490
And inside this.

160
00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.110
We're going to have another death.

161
00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:10.920
And.

162
00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:20.150
So this step is going to be like if if we check here.

163
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:27.240
Final version, we have a div here that has a border button for the bottom off.

164
00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.640
Uh, you can see.

165
00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:35.700
So first we have this div and we have another div for this icon.

166
00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:37.120
Okay.

167
00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.510
So we for this dev.

168
00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.440
We just, uh.

169
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:50.760
First let's add the icon and then we can see the effects better.

170
00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:55.080
So let's add icon inside a diff.

171
00:11:55.260 --> 00:12:01.380
The icon name is its icon and this is going to be from hero icons.

172
00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:02.460
Forward slash react.

173
00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:05.970
Forward slash outline then.

174
00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:12.410
Let's close this app for the icon.

175
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.930
Just make it a little bit smaller.

176
00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:23.760
Let's add it, uh, make it 22 pixels and we change the color to be gray.

177
00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:25.740
700.

178
00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:30.510
Let's see.

179
00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:32.320
Now.

180
00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:33.540
We can't sit here.

181
00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:42.670
And if that is covering the icon, let me bring it next to each other so we can see what we are doing.

182
00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.190
Let's close this side.

183
00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:46.750
Okay.

184
00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:50.250
Well, it was covering this.

185
00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:51.880
Uh, we can.

186
00:12:53.910 --> 00:13:02.520
We just add that hover effect that we used before for the other things, and now we want to bring this

187
00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:03.870
icon to the center.

188
00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:10.650
So first we add, we change the width to be nine and height should be nine.

189
00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:22.750
Then we use Flex to be able to bring the icon to the center using item center and justify sent.

190
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:29.290
Okay.

191
00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.360
Now it should come inside.

192
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:34.180
Then, uh.

193
00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:38.250
That's fine.

194
00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:43.490
For the diff that is covering this.

195
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:46.820
As you can see now we can see the border gone.

196
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:53.450
Uh, sometimes we can see, or sometimes not just change the border more.

197
00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:54.950
Yeah, that's fine.

198
00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:55.460
It's better.

199
00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:57.320
Okay.

200
00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.020
For this year.

201
00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:04.120
We want to add a border at the bottom.

202
00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:06.370
So just say border be.

203
00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:13.790
And we changed the border colour to be grey.

204
00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.010
200.

205
00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:19.900
And, uh.

206
00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:27.780
Let's add a padding and a y axis of two and an x axis of one and a half.

207
00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:30.200
Okay.

208
00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:32.780
That looks better now.

209
00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:38.470
And, uh, yeah, that's, that's it.

210
00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:45.440
And let's add the on click to the icon as well or we can add it to this there.

211
00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:48.200
So we just stay on click.

212
00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:53.350
And this Arncliffe is going to sit the open.

213
00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:56.780
To be false as well.

214
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:02.090
So this is going to close the.

215
00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.890
Model two like this.

216
00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.650
Now we have two options for closing them up.

217
00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:12.060
Okay.

218
00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:18.550
Now we, uh, we want to get the information, if Post's information.

219
00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:27.940
In order to do that, we need to add a state, but we cannot use the component level state.

220
00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:39.310
If we want to get that I.D. from each post and each post is from different component and we want to

221
00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:46.570
pass this one to the main component, which is the fit that yes.

222
00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:49.510
So we need to use a global state.

223
00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:54.490
So in order to use the global state now you already know we can use the recoil.

224
00:15:55.630 --> 00:16:04.620
So and inside the model atom that yes, we can just add another uh.

225
00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:10.130
So we just need to copy this one time.

226
00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:14.360
And this is state.

227
00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:19.100
We just call it, uh, post I.D..

228
00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:25.600
First.

229
00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:26.710
I'd like this.

230
00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:33.660
And this one is going to be post IED, too.

231
00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:37.750
And the default value is an empty string.

232
00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:38.620
Okay.

233
00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:49.270
Now inside post touches here that is having all of them.

234
00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:58.090
Okay, each post we can get that as state and updated as well.

235
00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:09.220
So here at a top we can copy this open recall of state and we just changed the open.

236
00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:12.650
Let's see.

237
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:20.530
The Open is going to be post I.D..

238
00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:27.170
And this is supposed to be the camel case and the.

239
00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:29.280
This is.

240
00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.110
Post.

241
00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:35.280
I'd stay too and we need to import it as well.

242
00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:40.840
So we need to import it from atom model.

243
00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:52.530
Okay, now we can when we click on this chat icon, we not only we open the model, we can get the idea

244
00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:59.730
of this each post and we pass it to this global states.

245
00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.280
Okay, so chat icon.

246
00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:07.860
Instead of just doing that, we open a curly braces here and.

247
00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:13.070
That this bring this one inside.

248
00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:23.050
We sit this one open or before even opening, we can just, uh, set the post I.D. first.

249
00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:28.840
So just a set post ID, and we set it to be there.

250
00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:29.910
Post I.D..

251
00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:33.500
Which is that we can just suppose that Idi.

252
00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:39.690
We have access to the ID because we are getting the ID here.

253
00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:43.710
And let me increase the size.

254
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:48.240
We are getting the idea from the top.

255
00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:53.470
Here we are getting to post and then.

256
00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:56.270
We can pass the I.D..

257
00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.360
Now we can there.

258
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:05.100
It's just the save to the global state.

259
00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:08.580
Now we can use it in any any component that we want.

260
00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:15.330
For example, we can use it inside the comment model so we can just get it here.

261
00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:19.050
So we just copy this one again.

262
00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:25.200
And this is going to be post IED and this is.

263
00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:27.810
Most IED.

264
00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:31.480
And we don't need to do any.

265
00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:33.520
We don't need to change it.

266
00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.440
We just want the information we get.

267
00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:39.280
And then we just can.

268
00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:44.150
Uh, let me just show it here.

269
00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:47.880
Just, uh.

270
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:53.870
Just here, we added each one.

271
00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:55.520
I would just say.

272
00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:00.050
Post it.

273
00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:02.330
Let's test it.

274
00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.340
So post I.D. is status 95.

275
00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:12.710
So we just need to import this have from ATM.

276
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:13.400
Okay.

277
00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:15.830
No.

278
00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:19.720
When we click on this posts, we should get the idea of the posts.

279
00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:20.250
See?

280
00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:23.280
Three F's s three.

281
00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:25.650
And this is this idea is different.

282
00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.200
This idea is different, too.

283
00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:29.610
Okay.

284
00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:40.140
So based on this information, this post idea, we can now get the post data from the, uh, from the

285
00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:43.800
fire store and show it inside our model.

286
00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:44.850
Okay.

287
00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:47.400
So, uh.

288
00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:49.400
Let's.

289
00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:51.890
Let's do it.

290
00:20:51.910 --> 00:21:01.090
But before doing that, I'll want to redirect that person to the signing page if the person is not authorized.

291
00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:03.600
So now this one is pop up.

292
00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:08.080
But when we are not logged in.

293
00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:10.410
Like now.

294
00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:11.560
Okay.

295
00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:16.330
We still can put a comment.

296
00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:16.800
Okay.

297
00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:22.480
But I want to redirect the person to the signing page when we think it's like this.

298
00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:26.470
The same things we did for the like functionality.

299
00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:34.270
Now, when we I want to like this post, I want to be redirected to the signing page.

300
00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:35.230
Okay.

301
00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:38.200
Let's do the same things for the chat icon to.

302
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:41.900
So inside post 30 years.

303
00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:49.160
Let's go to the chat icon section that we added this.

304
00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:53.290
And thinks so.

305
00:21:53.560 --> 00:22:01.270
First, instead of just directly doing that, we just add a condition and say, if the person is not

306
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:03.640
signing off, this session is not existed.

307
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.130
We want to.

308
00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:11.810
Redirect to the signing page.

309
00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:15.320
Okay.

310
00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:17.950
But.

311
00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:21.590
Otherwise we want to get.

312
00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:24.140
This idea.

313
00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:24.650
Okay.

314
00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:26.450
Now let's try it.

315
00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:32.570
So now when we click on the chat icon, we should be redirected to the signing page.

316
00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:34.640
And if we sign in.

317
00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:45.640
We should be able to open a model like this.

318
00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:46.100
Okay.

319
00:22:50.330 --> 00:23:00.580
So now we can use this information, the post ID to get the information to get the data from the Pfizer.

320
00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:03.770
So in order to get the data from Pfizer.

321
00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:06.170
So we need to use use effects.

322
00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:10.340
So let's go to comment model.

323
00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:15.590
And here at a top we add use effects.

324
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:27.760
So use the is going to take a function and a dependency dependency is the post I.D. because when the

325
00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:35.020
post I.D. changes, we want to request again and also our database.

326
00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:38.470
So let's import use effects.

327
00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:43.590
So you're not getting the other suggestions.

328
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:45.670
So let's import it manually.

329
00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:50.110
We just use effects from.

330
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.890
React.

331
00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:54.150
Okay.

332
00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:56.740
Uh, we need to import TV as well.

333
00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:02.200
TV is coming from Firebase and inside the function.

334
00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:08.390
You want to use the on snapshot as we did before.

335
00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:10.970
So we just say on Snapshot.

336
00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:22.020
And Enhanced Upshot is going to take the dock and for the document we want to go inside the DB and then

337
00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:25.620
posts and inside the post.

338
00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:30.660
We want to target one post which is the post with the post ID.

339
00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:33.780
Then.

340
00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:38.650
And I think that is going to return is a snapshot.

341
00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:45.270
And a snapshot is going to we can set the post.

342
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:50.920
To be a snapshot.

343
00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:56.550
Uh, just a snapshot that ducks.

344
00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:58.410
Okay.

345
00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:04.410
Now we need to import on a snapshot phone file store.

346
00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:07.680
We need to import, uh.

347
00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:09.230
Dark.

348
00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:12.520
Okay.

349
00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.010
So we are getting an error.

350
00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:16.970
This error.

351
00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:22.790
I just wanted to intentionally get the error and show you how to solve it.

352
00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:33.710
So we said invalid document reference and the problem of firebase and fire stories that we when the.

353
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:41.680
Plus it is an empty string if you get the error as this should be something you know some.

354
00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:47.800
So inside the model atom instead of putting the default to empty string, we just.

355
00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:51.370
We put something random or just we just write it.

356
00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:52.430
It.

357
00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.130
This one can be anything.

358
00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:56.330
Okay.

359
00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:58.060
Uh.

360
00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:00.630
Now we are getting another error.

361
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:01.460
That's, uh.

362
00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:04.720
Let me see.

363
00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:07.980
Said Post is not defined.

364
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:11.740
Said Post.

365
00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:14.600
Uh.

366
00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:17.320
Now.

367
00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.770
We should have set the bar.

368
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:27.950
Actually, we didn't make the posts as states, so we need to have a.

369
00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:30.660
Posts.

370
00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:43.440
And said post and this is going to be equal to use a state is not to use recoil because this is just

371
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:49.290
a component level state and the initial value will be.

372
00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:51.880
Uh, just.

373
00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:53.050
I think, uh.

374
00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:58.590
You know, just empty wi fi or.

375
00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:02.530
Uh, it's.

376
00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:06.040
It's an object that I think we just need to empty.

377
00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:06.490
Object.

378
00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:10.790
And, uh.

379
00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:16.710
Suppose we need to import use state.

380
00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:19.080
So we import it here.

381
00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:21.540
Use the state.

382
00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:25.980
So let's try it now actually.

383
00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:29.830
Where let's at least show something here.

384
00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:33.630
So instead of just post it, we just say post.

385
00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:35.310
Um.

386
00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:37.980
That username.

387
00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:42.800
For example, we can get the username.

388
00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:47.280
Let's protect ourselves too, as.

389
00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:49.410
Okay.

390
00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:52.960
Let's click.

391
00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:54.340
Yeah.

392
00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:56.870
We don't see anything yet.

393
00:27:58.270 --> 00:27:59.320
Let me check.

394
00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:01.640
So said post.

395
00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:04.400
It's not just post.

396
00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:06.770
It's just the post data.

397
00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:09.920
That's use.

398
00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:12.550
Now let's try it again.

399
00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:19.250
Let's refresh the page.

400
00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:28.600
Okay.

401
00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:29.740
Let's see.

402
00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:34.600
The problem is this docs.

403
00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:36.340
We just need we don't need it.

404
00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:45.970
We just delete it because it's inside the, uh, in, inside the, uh, the document.

405
00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:48.130
It's not the collection.

406
00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:55.000
So we just, we don't need for when we are getting the post it inside, we don't need to add the docs.

407
00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:57.370
So now let's try.

408
00:28:58.500 --> 00:28:59.260
It's working.

409
00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:00.090
Getting the.

410
00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:04.190
User username.

411
00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:06.920
Let's add something with this username.

412
00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:09.200
Folks are just say hello.

413
00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:15.800
Now, when they click here, we get the user ID of this person.

414
00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:17.710
Okay.

415
00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:21.490
So.

416
00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:27.040
And now we just need to really get the data and show it.

417
00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:31.840
Like the one in the final version here.

418
00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:34.270
We want to make it like this.

419
00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:36.370
The image user name.

420
00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:38.890
Sorry, the name.

421
00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:40.120
The user name.

422
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:45.160
And we have the date time that is published.

423
00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:48.880
Then we have the post texts.

424
00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:51.240
Okay.

425
00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:55.390
So this is really similar to here.

426
00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:56.460
Okay.

427
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:58.960
We can just get this one and this image.

428
00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:01.810
So we can just go.

429
00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:03.400
This is coming from post.

430
00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:06.070
So we can go just to the post that J.S..

431
00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:11.170
And, uh, let's check here.

432
00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:12.850
We can just, uh.

433
00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:15.750
This is user image.

434
00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.840
We can bring it there to.

435
00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:22.450
So we copied this.

436
00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:36.430
We go to comment model and just after the X icon and here we we don't need this one we don't need this,

437
00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:38.080
uh, user name.

438
00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:42.070
We add the image here, we just paste the image.

439
00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:44.510
No, uh.

440
00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:46.930
Let's see.

441
00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:49.090
What we are getting.

442
00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:50.350
We are getting the image.

443
00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:51.550
That's nice.

444
00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:53.920
And the.

445
00:30:57.190 --> 00:31:04.210
Let's just add a diff that we can just add some padding or other things.

446
00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:11.530
So we just added div here and inside that div at this image.

447
00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:14.670
And then here.

448
00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:18.200
Let's close this one.

449
00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:21.120
Okay.

450
00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:23.460
We can just add some padding.

451
00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:27.330
So we push them something inside.

452
00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:31.530
Just say padding of two.

453
00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:35.900
Okay, then, uh.

454
00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:41.240
Let's add the other things as well.

455
00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:48.230
So inside the poster, two years after the image we had, uh, the.

456
00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:54.740
This post user data.

457
00:31:55.770 --> 00:32:01.560
So we just copy from this h for to this span.

458
00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:05.780
And we pasted just after the image.

459
00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:16.070
So we should get an error because we didn't import the moment so we can and we need to import moment

460
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:17.310
from react moment.

461
00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:19.850
So let's see.

462
00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:24.690
And getting another error.

463
00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:31.250
This is just data didn't come.

464
00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:35.180
So let's refresh the page and try again.

465
00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:37.000
We need to protect our stuff.

466
00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:37.490
That's a.

467
00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:39.220
It tanks.

468
00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:40.720
We just need to.

469
00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:46.090
Sometimes the data comes later before opening the model.

470
00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:49.960
So we need to protect us.

471
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:54.160
So after post, we just need to add to the question mark.

472
00:32:57.970 --> 00:32:58.320
Okay.

473
00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:03.950
Now.

474
00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:06.220
We try again.

475
00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:14.720
So here you just had a question mark here as well.

476
00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:22.860
Let's try it.

477
00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:29.190
Okay.

478
00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:32.170
Now we can see, but they're next to each other.

479
00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:40.180
So in a top tier we just change the display to flex it, bring them next to each other, and then we

480
00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:46.930
do it in center to bring them in the center horizontally.

481
00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:52.810
Then we can add a space between them using a space.

482
00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:55.310
Ex of one.

483
00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:00.820
So that's nice.

484
00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:05.290
Uh, that's fine.

485
00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:07.850
And then I want to add that line here.

486
00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:13.840
If you look at the final version, we have a line between these two images.

487
00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:20.330
This is a person who posted the tweet and this is the person who is going to reply.

488
00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:25.260
So we want to add this line in order to use the line.

489
00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:29.000
I want to just add a s pen empty span.

490
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.760
But, uh, let's, uh.

491
00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:36.320
Just put this band here.

492
00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:39.130
But this is just empty.

493
00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:42.530
But it has a class name.

494
00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:46.190
Uh, it's empty.

495
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:49.580
So with me, we just can do it like a self-closing.

496
00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:52.220
So now.

497
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:55.250
I wanted to have a width of.

498
00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:59.900
Uh, point five.

499
00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:01.600
Uh.

500
00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:02.770
Let's see.

501
00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:06.980
And then, uh.

502
00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:13.600
The next thing is just the height of full.

503
00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:22.140
Soon as we're going to see it first lit and then I want it to be behind the picture.

504
00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:33.000
So the index should be minus one, then let's make it absolute and we position it on the left to be

505
00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:37.230
eight and top to be 11.

506
00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:44.510
We cannot see it at because we want to it should be ability to do this there.

507
00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:51.240
So we just change that pause, uh, position to be relative to the top there.

508
00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:56.430
Then let's change the background to be grey.

509
00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:58.650
300.

510
00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:02.610
So let's try it again.

511
00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:09.530
Let's see.

512
00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:25.080
And I think we cannot use the width point five.

513
00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:27.720
We can use the 0.5.

514
00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:29.710
That's a correct one.

515
00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:31.290
So now we can see it here.

516
00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:37.250
In the now it's just the nut position correctly.

517
00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:39.060
We want it to be exactly here.

518
00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:41.790
And also, I don't know why this.

519
00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:47.100
This icons got smaller.

520
00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:48.810
So let's fix that on to.

521
00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:56.490
So first, let's bring this one more to the right here.

522
00:36:57.930 --> 00:36:59.100
And, uh.

523
00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:04.270
So this left is not correct.

524
00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:06.890
So left it now.

525
00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:07.520
Exactly.

526
00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:07.970
Here.

527
00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:11.550
And this phone automatically got.

528
00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:15.180
Oh, this is when it's large.

529
00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:16.440
It's so small.

530
00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:20.340
Okay, so see what the problem.

531
00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:23.120
So age 20.

532
00:37:28.330 --> 00:37:29.170
So.

533
00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:40.860
Relax.

534
00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:43.220
Is fine.

535
00:37:47.650 --> 00:37:49.780
Let's play with this number.

536
00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:57.680
So make this fun bigger like the 20.

537
00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:03.680
So the problem is this.

538
00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:04.270
Nine.

539
00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:08.470
So maybe this is the above.

540
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:11.000
Okay.

541
00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:14.130
So we make it bigger.

542
00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:24.920
And this one.

543
00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:27.450
Just make it 30.

544
00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:33.310
But this one doesn't have any effect.

545
00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:39.790
So we just make it forever.

546
00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:48.800
Let's remove the padding here.

547
00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:54.860
Okay.

548
00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:56.270
I think it's fine.

549
00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:56.510
Yeah.

550
00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:57.950
Just, uh.

551
00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:04.100
Should I do it later in the update.

552
00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:08.270
So I have to Spencer on now this one became so big so.

553
00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:14.040
We make it, we should make it actually responsive.

554
00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:17.970
So for just, uh.

555
00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:22.580
Yeah.

556
00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:23.780
Just leave it.

557
00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:26.540
That's 23 pixels.

558
00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:29.620
That's fine.

559
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:35.480
Okay.

560
00:39:36.590 --> 00:39:37.730
Let's move on.

561
00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:45.440
And, uh, we need to just get the information for the person who wants the post that is coming from

562
00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:46.940
a position we can easily get it.

563
00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:53.120
So inside the comment model, we need to import use session.

564
00:39:56.050 --> 00:39:57.040
We import.

565
00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:00.120
U.S..

566
00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:02.250
From.

567
00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:06.450
I think most of the reacts.

568
00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:10.030
Not just nicks.

569
00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:11.500
Nicks.

570
00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:13.180
Off.

571
00:40:14.410 --> 00:40:14.600
Oh.

572
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:15.000
Slash.

573
00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:15.340
Yeah.

574
00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:16.110
Yeah.

575
00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:19.720
Then we need to initialize it.

576
00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:22.430
Here.

577
00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:24.080
We chose a concert.

578
00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:27.210
Session.

579
00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:29.670
Now we need to get the data.

580
00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:33.360
And we just called the data station.

581
00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:35.100
And this is coming.

582
00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:39.810
This is going to be equal to use session.

583
00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:44.610
Yeah.

584
00:40:44.610 --> 00:40:51.930
Actually, uh, this part, uh, if you look at the final version.

585
00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:56.920
Uh.

586
00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:00.340
This version.

587
00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:05.020
This part is very similar to the input that we have.

588
00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:06.930
All the way.

589
00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:16.050
You see it's very similar so we can copy the code from the input as well.

590
00:41:16.050 --> 00:41:25.560
So we can open the input and uh, let's copy everything and then we can delete the unnecessary parts.

591
00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:30.300
So from this part to the end.

592
00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:36.800
We copy every time we go to comment model.

593
00:41:39.070 --> 00:41:40.060
And just.

594
00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:42.020
After this.

595
00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:44.230
A span here.

596
00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:59.120
Uh, we can just paste that, and we just need to remove such some parts, uh, from here.

597
00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:08.390
We don't need to say if the session is exhausted or something like that, so we can delete that on first.

598
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:13.820
Then we don't need the image part or loading section.

599
00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:17.520
Uh, not this one.

600
00:42:17.770 --> 00:42:20.580
The selected file that we were showing the image.

601
00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:23.340
And, uh.

602
00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:25.590
Let's see.

603
00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:28.920
We should get some errors.

604
00:42:30.570 --> 00:42:31.740
Sign out.

605
00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:32.290
Uh.

606
00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:37.380
And heading out for the image.

607
00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:38.550
We added a sign out.

608
00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:41.490
We don't need this sign out actually for the image.

609
00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:43.530
So we remove it.

610
00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:46.410
So refresh.

611
00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:50.460
One by one, we get the error and we fix it.

612
00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:52.920
So you said input is not defined.

613
00:42:55.070 --> 00:42:56.060
Inputs.

614
00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:01.110
We need to create the input here.

615
00:43:01.110 --> 00:43:06.510
So if we just copy this, we just say input.

616
00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:10.070
Set inputs.

617
00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:14.620
And this is going to be an empty strip.

618
00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:17.600
Okay.

619
00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:19.310
Let's try again.

620
00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:26.500
Loading is not defined.

621
00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:29.680
We need we don't need loading actually here.

622
00:43:32.590 --> 00:43:36.720
So we delete this part with this fraction.

623
00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:40.910
Okay.

624
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:51.470
Let's refresh the page.

625
00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:54.980
Okay.

626
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.320
Photograph icon.

627
00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:57.370
Is that defined?

628
00:43:58.060 --> 00:43:59.380
We can import this.

629
00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:03.640
Import this icon to.

630
00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:12.270
So one by one, by getting the error, we can fix everything.

631
00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:14.250
File pic here ref.

632
00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:19.980
So for now we don't want to just add this input.

633
00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:22.270
So let's remove this font for now.

634
00:44:23.550 --> 00:44:24.840
I just commented.

635
00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:29.500
Uh, later we add this functionality.

636
00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:33.590
So now let's try again.

637
00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:37.280
St Paul's is not define us.

638
00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:45.110
We want to send posts, but actually let's change this font to cent comment because we want to send

639
00:44:45.110 --> 00:44:47.660
the comment and then.

640
00:44:49.450 --> 00:44:53.170
Let's create this function at the top just for now.

641
00:44:56.200 --> 00:45:05.050
So just a function we call it set sent comment and it just created for now and later we're going to

642
00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:06.310
handle that for.

643
00:45:10.930 --> 00:45:12.250
Let's refresh the page.

644
00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:16.360
I hope we don't get more errors now.

645
00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:17.050
That's fine.

646
00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:18.280
We are getting.

647
00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:18.910
That's fine.

648
00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:24.490
Instead of what's happening, uh, let's close this.

649
00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:26.520
Let's find, uh.

650
00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:27.070
Let's.

651
00:45:27.070 --> 00:45:27.940
What's happening?

652
00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:33.130
Instead of tweet, we should say reply.

653
00:45:35.850 --> 00:45:41.190
And instead of what's happening and let me search for what's happening, I can't find it.

654
00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:46.140
So instead of what's happening, we just say, right.

655
00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:51.210
Or Tweet your reply.

656
00:45:58.180 --> 00:45:58.580
Okay.

657
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:06.090
So these two doesn't work.

658
00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:10.450
I'm still getting an error here.

659
00:46:10.930 --> 00:46:12.190
Are we still have the.

660
00:46:14.410 --> 00:46:22.600
And this on click so I removed the unclear too so and then I want to remove this border bottom.

661
00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:28.140
So let's search for the border bottom.

662
00:46:30.170 --> 00:46:31.250
Not for this one.

663
00:46:31.250 --> 00:46:32.120
The next one.

664
00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:37.070
Just remove the border and its color.

665
00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:43.240
So we don't see the end in that this size.

666
00:46:43.250 --> 00:46:47.480
As I mentioned before, it's fixed to 300 pixels.

667
00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:53.240
The model, we just remove this edge 300 pixels.

668
00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:56.060
Now this is just a flexible.

669
00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:59.540
So if you write more, it's going to be bigger like this.

670
00:47:01.970 --> 00:47:06.440
The other thing we just missed is just the post itself.

671
00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:08.210
The comments in the post.

672
00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:19.250
No, we see that we are getting the everything back to the days, the user name, the user display name

673
00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:20.390
and also the image.

674
00:47:21.350 --> 00:47:27.650
If we look for example, here, but we I want us to write down this bird too, for example.

675
00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:29.450
It is amazing.

676
00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:29.970
Okay.

677
00:47:32.890 --> 00:47:34.000
This is very simple.

678
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.140
We just need to add something.

679
00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:38.950
For example, at the end of that span.

680
00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:41.860
Here.

681
00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:43.350
The time is just.

682
00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:46.090
Shake that one.

683
00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:47.820
It was a moment, you hear.

684
00:47:48.930 --> 00:47:58.470
We just and after this year we add a paragraph and this paragraph is just just going to be the post.

685
00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:04.140
Let me move this sound.

686
00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:08.170
Pose we protected.

687
00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:10.510
This is going to keep data.

688
00:48:11.850 --> 00:48:14.050
How are you going to protect this one, too?

689
00:48:14.050 --> 00:48:19.210
And this is going to be a text.

690
00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:22.310
Okay.

691
00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:27.340
That's refreshing to hear and see it.

692
00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:34.610
It's.

693
00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:38.880
Cause I'm recording too long this time.

694
00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:41.460
My computer's very slow now.

695
00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:42.810
So sorry about that.

696
00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:46.290
So now we see the halo here or here.

697
00:48:46.290 --> 00:48:48.090
We see that we should see the birds.

698
00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:50.460
But let's just style it.

699
00:48:52.290 --> 00:48:54.050
And the classes I want to use.

700
00:48:54.060 --> 00:49:04.980
I want to change the text to be gray 500 and make the texts to be 15 pixels.

701
00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:07.670
And.

702
00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:10.420
For the.

703
00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:18.000
Bigger size and more than the mobile.

704
00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:21.120
I want to make the text a little bit bigger.

705
00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:25.560
So let's, for example, make it 16 pixels.

706
00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:31.550
We add a margin left of 16 and.

707
00:49:32.810 --> 00:49:36.530
We just add a margin bottom of two.

708
00:49:36.590 --> 00:49:37.910
So we add some space.

709
00:49:39.830 --> 00:49:40.340
Okay.

710
00:49:41.390 --> 00:49:44.510
So in the bigger screen, it's like this bird.

711
00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:48.200
We should get the amazing to hear.

712
00:49:49.390 --> 00:49:55.150
And this person can write anything and reply, but the reply doesn't work for now.

713
00:49:55.990 --> 00:50:03.760
In the next section we're going to add this functionality so that we send the reply to the firestorm.

714
00:50:04.510 --> 00:50:08.230
So let's for just for now, we add this one to the guitar.

715
00:50:09.370 --> 00:50:11.860
It's getting very long, this video.

716
00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:20.710
So I want to just for the next section we do the reply section so we just say get add and we comments.

717
00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:24.670
With a message of.

718
00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:30.940
Install and implement.

719
00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:37.470
React model.

720
00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:43.460
So that's it.

721
00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:48.580
We push it to get hot.

722
00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:51.870
So let's check to get half.

723
00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:55.620
You refresh the page.

724
00:50:57.150 --> 00:50:57.660
No.

725
00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:04.650
We have 20 commits and the last one is install and implement react model.

726
00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:09.940
As you can see, we added another estate.

727
00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:14.290
We call it post I.D. but this estate is global.

728
00:51:14.290 --> 00:51:23.770
So we added to the atoll after the recoil and inside a comment mode, or it does that and did a lot

729
00:51:23.770 --> 00:51:24.490
of things.

730
00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:38.920
We added the model here and we just if the open estate is true, is we going to open the model and we

731
00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:45.250
can close it by just clicking on this outside and the.

732
00:51:46.650 --> 00:51:49.320
We added an icon, X icon.

733
00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:52.070
The image of the person.

734
00:51:52.370 --> 00:52:01.670
This is the horizon horizontal line between the two images and also we got the information username

735
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:07.040
name on all this etc. and this is the image of the person who is signing.

736
00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:10.610
And finally we added the input.

737
00:52:11.650 --> 00:52:12.910
Here's the text area.

738
00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:19.000
And this is just a photograph and emoji icon.

739
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:28.030
And at the end we add a button that is going to be sent the comments, but this is going to be, uh,

740
00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:30.910
we are going to do it in the next section.

741
00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:38.980
So inside the post that, yes, we got the I.D. and we, we actually updated the post ID.

742
00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:47.890
So if the person click on the chat icon, if the person is signed in, we are going to set the I.D.

743
00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:53.770
and also we are going to set the open to be opposite.

744
00:52:54.490 --> 00:52:54.970
Okay.

745
00:52:56.230 --> 00:52:59.250
And we have installed React model.

746
00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:01.780
That was it for this section.

747
00:53:01.830 --> 00:53:07.800
The next section we are going to send the data from this reply to the virus store.

748
00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:09.990
So see in the next section.
