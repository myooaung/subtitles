1
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:12,130
Well, right in the last section, we have finished with the header section.

2
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:21,730
We got these icons from hero icons dot com and we've got this logo from the Google.

3
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:30,280
In the news, in this section, we are going to start styling this Heather section using Telvin CSIS.

4
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,450
So we go to our code visual studio code.

5
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,240
And inside the.

6
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,830
Let's bring this to the right side.

7
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:56,080
So we can see the changes and we start with the styling and bring this everything to the center and

8
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,110
also change the background color as well.

9
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:07,570
If you check the final version, we see that the background color is dark gray and it colors are white,

10
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,130
are gray.

11
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:12,580
But when we hover over them, we see a.

12
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:22,640
If we see a white collar and also if we click on the buttons, we see a red colour.

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,390
And also if you click on the logo, we see that the logo gets brighter.

14
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:32,450
So we go back to.

15
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:41,480
Heterogeneous and inside this is the divide that contains everything, all the headers.

16
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,810
So we change the background color in this section.

17
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,850
So we just add a class name and the class.

18
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,050
The the classes we want to add first is the background color.

19
00:01:54,980 --> 00:02:00,110
So if we just write peachy gray for the gray color.

20
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:09,310
And we said it to be, if free press conserve space, you can see the suggestions, a different number

21
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,960
of colors and different colors.

22
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:19,990
If you installed the tailwinds to assist IntelliSense, so we start from the 50, which is the brightest

23
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:26,430
color and two, 700 or 900, which is completely black.

24
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,570
Two 700.

25
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:37,250
And let's start the server to see this change.

26
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,540
So we're just two a.m. around death.

27
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,290
OK, now see that the background color has been changed to dark gray.

28
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,120
Let's change the text.

29
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:15,180
Using just just a text, and we just say the color would be gray, but two hundred instead of seven

30
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:15,690
hundred.

31
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:18,550
All right.

32
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,290
And let's.

33
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:32,040
Change the display to Flex, to bring to bring them to the center using justified content and item center.

34
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:38,960
As you may know, in Telvin cases, we start with the mobile size.

35
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:48,030
So no, actually these are for mobile size and for the bigger sizes we have to specify.

36
00:03:49,130 --> 00:04:01,150
The classis by and for a small, we have medium large x large, and also we have.

37
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,170
Two weeks last.

38
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:12,460
Now we want to flex, but we want the items at this iPhone to be at the bottom like the final version.

39
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:22,220
If we check the final version, when we decrease the size, we see that the logo goes under these buttons.

40
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,880
You see here the trigger point.

41
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,850
So the in the mobile science.

42
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:39,830
We have this forum, so in our code, we change the Flex to column.

43
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:47,180
And we sit here and let's bring everything to the center using.

44
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,180
Items.

45
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,340
Santa.

46
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,130
You see and.

47
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:10,440
And let's bring these icons next to each other, but the container that covers these things is.

48
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:16,420
This class here, it's covering all the icons.

49
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,630
So here we change the display to Flex.

50
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:21,890
And.

51
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,490
That's that's it.

52
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:28,870
And for that, I don't want them to be very close to each other.

53
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,590
So in the header icons.

54
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,260
Here.

55
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:43,180
We are going to change that with or add some margin, so.

56
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,550
We just and the margin fix for.

57
00:05:50,740 --> 00:06:00,580
And in order to bring them back exactly in the center, we changed the display to Flex and we change

58
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,830
the flex direction to.

59
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,300
Column.

60
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,350
No, you can't see everything is centered.

61
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:23,640
Let's add some padding to the parent in the head of that, yes.

62
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:35,990
So at the top, it just adds some padding, like padding six, which is 24 pixels, so it pushed everything

63
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,370
in the middle.

64
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,190
And now.

65
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:46,230
And also, let's go to this Heather Icon.

66
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:50,510
And for the title, I want the title to be a little bit.

67
00:06:51,870 --> 00:07:02,610
And have a space between the title and icon, so we change the class name here and we sit to March.

68
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,420
Why?

69
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,900
Or marching into horizontal.

70
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:09,920
To.

71
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:17,160
Which is marching to it means eight pixels.

72
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:17,970
All right.

73
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,250
The things I want to do is just, I don't want this.

74
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,460
We can select the.

75
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:35,110
The characters, because this is going to be very annoying when your.

76
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:43,790
Watching a Web site inside the mobile, because when you clicking on a button, it's going to select

77
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,210
the.

78
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:55,780
The characters, and it's very annoying, so usually Web developers remove the cynic selecting ability.

79
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:05,300
For the mobile size or for menus, something like that, that's this that's not necessary to copy.

80
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:06,470
So.

81
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,690
And the heritage is in the top level.

82
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:16,910
I mean, the div that covers everything, we just add something called.

83
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,350
Select no.

84
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:27,070
So it removes the ability to select the items, no, it cannot select them.

85
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:35,740
So it's going to be very convenient when you're watching a website in the mobile version.

86
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:47,960
Next, I want to add some clicking and things like changing, hovering effects and active effects.

87
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:49,460
So.

88
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:53,760
In each icon, header icon.

89
00:08:54,930 --> 00:09:02,100
We're going to ask something called harbor effect, so we just say hover through the glass.

90
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:11,490
So when we hover over this icon, I want to change the ticks instead of gray to be white.

91
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:16,170
So you can see now by hovering.

92
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:23,820
Let me increase the size now, if you hover over the I can see see this change.

93
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:34,440
All right, so and then let's change the cursor to be pointer, so when we hover over the elements,

94
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,570
we can see a pointing hand.

95
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:38,760
Well.

96
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,310
And.

97
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,310
No, the.

98
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:52,280
The margin is four, but when we, uh, the website is.

99
00:09:53,410 --> 00:10:02,460
Bigger in a bigger size, I want that's a little bit they have more space between them, so I say just

100
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,390
when the size is.

101
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:09,390
Bigger and over large, I want the.

102
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:19,960
They width to be six instead of four or margin, X to be six.

103
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,390
So when no, we increase the size of the.

104
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,600
Is she the trigger point here?

105
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:35,120
Bigger than large, we have more space between the icons.

106
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:48,520
All right, so the next thing I want to do would be increasing the size after the small size.

107
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:53,760
I want these icons to be at the left and the logo to be on the right.

108
00:10:54,840 --> 00:11:01,620
So we need to change the flex direction of the header that chase.

109
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:06,790
From column to row when we are increasing this size.

110
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:13,260
So here we say, if we have this size bigger than the small.

111
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,290
We want to flex.

112
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:22,030
To be real instead of column.

113
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,520
Me tested for you.

114
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,590
See the change after this small.

115
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:44,480
This is the trigger point, so for the tablet and the bigger screens, we have been next next to each

116
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,500
other, but less change to justify to be.

117
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,030
Between.

118
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:59,800
This is similar to justify content between so you can see that this is like justified content, a space

119
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,340
between.

120
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:09,790
So when we are increasing the size more than the small, we see that the icons scores to the left and

121
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,290
the logo goes to the right.

122
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,140
All right.

123
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:25,940
The next thing I see on that is the active effect when we click on the icon, I want the color to be

124
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,330
red.

125
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:30,020
So in the header icon that James?

126
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:36,270
If you remember, we had the hover effect, takes flight after that.

127
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,170
We add the active.

128
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:50,860
They say when the active or in someone, click on the icon, change the text color to be read.

129
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:55,190
And just four hundred like this color.

130
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:00,440
So now when we click, it should see.

131
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,080
They're color changing.

132
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:19,160
The next thing is, I want to change when we click on this icon, IMDB icon, I want to change the brightness

133
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:27,350
of the logo, so indicator that yes, we go to the images, you go to the image tag.

134
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,520
And here we are.

135
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:35,090
Lastly, the class name and we just first we change the cursor to be pointer.

136
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,960
And so now we see a pointing hand when we hover over it and then.

137
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:54,740
If we someone click on the icon, it means the active shooter class, I want to change the brightness.

138
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,440
Two hundred and ten.

139
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:04,270
Here you can see you see no, the Tillmans, this is very easy to.

140
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:13,510
Use everything is similar to CSIS, but we don't need to go to CSIS all the time to change everything

141
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,670
and make different classes.

142
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:24,050
And it's very simple to use, but you just need to practice more to remember all the syntax.

143
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,900
So, no.

144
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,610
If we click on the icon.

145
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,810
We see that changing in the color.

146
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:37,910
All right.

147
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:43,400
But that was it for the now, for sick, for the Heather section, we have finished it.

148
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:52,160
It's responsive and also we have this, however, an active effect in the next section.

149
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:59,120
We're going to start with the Nafaa section and we're going to create it's like.

150
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:09,140
This section, the trending and top rated that we have in the final version.

151
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:15,740
So before, uh, finishing the video, let's do the.

152
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,320
Get half fiction.

153
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:25,590
So we just add everything to the repository and commit.

154
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:32,350
With the message of finish.

155
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:39,490
Or we just say hostile to Heather.

156
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:42,400
S..

157
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,200
And we push it.

158
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,520
Did it gets hot?

159
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:54,560
Now, let's go and check.

160
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:02,290
You're fresh, and we clicked on this movie app version eight.

161
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,480
Now we have five comments.

162
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:10,910
If you click on them, you see that the last comment is a solid header section and.

163
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:14,510
The things we did in the header.

164
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:19,700
That, yes, we add some class names for styling.

165
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:32,000
And also in the heroes I conduct is we just changed the class name and something we didn't do too much.

166
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,480
It was just a stylish and.

167
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:46,390
Just I want to, uh, to, uh, mention that using GitHub is necessary for all web developers, in my

168
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,320
opinion.

169
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,900
It has two good things.

170
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:55,750
First is just you can see what change you have done to your code.

171
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:05,990
And also, if someone comes to your GitHub page and if you want to hire somewhere, that's the best

172
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,460
place to show.

173
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:18,280
You're a lucky lucky your supervisor or person will interview you said that you are really working on

174
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,050
your projects every day.

175
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,750
Yeah, that's my recommendation.

176
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:33,150
And also, when we want to deploy the website to the Web, so we need to get help to connect our application

177
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:33,360
to a.

178
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:35,530
All right.

179
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:40,380
That was it for the styling part in the next section, we start with the.

180
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,370
Now for our section, so see in the next section.
