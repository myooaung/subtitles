1
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:07.780
All right.

2
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.880
In the last section, we have completed the What's Happening section of the widget component.

3
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.290
In this section, we're going to create the WHO to follow section.

4
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.050
If you look at the final version, we can see that we have a whole to follow.

5
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.170
It's similar to the What's Happening section.

6
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.710
It's always sticky at the top.

7
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:39.080
You can see when you're scrolling down, you still see this section on the right side and you're going

8
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:46.550
to get this status from API service called random users and all is random.

9
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.660
And when we refresh the page, you always see a new users here.

10
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.050
And when we click on Show More, each time you see three more users.

11
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.370
Okay.

12
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.440
Let's start with the fetching section.

13
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:14.420
If you remember for this part, we went to index searches and we used server side rendering of next

14
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.740
year to get data from the API news API.

15
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.760
We're going to do the same thing for the WHO to follow section.

16
00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:38.200
So we go back to index that's here just at the bottom when we have when we use this created this constant

17
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:45.280
news result, we are going to create a new constant for the whole to follow section.

18
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.080
I just write down here to follow.

19
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.550
Sich.

20
00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:01.710
And so here we create a constant and we call it follow.

21
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.610
Or we can call it random users.

22
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.030
Results.

23
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:22.590
And this is going to wait and fetch the data from the API.

24
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:32.970
So let's say let me show you the website we are using if you search on Google random users.

25
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.530
In the search results, you see a website.

26
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.700
A random user generator and a website.

27
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.810
Your areas random user touched me.

28
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.090
If you click on this website.

29
00:02:52.310 --> 00:03:02.100
You can see that, uh, it provides you many things like a name, email, birthday address, phone number,

30
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.870
etc..

31
00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.110
So if you go to documentation.

32
00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.580
And if you scroll down.

33
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.160
You can see that each time you request, you get some result.

34
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.330
And depending on your request type, you get different results.

35
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:32.070
And as you can see here, for example, if you want to get 5000 random users, you just need to fetch

36
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:41.220
this URL random you a random user dot me forward slash API and post slash question.

37
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.190
My results equals $5.

38
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.220
Let me try this.

39
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.750
We copy this and we go to a new tab.

40
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.630
Let's make it 54.

41
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:57.360
Now, if you press enter, we're going to see some the results.

42
00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:05.430
I'm getting this result like this because I'm using extension called JSON formatter.

43
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.460
But if you don't have that extension, you're going to see it like this.

44
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.360
Okay.

45
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.480
Uh.

46
00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.090
So we buried.

47
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.510
The result gives us two items.

48
00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.030
The first item is the results, and the second one is info info.

49
00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:35.000
It just gives us the number of result which is 50 and the page and version and etc..

50
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.300
We don't need this far for the results.

51
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.730
We are getting different things.

52
00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:49.370
We are getting like a name, gender, location, city.

53
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.050
And this is 50.

54
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.680
Each one is 50, so.

55
00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.720
If you make it, for example, to.

56
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.680
You can see.

57
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.680
Yeah.

58
00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.420
Too.

59
00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:11.150
And then we can also we can just say, I don't want gender, I don't want location, I just want name

60
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:12.800
or email.

61
00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.330
So for doing that, you just need to add two more queries.

62
00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:26.870
For example, I just add a ampersand and I just say just include name.

63
00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.210
You can see just we are getting there.

64
00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.920
And it's one name, Anthony.

65
00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:44.540
So if you want to get, for example, a 30, 30 name, which includes the title, first name and last

66
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:50.000
name, do the things I want to use is just I want to get the name.

67
00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:51.980
And also, I want to get the.

68
00:05:53.840 --> 00:06:03.830
A log in information, for example, the username or etc. and also I want to get the picture so we want

69
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:04.640
to get the name.

70
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:05.540
Logging.

71
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:11.720
Logging includes the username password and also the user ID and etc..

72
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.630
The picture includes three links.

73
00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:17.410
Large medium thumbnail.

74
00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.690
So we're going to use this thumbnail for the image as well.

75
00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.640
So if you click on it, you can see it's just an image of a person.

76
00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:32.250
And each time you refresh the page, if you request again, you get a different.

77
00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.650
And person randomly.

78
00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:37.800
Different username and everything is completely new.

79
00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:43.050
I think they have more than 2 billion users here.

80
00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:44.520
I'm not sure which.

81
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:45.300
Let me check.

82
00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:47.180
Uh.

83
00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:52.040
I think I saw it somewhere.

84
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.780
The stats and graphs.

85
00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:05.400
47 billion users totally generated for this website.

86
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.890
So all of them are a random.

87
00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:10.500
And you can also have a.

88
00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.160
For.

89
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:23.180
You can have different passport, passports and nationalities, for example, you can just have Brazilian,

90
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:24.620
Canadian.

91
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.720
And I said us.

92
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.530
So you can play with this fine.

93
00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:33.080
Get different users as you wish.

94
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:38.120
So for now or for us, this one is enough.

95
00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.710
So we copied this.

96
00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:48.620
And we go back to Visual Studio code and the inside of Fish, we paste this one.

97
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:58.720
After that, we're going to get the result and convert it to Jason.

98
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.920
So just to raise that, Jason.

99
00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:05.250
Okay.

100
00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:06.660
Let's save it.

101
00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:11.380
Now we we got this random users.

102
00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:22.380
We can pass it as a props here as we did for the news results, and we can send it to the user, which

103
00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:23.040
is here.

104
00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:26.760
Then.

105
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:31.800
We can pass it as a props to the widgets.

106
00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:34.110
A component here.

107
00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:38.410
Also, we don't want to send this one.

108
00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:41.860
We want to send the results one.

109
00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:45.910
So we just change it to resource.

110
00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:57.070
So we get just the inside, whatever inside the result, which is an array of for example here 30 items.

111
00:08:58.740 --> 00:08:59.180
Okay.

112
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:00.150
That's correct.

113
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.590
Now we are getting this.

114
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:07.170
We send it to widgets, we go to wages and we get it as a props here at a top.

115
00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:09.020
Okay.

116
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:12.390
Then.

117
00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.400
Just below the stairs we add a new div.

118
00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:25.370
And inside this, do we just add an edge for first?

119
00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:27.780
Let me show it.

120
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:29.850
Yeah.

121
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:39.070
So just need to refresh it one time.

122
00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:45.770
So inside this edge for me.

123
00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:46.190
Right.

124
00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:47.450
Who to follow?

125
00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:53.660
And just to follow.

126
00:09:58.610 --> 00:09:59.960
And here.

127
00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.150
Let me a little bit.

128
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:10.050
Let's add the button as well.

129
00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.700
So the button just saying show.

130
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:18.590
More.

131
00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:20.760
Okay.

132
00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.390
So that's, uh, let's just start.

133
00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:30.670
It is as you can see, the want is same a style from the top to the bottom.

134
00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.190
So the styling is similar.

135
00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:39.070
So, uh, we just quickly style it, for example, for the bottom.

136
00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:43.420
We just, uh.

137
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:47.270
Uh, let me.

138
00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:49.160
Yeah.

139
00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:49.520
We just.

140
00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.080
The techs blew.

141
00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.660
Text below 300.

142
00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.070
Then we have padding left of four.

143
00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:08.550
Padding bottom of three.

144
00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:14.100
And finally, we have the hover.

145
00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:17.430
Effect of tax.

146
00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.840
Blue 400.

147
00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:26.200
Okay.

148
00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:30.090
This is similar to that one for the age for as well.

149
00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:33.740
We just add a.

150
00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:43.800
Font posed to make it a little bit thicker.

151
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:50.610
Then we changed the text to be extra large and we add the width.

152
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:53.890
Uh.

153
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:54.280
Sorry.

154
00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:55.840
Uh, the padding.

155
00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.670
Except for.

156
00:11:59.410 --> 00:11:59.770
Okay.

157
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:01.630
For the div.

158
00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:07.910
We add a text color of gray.

159
00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:10.680
700.

160
00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:17.390
We had a space between the Y axis three between them.

161
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:23.550
And, uh, we had a background color of gray.

162
00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:25.710
100.

163
00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:31.830
And let's make it the same size of above.

164
00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:35.170
First we added padding.

165
00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.950
At top of two, we make it rounded.

166
00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:45.250
A large.

167
00:12:46.750 --> 00:13:00.520
We add the width of 90% for the mobile and for the x large, we add width of 75%.

168
00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:01.910
Okay.

169
00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.510
So these two are okay.

170
00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:08.130
Now, let's look through the.

171
00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:13.260
Random users and show it in between.

172
00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:16.680
So we add curly braces.

173
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:29.670
And we just see a random user's results dot map and we get each random user here.

174
00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:38.340
And we're going to return the following that we're going to return, for example.

175
00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:43.280
We just can pretend it did before forgetting.

176
00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:44.670
Let's add the key.

177
00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:50.910
The key is going to be random user dots.

178
00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:53.980
And the username is unique.

179
00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:56.260
The username is inside the.

180
00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:59.050
Uh, Logan.

181
00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.870
And is it okay?

182
00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:08.240
Here inside a dare.

183
00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:12.920
We add an image tag and a source would be.

184
00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.950
Random user dots.

185
00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.330
Uh, picture.

186
00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:26.550
The thumbnail.

187
00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:32.300
Now we can get the images.

188
00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:33.290
Now we can see it.

189
00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:39.470
So let's just style this images real quick.

190
00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:44.290
First we add the width to be 40.

191
00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:46.100
And.

192
00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:48.880
For the styling.

193
00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:51.750
Just make it rounded.

194
00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:55.030
So you just stay around the full.

195
00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:56.990
Hey.

196
00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:01.540
That looks fine after the image.

197
00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:07.510
We want to add the username and the name.

198
00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:14.650
As you can see from the final version, we have username at the top and we have the name which is which

199
00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:17.020
includes from first name and last name.

200
00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:18.760
Okay.

201
00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:22.780
So we needed to hear that that is covering both of them.

202
00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:27.120
Okay.

203
00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:28.510
Let's add the diff.

204
00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:29.950
And inside is there.

205
00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:31.330
We added h for.

206
00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:37.510
And this is going to be random users.

207
00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:41.280
Dot Logan.

208
00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:43.400
Use username.

209
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:46.830
Okay.

210
00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:48.830
You can see the username here.

211
00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:56.110
After this h four, we're going to have ah5.

212
00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:01.850
And this is this includes a name and the.

213
00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:03.540
Last name.

214
00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:07.860
So we just have to write random user dot.

215
00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:11.670
Name Dot first.

216
00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:15.390
You should see the first now.

217
00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:24.140
And plus, we added space, and after that we just say random death name.

218
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:24.990
That's the last.

219
00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:28.720
Okay.

220
00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:33.940
And after this, there we we're going to have another button.

221
00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:34.830
We're just saying.

222
00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:36.950
Follow.

223
00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:38.750
Okay.

224
00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:43.850
So let's bring them next to each other.

225
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:46.580
So in the above, dev.

226
00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.070
We changed the display to flex.

227
00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:55.470
And the.

228
00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:10.140
The things we do here, we just, uh, use items center to bring them next to each other in a vertical

229
00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:10.500
level.

230
00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:12.880
Okay.

231
00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:24.260
I mean, uh, items center, enough items stocked.

232
00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:27.880
Okay, so everything is, uh.

233
00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:29.840
Okay.

234
00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:30.300
Now.

235
00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:31.830
We?

236
00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:33.900
Let's.

237
00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:36.650
A stylish Spartan.

238
00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:40.130
For the bottom.

239
00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:43.070
You want to push it to the end.

240
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:44.390
So we just say.

241
00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:48.230
Margin left off auto.

242
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.390
And we changed the background color to black.

243
00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:01.230
We change the colour to be white.

244
00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:08.030
Let's make it rounded using a rounded four.

245
00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:15.220
Then we set the size of the tics to be as small.

246
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:20.730
Then we need to add some padding in the x axis.

247
00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:22.530
For example, a three and a half.

248
00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:25.860
And in a y axis of one a half.

249
00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:28.130
Okay.

250
00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:33.190
And let's make this fun to be bold as well.

251
00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:35.460
Okay.

252
00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:35.940
Let's.

253
00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:37.560
This one looks okay.

254
00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:42.750
In the above div, I want to add some padding.

255
00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:43.470
So.

256
00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:45.670
Here.

257
00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:57.180
So we had a padding in the x axis of four and in the y axis of two.

258
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:04.220
Then we we want to add some.

259
00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.870
First we make it cursor to the point here.

260
00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:13.110
So we see a pointing hand when we hover over and when we hover over it.

261
00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.640
I want to change the background color as well.

262
00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:19.990
So I change the background color to Gray 200.

263
00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:21.520
Like this.

264
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:28.650
So the only thing that is left is just this user a name.

265
00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:33.310
So we go to first find the username.

266
00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.440
Let's just style it.

267
00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:39.010
I want the text to be bold.

268
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:42.330
And then.

269
00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:45.060
When we hover over earth.

270
00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.670
I want to see underlie.

271
00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:54.870
So for the tax declaration line, we just need to say underline.

272
00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:57.190
Okay.

273
00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:01.420
And let's change the text size.

274
00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:06.660
To be, for example, 14 pixels.

275
00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:11.780
And the.

276
00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:17.900
Let's make it truncate when we have a bigger.

277
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:21.530
Uh, username any longer.

278
00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:23.540
Username we wanna truncate.

279
00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:28.610
Maybe we add that so we cannot see it yet.

280
00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:34.430
We need to add the truncate to the upper tier as well here to see the result.

281
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:40.250
Then in the upper dev, we want to have some margin left as well.

282
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:42.740
Margin left for.

283
00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:52.020
We pushed them a little bit in the right side and let's make it leading fire to push them a little bit

284
00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:53.940
to get their looks better.

285
00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:59.830
And for the name.

286
00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:08.210
That's Alec.

287
00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:09.000
Last name.

288
00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:13.500
I don't know what I did.

289
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:15.360
Okay.

290
00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:23.290
So let's change the text size to be 13 pixels.

291
00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:31.800
So it's a little bit smaller and that's changed.

292
00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:37.130
It takes color to be gray, but this time 500.

293
00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:42.380
And also, we want to make it truncate to just sit.

294
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:42.720
Right.

295
00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:47.140
Okay.

296
00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:52.980
Here you can see the truncate effect.

297
00:21:53.580 --> 00:22:00.960
This username was too long, so we added the dot dot dot at the end instead of pushing the button to

298
00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:01.710
the right side.

299
00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:03.160
Okay.

300
00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:13.770
Now we have to add the functionality for sure more and only first we want to see three users as we did

301
00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:14.570
for the above.

302
00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:16.590
We just need to add a slice here.

303
00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:17.610
Just a dot.

304
00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:19.080
A slice.

305
00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.950
And you make it three like this.

306
00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:24.370
You can see three.

307
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:27.630
But you want to make this random as well.

308
00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:28.350
Sorry.

309
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:29.940
Variable.

310
00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:34.460
So we just a random user.

311
00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:40.300
Number and we're going to create this hook at a top.

312
00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:50.830
So we just at the bottom of this, we create a constant and we just call it set the random user number

313
00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:54.610
and set random user number.

314
00:22:54.610 --> 00:23:04.660
But the random should be capital for consistency and the use user state and the initial value would

315
00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:06.070
be three as well.

316
00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:12.280
So we see three results now and we added oncolytic to this show more.

317
00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:15.140
Here.

318
00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:24.850
And we just say.

319
00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:28.070
Just.

320
00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:33.420
Sits random user number.

321
00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:41.810
So it's going to be random user number plus three each time you click here.

322
00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.870
So we add three each time we click.

323
00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:46.480
And.

324
00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.650
Let's add the sticky part as well.

325
00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:56.420
So now when we are going down, you see this part passes.

326
00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:05.090
So add a top dev that is covering this section.

327
00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:11.180
We just say sticky and we just said top 16.

328
00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:17.240
The reason we are using 16, not zero because it's not completely out of top.

329
00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:21.520
We want after the search bar, we keep it.

330
00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:26.650
So now if we go down, you see that it stops there.

331
00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:28.840
Okay.

332
00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:33.230
We do not have enough posts now to see the results completely.

333
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:35.720
But trust me, this is going to work.

334
00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:38.090
Okay.

335
00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:40.610
Let's at's everything to get half.

336
00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:43.100
So we go back to Visual Studio.

337
00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:51.650
We start the server using controversy and we add everything to get top using get at all.

338
00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:55.250
And then we make.

339
00:24:56.610 --> 00:24:58.530
Romance with the message of.

340
00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:06.260
Create their random users.

341
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.950
Section.

342
00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:17.460
Of the Richards components.

343
00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:27.580
So let's use get push to push everything to get huh.

344
00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:32.440
And let's see what we have done so far.

345
00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:36.790
So we refresh the page by clicking on the Twitter.

346
00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:39.490
Now we have nine commands.

347
00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:43.750
So the last command here is create.

348
00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:46.240
So I made a typo here.

349
00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:50.950
Create the random user section of the widgets component.

350
00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:53.820
So.

351
00:25:54.810 --> 00:26:01.190
We added to in the index, we added inside the widget that.

352
00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:01.860
Yes.

353
00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:08.770
We got the random users result from an index searches and.

354
00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:16.170
Well, we created a new path for the WHO to follow section.

355
00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:21.270
And inside the index that year we.

356
00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:31.200
We fetch the data from the random user that me website and we got the result and we passed it to the

357
00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:33.600
widgets component.

358
00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:34.380
Okay.

359
00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:36.000
That was it for this section.

360
00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:42.690
In the next section, we're going to start with the authentication part of our project.

361
00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:51.000
I mean, we are going to authenticate the user in a way that they can only access the website when they

362
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.110
are signing.

363
00:26:53.260 --> 00:27:01.330
And, uh, we're going to get, for example, this image did the name, the user name, everything from

364
00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:05.710
that data that user authenticated.

365
00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:09.340
So see in the next section for the authentication part.
