1
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:07,700
All right.

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,240
In the last section, we have completed the search box.

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,680
In this section, we're going to create the search options.

4
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:23,480
The other things we have here is important because this is very similar to the search box.

5
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:29,870
As we have interaction with the users, we need to create these section client side.

6
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,240
So we have already created this part.

7
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:43,460
If we just close everything here and then we go to the Explorer section, we go to search header options.

8
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,860
We have already created this component.

9
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:51,260
We need to complete it and put it inside our website.

10
00:00:53,340 --> 00:01:02,310
So the first thing I want to add here is to inside this debate we're going to have.

11
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:09,660
Another div four the each section.

12
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:19,700
So each of these places is the diff, including an icon and a text and this one as well.

13
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:24,110
So we're going to have another diff here.

14
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:31,430
And inside this tab we're going to have the icon and the text.

15
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:40,550
So the icon I want to use for the first one is the search icon, which is I.

16
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,610
Outline search.

17
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:49,010
We have already used this one before.

18
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,730
Which is coming from React icons for slash I.

19
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,370
So I'm going to close this one and the text for this one is going to be.

20
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,810
All.

21
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:09,360
So let's see.

22
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,820
We can see it inside our website.

23
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,310
So let's refresh the page.

24
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,510
Now we see the icon here.

25
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:29,920
I will show you this icon and this all we need to style it as the styling are very similar between the

26
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:34,840
two places I'm going to first style the first one.

27
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,640
And again, we can copy and use it for this second one.

28
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,990
So now for the.

29
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:55,300
This icon we just make it takes AMD, which is a text medium.

30
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:03,610
And for this all that is fine for the dev that is covering it.

31
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,110
We're going to first make it flex.

32
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:15,140
So we bring them next to each other and then we can use item center.

33
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:20,360
So we can just bring them and.

34
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,660
Vertically.

35
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,160
Next to each other, we can add some space between them.

36
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,300
Let me bring them here so we can see the changes in real time.

37
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,520
Let's close the left side.

38
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,820
So let's decrease the size here.

39
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:43,870
Kick.

40
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:55,020
So after the item center, I want to add some space between them using a space X and this is going to

41
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,970
be a space x one.

42
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,510
Just add a little bit of space between them.

43
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,060
And after that, we want to have some broader at a bottom

44
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,080
of four.

45
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,470
As you can see, the border.

46
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:27,290
But this border is going to be kind of limited.

47
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:31,350
But let's first continue and make it.

48
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:39,000
First, I want to set the colour of the border to be transparent.

49
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:43,200
The reason I'm doing that, because I don't want to see the border now.

50
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:54,810
But when we click on this icon, or if this is where I want to see the border, border blue.

51
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:07,190
And when we click on it, also when we click on which is active, I want to change the text to be blue

52
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,260
500.

53
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:15,280
So here when we click on it, we see the change in the color.

54
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,940
You see it becomes blue.

55
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:25,740
So this is kind of a sense for this users that they have clicked and let's set the cursor to be pointer.

56
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:36,870
So when we hover over it, we see a pointing hand like this and let's add some padding in the bottom

57
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:42,270
of three, some padding in the x axis of.

58
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,740
True.

59
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,490
K now.

60
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,570
But we want to make this one and.

61
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,470
Dynamic.

62
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:13,070
So we based on the search term that we see at a top or we're actually not searched based on this web

63
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:20,360
for slideshow and a search for the search web or forward slash image, We want to make this one active

64
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,680
or active.

65
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:28,790
So first thing first, we need to change this font to use client, because this is a client side.

66
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,950
We want to make it interactive.

67
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:37,310
So we must just make it client side and then we want to input something called.

68
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,280
And use path name.

69
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,500
So we want to import

70
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:50,900
use path name from next forward slash navigation.

71
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:54,410
And also we want to initialize it here.

72
00:06:54,410 --> 00:07:04,990
So we're going to say path name is equal to use path name.

73
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,220
So we have initialize it here.

74
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:13,970
Now we can just make it dynamic.

75
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:27,800
So here, instead of just adding it like a static using the double clone, I'm going to add a curly

76
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,830
braces at the beginning and at the end.

77
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:40,610
I want to change this clone to a back tick, which makes us gives us the ability to add some variable

78
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,130
here and after here.

79
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:53,650
After this padding x two, we can add a variable using dollar sign.

80
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,590
A set of curly braces.

81
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:10,530
And we just say if the path name is equal to forward slash search for slash web.

82
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,770
If this one happens, if this condition is true.

83
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:25,950
We want to the text to be blue.

84
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,030
600.

85
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:35,220
And border bottom or border color to be blue?

86
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,320
600 as well.

87
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:45,380
As you can see now, we see this is blue and the text is blue.

88
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,250
The border is blue as well.

89
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:52,590
But if this search forward slash web, we change it to image.

90
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:55,230
For example, we press enter.

91
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,810
We shouldn't see the colors to be blue or.

92
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,800
And if you just see it normally, let's change it to web.

93
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:11,360
We see it blue, but sometimes this one doesn't work.

94
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,400
I don't know why.

95
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,250
So we need to.

96
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:14,590
It's.

97
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:18,100
I think it's a kind of block for tailbacks.

98
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,140
There.

99
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,990
I think I found a solution.

100
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:21,760
It's.

101
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:26,050
You just need to after this condition to make it important.

102
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,480
So you need to add a question mark.

103
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:35,260
So if this is this condition happens, you want to make this one important.

104
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,480
So make sure to add this one.

105
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:44,380
So sometimes I see that doesn't work in some browsers, so it's better to make it important.

106
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:50,290
So I always use this as styling instead of the normal styling.

107
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:55,240
So we have just created this part.

108
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:08,020
The other things we need to do here inside this, we want to add a event listener.

109
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:12,520
So when we click on this font, we want to change the URL as well.

110
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,220
So for example, if we are in the image.

111
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:19,800
Okay.

112
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,870
We don't see the blue line.

113
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,720
It's not selected when we click on it.

114
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:34,530
We want to change the URL as well, so we need to add an event listener Sorry, click event listener

115
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:37,290
which is going to trigger a function.

116
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,470
And this function is going to be.

117
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,720
Dynamic as well.

118
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:51,060
And this is going to push the person to that URL with the search term and also be deep web inside the

119
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:51,990
path name.

120
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:59,430
So here, here at this div, we're going to add an n click event listener.

121
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:11,830
This uncle event listener is going to trigger a function, but we want to add some.

122
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,230
Parameters as well.

123
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:19,140
So we're going to call the function select.

124
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,270
Tap.

125
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,810
And we want to pass this lip.

126
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,960
Or we just say all.

127
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,690
For example, this is for all.

128
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,960
So we're going to pass this all.

129
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,820
And we create this function at the top.

130
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,540
So we create a function called.

131
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,510
Select tab.

132
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,860
This is a we get the suggestion.

133
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:03,130
We we create a function called select tab, which is going to get.

134
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:04,500
This.

135
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:13,880
Name, which is a tap name, or we can just call it, for example, title or whatever.

136
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:22,850
This is actually this suggestion is for JavaScript, but for next year we're going to do a different

137
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:23,480
way.

138
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:28,130
So we're going to use just the router dot push.

139
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:33,830
So we need to just import the use router at the top.

140
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:45,950
And here, if we just just say router and we need to initialize it first, we initialize the router

141
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:48,230
here and then we just say router.

142
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:56,610
That push and we're going to push the person to this tab.

143
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:01,110
But we don't want this tab, actually.

144
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:12,020
We don't want to redirect them to search for slash, for example, or we want to redirect them conditionally.

145
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:22,280
We just say if the tab is equal to all.

146
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:27,480
Okay.

147
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:31,630
If this one happens, we want to use whip.

148
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,320
Otherwise.

149
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:44,270
Or we can make it this way.

150
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,190
We can just say if this one is images.

151
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:50,320
Like this.

152
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,690
If this one is images, make this one image.

153
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,860
Otherwise, make it web because anything else can be whipped.

154
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,810
Our default will be whip.

155
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:04,280
So now this one is going to redirect us to this year.

156
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,280
But actually, we don't have that search term.

157
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,500
We need that search term, too.

158
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:17,090
So we need to import something else as well, which is used search params here.

159
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:26,120
So I'm going to import use search params and I'm going to initialize it here and I want to get this

160
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,440
search term.

161
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:38,610
Which is going to be equal to this search for that get that search term.

162
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,060
So we get the search term and added at the end of this here.

163
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:45,750
So.

164
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,400
This one.

165
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:56,230
So we need to add some thing.

166
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,840
I think we missed some.

167
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,680
A dark curly braces here.

168
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,880
This is for.

169
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,470
The ads.

170
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:08,860
The dollar sign is open, but I didn't close it.

171
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:10,840
Let's close this one here.

172
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,450
So after that, we're going to add the search term.

173
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:18,350
So I'm going to add a question mark.

174
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:21,740
Search term and the search term is coming from here.

175
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:30,830
So we're going to redirect the person to forward slash search for a slash can be image or web and search

176
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:34,730
term, which is already inside the URL.

177
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:43,100
So now if you look at here we are in the first slash search, first slash image search term.

178
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:43,690
Hello.

179
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:51,920
And if you click on this icon, this is going to redirect us to forward slash web instead of image and

180
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,060
then search term.

181
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:53,720
Hello.

182
00:15:54,680 --> 00:16:01,460
And also we have this selected to be blue color as well.

183
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:04,650
Okay.

184
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:09,940
So we have added this interactivity in our this part.

185
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:15,960
So I'm going to just copy this one and change it to B for the image as well.

186
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,330
So because because this is very similar.

187
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:24,030
So we need to just copy this div using alt shift error done.

188
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:36,580
And we're going to add we can just change this on click to be instead of all to be images.

189
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:46,090
This is should be similar to this images capital, K and uppercase.

190
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:56,390
And then, sorry, capitalized and then we just change it here.

191
00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:03,820
If the path name is equal to search for slash image, this one is going to be active.

192
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:08,590
The text inside is going to be images.

193
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:12,840
All right.

194
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:22,390
And instead of this icon, which is the I earth aligned search, we're going to use a i r line camera.

195
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,950
And we need to import it as well.

196
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:31,620
So we have imported two icons from this.

197
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,060
As you can see, we have all we have the image.

198
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:38,210
If we click here we are in the web.

199
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:42,450
Now we are in the web.

200
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:46,370
When we click on Image, we should go to forward slash image.

201
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,290
And this one is selected.

202
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,910
Okay, It's working.

203
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:59,090
Now we want to style this one and make them bring them next to each other and make them some smaller.

204
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:07,430
So inside the div that is coloring both of them here we're going to add some styling.

205
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:13,250
First thing first, I want to make them flex so they come next to each other like that.

206
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:22,340
I want to add a space between them just using a space X to.

207
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:35,460
And then as you can see, and then you can see we are select when we select them, we see the cursor

208
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,880
here moving that indicator.

209
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:47,550
So I'm going to remove that one using select non.

210
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:52,370
And then.

211
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:57,660
Let's add some border for both of them.

212
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,260
So border bottom.

213
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,370
F four.

214
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,230
Fit the size four.

215
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,230
But see.

216
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,390
Actually the size.

217
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,550
Just the one is enough.

218
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,150
And then.

219
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,870
Now you can see the border now.

220
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:33,050
Just the size of one is okay.

221
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:37,970
After the border, we're going to add.

222
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:43,200
So we set the width to be full your 100%.

223
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:51,360
And then you can use justify center to bring them to the center in the mobile size.

224
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,180
I want them to be in the center like this.

225
00:19:54,180 --> 00:20:03,750
But in the larger side, like the LG and above, I want them to be at the beginning.

226
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,520
So just say justify.

227
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,710
It starts.

228
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:14,500
So they are going to be at the beginning in the large size, but in the small size, they are going

229
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,960
to be at the middle.

230
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:26,060
And in the large size and above, I want the padding in the left of 52 for them.

231
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:29,790
Let's see.

232
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:31,560
Okay.

233
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:37,380
And then we can just change the color of these texts instead of to be too much black.

234
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,970
I want them to be.

235
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:48,180
Gray, for example, 700.

236
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:53,950
We make the text to be as small.

237
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,080
But that.

238
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:06,770
I think that's enough for this styling of this section.

239
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:11,800
This is if you remove the zoom level, that is okay.

240
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:20,080
As you can see, we are changing the page image, search page, and also we go to web search page.

241
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:22,310
So this is working fine.

242
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:25,430
And also the styling looks okay.

243
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,330
That was it for this section.

244
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:36,320
Let's go and add this one to GitHub using contour shift G, we add everything here.

245
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:41,810
Let's make a message for that one saying complete.

246
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,440
The surge.

247
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,710
Heather.

248
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:54,090
Options.

249
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,710
And we're going to commit and push it to GitHub.

250
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,060
Let's review what we have done.

251
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:09,540
We just click here to go back and now we have 11 commits in our GitHub repository.

252
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:14,040
The last one is complete the search filter options.

253
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,430
And then as you can see, we have created this page.

254
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:25,170
We have updated this search header components option.

255
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:35,070
We have created that one to be used a client side because we are using some hooks and there's some piece

256
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:37,170
of we don't have.

257
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:44,340
We have some folks here like use path name, we use router or use search params.

258
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,410
And also we have some event listener like on click.

259
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:52,280
All right.

260
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:57,240
So we have imported two icons from React Icons.

261
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,100
I.

262
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:05,340
Uh, first thing first, we have imported these hooks from next navigation, and then we have initialized

263
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,030
them.

264
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:12,900
We got the search term from the URL using search params dot git.

265
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:15,100
We've got the search term.

266
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:21,940
We have created a function which is going to redirect the person based on the tab, the clicking on

267
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,490
the tab, which is which can be.

268
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:32,880
Forward slash search, forward, slash whip or image based on the day click they do.

269
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,590
And also we have the search term, which is going to be at the end of the URL.

270
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:50,340
We have created two div, including two icons and to text all and images each of them they have on click

271
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:56,670
event listener, which is going to call a function called set tab, but with different

272
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,290
parameter here.

273
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:12,810
We pass the props like this and then we have a dynamic styling which is going to be different when we

274
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:13,530
have a.

275
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,280
Path name forward slash web.

276
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:23,790
Make this icon and the border bottom to be blue.

277
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:32,610
Otherwise, we do the other one which has the image and also the other one has the event listener,

278
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:38,910
which when we click, they're going to select the tab with the images here.

279
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,470
All right.

280
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:48,870
That was it for creating and updating the search header options in the next section, we're going to

281
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:58,290
actually work and get the Google API credentials and then we're going to fetch data from the Google

282
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,220
API.

283
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:04,790
And show the titles inside the our website.

284
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:08,180
So see you in the next section for this part of our project.
